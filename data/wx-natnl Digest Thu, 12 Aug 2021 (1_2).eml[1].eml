Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1051 AM CDT Wed Aug 11 2021

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

Only minor adjustments to the Elevated risk area are made based on
recent trends in observed RH and hi-res guidance. Relative humidity
values across southern MT are already falling into the upper 30s,
which is in line with more aggressive solutions and supports the
idea of persistent elevated conditions this afternoon.

To the east, strengthening gradient winds may coincide with diurnal
RH reductions to near 30% across the northwest quadrant of MN. These
conditions are expected to be fairly localized and relatively
transient, but may pose a low-end fire weather concern given curing
fine fuels. The dry thunderstorm potential over the Sierra remains
on track as outlined in the previous discussion below.

..Moore.. 08/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CDT Wed Aug 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
Across much of the US, the mid-level flow pattern will remain quite
weak as broad cyclonic flow prevails across the northern CONUS. A
cold front over the Midwest will stall as high pressure builds to
the south. To the west, a transient mid-level low off the coast of
California will draw monsoonal moisture northward supporting
thunderstorms across the higher terrain.

...Northern Plains...
In a dry post frontal flow regime, breezy northwesterly winds of
15-25 mph are expected across much of Montana and the Dakotas
through Wednesday afternoon. Downslope trajectories will aid in
adiabatic warming supporting warm temperatures in the 80s and 90s F
despite the passage of the cold front. Surface humidity values will
be borderline for elevated highlights as additional surface moisture
behind the front is advected into the area. Diurnal minimum RH
values of 25-30% are expected. The combination of gusty winds dry
fuels and near criteria RH should support elevated fire weather
conditions.

...Sierra Dry thunder...
As the weak upper low meanders above the West Coast, monsoonal
moisture will be drawn northward across Nevada and southern
California. Isolated thunderstorms are forecast to develop across
the higher terrain by early afternoon. Steep low-level lapse rates
and dry surface conditions will increase potential for a few dry
lightning strikes. Given current fuel receptiveness, isolated dry
thunder probabilities will be maintained.

FOR THURSDAY AUGUST 19 - WEDNESDAY AUGUST 25: Tropical Storm Fred developed
early on Aug 11, just to the southeast of the Dominican Republic, and is
forecast to track northwest towards the southeastern United States during t=
he
next three days. The future strength and track of Fred remain uncertain due=
 to
its likely interaction with land such as Hispaniola and potentially Cuba, a=
nd
also increasing wind shear later this week. By the beginning of week-2 (Aug
19), rainfall effects over the eastern U.S. associated with Fred are expect=
ed
to begin diminishing but heavy rain may linger with its remnant low. Based =
on
the latest model consensus, the most likely area for this heavy rainfall
extends across the Central/Southern Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic. Please
refer
to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for the latest updates and forecasts=
 on
Tropical Storm Fred.



The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is providing a favorable large-scale
environment for additional tropical cyclone (TC) development across the
Atlantic basin. A tropical wave is currently over the Main Development Regi=
on
of the tropical Atlantic and as of 2pm on Aug 11, NHC states that this syst=
em
has a 50 percent chance of becoming a TC within the next five days. Regardl=
ess
of development, this tropical wave could bring heavy rain and flooding to t=
he
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend. During week-2, this
potential
TC could track towards the Southeast or Gulf Coast but it is too early to k=
now
what impacts, if any, it would have on any specific area.



Downstream of a persistent, 500-hPa trough axis, multiple shortwave troughs
are
forecast to cross the north-central CONUS during week-2. Thunderstorms with
locally heavy rain (near an inch or more per 24 hours) are expected to
accompany these individual shortwave troughs. A slight risk of heavy rain i=
s
posted from the Northern and Central Great Plains eastward to the Upper
Mississippi Valley where the low-level jet will be maximized with elevated
moisture. Due to uncertainty on timing, the slight risk continues through d=
ay
12, Aug 23. Many of these areas have seen intensifying drought conditions
recently and the rainfall would be beneficial. However, heavy rainfall in a
short period of time may trigger flash flooding.



Although anomalous ridging at the higher latitudes of eastern North America
favors above normal temperatures across the Corn Belt, Great Lakes, and
Northeast during week-2, excessive heat criteria is not expected to be
reached.
This is partly due to heat waves becoming less likely by late August across
the
higher latitudes of the CONUS. The GEFS would support a slight risk of
excessive heat across the more hot, humid areas such as the Middle Mississi=
ppi
Valley, but ECMWF temperature tools indicate a cooler solution for this
region.



A zonal mid-level flow pattern is forecast across Alaska during much of
week-2.
As a result, intermittent surface low pressure systems are predicted to mov=
e
across the state, favoring above normal precipitation across most of Mainla=
nd
Alaska. This relatively wet pattern is expected to limit the wildfire risk.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 PM CDT Wed Aug 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

Recent ensemble guidance continues to support reasonable confidence
in the dry thunderstorm potential across northern CA and southern
OR. Although confidence in the coverage of storms decreases with
southern extent into the Sierra range, weak QPF signals and
supportive thermodynamic profiles maintain a low-end lightning risk
within the higher terrain. Across the northern Plains, sustained
winds between 15 to 20 mph appear likely, but cooler temperatures
will mitigate strong RH reductions and overall fire weather threat.

..Moore.. 08/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CDT Wed Aug 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
Little change in the mid-level flow pattern is expected across the
US Day2/Thursday, as a broad trough across the northern CONUS
continues slowly east. Flow across the rest of the country will be
minimal as weak high pressure builds across the Southwest where
monsoonal moisture will continue to move north. Fire weather
concerns are low outside of the risk for isolated dry thunderstorms
across California and portions of the Northwest.

...Sierra and Northwest dry thunder...
As the surge of monsoon moisture associated with the weak upper low
off the pacific coast continues northward, widely scattered
thunderstorms are forecast to develop across the Sierra and higher
terrain of southern Oregon. Regional model soundings show PWAT
values between 0.6 and 0.9 suggesting low precipitation efficiency.
With sufficient buoyancy for charge separation, isolated lightning
strikes appear probable. Given widespread receptive fuels in place,
isolated dry thunderstorms are expected.

...Major West/Northwest Heat Wave challenging daily temperature
records into the weekend then moderates...

...Tropical Storm Fred Heavy Rain Threat from Florida this weekend
to the Southeast/Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic early-mid next week...


...Pattern Overview...

Models and ensembles still show a strong upper level ridge
lingering over the Western U.S. on Saturday, with amplified
troughing moving into the Northwest Sunday/Monday and beyond into
the West which should suppress the ongoing heat wave. Meanwhile,
an upper level trough will move through from the Great Lakes to
the Northeast Saturday-Monday, with heights beginning to rise
again across much of the East by later in the medium range period.
Tropical Storm Fred will likely affect Florida this weekend
bringing heavy rainfall, and then also into parts of the
Southeast, southern to central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic
early-mid next week as tropical moisture feeds inland and
interacts with a stalled leading frontal zone draped to the north
of Fred and terrain.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The NHC tracks Tropical Storm Fred to the Florida Keys by Saturday
and then over the far eastern Gulf of Mexico this weekend before
lifting inland into the Southeast and up the Appalachians early
next week as a gradually weakening but very wet system both
along/east of the track and in advance with deep moisture feed
into a draped front. Fred offers a maritime and inland heavy
rainfall/runoff threat. Please refer NHC guidance regarding the
details and official forecast track.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of best clustered guidance from the NHC, WPC continuity, the
00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC National Blend of
Models. Nudged blend weights to the ECMWF ensemble mean days 5-7
consistent with slowly growing forecast spread with Fred and also
the extent of upper troughing to work into the Northwest/West next
week. GEFS and ECMWF ensembles best support upper trough emergence
over the Northwest next week in between the deeper GFS and less
amplified ECMWF.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave that will focus across the Northwest will continue
into Saturday with max/min temperatures of 10-15+ above normal
likely to reach or exceed daily records both for high temperatures
and warm overnight lows. Sunday temperatures should still be above
normal, but not nearly as extreme as previous days. By Monday,
troughing looks to quickly move into the region so temperatures
should actually rebound below normal across the Northwest. Some
portions of the Northern Rockies could be 10 degrees below normal
next Tuesday into Wednesday. Above to much above normal
temperatures will shift eastward Sunday and Monday into parts of
the Northern Plains as well.

Tropical Storm Fred should be impacting much of the Florida
peninsula by the start of the period on Saturday. Heavy rainfall
and gusty winds are likely through the weekend as Fred tracks into
the Keys and far eastern Gulf of Mexico. Tropical moisture will
also spread into the Southeast, Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic
early-mid next week, and well ahead of Fred. This moisture may
interact with a leading stalled frontal boundary and favorable
Appalachian terrain offering the potential for a pre event.

Elsewhere, as the western upper ridge axis shifts east with advent
of upper troughing over the Northwest, monsoon activity over the
Desert Southwest should increase and spread northward, again
bringing a localized flash flood risk. A cold front should reach
the East Coast and Southeast this weekend focusing periods of
showers and thunderstorms with areas of locally moderate to heavy
rain likely. Exact amounts and locations remain somewhat uncertain
at this time and may take until the short range period to resolve.
Daily scattered storm chances will also exist back into the lower
Mississippi Valley and Southern Plains within a warm and moist
environment. In addition, combined heat and humidity should
support heat index values into at least the low 100s for many
across the lower Mississippi Valley and areas along the central
and western Gulf this coming weekend.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed August 11 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 17 - 21 2021

Model solutions are in very good agreement with respect to the 500-hPa
circulation pattern over North America during the 6-10 day period. A strong
mid-level ridge, predicted over the Northeast Pacific, leads to positive
500-hPa height anomalies across the eastern Aleutians, parts of southern
Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle. A trough is predicted further west over t=
he
western Aleutians. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the
northern Alaska Mainland. The strong mid-level ridge over the Northeast
Pacific
leads to positive 500-hPa height anomalies along the Pacific coast of the
CONUS. A trough is predicted over the interior West, along with near to bel=
ow
average 500-hPa heights. A strong ridge is predicted over eastern Canada al=
ong
with positive mid-level height anomalies across parts of the Northern Plain=
s
and much of the Great Lakes and Northeast. Negative mid-level height anomal=
ies
across much of the Southern Tier from the interior West to parts of the
Southeast are associated with a mean frontal boundary and increased convect=
ive
activity. The GEFS, ECMWF and Canadian ensemble mean solutions and
high-resolution operational runs are in agreement on stronger mean ridging
over
southeastern Canada relative to yesterdays model solutions.

Below-normal temperatures are favored across much of Mainland Alaska, ahead=
 of
a mid-level trough over the Bering Strait and under near to below average
500-hPa heights. Above-normal temperatures are favored over parts of Northe=
rn
California, along the eastern periphery of the Northeast Pacific mid-level
ridge. Below-normal temperatures are favored for the Northwest, under the
predicted mid-level trough. Increased moisture advection and cloud cover
enhance odds for below-normal temperatures across the Southwest. Strong
positive 500-hPa height anomalies enhance odds for above-normal temperature=
s
from parts of the Northern Plains across the Great Lakes and extending into
the
Northeast, with the highest probability over 80% over Maine. There is
uncertainty between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble reforecasts for the Southea=
st
region, due to convective activity along a mean frontal boundary and the
potential for tropical activity during the 6-10 day period. Near-normal
temperatures are favored across parts of the Southern Plains and Southeast
region, along with increased above-normal temperature probabilities south o=
f
the mean front in the Florida Peninsula and western Gulf Coast.

Above-normal precipitation is favored for most of Mainland Alaska, ahead of=
 a
mean mid-level trough over the Bering Sea. Below-normal precipitation is
likely
for the Aleutians and southwestern Mainland Alaska, and near-normal
precipitation is favored for the Alaska Panhandle, under increased influenc=
e
from the Northeast Pacific ridge. Below normal precipitation is likely for
parts of the Pacific Northwest ahead of the predicted ridge. A predicted
trough
over the interior West increases probabilities of above-normal precipitatio=
n
from the Intermountain West region to most of the Great Plains. Increased o=
dds
of above-normal precipitation are also favored across the Southwest due to =
an
active Southwest Monsoon circulation. Strong positive mid-level height
anomalies over eastern Canada favor below-normal precipitation across the
Great
Lakes region and Northeast. Over the Southeast and parts of the Central
Mississippi Valley, frontal boundary activity increases odds for above-norm=
al
precipitation. A tropical system is predicted to move across the eastern Gu=
lf
Coast at the start of the 6-10 day period, leading to enhanced probabilitie=
s
of
above-normal precipitation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today=

0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
very good model agreement on the predicted mean 500-hPa height pattern over
the
CONUS, offset by differences among model temperature and precipitation
forecasts, and uncertainty associated with the potential for tropical activ=
ity
in the Southeast.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 19 - 25 2021

Models continue to be in good agreement on the predicted circulation patter=
n
over North America during the week 2 period, with some de-amplification of
large-scale anomalies relative to the 6-10 day period. The trough over the
Bering Sea and western Aleutians de-amplifies significantly during the week=
 2
period, while positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the
Aleutians and central and southern Alaska, under increased influence of the
Northeast Pacific ridge. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted ov=
er
northern Mainland Alaska. Predicted mid-level troughing becomes more amplif=
ied
over California in the week 2 forecast. Similar to the 6-10 day period, a
strong mean mid-level ridge over southeastern Canada leads to positive 500-=
hPa
height anomalies extending across the Midwest and Northeast. Near-normal
mid-level heights over the Southern Plains and Southeast are associated wit=
h
increased convective activity along a mean frontal boundary.

Increased onshore flow favors below-normal temperatures across much of
Mainland
Alaska. The predicted trough over the West leads to likely near to below-
normal
temperatures across most of the West. Enhanced probabilities for below-norm=
al
temperatures in the Southwest are supported by increased soil moisture due =
to
the active southwest monsoon prior to the period. Enhanced probabilities of
above-normal temperatures are favored from the Great Plains eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, under positive mid-level height anomalies.
Near-normal temperatures are predicted over parts of the Southeast, with
convective activity along a mean frontal boundary, with increased above-nor=
mal
temperature probabilities south of the mean front in Florida.

Increased onshore flow over central and northern Mainland Alaska increases =
the
chances of above-normal precipitation. Below-normal precipitation is predic=
ted
for southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, under the increased
influence of the Northeast Pacific ridge. Increased troughing over Californ=
ia
reduces monsoon precipitation leading to a forecast of  below-normal
precipitation. Mid-level troughing over the western CONUS increases souther=
ly
flow to the east, increasing chances of above-normal precipitation over par=
ts
of the Central and Northern Plains. A mean frontal boundary and potential
tropical activity lead to enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitat=
ion
across much of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. Below-normal precipitation i=
s
more likely over the eastern Great Lakes and the Northeast under positive
mid-level height anomalies.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=
0%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement in the circulation pattern over the forecast domain, offset by
increased uncertainty in the phase and amplitude of large-scale anomalies, =
and
some differences among the model temperature and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Heat intensifies across the Pacific Northwest while oppressive
heat persists across the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and the
Mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Daily rounds of strong-to-severe storms across the Great Lakes
and northern Mid-Atlantic as Tropical Storm Fred is forecast to
approach southern Florida late Friday...

...Poor air quality due to wildfire smoke continues in the western
and central U.S., monsoon showers and storms to drench parts of
the Southwest...

"The Heat Is On" for much of the U.S. mainland as a couple of
strong upper-level ridges remain in firm control from coast to
coast.  Heat Advisories and some Excessive Heat Warnings remain in
effect across much of the nation's mid-section and into parts of
the the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.  Some parts of the I-95
corridor could reach 100 degrees Thursday afternoon with
oppressive heat indices ranging between 105-110 degrees. Across
the Pacific Northwest, daytime highs are forecast to soar above
the century mark with high temperature departures anywhere from 15
to 25 degrees above normal. Temperatures on Thursday will even
challenge some daily record highs in the Northeast and the Pacific
Northwest. Speaking of records, numerous record warm lows are
expected to be broken along the West Coast and east of the
Mississippi River both Thursday and Friday mornings. Looking
further ahead, this heat wave looks to stick around into Friday
before gradually loosening its grip over these regions this
weekend.

The Great Lakes are most at risk for severe storms later today as
hot and humid conditions ahead of an approaching cold front sets
the stage for another round of scattered thunderstorms.  Damaging
winds, large hail, and tornadoes could accompany any severe
thunderstorms. Meanwhile, scattered thunderstorms can be expected
from the Midwest to the interior sections of the East Coast
including the Northeast, as well as along the Gulf Coast and into
Florida for the next couple of days.  Most shower and thunderstorm
activity will develop in the afternoon and linger into the evening
hours each day.  Some of these thunderstorms may contain heavy
downpours that could result in localized flash flooding.

Elsewhere, wildfire smoke continues to plague parts of the West
Coast, the Intermountain West, and High Plains with poor air
quality through Wednesday.  Also, monsoon showers and
thunderstorms will be a daily occurrence in the Desert Southwest,
helping to keep the heat at bay.  That said, some areas of flash
flooding are possible as well.  Farther north, temperatures in the
northern Plains will remain below normal with multiple passages of
dry cold fronts over the next couple days. Lastly, eyes are
turning to the tropics as Tropical Storm Fred is forecast to
approach southern Florida from Cuba later on Friday.  Some squalls
associated with the outer rainbands of Fred could begin to impact
southern Florida on Friday as heavy downpours become more frequent
and winds become increasingly gusty later on Friday.  Please visit
the National Hurricane Center homepage for the latest forecast
information on Tropical Storm Fred.

...Major West/Northwest Heat Wave challenging daily temperature
records into the weekend then moderates...

...Tropical Storm Fred Heavy Rain Threat from Florida this weekend
to the Southeast/Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic early-mid next week...


...Pattern Overview...

Models and ensembles still show a strong upper level ridge
lingering over the Western U.S. on Saturday, with amplified
troughing moving into the Northwest Sunday/Monday and beyond into
the West which should suppress the ongoing heat wave. Meanwhile,
an upper level trough will move through from the Great Lakes to
the Northeast Saturday-Monday, with heights beginning to rise
again across much of the East by later in the medium range period.
Tropical Storm Fred will likely affect Florida this weekend
bringing heavy rainfall, and then also into parts of the
Southeast, southern to central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic
early-mid next week as tropical moisture feeds inland and
interacts with a stalled leading frontal zone draped to the north
of Fred and terrain.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The NHC tracks Tropical Storm Fred to the Florida Keys by Saturday
and then over the far eastern Gulf of Mexico this weekend before
lifting inland into the Southeast and up the Appalachians early
next week as a gradually weakening but very wet system both
along/east of the track and in advance with deep moisture feed
into a draped front. Fred offers a maritime and inland heavy
rainfall/runoff threat. Please refer NHC guidance regarding the
details and official forecast track.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of best clustered guidance from the NHC, WPC continuity, the
00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC National Blend of
Models. Nudged blend weights to the ECMWF ensemble mean days 5-7
consistent with slowly growing forecast spread with Fred and also
the extent of upper troughing to work into the Northwest/West next
week. GEFS and ECMWF ensembles best support upper trough emergence
over the Northwest next week in between the deeper GFS and less
amplified ECMWF.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave that will focus across the Northwest will continue
into Saturday with max/min temperatures of 10-15+ above normal
likely to reach or exceed daily records both for high temperatures
and warm overnight lows. Sunday temperatures should still be above
normal, but not nearly as extreme as previous days. By Monday,
troughing looks to quickly move into the region so temperatures
should actually rebound below normal across the Northwest. Some
portions of the Northern Rockies could be 10 degrees below normal
next Tuesday into Wednesday. Above to much above normal
temperatures will shift eastward Sunday and Monday into parts of
the Northern Plains as well.

Tropical Storm Fred should be impacting much of the Florida
peninsula by the start of the period on Saturday. Heavy rainfall
and gusty winds are likely through the weekend as Fred tracks into
the Keys and far eastern Gulf of Mexico. Tropical moisture will
also spread into the Southeast, Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic
early-mid next week, and well ahead of Fred. This moisture may
interact with a leading stalled frontal boundary and favorable
Appalachian terrain offering the potential for a pre event.

Elsewhere, as the western upper ridge axis shifts east with advent
of upper troughing over the Northwest, monsoon activity over the
Desert Southwest should increase and spread northward, again
bringing a localized flash flood risk. A cold front should reach
the East Coast and Southeast this weekend focusing periods of
showers and thunderstorms with areas of locally moderate to heavy
rain likely. Exact amounts and locations remain somewhat uncertain
at this time and may take until the short range period to resolve.
Daily scattered storm chances will also exist back into the lower
Mississippi Valley and Southern Plains within a warm and moist
environment. In addition, combined heat and humidity should
support heat index values into at least the low 100s for many
across the lower Mississippi Valley and areas along the central
and western Gulf this coming weekend.

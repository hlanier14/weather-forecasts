30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR SEPTEMBER 2021

The September 2021 outlooks are issued against the backdrop of El Ni=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDo
Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) Neutral conditions and an ongoing strong Madden-Julian
Oscillation (MJO) event. The most recent three month observations of the Ni=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo
3.4 index (corresponding to the May-June-July season) indicated mean sea
surface temperature (SST) anomalies of -0.4C.  This represents a weakening
relative to the La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa event experienced during the past =
winter when the
average index value during the December-January-February season was near
-1.0C.
Equatorial SSTs are generally expected to remain near to below average with=
 a
re-emergence of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions possible within the nex=
t three months and
a
La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa Watch is currently in effect. Additionally, an ong=
oing strong MJO
event
is currently propagating eastward over the Indian Ocean with the amplitude =
of
the Wheeler-Hendon index exceeding 2.5. The current evolution of these ENSO
and
MJO signals would tend to favor below normal 500-hPa heights across much of
the
eastern Contiguous United States (CONUS) and south of Alaska. Signals from =
the
MJO and ENSO conflict across western North America as MJO composites favor
much
higher 500-hPa heights relative to that produced by ENSO composites. It sho=
uld
be noted that the sample size of these composites are relatively small, thu=
s,
reducing the reliability of the signal. Analysis of the most recent monthly
and
subseasonal dynamical model guidance, recent trends, as well as contributio=
ns
from current environmental conditions were also utilized in the production =
of
these outlooks.



Above normal temperatures are favored for much of the western CONUS and
Northern Plains due to good agreement among dynamical model guidance and MJ=
O
composites. Enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures are largely
absent farther to the south and east across the remainder of the Plains, mo=
st
of the Mississippi Valley, and the Southeast, consistent with potential
troughing over the eastern CONUS suggested by MJO and ENSO composites. Belo=
w
normal temperatures are favored for the western and central Gulf Coast Regi=
on,
the Lower Mississippi Valley, and eastern sections of the Southern Plains,
supported by dynamical model guidance from the CFSv2 and Copernicus Climate
Change Service (C3S). Agreement is generally good among dynamical model
guidance for warmer than normal conditions across the Great Lakes and
Northeast. Thus, above normal temperatures are favored for these regions.
However, probabilities are tempered due to potential troughing across the
eastern CONUS suggested by MJO and ENSO composites. Uncertainty is high acr=
oss
most of Alaska due to weak or conflicting signals among dynamical model
guidance. Therefore Equal Chances (EC) of above, near, or below normal
temperatures are indicated for most of the state. However, above normal
temperatures are weakly favored for parts of coastal southwestern Alaska du=
e,
in part, to above normal SSTs in adjacent waters.



The potential for troughing may promote an active pattern across much of th=
e
central and eastern CONUS. This is supported by MJO and ENSO composites whi=
ch
favor above normal precipitation from parts of the Gulf Coast northeastward=
 to
the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic states and the CFSv2, which depicts a wet
pattern across most of the southern two-thirds of the CONUS. However,
probabilities are tempered due to lack of support from the NMME and C3S
dynamical model tools. Conversely, below normal precipitation is favored
across
much of the West as dynamical model guidance generally supports a dry patte=
rn,
particularly from the Great Basin to the Northern Rockies and Northern High
Plains. A wet pattern is favored farther to the north across southeastern
Alaska due to good dynamical model support and agreement with MJO composite=
s.
ENSO composites, as well as dynamical model guidance from the NMME and CFSv=
2
favor a dry pattern for parts of western Alaska, where elevated chances of
below normal precipitation are indicated.

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Aug 19 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

ENSO-neutral conditions are present in the equatorial Pacific and ENSO-neut=
ral
is favored for the remainder of summer. La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa could emer=
ge during the
August-October season and last through the 2021-22 winter. The odds for La
Nina
to develop earlier in the autumn of 2021 have increased this month, and the
outlooks reflect that change.



The temperature outlook for September-October-November (SON) 2021 argely
favors
above normal temperatures, with the exception of Southern Mainland Alaska a=
nd
the Alaska Panhandle, portions of the Northwest to the Northern Plains, and
portions of the Lower-Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coasts.



The precipitation outlook is highly uncertain, so probabilities are modest =
and
coverage is low for the SON outlook. There are no strong changes to
climatological odds east of the Mississippi, and below normal precipitation=
 is
generally favored from the Southwest to the Great Plains. Above normal
precipitation is weakly indicated from the Alaska Panhandle to the Pacific
Northwest. Conversely,  below normal precipitation is slightly favored for
parts of the South Coast of Mainland Alaska.



Equal chances (EC) are indicated for areas where probabilities for each
category of seasonal mean temperatures and seasonal accumulated precipitati=
on
are expected to be similar to climatological probabilities.



BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS
Note:  For Graphical Displays of the Forecast Tools Discussed Below See:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictio=
ns/90day/tools/briefing__;!!DZ3fjg!uq9IdIBn-5Rc6m2R3mDA-KFkPFd3jzhyNv1X3etE=
Xvb7TeKZdBvgVJn8yR8iVketZ-2q5Gyg$

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

The coupled oceanic and atmospheric observations reflect ENSO-neutral
conditions. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are near climatological average=
s
across most of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, though for most of July, Nino3=
,
Nino3.4, and Nino4 were slightly negative. At depth, temperatures were larg=
ely
below normal for the month of July and into August, a change from June and
into
early July when temperatures at depth were above normal. Over the central
Pacific, low-level winds have been stronger than average, while upper-level
winds are less coherent. OLR shows reduced convection west of the Date Line=
,
and almost no signal for the equatorial central and eastern Pacific.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

Most dynamical and many statistical tools are indicating a transition to La
Nina in the autumn, with higher odds into winter 2021-2022. The SST-CA
(Constructed Analog based on SSTs) is a bit of an outlier, indicating a war=
mer
solution than most other tools. The CPC Consolidation outputs have SST
anomalies below -0.5 C from SON 2021 to DJF 2021-2022. Dynamical model
ensemble
means from the NMME all predict below normal SSTs in the Nino3.4 region, wi=
th
all models below the -0.5 C threshold by November. Copernicus Climate Chang=
e
Service (C3S) models are slightly warmer but all display negative SST
anomalies
in the ensemble means. C3S and NMME have different climatologies, that diff=
er
about the same magnitude of the differences in the mean plots. The official
CPC/IRI ENSO outlook indicates a 62 percent chance of La Nina during SON, w=
ith
peak odds for La Nina at 69 percent in NDJ.



PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Dynamical model forecasts from the NMME and C3S multi-model ensemble system=
s
are used extensively for the first six leads when they are available. A
consolidation of ENSO-OCN, CA, CCA, and NMME was also used for all seasons.
OCN
representing recent trends, was also considered in all seasons. The SST-CA =
was
weighted less due to the outlier forecast for Nino 3.4 values, though it di=
d
serve as a slight hedge in some areas.



PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - SON 2021 TO SON 2022

TEMPERATURE

For the SON outlook, above normal temperatures are favored across most of t=
he
CONUS and Alaska. Trends and an increased influence of La Nina resulted in
competing signals for portions of the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, =
and
Northern Plains, so EC is indicated there. A potential cooler start to the
season resulted in a mixed signal for much of the Gulf Coast and Southeast,=
 so
EC was indicated from eastern Texas to Georgia. Sea ice coverage and extent=
 in
the seas north of Alaska are above/ahead of recent years, but still likely =
to
be below/behind the long-term normal, so odds for above normal temperatures
are
favored, with more certainty, for the north coast of Alaska.



For OND 2021 through MAM 2022, the seasonal outlook represents the enhanced
likelihood of La Nina. Positive decadal temperature trends across most of t=
he
domain are moderated by the impacts of temperature variability due to La Ni=
na.
Areas of EC expand across much of Alaska and the northern tier of the CONUS=
 in
OND 2021 and NDJ 2021-2022, including the Pacific Northwest, Northern and
Central Plains, and western Great Lakes regions. Below normal temperatures =
are
more likely for parts of the Pacific Northwest in DJF through FMA 2022, and
across the northern tier into parts of the  northern Plains in FMA. Below
normal temperatures are also favored for parts of southeastern Mainland Ala=
ska
and the Alaska Panhandle from NDJ 2021-2022 through FMA 2022, due to potent=
ial
La Nina impacts.



For AMJ 2022 and thereafter, the forecast pattern primarily reflects decada=
l
trends with above normal temperatures favored for much of the West and acro=
ss
the southern and eastern CONUS through next spring and summer. Probabilitie=
s
of
above normal temperatures peak in the summer of next year across the West a=
nd
along the Atlantic coast, consistent with the seasonal influence of decadal
climate trends. Decadal trends favor above normal temperatures for
northwestern
areas of Alaska next spring, related to long term changes in sea ice cover
during this season, and across the state by summer of 2022.





PRECIPITATION

Dynamical model forecasts from the NMME support slightly elevated
probabilities
of below normal precipitation for much of the West into the Northern Plains=
,
excluding parts of the Pacific Northwest, in the SON seasonal outlook.
Dynamical model forecasts and some statistical tools favor above normal

precipitation in SON for portions of the Pacific Northwest and the Alaska
Panhandle. Trends would favor below normal in the Alaska Panhandle, so this
portion of the outlook is more reliant on dynamical model output and
relationships to La Nina. Those same tools indicate enhanced odds for below
normal precipitation for portions of southern mainland Alaska.



From this coming winter into next spring the precipitation pattern forecast
increasingly reflects the potential for La Nina development and influence.
Enhanced probabilities of below normal precipitation persist for much of th=
e
Southwest through MAM 2022, while probabilities of above normal precipitati=
on

are enhanced for parts of the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys from JFM through
MJJ
2022.



After spring 2022, and into summer 2022, decadal precipitation trends becom=
e
more influential, favoring above normal precipitation for parts of the
Mid-Atlantic in MJJ through SON 2022. The same trends would favor below nor=
mal
precipitation along the Rockies and over the Southwest in summer 2022. Deca=
dal
trends are the primary signal for above normal precipitation for the North
Slope of Alaska in NDJ 2021 through FMA 2022 and for parts of eastern inter=
ior
Alaska in JJA through SON 2022.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1100 AM CDT Thu Aug 19 2021

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

The previous forecast for Elevated conditions across parts of
northern California remains on track (please see the previous
forecast below for more details). In addition, a few instances of
brief, locally Elevated conditions may be observed ahead of the cold
front across portions of the northern Plains, down to the central
High Plains and into the southern Great Basin this afternoon.

..Squitieri.. 08/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Thu Aug 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
A deep upper low and cold front over the Great Basin are forecast to
move eastward into the Rockies this afternoon, bringing widespread
cloud cover and precipitation. To the west, lingering mid-level flow
along the backside of the upper low will continue across northern
California where dry and breezy surface conditions will support
elevated fire weather potential.

...Northern California...
Warm and dry surface conditions are expected to remain in place
across the northern Sacramento Valley today in the wake of a dry
cold front. As the upper low slowly moves east out of the Great
Basin, surface winds should gradually weaken as northerly mid-level
flow along the backside of the trough wanes. Despite the decreasing
upper-level support, a few hours of sustained surface winds near 15
mph are possible. With warm temperatures, surface RH of 15-20% and
very dry fuels in place, a few hours of elevated fire weather
conditions may occur.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 19 2021

SYNOPSIS: A generally low amplitude 500-hPa height pattern is forecast acro=
ss
the contiguous U.S. during week-2. Increased amplification is predicted
upstream over the North Pacific with mid-level high pressure favored across
the
Bering Sea and mid-level low pressure forecast across the Gulf of Alaska.
Lingering excessive heat remains possible early in the period across portio=
ns
of California and the Desert Southwest before this area of mid-level low
pressure moves closer to the West Coast. The remainder of the U.S. looks qu=
iet
in terms of hazards, with the only concern being increased chances for heav=
y
rain along parts of the Gulf of Mexico Coast, related to the potential for
increased tropical moisture flow depicted in some of the dynamical model
guidance.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of the Central Valley of Califor=
nia
and Desert Southwest, Fri-Sat, Aug 27-28.

Slight risk of heavy rain across parts of the western and central Gulf of
Mexico Coast, Sat-Thu, Aug 28-Sep 2.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY AUGUST 22 - THURSDAY AUGUST 26:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!vNPVJrbP6l1-KfqIKkVkdNNYt1nuAn61yOM4VfNYq714UQyKr9RGlXUj3Xnmn=
EdrYgBTcow7$

FOR FRIDAY AUGUST 27 - THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 02: The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canad=
ian
ensembles all indicate near normal 500-hPa heights across most of the CONUS
during week-2 associated with a low amplitude mid-level flow pattern. The
ECMWF
ensemble is significantly less amplified with the ridge over the western CO=
NUS
compared to yesterday and has trended closer to the GEFS and Canadian ensem=
ble
solutions, which depict a broader and weaker ridge centered more south acro=
ss
the western and central CONUS. However, even with the weaker ridging, the G=
EFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools both indicate elevated potential for anomalously
warm temperatures across portions of the Southwest CONUS early in week-2. A
slight risk of excessive heat is maintained for parts of the Central Valley=
 of
California and Desert Southwest, Aug 27 to 28, where the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th climatological percentile. Uncalibrated guidance from th=
e
ECMWF and GEFS ensembles indicate maximum temperatures exceeding 100 deg F
over
the Central Valley of California and 110 deg F across parts of the Sonoran
Desert on Aug 27, with maximum temperatures trending downward with time and
eventually falling below hazards thresholds by the middle of the period.
Across
the Pacific Northwest and Northern Great Basin, probabilities for maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th climatological percentile are now less than
20%
in the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools as a result of the less amplified
ridging, and the associated excessive heat hazard over that region is
discontinued in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook.



The 0z ECMWF ensemble depicts enhanced mid-level troughing over the eastern
CONUS during week-2, which favors increased frontal activity along the
Atlantic
and Gulf of Mexico Coasts. The 0z GEFS indicates a broader ridge expanding
over
the eastern CONUS and limits the amount of frontal activity. However, the G=
EFS
depicts increased moisture flow out of the Gulf of Mexico, enhancing rainfa=
ll
across coastal portions of southeastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi
Valley.
The 0z Canadian ensemble favors aspects of both the GEFS and ECMWF solution=
s,
with troughing in the east (although weaker compared to the ECMWF) and the
increased Gulf moisture depicted in the GEFS. Although there is considerabl=
e
uncertainty regarding the mechanism for heavy precipitation, both the ECMWF
and
GEFS reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall tota=
ls
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch during the middle of week-2 over
coastal areas of southeastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley.
Additionally, uncalibrated guidance from the GEFS and Canadian ensembles sh=
ow
ensemble mean daily rainfall totals in excess of a half inch starting on da=
y-9
(Aug 28), with deterministic solutions favoring higher totals, especially i=
f
an
organized tropical cyclone reaches the coast. Due to this elevated potentia=
l,
a
slight risk of heavy rain is highlighted across parts of the western and
central Gulf Coast starting on Aug 28, and continues through the end of
week-2.
The increased moisture favors elevated heat indices over the region, but
widespread coverage of heat indices exceeding 110 deg F appears unlikely, a=
nd
the increased cloud cover and rainfall predicted over the region is likely =
to
result in lower temperatures, precluding a related excessive heat hazard ov=
er
the region.



The ridge placement further south across the Four Corners region during wee=
k-2
favors a suppressed North American monsoon circulation. Recent runs of the
deterministic GFS show the potential for a tropical cyclone forming in the
East
Pacific and tracking northward toward the Gulf of California, which could
trigger a gulf surge and bring increased moisture into the southwestern CON=
US.
However the deterministic 0Z ECMWF continues to favor a weaker tropical
disturbance tracking further south and west, which would be less favorable =
for
enhanced moisture flow into the southwestern CONUS. Both of the reforecast
tools do not show a favorable wet signal for the Four Corners, thus no rela=
ted
precipitation or flooding hazards are highlighted. However, any thunderstor=
ms
that do develop may lead to localized flash flooding.



Weak mid-level troughing forecast over the Gulf of Alaska favors elevated
chances of heavy precipitation across portions of southeastern Mainland Ala=
ska
and the Panhandle. However, precipitation amounts are forecast to remain be=
low
pre-defined hazards criteria, precluding a related hazard. Near to below
normal
temperatures are predicted over most of the state during week-2 as a result=
 of
the increased northerly flow, although increased influence from the ridge
upstream over the Bering Sea favors above normal temperatures over the
Aleutians and the southwestern Mainland.

...Dangerous Henri to intensify to Hurricane status and threaten
New England by Sunday...


...Overall Pattern and Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Henri is forecast to gain strength over the western Atlantic and
threaten New England Sunday into early next week, bringing a
substantial threat for high winds/waves and heavy rainfall.
Guidance has overall come in better agreement with Henri, but the
overall blocky flow around the system and less predictable smaller
scale interactions still offer a tricky forecast. The National
Hurricane Center indicated during our 17 UTC collaboration that
Hurricane Hunter recon aircraft now investigating Henri may shed
additional light for subsequent guidance runs. Please refer to the
latest information from the NHC on Henri.

Otherwise, an active upper level pattern will be in place across
the northern tier states and southern Canada with several well
developed shortwaves moving through with development and slow
translation of well defined and wavy fronts to pool moisture and
instability. This offers broad potential for scattered to perhaps
numerous showers and storms, some of which could be strong or
severe where convective complexes develop as per SPC. Meanwhile, a
building upper level ridge underneath will continue to build
across the southern tier states and the northern Gulf of Mexico
leading to hot and humid conditions for much of the
south-central/southern states. The upper high/ridge is expected to
slowly retrograde westward next week and allow for a mainly dry
and increasingly hot West.

...Model analysis and preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite is primarily derived from the
NHC forecast for Henri and elsewhere a composite of reasonably
well clustered model and ensemble guidance along with the National
Blend of Models days 3-5 (Sun-Tue). In this preferred blend
outside of Henri, leaned strongly on the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET
days 3-5 (Sun-Tue) and then the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means into
days 6/7 amid growing forecast spread. In particular, recent GFS
runs have been more progressive/amplified bringing east Pacific
upper trough energies into the Northwest later next week and that
does not seem well supported by the pattern nor GEFS/ECMWF
ensembles. The resultant WPC forecast suite maintains good product
continuity.

300 PM EDT Thu August 19 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 25 - 29 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over
Mainland
Alaska. A ridge is predicted over the northeastern Pacific in most model
solutions, with associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies over parts of =
the
western CONUS in the ECMWF ensemble mean. Slightly positive 500-hPa height
anomalies extend across most of the CONUS. A weak trough is predicted over =
the
northeastern CONUS in the recent ECMWF and Canadian ensemble means, with
associated near to slightly below normal heights, while the latest GEFS
ensemble mean predicts positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the Northeast
region and greater troughing and negative 500-hPa height anomalies over the
northwestern CONUS. A subtropical ridge is predicted over most of the south=
ern
tier of the CONUS from the Southwest to the Lower Mississippi Valley in the
ECMWF and Canadian ensemble mean 500-hPa height forecasts, along with a bre=
ak
in the subtropical ridge over the Southeast.

Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated across northwestern
Mainland Alaska, due to the predicted trough. Above normal temperatures are
likely for the western Aleutians under predicted positive 500-hPa height
anomalies. Above normal temperatures are favored across much of the western
CONUS, Central and Southern Rockies, and the Central and Southern Plains, d=
ue
to predicted 500-hPa ridging and near to above normal heights forecast over
most areas in the manual blend. Anomalous northerly flow over the Northern
Rockies and Northern Plains favors enhanced probabilities of near to below
normal temperatures there. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are
enhanced for the eastern CONUS, supported by the temperature consolidation
tool.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over northern Mainlan=
d
Alaska due to increased potential for storm system development under a
predicted trough. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over
southern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, ahead of a forecast ridge. Belo=
w
normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over most of the western
CONUS,
due to forecasted above normal 500-hPa heights, and consistent with the
precipitation consolidation forecast tool. Troughing over the Midwest and
Northeast in model forecasts, as well as the precipitation consolidation to=
ol,
support increased probabilities of above normal precipitation from the Cent=
ral
Gulf Coast northeastward to parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast and for
parts of the Central and Southern Plains along a predicted active storm tra=
ck.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered=
 on

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
fair agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=
set
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 27 - SEP 02, 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally simi=
lar
to the 6-10 day period but de-amplifies overall with increasing uncertainty=
,
while a trough amplifies over parts of the Gulf of Alaska, western Canada, =
and
parts of the Pacific Northwest. Mid-level height anomalies are weak over mo=
st
of the CONUS in the manual blend of model forecasts, as uncertainty increas=
es.
Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over most of the CONUS an=
d
Alaska, with slightly below normal heights along the Gulf Coast and Southea=
st
Atlantic coast.

Mid-level troughing forecast over Alaska favors below normal temperatures f=
or
northwestern Mainland Alaska. Forecast above normal 500-hPa heights increas=
e
chances for above normal temperatures over parts of southwestern Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians. Near to above normal temperatures are favored acr=
oss
the western CONUS, most of the Great Plains and the Gulf Coast, consistent
with
the consolidation forecast tool. Enhanced probabilities of below normal
temperatures are favored over parts of the Ohio Valley and the Northeast,
associated with the eastward progression of predicted troughing and anomalo=
us
northerly flow, as well as potential increased cloudiness.

Troughing over Mainland Alaska increases the chances of above normal
precipitation over northern Mainland Alaska. Below normal precipitation is
favored for southern Alaska under increasing positive 500-hPa height
anomalies.
Below normal precipitation is likely for much of the northwestern CONUS, th=
e
Central Rockies, Midwest, and eastern areas of the Southwest monsoon region=
,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. A mean frontal boundary an=
d
potential tropical moisture lead to enhanced probabilities of above normal
precipitation across parts of the Central Gulf Coast and Southeast. Near
normal
precipitation is indicated over much of the Great Plains, the Ohio Valley, =
and
the Eastern Seaboard, due to increasing uncertainty and spread among model
forecasts.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centere=
d
on
Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20=
%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Slightly below average, 2 out =
of
5, due to only fair agreement among the models on a transitioning large-sca=
le
circulation pattern, as well as increasing differences among the temperatur=
e
and precipitation forecast tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0243 PM CDT Thu Aug 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Locally dry/breezy conditions and perhaps an isolated thunderstorm
cannot be completely ruled out along the immediate lee of the
southern Cascades/northern Sierra across the Pacific Northwest
tomorrow afternoon. A brief instance or two of locally dry and
breezy conditions may also develop over the central High Plains.
Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track. Please see the
previous outlook below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 08/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Thu Aug 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to move
south-southeastward across western Canada and eventually into the
Pacific Northwest, while another shortwave trough will exit the
Rockies and shift quickly northeastward toward the upper Midwest. At
the surface, low pressure associated with the Rockies trough will
move east with scattered showers and thunderstorm expected across
the Great Plains. To the west, onshore flow ahead of the second
trough will bring a cool and moist airmass inland across California.
With widespread precipitation and poor overlap between dry and windy
surface conditions, fire weather concerns will be low through the
forecast period.

...Dangerous Henri to intensify to Hurricane status and threaten
New England by Sunday...


...Overall Pattern and Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Henri is forecast to gain strength over the western Atlantic and
threaten New England Sunday into early next week, bringing a
substantial threat for high winds/waves and heavy rainfall.
Guidance has overall come in better agreement with Henri, but the
overall blocky flow around the system and less predictable smaller
scale interactions still offer a tricky forecast. The National
Hurricane Center indicated during our 17 UTC collaboration that
Hurricane Hunter recon aircraft now investigating Henri may shed
additional light for subsequent guidance runs. Please refer to the
latest information from the NHC on Henri.

Otherwise, an active upper level pattern will be in place across
the northern tier states and southern Canada with several well
developed shortwaves moving through with development and slow
translation of well defined and wavy fronts to pool moisture and
instability. This offers broad potential for scattered to perhaps
numerous showers and storms, some of which could be strong or
severe where convective complexes develop as per SPC. Meanwhile, a
building upper level ridge underneath will continue to build
across the southern tier states and the northern Gulf of Mexico
leading to hot and humid conditions for much of the
south-central/southern states. The upper high/ridge is expected to
slowly retrograde westward next week and allow for a mainly dry
and increasingly hot West.

...Model analysis and preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite is primarily derived from the
NHC forecast for Henri and elsewhere a composite of reasonably
well clustered model and ensemble guidance along with the National
Blend of Models days 3-5 (Sun-Tue). In this preferred blend
outside of Henri, leaned strongly on the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET
days 3-5 (Sun-Tue) and then the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means into
days 6/7 amid growing forecast spread. In particular, recent GFS
runs have been more progressive/amplified bringing east Pacific
upper trough energies into the Northwest later next week and that
does not seem well supported by the pattern nor GEFS/ECMWF
ensembles. The resultant WPC forecast suite maintains good product
continuity.

...Heavy rain and possible flash flooding lingers today in the
East as Post-Tropical Cyclone Fred moves offshore...

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding are possible as a
potent cold front moves through the North-Central U.S. and the
Intermountain West...

Post-Tropical Cyclone Fred will continue a northeastward march
into New England through tomorrow before exiting offshore by
Saturday. Tropical moisture associated with Fred will produce
showers and thunderstorms along the way in northern New England,
where a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in effect through
tonight. Isolated severe weather is also possible over eastern New
England today (including the Boston Metro) where isolated
tornadoes and severe wind gusts are possible. Additional
thunderstorm activity atop areas that have recently received ample
rain could cause isolated to scattered flash floods from the
Mid-Atlantic and further southwest into the Southern Plains
through the weekend. Eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, and
southern West Virginia could be particularly problematic today
given Fred's recent passage, so there is a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall in place there. More focused rainfall along a
front/trough in the eastern Mid-Atlantic tomorrow could create
scattered flash flooding issues as well. No severe weather is
anticipated with this activity.

A strong upper-level trough/low (for August) will continue moving
through the Intermountain West today and into central/northern
portions of the High Plains on Friday. This upper-level feature is
forecast to push a potent cold front across these regions, leading
to much cooler than average temperatures in the western third of
the CONUS. High temperatures in particular should be 10 to 20
degrees below normal for the Central Great Basin into the Northern
Rockies and Northern High Plains, while ahead of the front, highs
will be in the 90s for portions of the Dakotas into Minnesota
today. Additionally, the weather pattern and monsoonal moisture
inflow will provide support for widespread rain and thunderstorms
in portions of the western and central U.S., some of which could
be severe. The Central High Plains in particular could see severe
weather today and tonight, with a Slight Risk of severe weather in
place for tornadoes, wind, and hail. Thunderstorm development is
already underway over the region, and a Severe Thunderstorm Watch
extends over the region through tonight. The heavy rain threat
should focus further west today in western Colorado and eastern
Utah, as the aforementioned upper-level trough interacts with the
moist, unstable airmass in place and thunderstorms train over the
same location. Accordingly, Flash Flood Watches are in effect for
the area through this evening. The severe weather and heavy rain
threat will shift into the Northern Plains/Upper Midwest to begin
the weekend as the frontal system migrates east through tomorrow.
Slight Risks of both severe weather and flash flooding are in
place for portions of the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest for
Friday. After the frontal passage, cool temperatures can be
expected in the Northern Plains tomorrow, with below average highs
in the mid-70's likely before temperatures moderate to around
normal beginning Sunday. Moreover, the highest elevations of the
West could even see light snow with the precipitation given the
strong upper-low in place. Otherwise, poor air quality persists in
portions of the West despite the cooldown, and an Elevated Risk of
fire weather and Red Flag Warnings are in effect today for
portions of northern California.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1253 AM CDT Fri Aug 20 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified mid-level short-wave trough positioned over the
northern/central Rockies will shift northeast throughout the day,
reaching portions of the northern Great Plains by the end of the
forecast period. Meanwhile, another mid-level short-wave trough will
enter portions of the Pacific Northwest throughout the day. Despite
modestly enhanced mid-level flow that will accompany these features,
enhanced surface flow should remain confined to cool/post-frontal
airmasses, where the combination of relatively high RH values and
marginally receptive fuels should result in low wind/RH fire-weather
concerns.

Potential exists for some isolated dry thunderstorm development in
the lee of the Cascades during the overnight period with the
approaching mid-level trough. However, storm coverage appears too
localized to warrant the inclusion of any highlights at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 AM CDT Fri Aug 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level short-wave trough will translate from portions of the
Pacific Northwest into the northern Great Basin and northern
Rockies. A belt of enhanced mid-level flow (45-55 kt) will translate
along the southern periphery of this feature across the
northern/central Great Basin and intensify throughout the day.

...Portions of the Northern Great Basin...
Elevated fire-weather conditions will be possible as vertical mixing
during the afternoon allows for sustained westerly surface winds of
10-15 mph to develop. The residual low-level airmass over the region
remains quite dry, which should result in RH values falling into the
upper teens, while fuels across the region remain quite dry and
receptive to large-fire spread.

In addition, isolated dry thunderstorms will be possible across the
region. Modest mid-level moisture and steep low-level lapse rates,
combined with mid-level ascent from the passing trough should allow
for convective development by mid afternoon. Given the enhanced flow
aloft, relatively fast storm motions can be expected amid PWAT
values generally below 0.75 inches and receptive fuels.

...Dangerous Henri likely to affect New England into early next
week...


...Overview...

The 03Z National Hurricane Center advisory for Tropical Storm
Henri shows the system strengthening to hurricane status as it
lifts northward over the western Atlantic during the rest of this
week into the weekend.  Henri should weaken somewhat and be near
southern New England by the start of the medium range period early
Monday, followed by a track to the northeast.  Expect Henri to
bring a substantial threat for high winds/waves and areas of heavy
rainfall.  Refer to the latest NHC products for further
information on Henri.  Meanwhile the large scale pattern will be
fairly typical for late summer with southern Canada/northern U.S.
flow aloft pushing along rainfall-focusing waves/fronts across the
northern half of the lower 48 while mean ridging aloft prevails
farther south and likely expands westward with time.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The main complexity in Henri's forecast lies in the short range as
the system interacts with an eastern U.S. shortwave/upper low.
The consolidated system should be near southern New England by
early Monday, with subsequent opening of the upper low and
northeastward progression of the surface system.  Guidance still
displays some significant differences for the precise definition
and track at this time frame.  The 18Z and new 00Z GFS appear to
be the closest in principle to the official track provided in the
03Z advisory.

Guidance has varied with the specifics of features within southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. flow.  The primary uncertainties lie
with what becomes of an upper low that ejects from southwestern
Canada Monday onward and then Pacific flow that may reach the
Northwest after midweek, with neither one particularly stable
and/or agreeable in the models over the past couple days.  Most
solutions now indicate the southwestern Canada upper low should
open up with time and with moderate troughing to the south, in
contrast to some earlier runs that held onto a more persistent
upper low and more amplified trough.  The 00Z CMC still holds onto
a closed low for quite a while though.  These differences continue
to temper confidence in frontal position over the lower 48.  For
the trailing Pacific energy, the 12Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean have arrived
at their solutions after trending away from Northwest ridging they
had depicted a couple days ago.  On the other hand GFS runs have
been a fairly fast and amplified extreme with the upper trough by
late in the week, with the 12Z CMC a bit slower but also rather
amplified.  The new 00Z GFS has trended favorably back closer to
the means but the 00Z CMC/ECMWF have adjusted faster and flatter
than their 12Z runs, highlighting the continued uncertainty.

Away from Henri the initial forecast blend utilized a composite of
12Z/18Z models for the first half of the period.  Lower confidence
aspects of the GFS/CMC after midweek led to a steady phaseout of
those runs, yielding a day 7 Friday forecast consisting of mostly
the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means and a lingering minority component of
the 12Z ECMWF.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Extending into early next week Henri will bring a threat for high
winds/waves along with some bands of heavy rainfall over and near
New England.  The system should become extratropical by midweek as
it continues northeastward.  Surface waves/fronts crossing the
northern U.S. and southern Canada will interact with leading
moisture and instability to produce episodes of showers and
thunderstorms that could be locally heavy.  Currently the best
potential for highest five-day totals is over and near the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Midwest.  Central and southern parts of the
East may see areas of diurnally favored convection within a humid
and warm to hot airmass.

Monday-Wednesday should feature a broad area of above normal
temperatures from the central-southern Plains into the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.  Scattered plus 10-15F anomalies will be
possible mainly over the Mid-Mississippi Valley into Lower Great
Lakes and more for morning lows versus daytime highs.  Even away
from the areas with highest anomalies, some daily record warm lows
may be challenged.  Highs should moderate later in the week but
warm lows will likely persist over the eastern half of the
country.  Expect the highest heat index values to be over the
Mid/Lower Mississippi Valley and along the Gulf Coast early-mid
week.  Westward expansion of upper ridging will promote increasing
coverage of highs 5-10F above normal over southern parts of the
West later in the week.  The Northern Plains region will be the
main area of cool temperatures with some highs up to 10-15F below
normal, mainly Tuesday-Thursday.  Parts of the Northwest will also
be on the cool side early in the week.

...Severe thunderstorms and heavy rain possible from the
Northern/Central Plains toward portions of the Upper Midwest today
as a potent cold front swings through...

...A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in effect across parts
of the Mid-Atlantic through Saturday morning...

...Tropical Storm Henri is forecast to take a turn toward southern
New England today with potential impacts starting as early as
Saturday night...


A rather strong upper-level low traversing the Northern Rockies
this morning is forecast to eject into the Northern Plains today,
while a broader upper-level trough becomes negatively tilted.
These features will help produce an active day of weather across
the north-central United States. At the surface, a potent cold
front and rapidly strengthening low pressure system are expected
to spark numerous showers and thunderstorms across the
Northern/Central Plains by this afternoon before reaching parts of
the Upper Midwest and Middle/Lower Missouri Valley by evening. A
few storms could turn severe and lead to damaging wind gusts,
large hail, and isolated tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center
has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe weather from
northeast Kansas to northern Minnesota. Flash flooding will also
be a concern throughout central and eastern North Dakota, as well
as northwest Minnesota, where several inches of rain could fall.
Otherwise, much of this part of the country is currently
experiencing severe drought and will welcome any beneficial
rainfall.

Heavy rain will also be a concern throughout sections of the
Mid-Atlantic today as a tropical airmass and stationary boundary
linger over the region. An abundance of atmospheric moisture
content will allow for thunderstorms to produce intense downpours
from southern Maryland and Delaware to eastern North Carolina.
Many of these locations have already experienced an active week,
partly thanks to the remnants of Fred producing widespread showers
and thunderstorms a few days ago, which has left soil and terrain
even more susceptible to flash flooding. A Slight Risk (level 2/4)
of Excessive Rainfall, as well as Flash Flood Watches are in
effect to highlight the potential hazard.

Meanwhile, all eyes are expected to turn toward the Northeast and
New England by the end of the weekend as Tropical Storm Henri
threatens the region with potential storm surge, wind, and rain
impacts. Henri is currently located well off the Southeast
coastline and is forecast to make a turn toward the north today,
while potentially strengthening into a hurricane by Saturday
morning. Dangerous rip currents and rough surf can be expected
along the East Coast this weekend regardless of the eventual track
of Henri. Tropical storm force winds may reach coastal regions of
the Northeast and southern New England by Saturday night, with the
center of Henri nearing southern New England by Sunday morning. Be
sure to check the National Hurricane Center for the latest
forecast and potential impacts associated with Henri.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Sat Jun 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

The ongoing outlook for elevated fire weather conditions across
portions of east-central Arizona and west-central/southwestern New
Mexico remains on track.  Conditions are very dry across the region
with RH values already falling into the single digits this morning.
Despite weak flow aloft, deep vertical mixing will promote sustained
afternoon wind speeds of 15-20 mph, which will elevate fire weather
concerns given the receptive fuels in the region.

..Jirak.. 06/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1254 AM CDT Sat Jun 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will continue to build over the southern High
Plains for the next 24 hours, which will support generally weak flow
at the surface and a continuation of hot and dry conditions west of
the southern Rockies. Wind enhancements along terrain features will
likely result in areas of elevated conditions for parts of the
Southwest, but relatively benign winds and/or recent precipitation
and rain chances today will mitigate most other concerns.

...Eastern Arizona into Western New Mexico...
Although upper-level flow over the region will remain fairly weak,
deep-boundary layer mixing is expected once again this afternoon
amid strong diurnal heating. This will help support 15-20 mph winds,
especially within and in the lee of the Mongollon Rim and into the
Gila Region of southwest NM. Poor overnight RH recovery and little
moisture flux into the region will result in another day of single
digit RH values. Several fires in the broader region confirm
receptive fuels are in place and will support elevated fire weather
conditions given the forecast wind/RH combinations.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop along
the southern Rockies within an up-slope flow regime. Precipitable
water values are forecast to increase to generally above 0.6 inches,
but a few thunderstorms on the periphery of the better moisture may
support a few dry lightning strikes over dry fuels. However, the
expected coverage of dry lightning is too low to warrant additional
highlights.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
232 PM EDT Sat Jun 12 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Jun 15 2021 - 12Z Sat Jun 19 2021

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through next week across
much of the Interior West and through midweek over the northern
Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest/California next week...


...Overview...

Today's guidance maintains reasonable continuity for the general
pattern evolution.  The very strong upper ridge centered over the
Four Corners states next week may weaken somewhat by
Friday-Saturday as it flattens east-west.  Vigorous shortwave
energy brushing the Northwest and tracking around the Four Corners
ridge will push a cold front across the northern half of the West
and Plains, eventually reaching northern parts of the East by next
weekend.  This energy should re-establish eastern North American
mean troughing after it kicks out a leading trough expected to
persist near the East Coast into Thursday.  Expect the western
upper ridge to support a large area of temperatures that
approach/exceed daily record values over portions the Interior
West/Rockies on most days next week and extending into California
during the latter half of the week--making for a hazardous heat
wave event.  Some of this heat will extend into the northern
Plains through at least midweek as well.  In the Gulf of Mexico,
there is still the potential for a disturbance to form near the
Bay of Campeche and move northward late in the week but also a
large degree of uncertainty in its evolution.  The National
Hurricane Center continues to monitor this area in its outlooks.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The models and means continue to agree well for the strength and
position of the Four Corners ridge/upper high through the period.
Early-mid period strength of the upper ridge is quite remarkable
with even the ensemble means showing 500mb height anomalies of
+2.5-3 standard deviations over parts of the Rockies/High Plains
and even greater than that north of the Canadian border on
Tuesday.  Such heights may breach record high heights for this
early in the warm season.  Models/means all show some weakening of
the ridge by Friday and especially Saturday as the flow into the
PacNW squashes the northern side.  For the initial eastern North
America upper trough, most guidance has gravitated to a common
solution but the 00Z CMC differs with some details and was not
preferred.  It may still take some time to resolve the finer
details of surface low evolution near New England.  Among the
00Z/06Z guidance an operational model blend represented consensus
well, with relatively more weighting to the GFS/ECMWF vs the UKMET.

Not counting the 00Z CMC, there is decent agreement in principle
for the shortwave ejecting through the Northwest and around the
western ridge, ultimately settling into the long-term mean trough
over eastern North America. Meanwhile models and individual
ensemble members showed considerable difficulty in handling the
complexities of North Pacific flow--leading some guidance to
become up to 180 degrees out of phase for eastern Pacific/western
North America features by late in the week/weekend.  The rather
low amplitude flow across the North Pacific is at least one
factor, and suggests clarity may not exist until closer to the
short range. An operational model blend for the first half of the
period trending to an even weight of models/means (along with
continuity) later represents consensus well for the leading
shortwave. Differences in the 06Z/00Z GFS in the East led to a
preference for the latter rather than the former (which was
perhaps too bullish with low pressure off the Northeast coast late
Thu into Fri).

Latest guidance continues to show the possibility for some degree
of tropical development to emerge from the Bay of Campeche and
track northward over the Gulf of Mexico.  00Z model/ensemble cycle
trended slower with some eastern tracks as well and/or multiple
centers. Ensemble members are still sufficiently diverse to keep
their means from showing much definition.  Needless to say there
is still considerable uncertainty.  The manual forecast reflected
a consensus approach via the 17Z NHC-WPC coordination, with a weak
feature looming just south of the west-central Gulf Coast by early
next Saturday.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The most extreme anomalies within the area of intense
western/northern U.S. heat will be on Tuesday when areas over the
northern half of the Rockies/High Plains and possibly into parts
of the Great Basin may see highs 20-30F above normal.  It may not
be out of the question for one or more locations to set a new
record high for June.  The front progressing eastward from the
Northwest Tuesday onward will bring a brief cooler trend across
northern parts of the West into midweek and then into the northern
Plains.  The southern half to two-thirds of the West should see
highs consistently 10-20F above normal for most of the period,
including a westward expansion of the heat into California from
about Wednesday onward.  Northern areas should also rebound to
well above normal readings late in the week as well, though with
some uncertainty due to guidance spread for details of flow aloft.
 Morning lows should also be 10-20F above normal over a majority
of the West through the period, as well as the northern Plains
into Thursday.  Expect numerous daily records for highs/warm lows
for most of the period.  The combination of extreme daily
temperatures and duration, as well as being rather early in the
season for such an event, should make this a dangerous heat wave
for sensitive groups. Excessive heat warnings are in place for
many areas of the Southwest next week where temperatures may climb
well into the 110s in the lower deserts with low temperatures only
in the 80s and 90s.

The eastern trough aloft and associated surface waves/fronts will
produce some areas of rain and thunderstorms of varying intensity
and during mid-late week some moderately below normal temperatures
(perhaps 5 to about 10F below normal).  The southern tier may see
rain from both a wavy front and typical diurnal convective
activity.  Portions of the Gulf Coast region could see an increase
of rainfall toward the end of next week as moisture pushes
northward across the Gulf.  Guidance spread and variability thus
far keep confidence low for determining the timing and
coverage/intensity of rainfall.  Monitor forecasts/National
Hurricane Center discussions over the coming days for the latest
information regarding any potential tropical cyclone development.
The upper trough/surface front initially affecting the Pacific
Northwest will produce some rainfall from the eastern Plains into
the Great Lakes and Northeast through the week, with generally
light to locally modest amounts.

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through next week across
much of the Interior West and through midweek over the northern
Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest/California next week...


...Overview...

Today's guidance maintains reasonable continuity for the general
pattern evolution.  The very strong upper ridge centered over the
Four Corners states next week may weaken somewhat by
Friday-Saturday as it flattens east-west.  Vigorous shortwave
energy brushing the Northwest and tracking around the Four Corners
ridge will push a cold front across the northern half of the West
and Plains, eventually reaching northern parts of the East by next
weekend.  This energy should re-establish eastern North American
mean troughing after it kicks out a leading trough expected to
persist near the East Coast into Thursday.  Expect the western
upper ridge to support a large area of temperatures that
approach/exceed daily record values over portions the Interior
West/Rockies on most days next week and extending into California
during the latter half of the week--making for a hazardous heat
wave event.  Some of this heat will extend into the northern
Plains through at least midweek as well.  In the Gulf of Mexico,
there is still the potential for a disturbance to form near the
Bay of Campeche and move northward late in the week but also a
large degree of uncertainty in its evolution.  The National
Hurricane Center continues to monitor this area in its outlooks.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The models and means continue to agree well for the strength and
position of the Four Corners ridge/upper high through the period.
Early-mid period strength of the upper ridge is quite remarkable
with even the ensemble means showing 500mb height anomalies of
+2.5-3 standard deviations over parts of the Rockies/High Plains
and even greater than that north of the Canadian border on
Tuesday.  Such heights may breach record high heights for this
early in the warm season.  Models/means all show some weakening of
the ridge by Friday and especially Saturday as the flow into the
PacNW squashes the northern side.  For the initial eastern North
America upper trough, most guidance has gravitated to a common
solution but the 00Z CMC differs with some details and was not
preferred.  It may still take some time to resolve the finer
details of surface low evolution near New England.  Among the
00Z/06Z guidance an operational model blend represented consensus
well, with relatively more weighting to the GFS/ECMWF vs the UKMET.

Not counting the 00Z CMC, there is decent agreement in principle
for the shortwave ejecting through the Northwest and around the
western ridge, ultimately settling into the long-term mean trough
over eastern North America. Meanwhile models and individual
ensemble members showed considerable difficulty in handling the
complexities of North Pacific flow--leading some guidance to
become up to 180 degrees out of phase for eastern Pacific/western
North America features by late in the week/weekend.  The rather

short range. An operational model blend for the first half of the
period trending to an even weight of models/means (along with
continuity) later represents consensus well for the leading
shortwave. Differences in the 06Z/00Z GFS in the East led to a
preference for the latter rather than the former (which was
perhaps too bullish with low pressure off the Northeast coast late

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat June 12 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 PM CDT Sat Jun 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

A couple of changes were made to the fire weather outlook for Sunday
in this update.  1) Regarding the strong wind and low RH potential,
the elevated area has been expanded in all directions to encompass a
similar fire-weather environment from northwestern Arizona into
southeastern Oregon.  Very dry and well-mixed boundary layers across
the region will yield afternoon RH values in the single digits
concurrent with sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph. 2) Regarding
the dry thunderstorm potential, an area of isolated dry
thunderstorms was added across portions of southern New Mexico.
Despite expected slow movement for storms that develop over the high
terrain, very hot and dry boundary layers will promote evaporation
and limit the wetting rain potential.  With cured fuels over much of
the area, fire weather concerns may be elevated with isolated dry
thunderstorms.

..Jirak.. 06/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Sat Jun 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
Meridional upper-level flow is expected to become established along
the West coast as a strong ridge remains in place along the axis of
the Rocky Mountains. A low-amplitude impulse moving along the coast
will support modest surface pressure falls over the Pacific
Northwest Sunday afternoon, resulting in strengthening
pressure-gradient winds, and a subsequent increase in fire weather
concerns, within the Great Basin. Elsewhere across the CONUS recent
rainfall and/or weak winds in the vicinity of a surface high will
mitigate additional fire weather potential.

...Great Basin...
Ensemble guidance suggests winds will likely increase to 15-20 mph
across a broad swath of the Great Basin Sunday afternoon. Antecedent
hot and dry conditions are already in place, and 5-15% RH values
appear likely for much of the region. Several fires are noted across
NV and UT, indicating that fuels are receptive amid persistent
drought conditions. Consequently, elevated fire weather conditions
appear likely. Strengthening mid-level flow will support periods of
critical conditions as winds increase to 20-25 mph. However,
confidence in the most likely location and coverage of critical
conditions remains too low to highlight in this outlook.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southern High Plains through Sunday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
South Carolina through Sunday morning...

A weak front and some upper-level impulses will produce scattered
showers and thunderstorms east of the Mississippi River to the
East Coast.  Moisture streaming into the Southern High Plains and
a weak front along with troughs providing convergence will also
trigger showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Southern
Plains through late Saturday night.  The SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over the Southern High Plains through
Sunday morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes. There is a 10% or greater probability of severe
thunderstorm wind gust of 65 knots or greater and of two-inch or
great hail over parts of the Southern High Plains through Sunday
morning.

Furthermore, a weak upper-level low over the Mid-Atlantic will
produce showers and thunderstorms over parts of the southern
Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast through Sunday morning. The WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams are the most vulnerable through Sunday morning.

On Sunday, showers and thunderstorms will develop along and near a
weak quasi-stationary front over parts of the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys and the Mid-Atlantic.  Upper-level energy will move over
the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic destabilizing the atmosphere.  The SPC
has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic from Sunday through Monday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 AM CDT Sun Jun 13 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Early morning water vapor imagery reveals broad upper-level ridging
over the south-central CONUS and a trough over the eastern Pacific.
This trough is forecast to gradually shift east over the next 24
hours, which will result in modest surface pressure falls over the
western Great Basin/Pacific Northwest this afternoon and augment
mid-level flow over the region. Consequently, strengthening winds
will support fire weather concerns for much of the Great Basin today
given antecedent hot and dry conditions.

...Great Basin...
Observations and recent guidance continue to suggest a high
probability for widespread elevated fire weather conditions this
afternoon across a large swath of the Great Basin. Regional 00Z
soundings show very dry boundary layer conditions, and poor
overnight RH recoveries are noted. South to southwesterly winds will
increase by mid afternoon to 15-20 mph as the surface low begins to
consolidate over northern NV into OR. Strong diurnal heating will
drive deep boundary-layer mixing, resulting in single-digit relative
humidity values and allow downward transport of stronger mid-level
flow to the surface. Ongoing fires in the region are indicative of
receptive fuels amid severe drought conditions. Widespread elevated
conditions are expected, and some areas may see periods of critical
conditions as winds gust to 20-25 mph (possibly up to 30 mph for
terrain-favored locations).

...New Mexico...
Mid-level moisture on top of a deep, dry boundary layer is noted in
the 00Z EPZ sounding. Weak flow over the region will help keep this
moisture in place over southern NM, and support 100-500 J/kg MUCAPE
as isolated to scattered convection develops off the high terrain of
the southern Rockies this afternoon. This thermodynamic environment
should support at least a few dry lightning strikes across southern
and central NM where fuels are receptive. Dry lightning will be
possible across east/southeast NM, but slow storm motions and
improving moisture quality suggest a lower dry lightning potential.

Valid 12Z Wed Jun 16 2021 - 12Z Sun Jun 20 2021

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through the week across
much of the Interior West and through midweek over the northern
Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest/California through the
end of the week...


...Overview...

A very strong upper ridge centered over the Four Corners states
will remain a dominant feature in the pattern through the period
but should gradually weaken and drift a bit southward by next
weekend.  Long-term mean troughing over eastern North America will
consist of a leading East Coast trough that departs after Thursday
followed by moderately amplifying energy over western-central
parts of southern Canada and northern tier U.S. (and possibly some
trailing flow from Canada).  This amplifying energy will push a
front across the northern half of the lower 48 through the period,
with the trailing part of the front likely stalling over the
central Plains/Rockies.  Pacific flow should bring another
shortwave/upper low and leading frontal system into western Canada
and northwestern U.S. next weekend.  The western upper ridge will
support a hazardous heat wave event over parts of the Interior
West/Rockies and extending into California during the latter half
of the week, with a broad area of temperatures that should
approach/exceed daily record values.  Some of this heat will
extend into the northern Plains through Wednesday followed by a
moderating trend.  The upper ridge may weaken enough by Sunday to
bring temperatures below record levels, albeit still well above
normal.  In the Gulf of Mexico there is continued potential for a
disturbance to form near the Bay of Campeche and move northward
late in the week and weekend, but with a large degree of
uncertainty in its evolution.  The National Hurricane Center
continues to monitor this area in its outlooks.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Based on guidance through the 12Z/18Z cycles, the updated forecast
started with an operational model blend for day 3 Wednesday
followed by removal of the 12Z UKMET and in another couple days
the CMC while ultimately trending to an even weight of the 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean and 18Z GFS/GEFS mean by day 7 Sunday.

Within the initial East Coast trough there are still
low-predictability shortwave uncertainties that will take
additional time to resolve.  Some models hint at enough flow
separation to close off a small-scale upper low for a brief time
somewhat south of the main closed low forecast to track just north
of Maine.  The 12Z UKMET held the upper trough west of consensus
while the new run compares better to other guidance.

A blend approach worked well to resolve detail spread for the
southern Canada/northern tier shortwave that ultimately settles
over eastern North America.  By late week GFS runs stray a bit to
the strong side with the upper trough and southward with the
leading cold front.

Guidance spread for North Pacific flow reaching western Canada and
the northwestern U.S. by late week/weekend is less dramatic than
it was 24 hours ago but some differences persist.  The 12Z UKMET
became exceedingly fast after Wednesday and then the CMC strayed
on the fast side as well.  By day 7 Sunday an average between the
faster 12Z ECMWF and slower 18Z GFS for the arriving trough/upper
low compared reasonably well to the GEFS/ECMWF means in principle.
 The new 00Z UKMET/CMC are somewhat less extreme than their 12Z
runs and are close to the past couple ECMWF runs through late week.

Today's guidance still signals the potential for tropical
development to emerge from the Bay of Campeche and track northward
over the Gulf of Mexico.  The prevailing trend over the past day
or more has been slower (with the CMC continuing to be on the
faster side of the operational model envelope) and in some cases
westward.  Ensemble means are still fairly ill-defined due to
individual member spread.  Needless to say there is still
considerable uncertainty.  The updated manual forecast reflected
only a very slight westward nudge of the surface system and
extrapolation yielded an approach to the west-central Gulf Coast
next weekend about a day later than was the case 36 hours ago.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Ahead of the northern tier cold front on Wednesday, expect a broad
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal from California into the
northern Plains.  Continued progression of the front east of the
Rockies will bring a pronounced cooling trend to the central U.S.
after Wednesday/Thursday.  The Southwest/California and the Great
Basin should maintain similar anomalies into the weekend with the
Northwest also rebounding to well above normal levels late in the
week.  The combination of an arriving Pacific front and gradual
weakening of the Four Corners ridge may finally start to reduce
the coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies by next Sunday.
Before then expect multiple days with numerous locations seeing
temperatures approach or exceed daily record highs/warm lows.  The
combination of extreme daily temperatures and duration, as well as
being rather early in the season for such an event, should make
this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups.  Excessive heat
warnings are in place for many areas of the Southwest next week
where temperatures may climb well into the 110s in the lower
deserts with low temperatures only in the 80s and 90s.

The upper trough near the East Coast should reach far enough
eastward to allow for a drier trend over the northern half of the
region mid-late week though shortwave energy/Atlantic surface
waviness could still produce a little rain near the southern
Mid-Atlantic.  At the same time somewhat more rain may fall over
Florida while a stalling/weakening front near the Gulf Coast may
help to focus diurnally enhanced showers and thunderstorms.  Areas
near the Gulf Coast should continue to monitor forecasts/National
Hurricane Center discussions over the coming days for the latest
information regarding any potential tropical cyclone development
by the latter half of the week into the weekend.  Regardless of
the strength of any possible system, the northward flow of
tropical moisture would bring the threat of heavy rainfall to
portions of the southern tier.  The cold front pushing eastward
from the northern Plains will produce some rain and thunderstorms
from the Midwest eastward/southeastward into the eastern U.S.
Some of this activity could be locally heavy but it may take into
the short range time frame to determine any areas where it may be
relatively more likely.  Areas of rain may also be possible along
the stalling front back over the central Plains/Rockies.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0211 AM CDT Sun Jun 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEVADA INTO FAR WESTERN
UTAH...

...Synopsis...
South to southwesterly upper-level flow is expected to persist along
the West coast for the beginning of the work week. Although surface
pressure falls will be modest over the broader inter-mountain West,
strengthening mid-level flow coupled with deep boundary-layer mixing
and hot/dry conditions will support a fire weather threat for parts
of the Great Basin. Other localized threats may evolved across
coastal Southern California and central New Mexico.

...Great Basin...
Little to no moisture recovery is expected across the Great Basin
over the next 48 hours, which will yield another day of single digit
to low teen relative humidity values. Winds will increase to 15-25
mph across much of NV and western UT with a smaller corridor of
20-25 mph sustained winds likely within this area. Short and medium
range ensemble guidance show reasonably high probabilities for
critical wind/RH conditions, likely being driven by increasing flow
aloft amid deep boundary-layer mixing. Recent fire activity and
reports indicate fuels are receptive for most of NV and western UT,
and should remain receptive through early this week. Expansion of
the critical risk area is possible into parts of northwest UT if
fuels cure sufficiently by Monday afternoon.

...Southern California...
Northerly pressure-gradient winds are forecast to increase late
Monday night into early Tuesday along the southern CA coast as high
pressure builds to the north. Resulting Sundowner winds could lead
to areas of elevated fire weather conditions across Santa Barbra
county, though confidence in the wind and RH forecast is somewhat
low given the somewhat modest pressure gradient and marine moisture
currently in place.

...New Mexico...
Isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop within the southern
Rockies Monday afternoon. Mid-level moisture atop a deep, dry
boundary layer may support a few dry lightning strikes. However, the
coverage of storms is expected to be somewhat low, and PWAT values
between 0.5 to 0.75 inches suggest a mixture of wet and dry
thunderstorms.

...Thunderstorms across the High Plains and the eastern U.S. could
be severe today especially around the Central Appalachians...

...Building heat as well as potential fire danger is forecast for
much of the West...

In the eastern U.S., a couple of rounds of scattered thunderstorms
are expected over the next couple of days as moisture streams in
ahead of frontal systems and an upper-level trough coming into the
Great Lakes region. Today, the most widespread thunderstorms are
likely in the Central Appalachians, and a Slight Risk of severe
weather is in place there, with the main threat being high winds.
As some storms produce heavy rain, isolated flash flooding is
possible there as well, which may also affect portions of the Ohio
Valley. The Midwest could also see strong storms today.
Storms should shift a bit into the Northeast by Monday, but
generally stay below severe levels, though once again isolated
flash flooding cannot be ruled out.

Farther south, convergence and moist Gulf air could also create
scattered thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast and in the Southeast
over the next couple of days. Northern Florida as well as
southeastern Georgia may see some locally heavy rainfall causing
flash flooding from these storms. The High Plains should also see
some isolated thunderstorms today and less so on Monday. Today
into tonight, a few strong to severe thunderstorms are possible,
with gusty winds and hail. Additionally, isolated flash flooding
is possible in the Central High Plains, and Marginal Risks of
excessive rainfall and severe weather are in place.

Meanwhile in the West, the main story will be heat building
through this week as an upper-level ridge expands. Excessive Heat
Watches and Warnings and Heat Advisories are in place especially
for Monday onward for portions of California, the Desert
Southwest, and the Central Great Basin. Hot temperatures in the
90s and even into the 100s are forecast farther north across the
Northern Great Basin to Northern Plains as well, likely peaking on
Tuesday. Record high temperatures are expected to be widespread
across the Desert Southwest, Intermountain West, and Rockies over
the next several days. Given the heat and dry conditions, an
Elevated Risk of fire danger is in place in the Great Basin today,
with a Critical Risk for portions of Nevada and Utah on Monday.
The exception to the Western heat will be the Pacific Northwest
and northern California, which should see temperatures near or a
bit cooler than normal along with rainy weather as a cold front
comes through the area.

...Thunderstorms across the High Plains and the eastern U.S. could
be severe today especially around the Central Appalachians...

...Building heat as well as potential fire danger is forecast for
much of the West...

In the eastern U.S., a couple of rounds of scattered thunderstorms
are expected over the next couple of days as moisture streams in
ahead of frontal systems and an upper-level trough coming into the
Great Lakes region. Today, the most widespread thunderstorms are
likely in the Central Appalachians, and a Slight Risk of severe
weather is in place there, with the main threat being high winds.
As some storms produce heavy rain, isolated flash flooding is
possible there as well, which may also affect portions of the Ohio
Valley. The Midwest could also see strong storms today. Storms
should shift a bit into the Northeast by Monday, but generally
stay below severe levels, though once again isolated flash
flooding cannot be ruled out.

Farther south, convergence and moist Gulf air could also create
scattered thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast and in the Southeast
over the next couple of days. Northern Florida as well as
southeastern Georgia may see some locally heavy rainfall causing
flash flooding from these storms. The High Plains should also see
some isolated thunderstorms today and less so on Monday. Today
into tonight, a few strong to severe thunderstorms are possible
there, with gusty winds and hail. Additionally, isolated flash
flooding is possible in the Central High Plains, and Marginal
Risks of excessive rainfall and severe weather are in place.

Meanwhile in the West, the main story will be heat building
through this week as an upper-level ridge expands. Excessive Heat
Watches and Warnings and Heat Advisories are in place especially
for Monday onward for portions of California, the Desert
Southwest, and the Central Great Basin. Hot temperatures in the
90s and even into the 100s are forecast farther north across the
Northern Great Basin to Northern Plains as well, likely peaking on

across the Desert Southwest, Intermountain West, and Rockies over

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1129 AM CDT Sun Aug 08 2021

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

The ongoing fire weather outlook for today remains on track with
only minor adjustments to the elevated area in south-central Montana
based on the latest observations and guidance.  Visible satellite
imagery this morning indicates that a relatively dense smoke plume
is overspreading the region ahead of the cold front.  While this may
impede/delay surface heating and vertical mixing, elevated fire
weather conditions still appear likely.  See the previous discussion
below for more details.

..Jirak.. 08/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CDT Sun Aug 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A potent shortwave trough over the Pacific Northwest will move to
the east through the day as an attendant cold front advances through
the Great Basin and northern Rockies. Ahead of and along the front,
westerly winds are forecast to increase through the day, overlapping
with dry surface conditions. The strong winds and wind shift behind
the front will support elevated fire weather conditions.

...Northern Rockies...
Ahead of the cold front across Montana, southwesterly surface winds
will begin to increase as surface pressure gradients and mid-level
flow strengthen through much of the day. The downslope orientation
of surface winds and strong heating should support dry surface
conditions with RH below 25% across much of southern Montana,
western Wyoming and northeastern Idaho. As surface winds approach
25-35 mph near and along the front, a corridor of elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions will likely develop by mid
afternoon. The fire weather threat is expected to be relatively
brief, as surface humidity recovers rapidly behind the front.
However, given the magnitude of the forecast winds and the
significant shift in direction, brief elevated to critical
conditions are expected especially near any active fires.

As the cold front moves eastward through the afternoon, isolated
thunderstorms may develop across Idaho and Montana. Model soundings
show weak buoyancy atop a mostly dry boundary layer suggesting the
potential for a few dry lightning strikes. While coverage is not
anticipated to reach dry thunder criteria, a few starts are possible
in dry fuels. Strong downdraft winds associated with high-based
storms may also contribute to stronger winds gusts ahead of the
frontal passage.

...Northern Great Basin...
Along southern portions of the aforementioned cold front, surface
winds will gradually increase through the day across portions of the
Great Basin and northern Nevada. Widespread surface RH below 15% is
expected, with warm and dry conditions across much of the region. As
the front approaches by mid to late afternoon, surface winds are
forecast to reach 15-20 mph with higher gusts. Elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions are forecast to  develop before the
front brings cooler and more stable conditions into the evening and
overnight.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
256 PM EDT Sun Aug 08 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Aug 11 2021 - 12Z Sun Aug 15 2021

...Northwest heat wave likely to bring temperatures that challenge
daily records from midweek into the weekend...

...Overview...

Most guidance maintains good agreement and continuity for the
overall pattern through the period. Expect upper level ridges from
the eastern Pacific and southern Rockies/High Plains to
consolidate over the Great Basin and central Rockies by Friday
with a strong ridge remaining in place through the weekend.
Downstream the axis of a mean upper trough (with embedded
shortwaves) will move from the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes
and Northeast. The strong ridging over the West should support a
heat wave that affects the Northwest and parts of the Great
Basin/California with temperatures over some areas likely to
approach or reach daily records for highs/warm lows from midweek
onward. Across the eastern third of the country, associated fronts
and leading warm/moist flow will produce areas of rain and
thunderstorms, some locally heavy at times.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The primary guidance issues continue to involve details around the
periphery of the western U.S. ridge and shortwaves embedded within
the mean trough that settles into the Great Lakes/Northeast. Over
the West, 00Z/06Z GFS runs were generally stronger than other
guidance with shortwave energy on the south side of the upper high
while the new 12Z run has adjusted more to the model/mean average.
Also latest GFS runs have been on the aggressive side of
operational guidance in how much Pacific shortwave energy reaches
the northwestern U.S. and western Canada by next Sunday. Even
among remaining guidance there is some spread and variability for
how quickly heights aloft may decline. The GFS scenario is within
the full ensemble spread albeit in the minority while the new 12Z
ECMWF erodes the ridge a bit more than the prior run. An
intermediate model/mean solution looks reasonable at this time. A
blend approach maintains stability for the eastern trough aloft
and leading surface front details with embedded shortwave
specifics having lower predictability. The updated forecast
started with an operational model composite early and then trended
toward a half model (more 00Z ECMWF than 00Z CMC) and half mean
(06Z GEFS/00Z ECens) blend by day 7 Sunday.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The Northwest heat wave should produce several days with max/min
temperatures of 10-20F above normal over Washington/Oregon and
some surrounding areas from Wednesday through the weekend.
Anomalies for daytime highs should be the greatest around
Thursday-Friday when a few locations could reach 20-25F above
normal. A decent number of locations across the Northwest and into
northern California/Nevada may see readings approach if not
reach/exceed daily records for highs and warm lows over multiple
days. By Sunday the highs may moderate somewhat but morning lows
should remain quite warm. Coverage and character of any smoke will
provide short-term wild cards for temperature forecasts. Currently
expect this heat wave to be less extreme than the all-time record
event in late June but it may still be the second most significant
of the summer for the Portland-Seattle corridor.

Shortwaves and moisture to the south of the consolidating upper
ridge over the Great Basin/central Rockies will likely promote an
increase of coverage and rainfall amounts in monsoon activity over
the Four Corners states and parts of the Southwest. There is still
some uncertainty in the relative strength of the shortwaves and
ridge to the north so the precise coverage/intensity of rain will
take additional time to resolve. High temperatures over the
southern Rockies/Southwest should be within a few degrees on
either side of normal Wednesday followed by the warmer areas
trending to modestly below normal by late week/weekend.

A weakening Plains into Great Lakes front and then a trailing
front that reaches the East Coast and south-central U.S. by next
weekend will focus areas of showers and thunderstorms over the
eastern third to half of the lower 48 during the period. Some
areas of locally moderate to heavy rain are likely but it may take
until the short-range time frame to refine the most favored areas
for highest totals. Current indications suggest some potential
from the Upper Ohio Valley and portions of the Appalachians to
areas along the East Coast. The southern Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas
and areas to the west could see increasing potential for
training/repeat activity later in the weekend as the front
decelerates. Farther ahead of the fronts, daily scattered storm
chances will also exist over the East and Deep South within a warm
and moist environment. Florida should see rainfall increase Friday
into the weekend due to a surface trough and some upper level
energy moving into the area from the Bahamas/Cuba. This feature
originates from a tropical wave initially near 50W longitude.

Very warm to hot conditions should prevail to the east and south
of the two cold fronts. The highest anomalies of plus 10-15F are
most likely for morning lows from the Great Lakes into the
Northeast Wednesday-Friday with a few daily records possible. Plus
5-10F anomalies will be more common for highs but there may be a
few isolated higher readings over the central Plains around
midweek and to the east/northeast mid-late week. The combined heat
and humidity could support heat index values into at least the low
100s for many lower elevations across the southern half to
two-thirds of the central/eastern U.S.. Highest heat index values
are likely over the lower half of the Mississippi Valley and
vicinity along with areas along and inland from the Gulf Coast.
The cold front reaching the East toward the end of the week will
likely bring high temperatures down to within a few degrees on
either side of normal over the central U.S. by Friday and farther
east by the weekend. This will suppress 100F+ heat indices more
toward the Gulf Coast region by Sunday.

...Northwest heat wave likely to bring temperatures that challenge
daily records from midweek into the weekend...

...Overview...

Most guidance maintains good agreement and continuity for the
overall pattern through the period. Expect upper level ridges from
the eastern Pacific and southern Rockies/High Plains to
consolidate over the Great Basin and central Rockies by Friday
with a strong ridge remaining in place through the weekend.
Downstream the axis of a mean upper trough (with embedded
shortwaves) will move from the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes
and Northeast. The strong ridging over the West should support a
heat wave that affects the Northwest and parts of the Great
Basin/California with temperatures over some areas likely to
approach or reach daily records for highs/warm lows from midweek
onward. Across the eastern third of the country, associated fronts
and leading warm/moist flow will produce areas of rain and
thunderstorms, some locally heavy at times.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The primary guidance issues continue to involve details around the
periphery of the western U.S. ridge and shortwaves embedded within
the mean trough that settles into the Great Lakes/Northeast. Over
the West, 00Z/06Z GFS runs were generally stronger than other
guidance with shortwave energy on the south side of the upper high
while the new 12Z run has adjusted more to the model/mean average.
Also latest GFS runs have been on the aggressive side of
operational guidance in how much Pacific shortwave energy reaches
the northwestern U.S. and western Canada by next Sunday. Even
among remaining guidance there is some spread and variability for
how quickly heights aloft may decline. The GFS scenario is within
the full ensemble spread albeit in the minority while the new 12Z
ECMWF erodes the ridge a bit more than the prior run. An
intermediate model/mean solution looks reasonable at this time. A
blend approach maintains stability for the eastern trough aloft
and leading surface front details with embedded shortwave
specifics having lower predictability. The updated forecast
started with an operational model composite early and then trended
toward a half model (more 00Z ECMWF than 00Z CMC) and half mean
(06Z GEFS/00Z ECens) blend by day 7 Sunday.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The Northwest heat wave should produce several days with max/min
temperatures of 10-20F above normal over Washington/Oregon and
some surrounding areas from Wednesday through the weekend.
Anomalies for daytime highs should be the greatest around
Thursday-Friday when a few locations could reach 20-25F above
normal. A decent number of locations across the Northwest and into
northern California/Nevada may see readings approach if not
reach/exceed daily records for highs and warm lows over multiple
days. By Sunday the highs may moderate somewhat but morning lows
should remain quite warm. Coverage and character of any smoke will
provide short-term wild cards for temperature forecasts. Currently
expect this heat wave to be less extreme than the all-time record
event in late June but it may still be the second most significant
of the summer for the Portland-Seattle corridor.

Shortwaves and moisture to the south of the consolidating upper
ridge over the Great Basin/central Rockies will likely promote an
increase of coverage and rainfall amounts in monsoon activity over
the Four Corners states and parts of the Southwest. There is still
some uncertainty in the relative strength of the shortwaves and
ridge to the north so the precise coverage/intensity of rain will
take additional time to resolve. High temperatures over the
southern Rockies/Southwest should be within a few degrees on
either side of normal Wednesday followed by the warmer areas
trending to modestly below normal by late week/weekend.

A weakening Plains into Great Lakes front and then a trailing
front that reaches the East Coast and south-central U.S. by next
weekend will focus areas of showers and thunderstorms over the
eastern third to half of the lower 48 during the period. Some
areas of locally moderate to heavy rain are likely but it may take
until the short-range time frame to refine the most favored areas
for highest totals. Current indications suggest some potential
from the Upper Ohio Valley and portions of the Appalachians to
areas along the East Coast. The southern Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas
and areas to the west could see increasing potential for
training/repeat activity later in the weekend as the front
decelerates. Farther ahead of the fronts, daily scattered storm
chances will also exist over the East and Deep South within a warm
and moist environment. Florida should see rainfall increase Friday
into the weekend due to a surface trough and some upper level
energy moving into the area from the Bahamas/Cuba. This feature
originates from a tropical wave initially near 50W longitude.

Very warm to hot conditions should prevail to the east and south
of the two cold fronts. The highest anomalies of plus 10-15F are
most likely for morning lows from the Great Lakes into the
Northeast Wednesday-Friday with a few daily records possible. Plus
5-10F anomalies will be more common for highs but there may be a
few isolated higher readings over the central Plains around
midweek and to the east/northeast mid-late week. The combined heat
and humidity could support heat index values into at least the low
100s for many lower elevations across the southern half to
two-thirds of the central/eastern U.S.. Highest heat index values
are likely over the lower half of the Mississippi Valley and
vicinity along with areas along and inland from the Gulf Coast.
The cold front reaching the East toward the end of the week will
likely bring high temperatures down to within a few degrees on
either side of normal over the central U.S. by Friday and farther
east by the weekend. This will suppress 100F+ heat indices more
toward the Gulf Coast region by Sunday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun August 08 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

No changes are needed to the ongoing fire weather outlook for
tomorrow (Monday). See the discussion below for more details.

..Jirak.. 08/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Sun Aug 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough is forecast to move eastward across Montana and
Wyoming reaching the western Dakotas by early evening. At the
surface, a cold front associated with the trough will continue to
move east leaving a cooler and drier airmass across the Rockies and
central High Plains. Breezy westerly winds in the Rockies may
support locally elevated fire weather conditions across portions of
Wyoming.

...Southern Wyoming...
Within the post frontal airmass over the central Rockies, westerly
surface winds will remain gusty through much of the day as west to
east surface pressure gradients slowly weaken. Dry northwesterly
flow at the surface should keep humidity values low around 20%.
Winds of 15-20 mph may support locally elevated fire weather
conditions within the Red Desert and southern Wyoming before flow
weaken substantially late in the afternoon and early evening.
Elevated highlights will be withheld for now as the greatest overlap
of strong winds and low humidity appears to be over areas with
little concentration of favorable fuels.

...Heavy rain and severe storms possible in the Midwest and Great
Lakes through Tuesday, with the threat of severe weather returning
to the Northern Plains on Monday...

...Above average temperatures and oppressive humidity found across
the central U.S., shifting into the Northeast by Tuesday...

...Poor air quality due to wildfire smoke found throughout parts
of the High Plains and West...

Much of the active weather to close out this second weekend of
August and start a new workweek will be located across the
Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northern Plains. Two separate
upper-level disturbances are expected to traverse these regions
and spark numerous showers and the thunderstorms. The first system
is currently located over the Upper Midwest and in conjunction
with a weakening frontal boundary extending eastward across the
Upper Great Lakes. Developing thunderstorms this evening may turn
severe between southern Missouri and Wisconsin, producing damaging
wind gusts, large hail, isolated tornadoes, and frequent
lightning. Flash flooding will also be a concern across this area,
with upwards of 2+ inches of rain possible where repeating rounds
of thunderstorms occur. Flash Flood Watches are in effect across
central Wisconsin.

By Monday, the next impulse of energy and associated cold front is
expected to enter the Northern Plains and spark scattered
thunderstorms across parts of the Central/Northern Plains, with a
greater chance of damaging wind gusts and large hail found across
the eastern Dakotas. As the cold front continues to swing east on
Tuesday, organized showers and thunderstorms are expected to
return to the Great Lakes and Midwest. Elsewhere, monsoonal
moisture could bring continued rounds of thunderstorms to parts of
southern Arizona, while typical summertime storms impact parts of
the Florida Panhandle and the Ohio Valley.

For many residents east of the Rockies, the dog days of summer
have arrived as heat and high humidity swelter much of the
country. Above average temperatures found across the Great Plains
and Upper Midwest will lead to highs into the upper 90s, with
triple digits possible throughout the central and southern High
Plains. The combination of warm temperatures and oppressive
humidity is expected to lead to heat indices above the century
mark on Monday and Tuesday across the middle and lower Mississippi
Valleys. August heat will also be found throughout the Lower Great
Lakes and shift into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast early this
week. Highs here are forecast to reach into the 90s, while heat
indices approach 100 degrees. Meanwhile, a building heat wave is
expected to reach the Pacific Northwest by Tuesday, with much
hotter weather forecast to enter the region by midweek. Excessive
Heat Watches has been issued. Wildfire smoke continues to produce
poor air quality for much of the western U.S. as well. Widespread
Air Quality Alerts and scattered Red Flag Warnings stretch from
the Northwest and Northern Rockies to the High Plains, as well as
throughout parts of central California.

...Northwest heat wave likely to bring temperatures that challenge
daily records from midweek into the weekend...

...Overview...

Most guidance maintains good agreement and continuity for the
overall pattern through the period. Expect upper level ridges from
the eastern Pacific and southern Rockies/High Plains to
consolidate over the Great Basin and central Rockies by Friday
with a strong ridge remaining in place through the weekend.
Downstream, the axis of a mean upper trough (with embedded
shortwaves) will move from the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes
and Northeast. The strong ridging over the West should support a
heat wave that affects the Northwest and parts of the Great
Basin/California with temperatures over some areas likely to
approach or reach daily records for highs/warm lows. Across the
eastern third of the country, associated fronts and leading
warm/moist flow will produce areas of rain and thunderstorms, some
locally heavy at times, while a tropical wave could bring enhanced
precipitation to parts of Florida by next weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Main issues to note are regarding details around individual
shortwaves through the mean troughing over the Great Lakes and the
Northeast. The GFS and CMC become much faster with the trough axis
than a lot of the guidance next Sunday and beyond. The ECMWF is
slower but also more in line with the ensemble means. Out west,
there remains spread and variability for how quickly an incoming
shortwave to the Northwest erodes the ridge late period, with
again, the GFS on the fast side of the envelope. The WPC blend
consisted of a mix of the deterministic runs for the first half of
the period, leaning more heavily on the ECMWF and the ensemble
means late period for the reasons outlined above. This approach
also maintained good continuity with the previous shift.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The Northwest heat wave should produce several days with max/min
temperatures of 10-20F above normal over Washington/Oregon and
some surrounding areas from Thursday through the weekend.
Anomalies for daytime highs should be the greatest around
Thursday-Friday when a few locations could reach 20-25F above
normal. A decent number of locations across the Northwest and into
northern California/Nevada may see readings approach if not
reach/exceed daily records for highs and warm lows over multiple
days. By Sunday and Monday the highs may moderate somewhat as the
ridge gets eroded by incoming shortwave energy, but morning lows
should remain quite warm. Currently expect this heat wave to be
less extreme than the all-time record event in late June but it
may still be the second most significant of the summer for the
Portland-Seattle corridor.

Shortwaves and moisture to the south of the consolidating upper
ridge over the Great Basin/central Rockies will likely promote an
increase of coverage and rainfall amounts in monsoon activity over
the Four Corners states and parts of the Southwest. There is still
some uncertainty in the relative strength of the shortwaves and
ridge to the north so the precise coverage/intensity of rain will
take additional time to resolve. High temperatures over the
southern Rockies/Southwest should be within a few degrees on
either side of normal Wednesday followed by the warmer areas
trending to modestly below normal by late week/weekend.

A weakening Plains into Great Lakes front and then a trailing
front that reaches the East Coast and south-central U.S. by next
weekend will focus areas of showers and thunderstorms over the
eastern third to half of the lower 48 during the period. Some
areas of locally moderate to heavy rain are likely but details on
exactly where remain very uncertain. Current indications suggest
some potential from the Upper Ohio Valley and portions of the
Appalachians to areas along the East Coast. The southern
Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas and areas to the west could see increasing
potential for training/repeat activity later in the weekend as the
front decelerates. Farther ahead of the fronts, daily scattered
storm chances will also exist over the East and Deep South within
a warm and moist environment. Florida should see rainfall increase
Friday into the weekend due to a tropical wave/surface low and
some upper level energy moving into the area from the
Bahamas/Cuba. The National Hurricane Center is currently
monitoring this system for potential tropical development in the
next few days.

Very warm to hot conditions should prevail to the east and south
of the two cold fronts. The highest anomalies of plus 10-15F are
most likely for morning lows from the Great Lakes into the
Northeast Thursday-Friday with a few daily records possible. Plus
5-10F anomalies will be more common for highs but there may be a
few isolated higher readings over the Northeast later in the week.
The combined heat and humidity could support heat index values
into at least the low 100s for many lower elevations across the
southern half to two-thirds of the central/eastern U.S.. Highest
heat index values are likely over the lower half of the
Mississippi Valley and vicinity along with areas along and inland
from the Gulf Coast. The cold front reaching the East toward the
end of the week will likely bring high temperatures down to within
a few degrees on either side of normal over the central U.S. by
Friday and farther east by the weekend. This will suppress 100F+
heat indices more toward the Gulf Coast region by Sunday.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CDT Mon Aug 09 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low will traverse the northern Rockies as it moves
east throughout the day. At the surface, a cold front will intensify
as it moves through Montana and Wyoming in the morning. Strong
westerly winds will accompany the front before gradually weakening
through the day. In the wake of the front, a cooler and drier
airmass is forecast to become established over the Intermountain
west. Surface humidity values will remain low, around 20%. While
winds will be strong initially, as they decrease through the day
favorable overlap with dry surface conditions and receptive fuels
conditions is expected to be negligible. No areas will be maintained
as fire weather threats will be limited to sparsely vegetated areas
of southern Wyoming.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 AM CDT Mon Aug 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime will remain in places across the
northern Rockies/Plains through the forecast period as an upper low
moves slowly to the east. A second trough/low over central Canada
will move to the south and east slowing as it approaches the
international border. In response to the secondary low, a cold front
across the Plains will stall. Gusty northwest winds behind the front
are expected to support elevated fire weather conditions across
southern Montana and portions of western south Dakota.

...Southern Montana and western South Dakota...
Along the southern portion of the slow moving upper low, mid-level
westerly flow in excess of 40 kts will overspread much of Montana
and the Dakotas. Westerly surface winds of 15-20 mph will likely
develop through the afternoon. The dry downslope winds and deep
mixing will favor low surface humidity values of 25-30%. The
resulting overlap of dry and windy conditions will support elevated
to locally critical fire weather conditions where fuels are dry.

Farther south across Wyoming, the stronger upper level winds will be
displaced farther to the north and east. This should result in
weaker surface winds across much of the state. However, periodic
winds of 15-20 mph may occur through the day supporting locally
elevated condition within the dry airmass across southern portions
of the state. The greatest overlap of dry and breezy conditions
should develop within regions of sparse vegetation negating any
large fire weather risk.

...Heavy rain and severe storms possible in the Midwest and Great
Lakes through Tuesday; severe weather returns to the Northern
Plains today...

...Above average temperatures and oppressive humidity found across
the central U.S., shifting into the Northeast by Tuesday...

...Poor air quality due to wildfire smoke found throughout parts
of the High Plains and West...

A wave of low pressure tracking through the Northern Plains will
become the main driver in producing strong-to-severe storms in the
Dakotas later today. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Slight Risk in the portions of the eastern Dakotas and northwest
Minnesota. Farther east, a second wave of low pressure tracking
along a warm front in the Midwest is set to generate its own area
of showers and thunderstorms, some of which could be severe. Heavy
rainfall rates are also likely within the strongest storms,
especially in the Great Lakes where there is ample atmospheric
moisture available. By Tuesday, the Northern Plains system heads
north into south central Canada, but the warm sector becomes
positioned across the Midwest and Great Lakes. The storm's
accompanying cold front will act as a trigger for severe
thunderstorms Tuesday afternoon and evening with damaging winds
and large hail possible. By Tuesday night, including Monday
night's rainfall, parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes could
receive 2-3 inches of rainfall with higher amounts in more
localized areas.

Areas of showers and thunderstorms are also likely to transpire in
other regions as well through the first half of the work-week. The
Ohio and Tennessee Valleys can expect daily episodes of
thunderstorms, some of which could become severe and/or cause
flash flooding. Daily hit-or-miss showers and storms will also be
possible in parts of the Southeast both Monday and Tuesday. Also,
spotty showers and storms are on tap from the Mid-Atlantic to the
Northeast on Tuesday. In the Southwest, monsoonal moisture arrives
with scattered showers and thunderstorms potentially causing areas
of flash flooding. The South-Central and Northwestern U.S. can
expect mostly dry conditions into mid-week.

Meanwhile, the dog days of summer have arrived as sultry
conditions engulf much of the country. Above average temperatures
are focused in the Great Plains and Upper Midwest with triple
digit temperatures, as well as some daily record high temps,
possible in the central and southern High Plains. The combination
of abnormally hot temperatures and oppressive humidity is expected
to cause heat indices to exceed the century mark on Monday and
Tuesday across the middle and lower Mississippi Valleys. Stifling
heat will also be found across the Lower Great Lakes, the
Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast the first half of the week. High temps
are forecast to reach into the 90s, while heat indices approach
100 degrees. Farther west, a building heat wave is expected to
reach the Pacific Northwest by Tuesday with considerably hotter
weather forecast to overtake the region by midweek. Excessive Heat
Watches have been issued in advance of this impending heat wave.
Last but certainly not least, wildfire smoke continues to produce
poor air quality for much of the western U.S.. Numerous Air
Quality Alerts and scattered Red Flag Warnings stretch from the
Northwest and central California to the Rockies and the High
Plains.

No changes. Previous discussion follows.

..Bentley.. 08/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1242 AM CDT Wed Aug 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough off the northern California coast is forecast
to begin moving onshore over the next 24 hours. As this occurs, lift
ahead of the wave will support thunderstorm chances east of the OR
Cascades as well as increasing winds near the surface. Although some
precipitation has fallen over OR and adjacent areas of CA, NV, and
ID, fuels generally remain dry and will support another day of fire
weather concerns.

...Eastern Oregon...
PWAT values have decreased over the past 24 hours across the Pacific
Northwest, but cooler temperatures aloft (noted in 00z soundings)
and lingering mid-level moisture are maintaining instability east of
the Cascades. Lift will begin overspreading the region by the late
afternoon, coincident with peak diurnal heating/boundary-layer
mixing. A mix of wet/dry thunderstorms is likely, and will pose a
fire weather concern given the generally dry fuels (outside of where
heavier rain has fallen over the past 24 hours). Thunderstorms are
expected into parts of ID and NV as well, but improving fuel
conditions over these areas precludes an expansion.

...Northern Sierra....
Boundary-layer winds are forecast to increase over northern CA,
western NV, and far southern OR as the main trough begins to move
onshore this afternoon. Although backing winds in the lowest 1-2 km
may limit the propensity of stronger gusts, sustained winds near 15
mph gusting to 20-25 mph are probable. A combination of poor
moisture flux into the region and some degree of downslope
warming/drying will yield RH values in the single digits to low
teens. Recent fuel analyses continue to show very dry fuels in
place, and active fire behavior over the past 24 hours supports this
idea. While elevated fire weather conditions are possible as far
southeast as central NV, the Elevated risk area is maintained over
the northern Sierra and adjacent areas of NV/OR where fuels are more
receptive.

FXUS21 KWNC 041816
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 04 2021

SYNOPSIS: There continues to be relatively good multi-model agreement
indicating positive mid-level height anomalies for the northeastern lower 48
during week-2, supporting increased chances for excessive heat across the
region most likely at the beginning of week-2. Enhanced moisture levels across
parts of the eastern contiguous U.S. at the beginning of the period may
support
heat index values exceeding 90 Deg F across parts of New England and the
Appalachians and 100 Deg F across portions of the Mid-Atlantic at the
beginning
of the period. The mid-level pattern is anticipated to generally weaken
throughout week-2, lowering chances for excessive heat from the middle to end
of the period. Some models indicate the possibility of mid-level high pressure
lingering across parts of the Northwest from the end of week-1 into the start
of week-2. This pattern increases the likelihood for maximum temperatures to
reach excessive heat criteria at the beginning of the period. Frontal activity
near or along the South Coast of Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle may bring
episodes of wet weather to these regions, although precipitation totals are
not
anticipated to reach hazards criteria.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat across parts of the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic,
Central Appalachians, and Great Lakes, Thu-Fri, Aug 12-13.

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of the northeastern CONUS, Thu-Sat,
Aug 12-14.

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of the Pacific Northwest, Thu-Fri,
Aug 12-13.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY AUGUST 07 - WEDNESDAY AUGUST 11:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vj5emNC9WuPuTXQa8Q2aSJxelspWurOw017Jj2ES_2z6frzkdPy68rZgFqGz19d32QyEMgUb$

FOR THURSDAY AUGUST 12 - WEDNESDAY AUGUST 18: There continues to be relatively
good agreement in the 0Z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensemble means indicating
positive mid-level height anomalies over the northwestern and northeastern
lower 48 during week-2, as well as the central northern tier of the CONUS.
Large 500-hPa anomalies over the northeastern CONUS combined with enhanced
moisture across parts of the eastern CONUS favored by the models at the
beginning of the period increases the likelihood for excessive heat across the
region. A slight risk of excessive heat is posted for parts of the
northeastern
CONUS, Aug 12 to 14, where the calibrated GEFS and ECMWF heat tools indicate
at
least a 20% chance of heat index values exceeding the 85th percentile. A
moderate risk of excessive heat is posted for parts of the Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic, Central Appalachians, and Great Lakes, Aug 12 to 13 where the
calibrated GEFS and ECMWF heat tools show at least a 40% chance of heat index
values exceeding the 90th percentile. These heat tools also indicate some of
the moderate risk areas having at least a 20% chance of heat index values
exceeding the 95th percentile. Heat index values may reach or exceed 90 Deg F
across parts of New England, the Great Lakes, and Appalachians, 95 Deg F
across
parts of the Ohio Valley, and triple digits across parts of the Mid-Atlantic.
Of additional concern is the potential for some of the risk areas having
nighttime temperatures in the upper 70s and 80s.



Over the northwestern CONUS, the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means
show the potential for positive 500-hPa height anomalies continuing from the
end of week-1 into the beginning of week-2. The 0Z ECMWF and 0Z daily ensemble
means indicate larger and more widespread mid-level height anomalies across
the
Northwest compared to the 0Z GEFS. The slight risk for excessive heat is
maintained in today's outlook across the Pacific Northwest for Aug 12 to 13,
where the ECMWF (GEFS) reforecast tool shows at least a 40% (30%) chance of
maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 Deg F.  Eastward,
there is better multi-model agreement regarding positive 500-hPa anomalies
over
the North-Central CONUS compared to recent forecasts, but there are
significant
model discrepancies regarding the potential for temperatures reaching
excessive
heat criteria. The GEFS heat tool has a stronger signal for heat than the
ECMWF
for the Upper Mississippi Valley (heat index values exceeding the 90th
percentile). High model uncertainty in both the likelihood and timing of a
possible excessive heat risk precludes an additional area for excessive heat
from being included in today's outlook for the North-Central CONUS but will be
monitored in the upcoming days. Excessive heat may prolong or exacerbate
drought conditions and elevate wildfire risk across this area.



Across the Four Corners region, there continues to be variability within the
models in their depiction of the mid-level ridge placement. As of 11am PDT,
the
National Hurricane Center has a 30% chance for tropical cyclone formation
during the next 5 days off the coast of Southern Mexico. Due to the enhanced
phase of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), there is an increased potential
for tropical cyclone activity in the East Pacific during the period which
could
promote enhanced moisture and enhanced precipitation for the Four Corners
region. The tracks of predicted tropical cyclones have been more favorable for
enhanced moisture flow to the Four Corners in the deterministic GFS than the
deterministic ECMWF, which is also seen in the differences of the
precipitation
reforecast tools. The GEFS reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of
3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile and half an inch
across parts of Arizona during the beginning and middle of week-2, whereas the
ECMWF does not. Despite high model uncertainty regarding the potential for
heavy precipitation across the Southwest, there is still a possibility for
thunderstorm activity and resulting localized flash flooding across the Four
Corners, especially if a tropical cyclone forms in the East Pacific and tracks
closer to Baja California.



The 0Z GEFS and 0Z ECMWF indicate the possibility of frontal activity along or
near the South Coast of Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle from the beginning to
middle of the period. This feature, in addition to potentially southerly moist
flow associated with surface high pressure over the Gulf of Alaska, may
support
episodes of enhanced precipitation across parts of the southeastern Mainland
and the Alaska Panhandle from the beginning to middle of week-2. Daily GEFS,
ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means show the potential for some days having
precipitation across the South Coast of Alaska and Alaska Panhandle. However,
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools are not supportive of 3-day precipitation
totals reaching hazardous thresholds. Therefore, a related precipitation
hazard
is not posted at this time.

Extended Forecast Discussion

236 PM EDT Wed Aug 4 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Aug 7 2021 - 12Z Wed Aug 11 2021

18Z Update: With the quasi-zonal flow pattern becoming established
over the north-central U.S. and southern Canada, more noteworthy
model differences are becoming apparent compared to the recent
amplified pattern.  The trough entering the Pacific Northwest this
weekend is now in better agreement with the arrival of the 12Z
ECMWF, compared to the much slower and amplified 00Z ECMWF.  By
the middle of the week, the 12Z CMC becomes out of phase by having
a ridge over the Midwest states, whereas the model consensus
favors a building trough over this region.  More of the ensemble
means were incorporated for the middle of next week to account for
the increasing spread in the deterministic guidance.  Temperatures
for the most part should be near to above average for the majority
of the nation, with the only exception being across the Pacific
Northwest early in the forecast period with the upper level trough
moving through.  The previous forecast discussion is appended
below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Troughing will persist in the West and along the Canadian border
next week as upper ridging builds into the East and South. This
favors a drier pattern than in recent weeks with rainfall focused
mostly over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes as systems converge in
the center of the continent and lift northeastward. Mid-summer
heat will return with a vengeance by the middle of next week in
much of the East.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the deterministic models largely paired
well with the ensembles except that the GFS runs were largely
quicker than the consensus. Though there has been a several day
trend of a quicker pace, and the quasi-zonal pattern may support
it, did not favor this quicker solution as many GEFS members were
as slow as the ECMWF (on the slowest end) while the UKMET/Canadian
fell in the middle. Opted to rely more on the ensembles means by
the end of the period in order to compensate for uncertainty in
timing by next Tue/Wed in the west-to-east flow. Favored a bit
higher heights over the Southeast per the GFS/GEFS just over the
5940m threshold.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Rainfall will expand across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes this
weekend ahead of a shortwave trough south of a main low over
BC/Alberta. Some rainfall could be locally heavy over MN into
WI/MI. As the system lifts into southern Ontario/Quebec, rainfall
coverage and intensity may wane a bit before perhaps picking up
again next Tue/Wed along the tail-end of the boundary again over
the Corn Belt into the Great Lakes. In the Southwest, some monsoon
rains may flare up over southeastern AZ as some moisture rides up
the west side of mainland Mexico.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest behind the lead cold front this weekend with a
slow moderation next week. Ahead of this lead cold front,
temperatures will be 5 to 12 degrees above normal over the Plains
this weekend and expanding to the East Coast next week. A ridge
over the Southeast sets up by Sunday and looks to persist well
into next week bringing an extended heat wave over the Lower
Mississippi Valley eastward to the Mid-Atlantic. Temperatures will
climb into the 90s with heat indices into the low 100s as dew
points rise into the 60s and low 70s.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed August 04 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 10 - 14 2021

A major summertime pattern change is forecast to be well underway prior to the
start of this period as 500-hPa ridging replaces an amplified trough over
eastern North America. The ensemble means depict 500-hPa height anomalies of
+30 to +90 meters from the Mississippi Valley to the East Coast during the 6-
10
day period. These large anomalies are expected to result in the hottest
temperatures this summer across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast where above
normal temperatures are strongly favored. This heat wave is expected to peak
during the early part of next week. Although the longwave pattern also
supports
above normal temperatures farther to the south across the Lower Mississippi
Valley and Southeast, probabilities are lower due in part to high soil
moisture
(above the 70th percentile). An amplified ridge, initially centered over the
Northeast Pacific, is forecast to expand eastward next week after a shortwave
trough progresses eastward. The increase in 500-hPa heights favors above
normal
temperatures across much of the western CONUS, including the Northern Rockies
where a brief period of below normal temperatures is forecast to time off.

A shortwave trough is forecast to eject from the north-central CONUS early in
the period, elevating probabilities of near to above normal precipitation
across the eastern Corn Belt, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic. Recent
deterministic
GFS model runs and many of its ensemble members continue to feature a tropical
cyclone tracking northwest near the Baja Peninsula next week which would
promote a suge of enhanced moisture north from the Gulf of California into the
Southwest. Based on good continuity with the GFS model and support from the
deterministic 0Z Canadian model, an increase in monsoonal moisture is
anticipated for the Southwest later next week resulting in elevated
probabilities for above normal precipitation. Elsewhere, across the CONUS, the
expanding subtropical ridge elevates probabilities of below normal
precipitation.

A dipole of below (above) normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over Mainland
Alaska (Gulf of Alaska) during the 6-10 day period. Below normal temperatures
are likely to accompany the below normal 500-hPa heights throughout Mainland
Alaska, while above normal temperatures are slightly favored for the southern
Alaska Panhandle. Probabilities of above normal precipitation remain slightly
elevated for most of Alaska due to the trough aloft.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 35% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement on the longwave pattern and temperature tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 12 - 18 2021

An expansive subtropical ridge is forecast to become established over the
CONUS
by week-2 with the ensemble means depicting 500-hPa height departures of more
than +30 meters along and north of the 40th parallel. This longwave pattern
favors above normal temperatures for a majority of the CONUS with the largest
probabilities (more than 50 to 60 percent) coinciding with where the most
anomalous 500-hPa heights are forecast. Below normal temperatures are slightly
favored for the Rio Grande Valley and parts of the Southwest based on
increasing chances of above normal precipitation during week-2 along with
higher soil moisture.

Due to the large-scale ridging and associated above normal 500-hPa heights, a
relatively dry pattern is expected for much of the lower 48. The most likely
area for above normal precipitation, although only slightly favored, exists
across the Mid-Atlantic along with parts of the Northeast and Ohio Valley.
These areas are forecast to be in a favorable region of northwest flow aloft
which could promote periods of convection. The largest uncertainty in the
week-2 outlook is how much monsoonal rainfall occurs across the Southwest as
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools continue to differ. Since a northward
surge
of enhanced moisture from the Gulf of California is favored later next week,
elevated probabilities of above normal precipitation are introduced to the
Southwest. This favored area of above normal precipitation also includes the
Rio Grande Valley where an easterly wave may eventually track west from the
Gulf of Mexico. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is forecast to provide a
favorable large-scale environment for tropical cyclone development across the
East Pacific and Atlantic basins during early to mid-August.

The Canadian and ECMWF ensemble means depict an increase in 500-hPa heights
across the Aleutians and southwestern Mainland Alaska compared to the 6-10 day
period, which is forecast to result in a moderating trend in temperatures,
especially for southern Mainland Alaska, later in week-2. In addition, the
spatial coverage with elevated probabilities of above normal precipitation
decreased across Mainland Alaska compared to previous days.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 35% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the temperature tools offset by large model differences on
precipitation across the Southwest and limited predictability on convective
rainfall at this time range.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Heavy rain and scattered flash flooding possible tonight across
southeastern New England, the southern Rockies, and the Florida
Big Bend region...

...Dangerous heat found across the Desert Southwest and Interior
Pacific Northwest through Thursday...

A mid- to upper-level ridge building from the Southwest into the
Pacific Northwest will continue to spread drier conditions across
interior sections of the West Coast while shifting most of the
monsoonal showers farther eastward from the central and southern
Rockies into the High Plains. Locally heavy rain is possible this
evening over the southern Rockies/High Plains before diminishing
by Thursday. Scattered flash flooding will be a particular concern
near burn scars. Meanwhile, the drying trend brought by the
building ridge will lead to above average temperatures across the
Desert Southwest northward to the interior Pacific Northwest. High
temperatures in the 110s will be common in the Desert Southwest
for the next couple of days while upper 90s to 100 degrees are
forecast for the interior Pacific Northwest this afternoon. As a
result, Excessive Heat Warnings are in effect for the Desert
Southwest through Thursday evening while Heat Advisories are in
effect for this afternoon across the interior Pacific Northwest.
In addition, fire weather danger is forecast to increase over the
Great Basin into Thursday. A system moving east from the Pacific
will begin to bring cooler air into the Pacific Northwest on
Thursday together with a round of rain/thunderstorms eastward into
the northern Rockies. The rain/storms are expected to continue
across the northern Rockies into early Friday as the heat spreads
further east into the northern/central Plains and upper Midwest,
where widespread high temperatures are forecast to reach into the
upper-80s and 90s by Friday.

Elsewhere, a frontal boundary is forecast to remain nearly
stationary near the Gulf Coast as well as along and just off the
East Coast through the end of the week. An axis of heavy rain is
forecast to extend along the boundary and associated waves of low
pressure. The heaviest rainfall should stay just off the coast;
however, a modest influx of moisture is expected to enter
southeastern New England tonight and could produce around 1-2
inches of rainfall. This region has experienced a very wet summer
thus far, therefore isolated to scattered flash flooding is
possible from eastern Connecticut to coastal Maine. Some heavy
rainfall is also possible across northern Florida and the Big Bend
region, as well as across southern Texas for the next couple of
days.

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA...

Expanded the critical area farther north into southeast Oregon where
winds of 20 to 25 mph and relative humidity in the single digits
appears likely. Otherwise, expanded the IsoDryT farther west across
Oregon and northern California. Farther west expansion may be needed
in later outlooks based on 12Z HREF guidance and forecast soundings.
Some convection may be possible as far west as the Coast Range in
Oregon during the morning hours.

..Bentley.. 08/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Wed Aug 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
A cold front attendant to the passage of an upper-level trough will
increase fire weather concerns Thursday afternoon as winds increase
in the lee of the Sierra and thunderstorms develop across the
Pacific Northwest. The timing of the front is currently forecast to
coincide with peak diurnal heating, which will augment the potential
for elevated to critical fire weather conditions.

...Northwest Nevada...
Recent guidance shows reasonably good agreement in the timing and
progression of the cold front across northeast CA into NV Thursday
afternoon. While southerly winds ahead of the front are expected to
increase to around 15 mph, post-frontal westerly flow will likely
see sustained winds near 20 mph (gusting to 25-30 mph) based on
bias-corrected ensemble means. The driest/windiest conditions are
expected across northwest NV, where downslope warming/drying in the
lee of the Sierra will foster RH reductions well into the single
digits, and sustained 20+ mph winds are most likely. Elevated to
critical fire weather conditions are probable across much of central
NV, but ERC values are well below seasonal normal due to recent
rainfall. Further north across central OR, breezy westerly winds are
expected behind the cold front, but RH reductions will likely be
muted due to cloud cover. However, increasing winds may impact any
holdover fires from recent rounds of thunderstorms.

...Pacific Northwest...
Cooling temperatures aloft and lingering mid-level moisture will
support another day of modest instability and thunderstorm chances.
Convection will likely develop along and ahead of the cold front,
though convective coverage is somewhat uncertain. Forecast soundings
suggest that a transition from mostly wet storms over the Cascades
to increasingly dry storms across eastern WA/OR is probable as
boundary-layer mixing increases with eastward extent. Strong to
severe outflow winds are possible from any thunderstorm across
eastern OR to southeast WA (see the Day 2 Convective Outlook for
details). While the western extent of the dry-thunderstorm risk is
somewhat uncertain, fuels across the region generally remain dry and
will support a lightning-driven fire weather concern.

Valid 12Z Sat Aug 07 2021 - 12Z Wed Aug 11 2021

18Z Update: With the quasi-zonal flow pattern becoming established
over the north-central U.S. and southern Canada, more noteworthy
model differences are becoming apparent compared to the recent
amplified pattern.  The trough entering the Pacific Northwest this
weekend is now in better agreement with the arrival of the 12Z
ECMWF, compared to the much slower and amplified 00Z ECMWF.  By
the middle of the week, the 12Z CMC becomes out of phase by having
a ridge over the Midwest states, whereas the model consensus
favors a building trough over this region.  More of the ensemble
means were incorporated for the middle of next week to account for
the increasing spread in the deterministic guidance.  Temperatures
for the most part should be near to above average for the majority
of the nation, with the only exception being across the Pacific
Northwest early in the forecast period with the upper level trough
moving through.  The previous forecast discussion is appended
below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Troughing will persist in the West and along the Canadian border
next week as upper ridging builds into the East and South. This
favors a drier pattern than in recent weeks with rainfall focused
mostly over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes as systems converge in
the center of the continent and lift northeastward. Mid-summer
heat will return with a vengeance by the middle of next week in
much of the East.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the deterministic models largely paired
well with the ensembles except that the GFS runs were largely
quicker than the consensus. Though there has been a several day
trend of a quicker pace, and the quasi-zonal pattern may support
it, did not favor this quicker solution as many GEFS members were
as slow as the ECMWF (on the slowest end) while the UKMET/Canadian
fell in the middle. Opted to rely more on the ensembles means by
the end of the period in order to compensate for uncertainty in
timing by next Tue/Wed in the west-to-east flow. Favored a bit
higher heights over the Southeast per the GFS/GEFS just over the
5940m threshold.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Rainfall will expand across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes this
weekend ahead of a shortwave trough south of a main low over
BC/Alberta. Some rainfall could be locally heavy over MN into
WI/MI. As the system lifts into southern Ontario/Quebec, rainfall
coverage and intensity may wane a bit before perhaps picking up
again next Tue/Wed along the tail-end of the boundary again over
the Corn Belt into the Great Lakes. In the Southwest, some monsoon
rains may flare up over southeastern AZ as some moisture rides up
the west side of mainland Mexico.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest behind the lead cold front this weekend with a
slow moderation next week. Ahead of this lead cold front,
temperatures will be 5 to 12 degrees above normal over the Plains
this weekend and expanding to the East Coast next week. A ridge
over the Southeast sets up by Sunday and looks to persist well
into next week bringing an extended heat wave over the Lower
Mississippi Valley eastward to the Mid-Atlantic. Temperatures will
climb into the 90s with heat indices into the low 100s as dew
points rise into the 60s and low 70s.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0111 AM CDT Thu Aug 05 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level wave off the northern California coast will move
onshore over the next 24 hours, resulting in thunderstorm chances
across the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies as well as
wind-driven fire weather concerns across the northwestern Great
Basin and lee of the Cascades. Despite widely scattered
precipitation across these regions in recent days, fuels remain very
dry and will support the fire weather threat.

...Northwest Nevada into central OR/WA...
Confidence remains high in elevated to critical fire weather
conditions this afternoon as a deepening surface low and attendant
cold front move through the region in tandem with the upper-level
trough. Several factors are expected to phase well today and
contribute to the wind/RH-driven fire weather threat, including: an
abrupt wind shift from southerly to westerly associated with the
cold frontal passage, strengthening surface pressure gradient and
boundary-layer winds, and downslope warming/drying off the northern
Sierra. The result will be 20-25 mph sustained winds gusting to
30-35 mph coincident with RH values in the single digits to low
teens. Confidence in these conditions is highest across northwest NV
and southeast OR, but critical wind/RH combinations may occur in
adjacent areas of CA and further east/southeast into southwest ID
and central NV (though fuels here exhibit below-normal ERC values
per recent analyses).

Further north into the Pacific Northwest, the passage of the cold
front and/or increasing gap winds are expected to bring 15-25 mph
westerly winds this afternoon along and east of the Cascades. RH
reductions may be muted due to cloud cover, but the increasing winds
may impact holdover fires from recent lightning activity.

...Pacific Northwest - Dry Lightning...
Recent GOES PWAT estimates show a swath of lingering moisture in
place across the Pacific Northwest. This moisture, combined with
cooling temperatures aloft associated with the upper-level wave,
will support sufficient instability for thunderstorms this
afternoon. Thunderstorms are possible as far west as the south OR
coast this morning with increasing chances to the east/northeast
through the day. Latest ensemble guidance and forecast soundings
suggest the highest potential for dry thunderstorms will reside
across central OR/WA east of the Cascades where deep boundary-layer
mixing, instability, and lift will most favorably overlap.
Convective coverage will likely increase across ID and western MT
late this afternoon and evening, but this region will see the
highest probability for wetting rainfall and has seen swaths of
0.25+ inches of rain in recent days. However, a few dry strikes are
possible and may pose a fire weather concern for locations that
observed low rainfall amounts. Thunderstorms across the region will
also pose a risk of strong to severe outflow winds (see the latest
Day 1 Convective Outlook for details).

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
253 AM EDT Thu Aug 05 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Aug 08 2021 - 12Z Thu Aug 12 2021

...Overview...

Troughing in the West will move into the central CONUS around the
middle of next week as heights build over much of the area in
another push of summertime heat. Rainfall will largely focus along
the Canadian border (Northern Rockies Sunday, then the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys) in an
overall drier pattern than in recent weeks. Uncertain flow
evolution out of the Pacific may squeeze some ridging into the
Pacific Northwest late in the period.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the deterministic models largely paired
well with the ensembles, but this represented a change out of the
Pacific toward more ridging into the Pacific Northwest around
midweek next week rather than persistent, albeit weak, troughing.
Though this may be a relatively small shift eastward, this also
nudged the downstream trough eastward to the Great Lakes rather
than the Plains or Upper Midwest. The GFS/ECMWF were stronger with
this troughing than earlier runs and the ensemble means, but since
this change was manifested in just the recent 12Z cycle, opted to
rely mostly on the ensemble means in case an adjustment back
emerges. This was a good midpoint between continuity and the more
aggressive GFS/ECMWF. Otherwise, still expect heights build over
much of the CONUS midweek next week and beyond in line with the
CPC day 6-10 forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Rainfall will expand across the Corn Belt and Great Lakes Sunday
as a shortwave lifts toward Wisconsin. Some rainfall could be
locally heavy as this system has trended more defined in recent
runs. As the system lifts into southern Ontario/Quebec, rainfall
coverage and intensity may wane a bit before perhaps picking up
again next Tue-Thu along the tail-end of the lead boundary and in
advance of another Canadian front, in addition to afternoon
convection over the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies behind the lead cold front
this weekend into Monday with a moderation thereafter. Ahead of
this cold front, temperatures will be 5 to 12 degrees above normal
over the Plains Sun-Mon and expanding to the East Coast Mon-Thu. A
ridge over the Southeast Monday will maintain temperatures into
the 90s with heat indices into the low 100s as dew points rise
into the 60s and low 70s. Temperatures into the 80s and 90s will
reach into the Northeast/ Mid-Atlantic ahead of the Great Lakes
trough which is about 5-10 degrees above normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CDT Thu Aug 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level wave currently off the northern California coast is
forecast to progress over northern/central Rockies through the day
Friday. The resulting lee troughing will drive an increase in
pressure-gradient winds across the central Plains and parts of the
eastern Great Basin that may foster elevated to critical wind/RH
combinations. Additionally, isolated dry thunderstorms will be
possible along the central Rockies.

...Great Basin and central High Plains...
Confidence is reasonably high that a deepening lee trough over the
northern to central High Plains will strengthening winds across the
central High Plains and into the eastern Great Basin. Sustained
winds between 15-25 mph appear likely for both regions, and an
antecedent dry airmass in place over the Great Basin and meager
moisture return over the Plains will support RH reductions into the
teens and 20s. While elevated (to locally critical) wind/RH
combinations are likely, ERC values below seasonal normal will limit
the fire weather risk. Fuel status will be monitored over the next
24 hours to determine if highlights are needed.

...Central Rockies - Dry Thunderstorms...
Dry thunderstorms are probable Friday afternoon from southern WY
into central CO, and may occur as far south as northern NM. A
combination of cooling temperatures aloft and meager mid-level
moisture (PWAT values near 0.6 inches) atop a dry, well-mixed
boundary layer suggests mostly dry thunderstorms are likely. Lift
ahead of the main trough axis will likely support at least isolated
thunderstorm coverage by the mid to late afternoon hours. Despite
the favorable thermodynamic conditions, fuels across the region are
generally unreceptive and will temper the dry lightning threat to
some degree.

...Heavy rain and scattered flash flooding possible this morning
across southeastern New England, and across parts of northern
Florida today...

...Excessive heat across the Desert Southwest as hot and dry
conditions with fire weather threat and poor air quality across
the interior Northwest...

A mid- to upper-level ridge extending northward into the Pacific
Northwest will continue to sustain the hot and and dry conditions
one more day across interior western U.S. before a noticeable
change in the weather pattern arrives.  High temperatures in the
110s will be common in the Desert Southwest for the next couple of
days while upper 90s are forecast for the interior Pacific
Northwest this afternoon. As a result, Excessive Heat Warnings are
in effect for the Desert Southwest. In addition, fire weather
danger is forecast to be most prominent today over the Great
Basin.

Meanwhile, an upper-level low off the coast of California today is
forecast to move onshore and head towards the northern Rockies on
Friday.  This will signal the beginning of a noticeable change in
the general weather pattern across the western U.S., bringing
cooler air into the Pacific Northwest during the next couple of
days, together with a round of rain/thunderstorms pushing across
the Intermountain region into the northern Rockies. The
rain/storms are expected to continue spread eastward across the
northern Plains on Friday as a complex low pressure system is
forecast to develop over the northern High Plains.  Heat is
expected to build across the central High Plains today and
especially on Friday where high temperatures are forecast to reach
into the upper-90s.

Elsewhere, a frontal boundary is forecast to remain nearly
stationary near the Gulf Coast as well as along and just off the
East Coast through the end of the week. An axis of heavy rain is
forecast to extend along the boundary and associated waves of low
pressure. The heaviest rainfall should stay just off the coast;
however, a modest influx of moisture is expected to enter
southeastern New England tonight and could produce around 1-2
inches of rainfall. Much of this region (besides Cape Cod) has
experienced a very wet summer thus far, therefore isolated to
scattered flash flooding is possible from eastern Connecticut to
coastal Maine. Some heavy rainfall is also possible across
northern Florida and the Big Bend region, as well as across
southern Texas for the next couple of days.

A mid- to upper-level ridge extending northward into the Pacific
Northwest will continue to sustain the hot and dry conditions for
one more day across the interior western U.S. before a noticeable
change in the weather pattern arrives.  Although temperatures this
afternoon will be not as hot as yesterday, this latest dry spell
will once again increase the threat of wildfires especially across
the Great Basin.  In addition, much of the interior Northwest into
the northern High Plains will be enveloped by poor air quality
today.  Meanwhile, Excessive Heat Warnings remain in effect for
the Desert Southwest where another day of high temperatures in the
110s is expected before gradual moderation sets in on Friday.

An upper-level low off the coast of California today is forecast
to move onshore and head towards the northern Rockies on Friday.
This system will signal the beginning of a noticeable change in
the general weather pattern across the western U.S., bringing
cooler air into the Pacific Northwest during the next couple of

Intermountain region into the northern Rockies.  The rain/storms
are expected to continue eastward across the northern Plains on
Friday as a complex low pressure system is forecast to develop
over the northern High Plains.  Heat is expected to build ahead of
the complex system across the central High Plains today and
especially on Friday where high temperatures are forecast to reach
into the upper-90s.  Meanwhile, some showers and thunderstorms are
expected to move across the Plains today ahead of a lee trough
under upper-level support.  These rain/storms should gradually
weaken as they move toward the Mississippi Valley on Friday.
However, the northern extent of the rain across the upper Midwest
is forecast to be invigorated by a cold front and a low pressure
wave.  Some heavier rainfall amounts are possible later on Friday
into Saturday as the rain reaches the Great Lakes.

Elsewhere, a frontal boundary remains nearly stationary along/near
the Gulf Coast as well as just off the East Coast.  Some locally
heavy rainfall is expected across southeastern New England this
morning as a low pressure wave develops along the front and moves
across the region.  Some heavy rainfall is also possible across
northern Florida, as well as across southern Texas into Friday.
Fine weather should then return to the Northeast on Friday as the
front edges offshore but the trailing portion of the front is
forecast to push inland across Deep South and the Southeast later
on Friday.  As such, the moderate to heavy rain over northern
Florida will then lift northward across the interior Southeast,
reaching the Carolinas early on Saturday.

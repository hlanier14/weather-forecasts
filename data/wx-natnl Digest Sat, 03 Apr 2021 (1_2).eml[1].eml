Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1124 AM CDT Fri Apr 02 2021

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

The main change this morning was to expand the elevated risk area
across the Plains to better capture recent observed trends. Surface
observations across western IA and southern MN show 15-25 mph winds
with humidity values already falling into the 30s and upper 20s,
much lower than anticipated by most guidance. With only marginal
moisture influx into the region this afternoon, humidity values
should continue to fall into the 20-30% range. Diurnal mixing and
the slow eastward progression of the surface low/trough across the
Dakotas will help maintain breezy conditions through the day. Dry
fine fuels across this region and reports of recent fire activity
further support the expansion. A few locations may experience
periodic critical conditions, but the coverage and duration of these
conditions is too uncertain to warrant a critical risk area.

Further to the west, similar trends are noted across western NE
where morning RH values are lower than anticipated by guidance.
Although winds may diminish through the day, recent RH trends
suggest that the duration of elevated conditions may persist longer
than previously thought, warranting the expansion of the elevated
risk into western NE. All other regions appear to be on track as
outlined in the previous discussion below.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A few dry thunderstorms are possible throughout the day across
central AZ and into western NM. A few lightning strikes have already
been noted across this region associated with an upper-level
disturbance. Both observed and forecast soundings show PWAT values
between 0.4-0.5 inches, suggesting little precipitation and dry
lightning is possible with any storm. However, below average ERC
values across the region indicate that fuels are not overly
receptive, precluding the need for a risk area.

..Moore.. 04/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Fri Apr 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will continue to develop across the West and
central U.S. today. The strongest flow aloft will be displaced to
the north along the and near the Canadian border. With the building
upper-level ridge, a surface high pressure system will maintain its
strength as it moves through the Midwest and into the Mid-South. To
the north, a strong shortwave trough will help to deepen a surface
low in the Canadian Prairies. These two surface features will
promote elevated fire weather conditions across portions of the
Plains and western Florida.

...Northern Plains..
15-20 mph winds with 10-25% RH during the afternoon will be possible
from northern Montana into the Dakotas behind a weak surface
front/pressure trough. Fine fuels continue to dry out in this region
and will support fire spread. Winds aloft will be greater in this
region compared to points southward; however, a weaker surface
pressure gradient will tend to limit the potential critical fire
weather in most locations. Some areas of the High Plains will see
similar conditions, but the duration of these conditions is in doubt
given the weaker winds aloft.

...Southern/Central Plains...
Between the surface trough and the surface high pressure, a zone of
enhance winds in the lowest 2-3 km will develop from the Texas
Panhandle into the Mid-Missouri Valley. Winds of 15-25 mph appear
possible in this region. Guidance differs on how low RH will fall,
especially with eastern extent. In similar situations with a frontal
boundary nearby with surface trajectories generally remaining
continental, the drier guidance tends to perform better. With that
in mind, the elevated area has been expanded north and east. Even
though some areas could see higher RH values in the afternoon, the
strength of the winds and dry fuel conditions will support elevated
risk.

...Western Florida Coast...
Post-frontal wind will remain strong into the afternoon with the
surface high maintaining its strength. 10-20 mph winds will overlap
RH potentially as low as 25-30% in areas near the western coast.
ERCs in this location are nearing the 90th percentile and will
support an elevated fire weather risk.

155 PM EDT Fri Apr 02 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 05 2021 - 12Z Fri Apr 09 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The two primary uncertainties of the forecast involve initial West
Coast/Northwest shortwave energy that may progress through the
western and central U.S. in the form of a closed low, followed by
the specifics of eastern Pacific/western U.S. flow with guidance
showing increasing divergence by late next week.  The leading
system should spread precipitation across the northern half of the
West/Rockies and then onward through a majority of the
central/eastern U.S.. Late week flow details will determine how
much precipitation reaches the Pacific Northwest at that time.
Meanwhile an upper low just offshore New England and Nova Scotia
at the start of the week will drift away only gradually due to a
fairly blocky pattern over the Atlantic and eastern Canada.

The latest round of guidance appear to have a little better
agreement on shortwave energy/likely closed low over the Northwest
by 12z Monday, progressing eastward as a compact closed low into
the Ohio Valley by the end of the week. Some minor
timing/placement differences remain, but at least for the first
half of the week, a general model blend seemed to work well as a
starting point. Thereafter, run to run continuity is fairly poor
on the evolution/characteristics of the low, with low confidence
on specifics, so a bit more lean towards the ensemble means helps
to mitigate these differences. Just given the model trends over
the past run or two of guidance, this resulted in a little
faster/stronger depiction of the closed low as it moves across the
northern U.S. as compared to previous WPC continuity.

Meanwhile, the spread for the eastern Pacific and western U.S.
flow becomes most noticeable by next Thursday-Friday with the 06z
GFS continuing to amplify central Pacific ridging farther west
than most of the other guidance. On the other side of the
envelope, the CMC is the farthest east, with the energy reaching
the West Coast by early Thursday. The 00z ECMWF has been
consistent in a position somewhere in the middle of these two
which is also the closest to the ensemble means (GEFS mean is a
little slower, but not quite as much as its deterministic
counterpart). Therefore, WPCs blend for later in the period
blended more heavily towards the ensemble means as well as the
ECMWF for some added definition and details where necessary.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Early in the week the system moving into the West will bring an
area of rain and high elevation snow mainly over the northern half
of the region.  Coverage and intensity of precipitation should
then increase to the east of the Rockies as the upper system
continues onward and associated low pressure/frontal system evolve
over the central U.S.  Guidance seems to better support an area of
possibly heavy rain north of the surface low/warm front from the
northern Plains into the Upper Midwest on Wednesday into Thursday.
Some areas of locally moderate to heavy rainfall may also be
possible within a broad area ahead of the cold front Wednesday and
after into portions of the East.  A front ahead of this system may
also provide a focus for enhanced rainfall over parts of the
Midwest and Great Lakes earlier in the week.  Meanwhile the
Pacific Northwest may see an increase of moisture during the
latter half of the week but with continued uncertainty as to the
magnitude.

Warm flow ahead of the initial Northwest system will bring well
above normal temperatures to areas from the Southwest and parts of
the Great Basin through the Midwest/Great Lakes early in the week.
 Best potential for plus 20F or greater anomalies for min and/or
max readings will be over the northern and central Plains into
Midwest.  Some daily records are possible from the
Southwest/southern Rockies northeastward.  This warmth will
moderate as it moves eastward ahead of the system that should
reach into the Plains/Mississippi Valley, with late week eastern
U.S. anomalies tending to be in the plus 10-20F range for morning
lows and plus 5-15F for highs.  System passage over the West
should bring temperatures down only to around normal or perhaps
briefly below, with southern areas tending to stay moderately
above climatology.  The Pacific Northwest should be near to
modestly below normal for most of the week.

155 PM EDT Fri Apr 02 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 05 2021 - 12Z Fri Apr 09 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The two primary uncertainties of the forecast involve initial West
Coast/Northwest shortwave energy that may progress through the
western and central U.S. in the form of a closed low, followed by
the specifics of eastern Pacific/western U.S. flow with guidance
showing increasing divergence by late next week.  The leading
system should spread precipitation across the northern half of the
West/Rockies and then onward through a majority of the
central/eastern U.S.. Late week flow details will determine how
much precipitation reaches the Pacific Northwest at that time.
Meanwhile an upper low just offshore New England and Nova Scotia
at the start of the week will drift away only gradually due to a
fairly blocky pattern over the Atlantic and eastern Canada.

The latest round of guidance appear to have a little better
agreement on shortwave energy/likely closed low over the Northwest
by 12z Monday, progressing eastward as a compact closed low into
the Ohio Valley by the end of the week. Some minor
timing/placement differences remain, but at least for the first
half of the week, a general model blend seemed to work well as a
starting point. Thereafter, run to run continuity is fairly poor
on the evolution/characteristics of the low, with low confidence
on specifics, so a bit more lean towards the ensemble means helps
to mitigate these differences. Just given the model trends over
the past run or two of guidance, this resulted in a little
faster/stronger depiction of the closed low as it moves across the
northern U.S. as compared to previous WPC continuity.

Meanwhile, the spread for the eastern Pacific and western U.S.
flow becomes most noticeable by next Thursday-Friday with the 06z
GFS continuing to amplify central Pacific ridging farther west
than most of the other guidance. On the other side of the
envelope, the CMC is the farthest east, with the energy reaching
the West Coast by early Thursday. The 00z ECMWF has been
consistent in a position somewhere in the middle of these two
which is also the closest to the ensemble means (GEFS mean is a
little slower, but not quite as much as its deterministic
counterpart). Therefore, WPCs blend for later in the period

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 02 2021

SYNOPSIS: A low amplitude mid-level height pattern is forecast over most of
the
U.S. in week-2. The most significant feature is mid-level low pressure
predicted across parts of Alaska, and extending into the West Coast of the
lower 48, which favors anomalously cold temperatures across these areas.
Further downstream, weak mid-level high (low) pressure is forecast over the
central (eastern) lower 48. This pattern favors above normal temperatures f=
or
parts of the Plains, and more seasonable weather across the East.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures over interior portions of
Mainland Alaska, including to the western Alaskan coast, Sat, Apr 10.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across Mainland Alaska, Sat-T=
ue,
Apr 10-13.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures over portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Great Basin, and Northern California, Sat-Mon, Apr 10-12.

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures over portions of the Southern
Plains, Sat-Sun, Apr 10-11.

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 10 - FRIDAY APRIL 16: Todays dynamical models are in goo=
d
agreement featuring an amplified trough over Alaska late in week-1 which is
forecast to split, with a secondary trough progressing into the western CON=
US,
while the original trough remains in the vicinity of Alaska. The continued
anomalous troughing over Alaska favors increased northerly mid-level flow. =
In
addition, a mean storm track extending from the Bering Sea southeastward to
the
Gulf of Alaska, combined with surface high pressure in the southern Arctic
Ocean, favors increased cold air advection over the state due to increased
east
to northeasterly surface flow. This synoptic pattern favors increased
confidence in anomalously cold temperatures across much of Alaska during th=
e
first half of the period, potentially delaying river ice breakup across par=
ts
of the state. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a =
40%
chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 10th percentile on Apr 10
over
parts of the Mainland, and including the western coast. For this reason, a
moderate risk of much below normal temperatures is highlighted over the reg=
ion
for this day only, with actual temperatures possibly dropping below -20 deg=
 F
in some areas, and approaching record lows for this time of year. The GEFS =
and
Canadian solutions are more progressive than the ECMWF, which are quicker t=
o
moderate the cold air mass. However, the ECMWF ensemble solution favors the
anomalous cold persisting into the middle of the outlook period with trough=
ing
reamplifying across the state, and elevated probabilities (>20%) for hazard=
ous
cold continuing through Apr 13 across the Mainland, coinciding with the sli=
ght
risk area.



The aforementioned secondary troughing is forecast to shift into the wester=
n
CONUS early in the period, bringing colder temperatures to portions of the
Pacific Coast, and spreading inland to the Rockies by the middle of the
period.
The ECMWF and Canadian ensembles bring this trough axis further inland
compared
to the GEFS ensemble, and would therefore favor a colder outcome across
portions of the West. While the GEFS is not as progressive in moving the
trough
axis inland, it is more amplified with the trough along the coast compared =
to
the ECMWF and Canadian models. The ECMWF reforecast tool continues to depic=
t
elevated probabilities (>20%) for minimum temperatures dropping below the
lowest 15th percentile and freezing over some areas, and the GEFS tool is n=
ow
in better agreement also indicating these elevated probabilities relative t=
o
yesterdays reforecast guidance. Therefore, a slight risk of much below norm=
al
temperatures is now highlighted over portions of the Pacific Northwest, Gre=
at
Basin, and Northern California for Apr 10-12.



Downstream of this trough, weak ridging and associated above normal
temperatures are forecast across the Great Plains. There are some indicatio=
ns,
particularly in the ECMWF guidance, that temperatures over parts of Texas m=
ay
reach hazards thresholds. Specifically, the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts
elevated probabilities over parts of Texas with at least a 40% chance of
temperatures reaching the 90th percentile on Apr 10 and 11. The GEFS is wea=
ker
with the signal, instead showing the highest positive temperature anomalies
late in week-1, but not persisting into week-2. This difference is related =
to
the expansion of the troughing downstream over the eastern CONUS, with the
GEFS
favoring decreasing mid-level heights as far west as the Great Plains, whil=
e
the ECMWF maintains higher positive height anomalies across the Southern
Plains
at the start of the period. Given antecedent dry soils, and moderate to
extreme
drought over many parts of the Southern Plains, a slight risk of much above
normal maximum temperatures is depicted over the region for Apr 10 and 11,
with
the potential for daytime highs well into the 90s (deg F), should the warme=
r
ECMWF guidance verify.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri April 02 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 08 - 12 2021

Many of the GFS ensemble members continue to feature the development of a
negative NAO during early April. Positive 500-hpa height anomalies are
forecast
to shift westward from Greenland to the Davis Strait, while negative anomal=
ies
become established over the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. Based on this evolv=
ing
pattern with lower 500-hPa heights compared to yesterday, near normal
temperatures are favored for the Mid-Atlantic, much of the Southeast, and t=
he
Ohio Valley. For the Mid-Atlantic, a transition from above to below normal
temperatures is expected from days 6 to 10. Farther to the north and closer=
 to
the 500-hPa ridge over eastern Canada, elevated probabilities of above norm=
al
temperatures are forecast across the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes,
and
Northeast. Ridging aloft with above normal 500-hPa heights supports increas=
ed
probabilities of above normal temperatures from the Rockies and Southwest e=
ast
to the Great Plains. Due to an amplified trough near the West Coast, below
normal temperatures are more likely for much of California and the Pacific
Northwest.

The deterministic 6Z GFS and 0Z ECMWF model runs are in good agreement that=
 a
low pressure system slowly tracks eastward from the Ohio Valley to the
Mid-Atlantic from Apr 8 to 10. The 6Z GFS ensemble members also depict this
surface low track and similar timing. Therefore, elevated probabilities of
above normal precipitation are forecast for much of the East Coast. In the
wake
of this low pressure system, below normal precipitation is favored for the
Mississippi Valley and central to southern Great Plains. Increased
probabilities of below normal precipitation are also forecast for the Great
Basin, central to southern Rockies, and Southwest based a predicted storm
track
remaining north of the 40th parallel. Near normal precipitation is favored =
for
parts of the Southwest that are climatologically dry this time of year. As =
a
500-hPa trough shifts eastward from the Northeast Pacific, above normal
precipitation is slightly favored for the Pacific Northwest.

A 500-hPa ridge (trough) forecast over the Aleutians (Mainland Alaska)
strongly
favors below normal temperatures throughout Alaska. Probabilities of above
normal precipitation are slightly elevated for much of Alaska, as a low
pressure system is forecast to track eastward from the Bering Sea.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among temperature and precipitation tools offset by uncertainty o=
n
how fast a low pressure system tracks eastward from the Ohio Valley and a
variable temperature pattern for the eastern CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 10 - 16 2021

Ensemble means remains consistent for the third consecutive day with a
blocking
pattern becoming established over the middle to higher latitudes of eastern
North America. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over central =
and
eastern Canada with negative anomalies to the south across the eastern thir=
d
of
the CONUS. Based upon teleconnections upon the largest positive and negativ=
e
anomaly centers near Hudson Bay and the Mid-Atlantic, respectively, along w=
ith
enhanced northeast surface flow, below normal temperatures are favored for =
the
Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Southeast. To the west of the Appalachians, n=
ear
normal temperatures are more likely across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys.
Ahead of a longwave trough axis, elevated probabilities of above normal
temperatures are forecast for the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Plains, a=
nd
Southwest. Low soil moisture resulted in the largest probabilities (above 6=
0
percent) of above normal temperatures being forecast across western Texas a=
nd
southeast New Mexico. The 0Z ECMWF and 0Z Canadian ensemble means are more
progressive with a longwave trough shifting into the interior West, while t=
he
GFS ensemble means depict this trough axis remaining along the West Coast. =
Due
to good agreement between the 0Z ECMWF and 0Z Canadian ensemble means, thos=
e
model solutions were preferred today in the weighting for the manual 500-hP=
a
height blend. Despite these model differences, the GEFS and ECMWF reforecas=
t
tools are quite similar and depict increased probabilities of below normal
temperatures for California and the Pacific Northwest. The most anomalous c=
old
during week-2 is likely to be located across Alaska due to an amplified tro=
ugh
aloft.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored across the northern and centr=
al
Great Plains, downstream of a 500-hPa trough axis. As this trough shifts
eastward during week-2, below normal precipitation is more likely west of t=
he
Continental Divide (except for areas that are climatologically dry). The lo=
w
pressure system, that is likely to result in widespread precipitation acros=
s
the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic during days 6 to 8, is expected to exit the
East
Coast early in week-2. Therefore, elevated probabilities of below normal
precipitation are forecast for most of the eastern third of the CONUS. Surf=
ace
high pressure, prevailing throughout much of week-2, elevates probabilities=
 of
below normal precipitation for the Great Lakes, Midwest, and Mississippi
Valley. Due to a persistent storm track from the Bering Sea to the northern
Gulf of Alaska, near to above normal precipitation is favored for Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
continued good agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools offs=
et
by uncertainty on how fast a low pressure system exits the East Coast and t=
he
placement of a longwave trough over the western CONUS.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Fri Apr 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

Recent hi-res guidance has trended drier across the Dakotas in the
vicinity of the surface low/trough mentioned in the discussion
below. Guidance has generally been over-forecasting relative
humidity values over the past 24 hours across the Plains, and
dewpoints in the teens are currently overspreading the western
Dakotas. These considerations have increased confidence in reduced
RH values between 15-25%. Winds around 15-20 mph remain likely and
fuels will also remain supportive of fire spread. As such, an
elevated risk area has been introduced.

...Northern Ohio River Valley...
Pressure-gradient winds are forecast to increase well into the 15-20
mph range by tomorrow afternoon across eastern IL into IN and
western OH (where fine fuel moisture is falling to around 10%).
Although guidance suggests dewpoints should increase enough to
maintain above-criteria RH, confidence in sufficient moisture return
remains somewhat low based on current upstream observations and
recent model biases. An elevated risk area may be introduced in
subsequent outlooks if observed trends suggest RH will be lower than
currently anticipated.

...Southeast...
Low humidity is expected across much of the Southeast U.S. with
20-30% likely from southeast AL into the Carolinas and southern PA.
Fine fuels are receptive in some areas, but weak winds under surface
high pressure will mitigate any robust fire weather concerns.

..Moore.. 04/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0229 AM CDT Fri Apr 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
Ridging at upper-levels will continue to be the main feature across
the West and into the Mississippi Valley on Saturday. The surface
high pressure system is expected to weaken in the Southeast with the
pattern in elsewhere being relatively disorganized. A subtle
shortwave trough at upper-levels will move into the northern Rockies
by afternoon. A weak surface low will develop in MT and the western
Dakotas. With the low, a diffuse surface boundary will move east
during the day. Southwesterly winds in portions of central South
Dakota into eastern North Dakota could reach 15-20 mph during the
afternoon. Surface conditions are likely to be dry with most areas
seeing 20-25%, though areas of 15-20% are possible. Given the
overall disorganized surface pressure pattern, conditions are most
likely going to remain elevated on a relatively brief and localized
basis. Elsewhere across the CONUS, weak winds over dry fuels will
keep fire weather concerns low.

321 PM EDT Fri Apr 02 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 05 2021 - 12Z Fri Apr 09 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The two primary uncertainties of the forecast involve initial West
Coast/Northwest shortwave energy that may progress through the
western and central U.S. in the form of a closed low, followed by
the specifics of eastern Pacific/western U.S. flow with guidance
showing increasing divergence by late next week.  The leading
system should spread precipitation across the northern half of the
West/Rockies and then onward through a majority of the
central/eastern U.S.. Late week flow details will determine how
much precipitation reaches the Pacific Northwest at that time.
Meanwhile an upper low just offshore New England and Nova Scotia
at the start of the week will drift away only gradually due to a
fairly blocky pattern over the Atlantic and eastern Canada.

The latest round of guidance appear to have a little better
agreement on shortwave energy/likely closed low over the Northwest
by 12z Monday, progressing eastward as a compact closed low into
the Ohio Valley by the end of the week. Some minor
timing/placement differences remain, but at least for the first
half of the week, a general model blend seemed to work well as a
starting point. Thereafter, run to run continuity is fairly poor
on the evolution/characteristics of the low, with low confidence
on specifics, so a bit more lean towards the ensemble means helps
to mitigate these differences. Just given the model trends over
the past run or two of guidance, this resulted in a little
faster/stronger depiction of the closed low as it moves across the
northern U.S. as compared to previous WPC continuity.

Meanwhile, the spread for the eastern Pacific and western U.S.
flow becomes most noticeable by next Thursday-Friday with the 06z
GFS continuing to amplify central Pacific ridging farther west
than most of the other guidance. On the other side of the
envelope, the CMC is the farthest east, with the energy reaching
the West Coast by early Thursday. The 00z ECMWF has been
consistent in a position somewhere in the middle of these two
which is also the closest to the ensemble means (GEFS mean is a
little slower, but not quite as much as its deterministic
counterpart). Therefore, WPCs blend for later in the period
blended more heavily towards the ensemble means as well as the
ECMWF for some added definition and details where necessary.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Early in the week the system moving into the West will bring an
area of rain and high elevation snow mainly over the northern half
of the region.  Coverage and intensity of precipitation should
then increase to the east of the Rockies as the upper system
continues onward and associated low pressure/frontal system evolve
over the central U.S.  Guidance seems to better support an area of
possibly heavy rain north of the surface low/warm front from the
northern Plains into the Upper Midwest on Wednesday into Thursday.
Some areas of locally moderate to heavy rainfall may also be
possible within a broad area ahead of the cold front Wednesday and
after into portions of the East.  A front ahead of this system may
also provide a focus for enhanced rainfall over parts of the
Midwest and Great Lakes earlier in the week.  Meanwhile the
Pacific Northwest may see an increase of moisture during the
latter half of the week but with continued uncertainty as to the
magnitude.

Warm flow ahead of the initial Northwest system will bring well
above normal temperatures to areas from the Southwest and parts of
the Great Basin through the Midwest/Great Lakes early in the week.
 Best potential for plus 20F or greater anomalies for min and/or
max readings will be over the northern and central Plains into
Midwest.  Some daily records are possible from the
Southwest/southern Rockies northeastward.  This warmth will
moderate as it moves eastward ahead of the system that should
reach into the Plains/Mississippi Valley, with late week eastern
U.S. anomalies tending to be in the plus 10-20F range for morning
lows and plus 5-15F for highs.  System passage over the West
should bring temperatures down only to around normal or perhaps
briefly below, with southern areas tending to stay moderately
above climatology.  The Pacific Northwest should be near to
modestly below normal for most of the week.

...Widespread freezing temperatures and record-breaking cold are
expected from the Southeast to the Northeast on Saturday morning...

...Low humidity and windy conditions will support an Elevated
Risks of fire weather over most of the Plains and parts of the
southwestern Florida peninsula through Saturday morning...

A front extending from the Northern Intermountain Region eastward
to the Upper Mississippi Valley will slowly move eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and roughly westward to the Northwest
by Easter Sunday.  The system will produce light rain and snow
over parts of the Lower Great Lakes into Up-State New York
overnight Saturday into Easter Sunday morning.

Upper-level energy over the Southwest will move eastward to Texas
by Sunday.  The system will draw moisture off the Gulf of Mexico
and produce scattered showers and thunderstorms over parts of
Texas starting on Saturday afternoon and going through Sunday
evening.

A weak front pushing onshore over the Pacific Northwest overnight
Saturday will move eastward to the Northern High Plains by Sunday
evening.  The system will produce light rain and higher elevation
snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest late Saturday night,
spreading eastward to parts of the Northern Intermountain Region
by Easter Sunday evening.

High pressure over the Ohio Valley will move into the Southeast by
Saturday afternoon.  The high will linger over the Southeast and
slowly weaken. The high will bring in unseasonably cold
temperatures through Saturday morning and moderate closer to
average by Sunday. Temperatures are forecast to be 10 to 25
degrees below normal for much of the country's eastern third, and
many daily records for low minimum and maximum temperatures could
be set.  Freeze/Hard Freeze Warnings and Watches and Frost
Advisories are widespread from the Tennessee Valleys into the
Southern Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic through Saturday morning.  These
cold temperatures in early April, over the Southeast and parts of
the Mid-Atlantic, could cause damage to early-season crops and
plants.

However, the western and north-central U.S. can expect much warmer
temperatures through Sunday evening, with much above average and
possibly record-breaking warm temperatures.  The Southwest should
see temperatures in the upper 90s, while the 80s are forecast for
Northern and Central portions of the Plains. Unfortunately, these
warm temperatures combined with dry soils, low relative humidity,
and gusty winds will lead to Elevated Risks of fire weather for
parts of the Plains, as delineated by the Storm Prediction Center.
There is also an Elevated Risk of fire danger across the
southwestern Florida peninsula coast given some gusty post-frontal
winds and dry soil conditions.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 AM CDT Sat Apr 03 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
A sprawling upper-level ridge will be in place across the CONUS
today. Stronger winds aloft will remain across the northern tier
states. A subtle shortwave will likely move through the northern
Rockies into the western Dakotas. At the surface, strong surface
heating and the influence of the shortwave trough will help develop
a surface trough in the northern High Plains. This feature will
shift eastward during the day into the Dakotas.

...Northern Plains...
Early Saturday surface observations show dry air in parts of the
central and northern Plains. Given the weak surface pressure
pattern, this airmass is not expected to modify or move
substantially until the surface trough induces enhanced southerly
winds during the afternoon in SD/ND. This will likely support areas
of 15-25% with 15-20 mph winds. Wind approaching 25 mph may occur in
a narrow corridor right near the boundary. Elevated to locally
critical fire weather is possible.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
257 AM EDT Sat Apr 03 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Apr 06 2021 - 12Z Sat Apr 10 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Some aspects of the medium range forecast continue to be
challenging.  After midweek the models and ensembles still show
significant divergence for shortwave details within a larger scale
mean trough expected to settle over northwestern North America and
portions of the western U.S. coast.  In addition to affecting
timing/coverage/amounts of precipitation over the West, some of
the energy emerging from this mean trough could ultimately affect
the upper low forecast to track from the north-central Rockies
into the Midwest during Tuesday-Thursday.  Another factor at play
for this upper low by late week into the weekend will be the
fairly blocky pattern over the Atlantic and eastern Canada.  This
system will bring the potential for significant precipitation from
the north-central Plains and Midwest through portions of the East.


The models are gradually consolidating for their depiction of the
upper low currently expected to track from near eastern Idaho into
the Midwest during Tuesday-Thursday.  Among the 12Z/18Z solutions
for this time frame, the UKMET was the one that had to be excluded
due to being a fast extreme from the start of the period.  The new
00Z run looks more reasonable.  Recent trends have been
gravitating toward the stronger half of the spread.  By
Friday-Saturday the ultimate evolution of the upper low becomes
increasingly uncertain due to the possible influence of upstream
shortwave energy as well as models/ensembles showing a variety of
possibilities for flow details over and south of eastern Canada
(with eastern Canada seeing rising heights/ridging in general but
potential for embedded shortwave/closed low energy).  The 12Z and
old 00Z ECMWF runs represent the two extremes, lifting northward
or dropping southeastward.  The new 00Z run has reverted to a more
southern track late in the period.  The GEFS/ECMWF means provide
the most reasonable intermediate solution with the upper low
center drifting into the Great Lakes.

The forecast of details within the mean trough near the West Coast
is quite uncertain as well.  The GFS/UKMET/CMC are all suggesting
in varying ways that leading energy reaching the trough axis by
midweek should eject much farther eastward than ECMWF runs have
shown thus far.  GEFS/CMC means show a more subdued hint at such
energy.  As has been the case recently, the GFS digs upstream
energy farther westward than most other solutions.  In a favorable
trend the GEFS mean has been adjusting its somewhat westward axis
closer to the ECMWF mean.  The past two ECMWF runs were somewhat
opposite near the West Coast late in the period as well, with the
12Z run a lot flatter/broader with the trough than the prior 00Z
run.  The new run is sharper but strays a bit eastward by
Saturday.  Again a blend of the GEFS/ECMWF means provide the best
intermediate starting point for a single deterministic forecast.

Aforementioned comparisons/preferences led to a starting blend
that consisted of the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF/CMC for about the
first half of the period and then quickly trended toward majority
weight of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means.  Enough minority weights
of the 18Z GFS and 00Z/02 ECMWF were included late in the period
to enhance detail over the East slightly but not enough to have an
adverse impact on preferences farther West.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

The upper low emerging from the north-central Rockies along with
developing Plains/Midwest low pressure should promote an axis of
potentially heavy rainfall over parts of the north-central Plains
and Midwest during Tuesday or Tuesday night through at least
Wednesday.  Some snow will be possible over the north-central
Rockies and High Plains.  With time expect this system to spread
moisture into the East with some areas of locally moderate to
heavy rainfall possible.  Increasing uncertainty over system
details after Thursday decreases confidence for determining
highest rainfall totals and their location at that time, though
existing signals suggest they would be within an area from the
Ohio Valley into Tennessee Valley through parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast.  The Northwest should see one or more
periods of rain and mountain snow during the period but
uncertainty over shortwave details will keep confidence low for
specifics of coverage/timing/amounts.

From Tuesday into early Wednesday well above normal temperatures
(at least plus 10-20F anomalies) will prevail from the southern
Rockies/Plains into the Great Lakes.  The greatest anomalies
should be over the central Plains and Midwest where morning lows
may be 20-25F above normal.  This warmth will moderate somewhat as
it continues eastward ahead of the Plains system.  The East should
generally seeing highs of 5-15F above normal mid-late week while
clouds and rainfall will lead to warmer anomalies of plus 10-20F
for morning lows.  Farther west, parts of the north-central
Rockies/Plains may see modestly below normal highs into midweek
while the mean trough aloft nearby keeps the Pacific Northwest
somewhat below normal for highs.  Most of the Southwest and Great
Basin will likely see highs 5-10F above normal from midweek onward.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 AM CDT Sat Apr 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will continue across most of the U.S. on Sunday.
A trough will move into the Pacific Northwest later in the period.
Increasing westerly flow across the Northern Rockies will help
deepen a lee trough in the northern High Plains into adjacent
Plains.

...Montana...
Increasing flow aloft will coincide with a modestly enhanced surface
pressure gradient. 15-20 mph winds are possible with some higher
values in wind-prone areas. RH may drop to around 20% in some
locations, but the potential for mid/upper-level clouds will likely
impact how widespread the overall fire weather risk becomes.
Marginally elevated fire weather concerns are still expected,
however.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
While moisture return will be increasing to the east, a zone of dry
air appears probable near the surface trough from parts of the TX/OK
Panhandles into northwestern Kansas. With winds of 15-20 mph and RH
of 15-20%, elevated to locally critical fire weather concerns are
expected during the afternoon.

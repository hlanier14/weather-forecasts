...Snow over the central High Plains gradually tapers off later
today while higher elevations wet snow spreads across the interior
Northeast...

...Focus of showers and thunderstorms shifts from the southern
Plains today to along the Gulf Coast during the weekend...

An upper-level low responsible for the snow across the central
Rockies and nearby High Plains will slowly weaken as it heads
toward the Ohio Valley during the next couple of days.  The snow
currently in these areas will gradually taper off as the day
progresses.  Some of the snow is expected to linger over the
Colorado Rockies and then drift south into New Mexico during the
weekend near a frontal boundary.  Meanwhile, a swath of rain will
move eastward across the central Plains while some embedded strong
thunderstorms move through eastern Texas into the lower
Mississippi Valley.  As the upper low moves toward the Ohio
Valley, the focus of showers and thunderstorms will shift from the
southern Plains today to along the Gulf Coast during the weekend.
The highest chance of seeing heavy rainfall will be from central
to eastern Gulf Coast as a low pressure wave forms along a nearly
stationary front and then tracks eastward.

Meanwhile, a compact coastal storm is developing just off the New
England coast ahead of an upper-level low heading very slowly to
east across the lower Great Lakes.  The storm will result in gusty
winds and locally heavy rainfall across southeastern New England
today.  Farther inland, the presence of colder air will result in
higher elevation wet snow across interior New England where 4 to
10 inches of accumulations are expected today.  The storm is
forecast to gradually move eastward into the Gulf of Maine on
Saturday as the precipitation over New England slowly tapers off.
Cool and damp conditions should continue into Sunday due to a
lingering surface trough.

Elsewhere, lighter rain will move across portions of the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, the central Appalachians and into the
Southeast on Saturday.  Over parts of the Southwest and Southern
Rockies, dry and windy weather will help elevate the risk of
wildfire today.

By Sunday morning, the next surge of cold air from Canada should
reach the northern High Plains where mixed rain and snow develop
along with gusty winds and falling temperatures.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0107 AM CST Tue Feb 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow aloft will prevail across much of the CONUS
today, with an embedded mid-level trough pivoting around the
cyclonic flow and traversing the western CONUS while amplifying.
Surface cyclone development is expected to occur during the
afternoon across portions of the southern High Plains in response to
the approaching mid-level trough. Gradient winds and downslope flow
along the lee of the Rockies will contribute to dry and breezy
conditions across the southern High Plains. Widespread 10-20% RH
will likely overlap 20-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds for
multiple hours during the afternoon across much of eastern New
Mexico into western Texas, eastern Colorado and western Kansas.
While these surface meteorological conditions would typically
warrant widespread Elevated to Critical conditions, fuel
receptiveness to fire spread is not particularly robust, especially
across portions of the southern High Plains. As such, fire weather
highlights for widespread significant wildfire-spread potential have
not been delineated, though potential may exist for localized
grass-fire potential with patchy areas of drier fine fuels.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 23 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast to become anchored over the Gulf
of Mexico and Southeast by the beginning of March. This area of mid-level high
pressure is then expected to expand north over the east-central U.S. Early in
week-2, low pressure systems could affect the Northeast, Great Plains, or
Midwest but forecast confidence is very low on the development of these
potential surface lows and any related hazards. Mid-level high (low) pressure
is forecast to persist over the North Pacific (Mainland Alaska) during the
next
two weeks.

HAZARDS



DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 26 - TUESDAY MARCH 02:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!riBN-q0U6aVsF0PXE1FCr101AY4r9VC6uS4zWX48yh6imnTkgS15n4nua6dhRP__wrftKao3$

FOR WEDNESDAY MARCH 03 - TUESDAY MARCH 09: Following a negative phase of the
Arctic Oscillation (AO) since early December, a transition to a positive AO
occurred during mid-February. Nearly all the 0Z GFS ensemble members maintain
a
positive phase of the AO into early March. This positive AO along with
anomalous 500-hPa ridging expanding north over the central and eastern U.S.
favors near to above normal temperatures for the eastern two-thirds of the
CONUS during week-2. Although the CPC week-2 outlook features increased
chances
of below normal temperatures across the West, these temperatures are not
expected to be hazardous as spring draws closer. The most anomalous cold
during
early March is forecast to be limited to the highest latitudes of western
North
America, including Alaska. Although the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
indicate that minimum temperatures have more than a 40 percent chance of
falling below the 15th percentile of the climatological distribution across
southwest Alaska, minimum temperatures are not expected to meet hazards
criteria and no temperature hazard is issued. If this anomalous cold signal
continues or strengthens, then a much below normal temperature hazard may be
needed in subsequent week-2 outlooks.



The deterministic 0Z ECMWF model depicts an intensifying coastal low affecting
the Northeast on March 3 and 4. However, this model solution has no support
from recent GFS and Canadian model runs. Also, the 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean is
an
outlier with its amplified 500-hPa trough over the Northeast during week-2.
Therefore, no hazards are designated for the Northeast.



Early in week-2, a longwave 500-hPa trough of modest amplitude is forecast
over
the West which may promote a shortwave trough ejecting east to the Great
Plains. This shortwave trough would likely weaken as it shifts east of the
Rockies and encounters an expanding mid-level ridge. Due to the expectation of
this evolving pattern and likelihood of any heavy rainfall to occur prior to
week-2, the slight risk of heavy precipitation and flooding possible hazard
are
discontinued today. Another reason for no precipitation hazards is the large
differences between the week-2 GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. After the
ongoing atmospheric river (AR) event affecting the Pacific Northwest, tools
are
in excellent agreement and are devoid of any AR events along the West Coast
into early March.

...Potential heavy rainfall from the southern Plains to the
Tennessee Valley this weekend into early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A general synoptic pattern that features upper-level energies
lifting across the Southwest together with a subtropical ridge
anchored over the southern Gulf of Mexico will prevail during the
medium range period.  The resulting southwesterly flow in between
will likely lift Gulf moisture across the southern U.S. and into
portions of the eastern U.S. this weekend into early next week.
Waves of low pressure developing along a slow-moving front would
provide the focus for a multi-day heavy rainfall event across the
interior southern U.S. and into the Tennessee Valley.

Since yesterday, models have settled into the idea of ejecting
more upper-level energy from the Southwest into the central Plains
this weekend, lending more confidence for the initial bout of
potentially heavy rainfall to extend across the interior Deep
South into the weekend.  The GFS/GEFS solutions place the rain
axis farther to the south into the interior Southeast.  Preference
was given to the EC and CMC means for an axis farther inland
across the Tennessee Valley.

The extra upper-level energy is then carried downstream to promote
upper-level troughing and a decent signal for a low pressure
system to move across the Great Lakes on Saturday.  Meanwhile,
moisture ahead of the developing system will likely move up the
East Coast on Saturday ahead of a warm front lifting across the
Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic.  Some wintry precipitation is
possible across the central Appalachians Friday night into early
Saturday.  As the system exits New England on Sunday, model
guidance continues to be quite consistent in a resurgence of
moisture from the Gulf to prolong the heavy rain potential across
the Mid-South into the Tennessee Valley and towards the
Appalachians.  Another upper-level trough that gradually digs down
into the Southwest this weekend will then send additional
upper-level energy into the southern Plains.  When combining with
broad troughing associated with a cold air mass settling into the
northern tier states, the synoptic pattern will help sustain the
slow-moving axis of heavy rainfall across Mid-South into early
next week, although
the details are yet to be determined.  It is possible that the
heavy rain event will gradually diminish in the Deep South by next
Tuesday as the bulk of the moisture begins to shifts eastward into
the Southeast.

The WPC morning package was derived based on the consensus of the
00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS, and smaller
contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean with more of the ensemble
means on day 6-7 to account for the forecast uncertainty.
This resulted in a blend that lied reasonably close to continuity.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest to northern Rockies will see a couple days
of widespread precipitation late this week, with the higher
elevations of the Cascades, northern Rockies, and Bitterroots
expected to receive heavy snow. The associated upper trough will
then drop into the Southwest U.S. and gradually opens up over the
Plains. A favorable setup for a prolonged period of Gulf moisture
to interact with the wavy boundary in place is likely to set up a
period of active weather including heavy rainfall and possibly
thunderstorms for portions of the Southern Plains to the Tennessee
Valley and southern Appalachians beginning late this week into
early next week. The latest guidance shows the possibility of
general rainfall totaling several inches over the period.

Farther north, some wintry precipitation can be expected across
the upper Great Lakes early on Saturday, across the Midwest on
Sunday and Sunday night, and across northern New England Monday
and Monday night.  Another round of wintry weather is possible
across the Midwest on Monday.

Below normal temperatures are forecast predominately across the
Rockies during the period and then in the wake of the late weekend
and early next week system. Those below normal readings could
spill into the Plains. Departures of 10F to as much as 20F are
possible.  Nighttime lows are forecast to be well above normal (10
to 15F) for much of the central and eastern U.S. Sunday and
Monday, ahead of the frontal boundary draped through the MS River
Valley to Great Lakes.

...Potential heavy rainfall from the southern Plains to the
Tennessee Valley this weekend into early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A general synoptic pattern that features upper-level energies
lifting across the Southwest together with a subtropical ridge
anchored over the southern Gulf of Mexico will prevail during the
medium range period.  The resulting southwesterly flow in between
will likely lift Gulf moisture across the southern U.S. and into
portions of the eastern U.S. this weekend into early next week.
Waves of low pressure developing along a slow-moving front would
provide the focus for a multi-day heavy rainfall event across the
interior southern U.S. and into the Tennessee Valley.

Since yesterday, models have settled into the idea of ejecting
more upper-level energy from the Southwest into the central Plains
this weekend, lending more confidence for the initial bout of
potentially heavy rainfall to extend across the interior Deep
South into the weekend.  The GFS/GEFS solutions place the rain
axis farther to the south into the interior Southeast.  Preference

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 23 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast to become anchored over the Gulf
of Mexico and Southeast by the beginning of March. This area of mid-level high
pressure is then expected to expand north over the east-central U.S. Early in
week-2, low pressure systems could affect the Northeast, Great Plains, or
Midwest but forecast confidence is very low on the development of these
potential surface lows and any related hazards. Mid-level high (low) pressure
is forecast to persist over the North Pacific (Mainland Alaska) during the
next
two weeks.

HAZARDS

No hazards are posted.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 26 - TUESDAY MARCH 02:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vgPRxCv0NQx5u7lx7TIx-hm4-qh9La_gSPsywh_8fWUUQkqd_mkycQh796aH3koSCLIh13za$

FOR WEDNESDAY MARCH 03 - TUESDAY MARCH 09: Following a negative phase of the
Arctic Oscillation (AO) since early December, a transition to a positive AO
occurred during mid-February. Nearly all the 0Z GFS ensemble members maintain
a
positive phase of the AO into early March. This positive AO along with
anomalous 500-hPa ridging expanding north over the central and eastern U.S.
favors near to above normal temperatures for the eastern two-thirds of the
CONUS during week-2. Although the CPC week-2 outlook features increased
chances
of below normal temperatures across the West, these temperatures are not
expected to be hazardous as spring draws closer. The most anomalous cold
during
early March is forecast to be limited to the highest latitudes of western
North
America, including Alaska. Although the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
indicate that minimum temperatures have more than a 40 percent chance of
falling below the 15th percentile of the climatological distribution across
southwest Alaska, minimum temperatures are not expected to meet hazards
criteria and no temperature hazard is issued. If this anomalous cold signal
continues or strengthens, then a much below normal temperature hazard may be
needed in subsequent week-2 outlooks.



The deterministic 0Z ECMWF model depicts an intensifying coastal low affecting
the Northeast on March 3 and 4. However, this model solution has no support
from recent GFS and Canadian model runs. Also, the 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean is
an
outlier with its amplified 500-hPa trough over the Northeast during week-2.
Therefore, no hazards are designated for the Northeast.



Early in week-2, a longwave 500-hPa trough of modest amplitude is forecast
over
the West which may promote a shortwave trough ejecting east to the Great
Plains. This shortwave trough would likely weaken as it shifts east of the
Rockies and encounters an expanding mid-level ridge. Due to the expectation of
this evolving pattern and likelihood of any heavy rainfall to occur prior to
week-2, the slight risk of heavy precipitation and flooding possible hazard
are
discontinued today. Another reason for no precipitation hazards is the large
differences between the week-2 GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. After the
ongoing atmospheric river (AR) event affecting the Pacific Northwest, tools
are
in excellent agreement and are devoid of any AR events along the West Coast
into early March.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0127 AM CST Tue Feb 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the central Rockies while surface
high pressure overspreads much of the western and central CONUS
tomorrow, Wednesday February 24th. While cool and/or moist
conditions are expected to limit wildfire potential across much of
the CONUS, a localized threat for wildfire spread may develop across
portions of the southwest U.S (mainly southern Arizona and New
Mexico), ahead of a southward approaching cold front. Before
temperatures cool, diurnal mixing may promote 15-20% RH and 15-20
mph sustained westerly winds around afternoon peak heating. However,
fuels remain poorly receptive to fire spread, precluding any fire
weather highlights.

In addition, southward surging high pressure will also support the
development of a strong pressure gradient across southern
California, with dry and breezy offshore conditions likely beginning
on Wednesday evening. Similar to areas farther east, fuel
receptiveness to fire spread remains meager, with no fire weather
delineations made at this time. However, several areas across the
southern Transverse/Peninsular Ranges have been relatively devoid of
meaningful precipitation accumulations for the past two weeks. As
such, an Elevated highlight may be introduced if the driest/windiest
conditions may overlap with diurnal heating, potentially prompting
the finest fuels to become more receptive to fire spread.

across the Midwest on Monday.

Below normal temperatures are forecast predominately across the
Rockies during the period and then in the wake of the late weekend
and early next week system. Those below normal readings could
spill into the Plains. Departures of 10F to as much as 20F are
possible.  Nighttime lows are forecast to be well above normal (10
to 15F) for much of the central and eastern U.S. Sunday and
Monday, ahead of the frontal boundary draped through the MS River
Valley to Great Lakes.

...Series of storm systems to produce unsettled weather over the
northern tier of the Lower 48 ...

to the Rockies and Heartland...

...High winds likely across the Northern Plains, Avalanche
Warnings in the Northern Rockies...

A quick moving storm system is producing periods of snow in the
Upper Midwest this afternoon. This wave of low pressure races east
towards the Great Lakes tonight with areas of snow and some wintry
mix expected. Snowfall accumulations of 3-6 inches are forecast
over the northern Great Lakes through Wednesday morning. By
Wednesday afternoon, hit-or-miss showers look to develop along a
lengthy cold front that extends from the South Central U.S. to the
northern Mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, periods of snow are possible out
ahead of the storm over northenr New England that are likely to
continue into Wednesday night. A passing cold front then supplies
one more round of snow over northern New England before high
pressure builds in from the west Thursday night. The higher
elevations of northern New England; such as the Adirondacks,
Green, and White mountains, could receive 3 to 6 inches of snow
with locally higher amounts possible. To the West, a new Pacific
storm delivers more valley/coastal rain and mountain snow to the
Pacific Northwest on Thursday. Heavy snow will blanket the
Cascades and Olympic ranges with totals as high as 1 to 2 feet.

This same storm system is also responsible for a roller coaster
temperature regime spanning from the Intermountain West to the
East Coast. Ahead of the storm, abnormally warm temperatures are
expected this evening with 60s and 70s spread out from the
Southwest to the Deep South. By Wednesday, the warm sector of the
storm reaches the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast where the same range
of temperatures are likely to be observed. Above normal
temperatures are also anticipated in the Northeast with highs
approaching 50 degrees in spots. Temperatures could reach 80
degrees in parts of Florida by Thursday. Behind the storm, a cold
front delivers a fresh injection of cold Canadian air into the
Northwest, the Rockies, and central Plains on Wednesday. As the
front plunges south, mountain snow is forecast to develop with
accumulations up to a foot possible in the highest elevations of
the Bitterroots and Colorado Rockies. Much below normal
temperatures reach the southern Plains on Thursday with highs
ranging between 15 and 25 degrees below normal. This frontal
boundary will come to a halt and stall over the Deep South,
setting the stage for areas of showers and thunderstorms over the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley Thursday night.

Elsewhere, High Wind Warnings in portions of the Northern Plains
will conclude this afternoon as strong wind gusts diminish this
evening. Gusty winds may return to both the Northern Rockies and
Plains on Thursday as a storm system strengthens in the Canadian
Prairies. Also, Avalanche Warnings are in place in parts of the
northern Rockies through Wednesday morning. Lastly, Red Flag
Warnings have been posted for some counties in the central High
Plains due to gusty winds and low humidity levels fostering a
favorable environment for fire weather conditions.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Tue February 23 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 01 - 05 2021

Today's model forecasts are in general agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. While most ensemble model solutions predict a low amplitude
500-hPa trough in the vicinity of western North America. The ECMWF ensemble
mean predicts a low amplitude trough over the western CONUS, while the GEFS
predicts a slightly more amplified trough near the Pacific coast of the CONUS.
Enhanced westerly flow is predicted across the Aleutian Islands and into
southwestern Mainland Alaska around a negative height anomaly to the north and
a positive height anomaly to the south. A high amplitude ridge is predicted
over the eastern CONUS by all recent ensemble means. The manual height blend
depicts negative 500-hPa height anomalies over most of Alaska except the
western Aleutians. Weak negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over
the western CONUS, and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted across
the eastern CONUS.

Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are enhanced across Mainland
Alaska,
under negative 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are likely
across most of the western CONUS, related to the predicted trough over the
region. Above normal temperatures are likely over much of the eastern CONUS,
from southeastern Texas northeastward to the eastern Great Lakes region and
eastward to the Atlantic Coast, under a predicted ridge. Above normal
temperatures are also favored for parts of the Northern Plains, with anomalous
southerly flow behind high pressure to the east.

Above normal precipitation is likely across Alaska, excluding the western
Aleutians and the North Slope, under enhanced westerly flow. Near to below
normal precipitation is favored for most of the northwestern CONUS, from
northern California, Oregon and Washington into the Northern Plains and
western
Great Lakes region, with split mid-level flow around the region. Above normal
precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southern and Central
Plains
across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
regions, due to the potential emergence of shortwaves ahead of the trough over
the southwestern CONUS. Chances of below  normal precipitation are enhanced
for
parts of South Texas and the Florida Peninsula, consistent with most dynamical
model forecasts.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 10%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
only fair agreement among the model circulation, temperature, and
precipitation
forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 03 - 09 2021

There is increasing spread among dynamical model solutions for the 8-14 day
period, such that the main features of the predicted circulation pattern for
the 6-10 day period persist into the week 2 period in the manual blend with
much greater uncertainty and weaker mean 500-hPa height anomalies. Enhanced
westerly flow between a positive height anomaly to the south and a negative
height anomaly to the north persists into southwestern Alaska. Weakening
troughing and near normal 500-hPa heights are depicted over the western CONUS
in the week 2 manual blend of model forecasts. Ridging persists over the
eastern CONUS into week 2, although with substantially lower positive 500-hPa
height anomalies compared to the 6-10 day period forecast.

The temperature pattern forecast for the week 2 period is also similar to the
6-10 day period forecast with some notable changes. Enhanced probabilities of
below normal temperatures are indicated for the Alaska Mainland, under
negative
500-hPa height anomalies. Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures
are also shown for the western CONUS from the Pacific Coast to the Rocky
Mountains, although with weaker probabilities than in the 6-10 day period as
the trough over the west de-amplifies significantly. Above normal temperatures
are favored over the eastern CONUS, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies.
Probabilities of above normal temperatures exceed 50 percent over the Northern
Plains and the Great Lakes region under anomalous southerly flow. There were
considerable differences among model temperature forecasts for much of the
Central and Southern Plains and across the Southeast and Northeast regions, so
only weak probabilities of above normal temperatures were indicated for these
regions, supported by analog forecasts and positive 500-hPa height anomalies.

Enhanced probabilities  above normal precipitation is favored over all of
Alaska except the North Slope in week 2, under persistent westerly mid-level
flow. The precipitation pattern forecast over the CONUS in week 2 is generally
similar to the 6-10 day period forecast with greater uncertainty. Near to
below
normal precipitation is favored over most of the western CONUS, outside
climatologically dry areas of the Southwest. Slightly enhanced probabilities
of
above normal precipitation are depicted for eastern areas of the Central
Plains
across the Central Mississippi Valley into the Mid-Atlantic, with potential
storm activity ahead of the remaining troughing over the Southwest. Near to
below normal precipitation is favored for the Gulf Coast region, supported by
most dynamical model forecasts. Uncertainty leads to a forecast of near normal
precipitation for the eastern Great Lakes and Northeast regions in week 2.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 10% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and
10%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
only fair agreement among the model circulation, temperature, and
precipitation
forecasts, offset by increasing uncertainty and model spread.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...Potential heavy rainfall from the southern Plains to the
Tennessee Valley this weekend into early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Quasi-southwesterly flow aloft is expected over the CONUS during
the period with a couple Pacific systems dropping into the Four
Corners region while a deepening trough quickly moves through the
northern stream. Ridging is expected to persist over southern
Florida and parts of the Gulf of Mexico and the resulting
southwesterly flow will allow Gulf moisture to lift into parts of
the CONUS. This moisture and associated boundary will be
interacting with high pressure form the north, creating a zone for
some episodes of heavy rainfall this weekend into early next week
across portions of the Southern Plains to southern Appalachians.

Through day 5, the models show fairly good agreement with the
Pacific system dropping down to the Four Corners then pushing out
into the Plains by early day 6. In the northern stream, the models
continue to advertise a deeper solution with the upper level
trough, giving way to a stronger low passing through day 3-4-5. In
its wake, stronger high pressure is now forecast to drop down into
the Plains. This effectively pushes the wavy stationary boundary
across the South further south by day 5/6. Meanwhile, there is
much uncertainty with the day 6/7 Pacific/West Coast trough.
Although many of the models now show a deeper low pinching off
well offshore.

The GFS appeared to be again too strong with the northern stream
energy, though the trend is for a more pronounced trough taking on
a negative tilt, so it was not entirely discarded. Elsewhere
through day 5, a blend of the available deterministic guidance
sufficed. By day 6/7, the forecast confidence was below normal
regarding the position of the stationary boundary/front across the
South - the models now suggest a stronger high to the north which
could push it toward the Gulf Coast (and push heavy rainfall
threat to the south as well). Meanwhile, the west coast trough
evolution is very uncertain, so a blend heavy on the ensemble
means was used.

The WPC blend was derived based on the consensus of the 12Z
ECMWF/12Z EC mean, the 18Z GFS/18Z GEFS, and smaller contribution
from the 12Z CMC, and mostly a blend of the ensemble means on day
6-7 to account for the forecast uncertainty.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Precipitation spreading into portions of the central to northern
Rockies could result in heavy snow for the higher elevations.
Meanwhile, upper level troughing over the Four Corners region will
allow Gulf moisture to lift northward as waves of low pressure
move along a stationary boundary in place. This setup will favor a
few rounds of locally heavy rainfall this weekend into early next
week across portions of the Arklatex to the TN and OH Valleys. The
latest guidance shows the possibility of general rainfall totaling
several inches over the period.

Farther north, some wintry precipitation can be expected across
the central Appalachians Friday night into early Saturday, across
the upper Great Lakes early on Saturday, across the Midwest on
Sunday and Sunday night, and across northern New England Monday
and Monday night.  Another round of wintry weather is possible
across the Midwest on Monday.

Below normal temperatures are expected to remain primarily over
the Northern Rockies to start the period with departures of 10F to
as much as 20F Saturday while the eastern half of the CONUS
experiences slightly above normal daytime highs. Ahead of the
stationary boundary expected to be draped across portions of the
South, daytime highs as much as 15F above normal are possible
Sunday along the Gulf Coast as well as portions of the Northeast
and New England. Nighttime lows are forecast to be well above
normal (10 to 20F) for much of the central and eastern U.S. Sunday
and Monday, ahead of the frontal boundary draped through the MS
River Valley to Great Lakes.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0105 AM CST Wed Feb 24 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will move across the Inter-mountain West during
the day, promoting surface low development and subsequent dry and
breezy westerly flow across portions of southern California, into
Arizona, New Mexico and the southern High Plains. While much of the
aforementioned areas may experience Elevated to locally Critical
conditions by afternoon peak heating, fuels remain largely
un-receptive to significant wildfire-spread. Cooler and moister
conditions across the central and eastern U.S. will hamper
significant wildfire concerns as well.

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the Great Basin as the first
trough aloft (traversing the Inter-mountain West on Day 1) ejects
into the Plains states. Similar to Day 1, dry and breezy westerly
flow is expected to prevail across southern portions of Arizona, New
Mexico, and Far West Texas. Still, fuel receptiveness to fire spread
is expected to remain too mediocre for fire weather highlights.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, cool and/or moist conditions will
continue to limit significant wildfire-growth potential.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1135 AM CDT Mon Jun 21 2021

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN...

No changes to the ongoing forecast. Strong heating ahead of a cold
front now in parts of western/central New Mexico may promote locally
elevated to near critical fire weather in southeastern Arizona. The
risk should be spatially confined and relatively brief this
afternoon.

..Wendt.. 06/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0208 AM CDT Mon Jun 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
The mid-level flow pattern across the CONUS will become more
amplified today, as a broad trough deepens across the Great Lakes.
Over the West, a mid-level ridge will be compressed by an
approaching upper low off the California coast. Increasing westerly
flow aloft will spill over into the Great Basin supporting critical
fire weather conditions, while thunderstorms develop over the West
Coast.

...Southern Great Basin and Vicinity...
Ahead of the Pacific trough, southwesterly mid-level low will
increase across eastern California and west-southwestern Nevada.
Warm and dry conditions will persist under the northward extension
of the ridge, as westerly downslope flow increases through the day.
Across the southern Great Basin, widespread surface RH below 15% is
expected by early afternoon. As winds increase through the diurnal
cycle, 20-25 mph sustained westerlies will overlap with the dry
airmass, supporting critical fire weather conditions.

...West Coast Dry Thunder...
Moist onshore flow will develop across much of the West Coast ahead
of the mid-level low. Regional model soundings show modest buoyancy
developing above relatively dry sub-cloud layers across northern
California and southern Oregon. Isolated dry lightning strikes
appear likely over dry fuels. Moisture should continue to increase
through the evening and overnight hours, augmenting precipitation
efficiency. However, fast-moving and high-based storms will likely
still support a few dry strikes as the mode becomes wetter.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 21 2021

SYNOPSIS: An amplified pattern is predicted across North America during
week-2.
The most significant feature from a hazards perspective is the anomalous
mid-level high pressure forecast over the western contiguous U.S., which is
expected to peak in amplitude late in week-1, and shift toward the
north-central states early in week-2. Excessive heat impacts will likely be
exacerbated by the ongoing severe to exceptional drought conditions across
these areas. Mid-level low pressure is forecast downstream, favoring more
seasonable weather across the eastern contiguous U.S., with frontal activity
possibly enhancing precipitation early in the period. Mid-level low pressure
forecast over the Bering Sea favors increased precipitation chances across
western Alaska.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Intermountain region
and the Northern Great Basin, Tue-Wed, Jun 29-30.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of California, the Great Basin,
and the Northern and Central Rockies and Northern and Central Plains, Tue-Thu,
Jun 29-Jul 1.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western CONUS, extending through
parts of the Northern and Central Plains and Upper and Middle Mississippi
Valley, Tue-Mon, Jun 29-Jul 5.

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Ohio
Valley, Great Lakes, and Appalachians, Tue-Thu, Jun 29-Jul 1.

Flooding possible for portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ohio
Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY JUNE 24 - MONDAY JUNE 28:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!qntBJAlhBknyhYDpKiY8B4R0BewyhjSlMobcKZ7R1ZCPL6oygM1JgLcOYC2loFl1C10rFxjz$

FOR TUESDAY JUNE 29 - MONDAY JULY 05: Anomalous ridging is forecast to amplify
over the western CONUS later in week-1, with 500-hPa geopotential heights of
594-597 dam indicated over parts of the northwestern CONUS in the latest
deterministic runs of the ECMWF and GFS. By the start of week-2, the mid-level
heights are expected to decrease slightly, but the ridging is forecast to
become more expansive, with positive mid-level height anomalies favored to
build across the north-central CONUS. The 0z ECMWF ensemble is more
progressive
in expanding the ridge across the Great Plains compared to the 6z GEFS. This
evolution is also seen in the reforecast tools, where the ECMWF tool depicts
at
least a 60% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile from
the Great Basin through portions of the Northern Plains early in week-2. The
GEFS reforecast tool confines these higher probabilities to the Northern Great
Basin and Intermountain region, corresponding with the placement of a high
risk
for excessive heat for 6/29 and 6/30. The National Blend of Models (NBM)
indicates the potential for daily record high temperatures across the
highlighted high risk area, with temperatures likely exceeding 100 deg F, and
possibly reaching 105 deg F. With the forecast expansion of the ridge across
the North Central states, a moderate risk of excessive heat is highlighted
from
the California Central Valley and Great Basin to the Northern and Central
Plains from 6/29 through 7/1. Although the ECMWF reforecast would support the
expansion of the high risk across the Northern Plains, the lower probabilities
(~40%) for temperatures reaching the 85th percentile in the GEFS reforecast
tool justifies only a moderate risk at this time. Maximum temperatures in the
upper 90s to near 100 deg F are possible, with the NBM indicating near record
high temperatures across parts of the Northern Plains on 6/30 and 7/1. A broad
slight risk for excessive heat is maintained across the western CONUS, and
through parts of the Northern and Central Plains and Upper and Middle
Mississippi Valley for the entire week-2 period. The forecast excessive heat
and generally dry conditions will exacerbate the ongoing drought over the
western and North-Central CONUS, where many areas are classified as being in
severe to exceptional drought as of June 15.



Downstream of the ridging, troughing is predicted across the East-Central
CONUS. This favors maximum temperatures closer to normal across many areas of
the East, or even on the cooler side. Surface low pressure is forecast to move
across the Great Lakes and southeastern Canada late in week-1 into early
week-2. Enhanced rainfall is predicted along a trailing cold front. The
uncalibrated 0z ECMWF depicts parts of the Northeast having at least a 20%
chance for 3-day rainfall totals of over 2 inches during days 8-10 (6/29-7/1).
Subsequently, the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates a 20% chance or greater of
rainfall exceeding the 85th percentile along the Eastern Seaboard for this
same
period, and also along the Gulf of Mexico coast. The GEFS reforecast tool does
not show elevated probabilities, but model ensemble means depict a similar
synoptic set-up to the ECMWF. Given the increased probabilities in the ECMWF
guidance, a slight risk for heavy rain is highlighted across portions of the
Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and Appalachians from 6/29
through 7/1, although the highest chances are likely earlier in the period.
There are indications of increased southerly flow and perhaps tropical cyclone
activity in the Gulf of Mexico, which could enhance rainfall along the Gulf
Coast, as seen in the ECMWF reforecast guidance. However, the lack of
agreement
in terms of any organized features precludes any related hazards for the Gulf
Coast region.



Antecedent rainfall from Tropical Storm Claudette and elevated soil moisture
is
likely to prolong the threat of river flooding across the Lower Mississippi
Valley into week-2, allowing the possible flooding hazard to continue over the
region. River flooding is also ongoing along the White River in Indiana, where
additional rainfall is forecast during week-1. As a result, a possible flood
hazard is added across southern Indiana and adjacent areas, with the potential
for some of this flooding to continue into week-2.



Over Alaska, the amplified mid-level pattern forecast across the North Pacific
is expected to enhance onshore flow early in the period. With surface low
pressure also forecast, enhanced precipitation and increased wind speeds are
likely across the Southern Mainland and the Aleutians. However, reforecast
tools remain unsupportive of precipitation and winds reaching pre-determined
hazard thresholds. The 0z ECMWF and 6z GEFS both show the troughing over the
Bering Sea weakening toward the end of the period favoring a trend toward more
tranquil weather.

...Heat intensifies late week over the interior Northwest/West
toward record levels...
...Heavy rain threat for the mid-section of the country late this
week...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was derived from a composite of
best clustered solutions of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 00 UTC
ECMWF/EC mean and the 00Z CMC/CMC mean for days 3-4 (Thu-Fri) in a
pattern with above average continuity and predictability.  From
Day 5 onward, models continue to exhibit considerable spread as
well as run-to-run variability downstream from a Rex blocking
pattern on the West Coast.  This calls for placing more weights
than usual toward the ensemble means beginning on Day 5 and
through Day 7, as the ensemble means remain compatible with one
another through Day 7.  The deterministic model solutions from Day
5 onward show more spread than they were yesterday in general.
Notable differences include the amplitude/evolution of the hot
ridge over the West, but especially with longitudinal focus of
downstream trough amplification over the central U.S. as energies
dig downstream from the Rex block.  The 12Z UTC model guidance
does not seem to offer much clarifications either.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low just off northern California is forecast to meander
offshore later this week as a hot ridge builds inland through the
Northwest.  This will allow temperatures to climb to 15-25+
degrees above normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern
Rockies, and more generally 5-15 degrees above normal along and
west of the Rockies. Record highs are likely from the Pacific
Northwest to the northern Rockies, with afternoon temperatures
peaking well over 100F to near 110F are forecast for the interior
sections of the West.  Little to no rainfall is expected to ease
the high heat throughout the broad region.

Downstream, robust upper trough digging from south-central Canada
will solidify a wavy and fortified cold front to move steadily
over the central to eastern U.S., inviting moisture return by
later week.  Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall/runoff potential along and ahead of the front
from the Midwest to the Mid-South, Southern Plains and across the
Ohio Valley and Appalachians to the Northeast.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon June 21 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 27 - JUL 01, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
North Pacific, centered over the Aleutians, and a ridge and positive 500-hPa
height anomalies over the eastern North Pacific and western North America.
Downstream, a trough is predicted over the east-central CONUS, and positive
500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the Northeast.

Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures are favored over much of
south-central and southwestern Mainland Alaska, due to the predicted trough
over the Aleutians and associated potential storm system development and
increased cloud cover. Predicted southwesterly flow favors relatively warm
conditions for northeastern Mainland Alaska. A predicted trough over the
east-central CONUS and near zero 500-hPa height anomalies favor enhanced
probabilities of below normal temperatures for eastern areas of the Southwest,
the Southern Plains, the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, and the Southeast
region. Above normal temperatures are likely over the western CONUS, the
Northern Plains, and the Northeast, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies
and
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the Aleutians and anomalous southerly flow enhance
probabilities of above normal precipitation over the eastern Aleutians as well
as western and northern Mainland Alaska. A predicted ridge and anomalous
northerly flow increase probabilities of below normal precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest, across the Central and Northern Plains states into the
Upper
Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes region. A predicted trough over the
east-central CONUS and anomalous southerly surface flow around high pressure
over the Atlantic favor above normal precipitation from the Gulf Coast across
the Southeast region and Eastern Seaboard, excluding the Florida Peninsula,
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool. An enhanced southwestern
monsoon and associated above normal precipitation are favored for much of the
Southwest, supported by dynamical model forecasts and the ERF consolidation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to good agreement among the model circulation, temperature, and
precipitation forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 29 - JUL 05, 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist while troughs over the Aleutians and east-central CONUS are
predicted to deamplify, as ensemble spread and uncertainty increase.
Additionally, the ridge over the western CONUS is predicted to expand
eastward,
particularly as depicted by the ECMWF ensemble mean forecast.

Near to below normal temperatures are favored for much of southwestern
Mainland
Alaska, associated with a mean trough over the Aleutians and potential
development of storm systems leading to increased cloud cover. Above normal
temperatures are likely over the West, extending eastward across the Central
and Northern Plains, and much of the Great Lakes and Northeast regions, under
positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favored over
most of the remainder of the CONUS, from eastern areas of the Southwest
monsoon
region across the Southern Plains into the Southeast region, under the
predicted trough and near zero 500-hPa height anomalies.

Probabilities of above normal precipitation are enhanced over southwestern
Mainland Alaska due to predicted troughing over the Aleutians. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are increased for the southern Alaska Panhandle
and
most of the northwestern CONUS and Northern and Central Plains, associated
with
the expanding ridge over the Gulf of Alaska and western CONUS. Near to above
normal precipitation is favored across most of the western Gulf Coast region
and eastern CONUS, consistent with the ERF consolidation tool and troughing
over the east-central CONUS. An active monsoon and associated above normal
precipitation continues to be favored in week 2 for parts of the Southwest,
supported by dynamical model forecasts and the ERF consolidation tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN GREAT
BASIN...

No changes are needed to the ongoing critical/elevated areas.

Elevated thunderstorms are expected to impact dry fuels in parts of
central Idaho and southwestern Montana during the evening and
overnight. These storms will likely be forced by a disturbance
moving out of Oregon. These elevated storms will move quickly enough
atop modestly dry low levels to produce some mix wet/dry storms.
Some guidance shows afternoon storms could develop in the terrain of
southwestern Montana, but confidence is lower in that occurring.

..Wendt.. 06/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0213 AM CDT Mon Jun 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
Eastern US troughing is forecast to deepen Day2/Tuesday, while an
upper low off the West Coast slowly moves onshore. Flanked by the
troughs, a mid-level ridge over the Southwest will become
increasingly elongated as it is shunted to the east by falling
heights over to the west. Increasing mid-level flow will result in
warm, dry, and windy conditions developing across much of the Desert
Southwest, supporting critical fire weather.

...Nevada, Utah, and Arizona...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions are expected to develop
Day2/Tuesday afternoon across the southern Great Basin and
southwestern US. Southwesterly flow aloft ahead of the main upper
low will increase, with 500 mb winds of 30-40 kts overspreading
southern Nevada and western Utah by early afternoon. Enhanced
mixing, both mechanical and thermally driven, should bolster surface
winds to 25-30 mph across a broad swath of southern Nevada and Utah.
Widespread critical fire weather conditions appear likely given
recent fire activity and exceptionally dry fuels. Critical
conditions will likely extended to the east of this enhanced
corridor, across the higher terrain of southern and central
Colorado. Here, sustained surface winds are likely to be lower owing
to weaker flow aloft. However, frequent gusts to near 25 mph should
be adequate for a few hours of critical conditions, given recent
lightning and likely holdover fire activity.

...Northwest...
As flow aloft from the approaching West Coast trough strengthens,
cross Cascade pressure gradients will tighten driving westerly flow
down the leeward slopes. The dry downslope nature of the flow will
likely support a few hours of locally elevated/critical fire weather
conditions through the afternoon. Model guidance differs on arrival
of the stronger flow aloft, casting considerable uncertainty of the
longevity of any fire weather threat across the area.

Additionally, some risk for thunderstorms along the West Coast will
continue Day2/Tuesday as deeper moisture and forcing for ascent
spread inland. Storm coverage should remain widely scattered, but
increasingly moist surface profiles may favor a storm mode less
favorable for efficient lightning strikes. A few dry strikes are
possible over dry fuels through the evening, but sufficient coverage
for dry thunder probabilities appears unlikely at this time.

...Showers and thunderstorms to produce severe weather today in
the Tennessee Valley and areas northeast; excessive rainfall along
the Gulf Coast, Mississippi Delta, and into the Allegheny
Plateau...

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat wanes across California and
the Southwest, while expanding into the Pacific Northwest...

...Fire weather conditions forecast across the Great Basin...

On the heels of Tropical Storm Claudette, a strong cold front
arcing from the Great Lakes into southern Colorado is forecast to
serve as a catalyst for active weather this week across the CONUS.
Ahead of the front, a plume of rich tropical moisture leftover
from Claudette remains in place. Accordingly, expect this week to
be active with heavy rain and thunderstorm activity through
Wednesday. Today, a large area is highlighted for a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall concerns ahead of the cold front along the Gulf
Coast, further north in the Mississippi River Delta, and into the
Pittsburgh Metro. Some areas, particularly along the Central Gulf
Coast from Southeast Louisiana through the Florida Panhandle are
particularly sensitive to additional heavy rain in light of heavy
rainfall from Claudette this past weekend. In addition to the
flash flood threat, an Enhanced Risk of severe weather has been
highlighted by the Storm Prediction Center over portions of the
Northeast, with a Slight Risk extending through the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys. A myriad of Severe Thunderstorm Watches
currently extend from New Hampshire into North-Central Tennessee
ahead of developing thunderstorms. The risk of heavy rain
continues tomorrow with the eastern progression of the front; a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall runs from the Carolina Coastal
Plains, through Central Georgia, and into North Florida. A
Marginal Risk of severe weather is also in effect over the same
region.

Elsewhere, the high heat over most of the western U.S. will end as
the temperature becomes more average. However, there is a
potential for record-breaking high minimum temperatures across the
Northwest today, with above average temperatures all around the
region. Dry high pressure will facilitate a fire weather risk
today through Wednesday in the Great Basin. A Critical Risk of
fire weather is forecast by the Storm Prediction Center through
tomorrow, with an additional risk area highlighted on the 23rd.

With respect to the track of Tropical Storm Claudette: Claudette
is forecast to move northeastward over the Western Atlantic off
the Northeast Coast towards the Canadian Maritimes by Wednesday.
Check the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center for
the most up-to-date track and intensity of Claudette.

...Dangerous Heat Wave to build record temperatures across the
Northwest/West...
...Elongated Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Plains to
Northeast...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean
and 12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF/ECENS mean Friday into Saturday in a
pattern with above average continuity and predictability.

The models exhibit considerable spread as well as run-to-run
variability over the weekend with and downstream from a Rex
blocking pattern on the West Coast. The ensemble means remain
compatible through early next week and were used in composite with
similarly consistent guidance from WPC continuity and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models. This composite develops and maintains
north-central U.S. upper troughing a bit on the amplified side of
the full envelope of guidance, seemingly consistent with upstream
blocking. Newer 00 UTC guidance overall continues these general
trends.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest by the weekend and the heat wave will expand for much of
the West into next week. Temperatures will climb to 15-25+ degrees
above normal from Washington/Oregon to the Northern Rockies, and
more generally 5-15 degrees above normal along and west of the
Rockies. Records are likely from the Pacific Northwest to the
north/central Great Basin and northern Rockies, with temperatures
peaking over 100F to near 110F forecast for interior sections of
the West. Little to no rainfall is expected to ease this excessive
heat.

Downstream, robust upper trough digging from south-central Canada
will solidify a wavy, fortified and slow moving cold front to
stretch from the south-central to northeastern U.S. this weekend
and early next week, inviting deep moisture return and pooling.
Well organized showers and storms will significantly increase
rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the front with an
elongated and focused zone from the Southern Plains northeastward
across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and Appalachians to the
Northeast. Episodes of cell training and repeat cells are likely.

trends.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest by the weekend and the heat wave will expand for much of
the West into next week. Temperatures will climb to 15-25+ degrees
above normal from Washington/Oregon to the Northern Rockies, and
more generally 5-15 degrees above normal along and west of the
Rockies. Records are likely from the Pacific Northwest to the
north/central Great Basin and northern Rockies, with temperatures
peaking over 100F to near 110F forecast for interior sections of
the West. Little to no rainfall is expected to ease this excessive
heat.

Downstream, robust upper trough digging from south-central Canada
will solidify a wavy, fortified and slow moving cold front to
stretch from the south-central to northeastern U.S. this weekend
and early next week, inviting deep moisture return and pooling.
Well organized showers and storms will significantly increase
rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the front with an
elongated and focused zone from the Southern Plains northeastward
across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and Appalachians to the
Northeast. Episodes of cell training and repeat cells are likely.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN INTO UTAH AND
WESTERN COLORADO...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing will move onshore across California today, while
stronger mid-level flow and moisture spread inland over much of the
West. Ridging across the Southwest will move slowly to the east,
while a broad trough will envelop much of the northeastern CONUS.
Warm, dry, and windy surface conditions in the Southern Great Basin
and Southwest will support critical fire weather conditions today.
Thunderstorms over the West may also produce isolated dry lightning
over Oregon and Idaho.

...Southern Great Basin and Southwest...
A corridor of 30-40 kt 500-700 mb flow to the east of the upper low
will spread inland over southern Nevada and central Utah by early
afternoon. Deep mixing will transport stronger momentum aloft to the
surface, supporting winds of 25-30 mph. Widespread relative humidity
below 15% is forecast to develop with warm surface temperatures. Dry
fuels and recent lightning/fire activity suggest enhanced potential
for fire spread. Widespread critical fire weather conditions are
likely from Nevada, through northern Arizona and much of Utah, into
western Colorado.

...Northern Nevada and California...
Stronger flow aloft should be focused across portions of the
northern Great Basin and Intermountain West as the mid-level low
approaches. Gusty downslope flow across the Sierra and high terrain
of the Northwest will overlap with warm and dry surface conditions
across Nevada and northern California. Here, fuels are critically
dry, and recent lightning activity will increase the potential for
fire growth. Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
will be likely through much of the day.

...Northwest and Intermountain West Dry Thunder...
As broad ascent from the mid-level low spreads inland through the
morning, thunderstorms should develop along a gradient of deeper
mid-level moisture from southeast Oregon into central Idaho. Model
soundings show sufficient buoyancy for scattered storms and
subsequent lightning strikes. While storm coverage will be increased
from previous days, higher PWAT values (0.75-1.0 inches) may favor a
storm mode less favorable for efficient lightning starts. Isolated
dry strikes will remain possible over dry fuels through much of the
evening, before storm coverage decreases later tonight.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0206 AM CDT Tue Jun 22 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
The mid-level flow pattern over the CONUS will transition to more
zonal flow, as mid-level heights increase across the southern third
of the country. The upper low along the West Coast will stall,
keeping southwesterly flow aloft above much of the West. Deep
moisture will spread northward supporting thunderstorms across the
southern Rockies and Great Basin.

...Great Basin...
Southerly flow along the eastern periphery of the stalled upper low
will transport Gulf of California moisture northward across the Four
Corners and Southern Rockies. Model soundings show weak buoyancy
(MUCAPE 250-500 J/kg) developing across a broad swath of the
Southwest, from southern New Mexico northward, into southern Nevada.
CAM guidance suggests isolated storms will develop first along the
higher terrain before becoming more widespread with time. Despite
higher than average PWAT values around 1 inch, fast storm speeds and
relatively dry low-level profiles will favor high-based storms.
Fuels over much of the region are exceptionally dry, suggesting high
susceptibility to lightning ignitions. Isolated dry lightning
strikes appear likely, and isolated dry thunder probabilities will
be continued.

...Southern Wyoming...
Lee troughing across the High Plains will increase west-east
pressure gradients across the central Rockies and southern Wyoming
through Day2/Wednesday. Westerly downslope winds of 15-20 mph will
likely develop coincident with dry surface conditions during peak
heating. Surface RH of 15-20%, and sufficiently dry fuels will
support elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions through
the afternoon.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
southern Mid-Atlantic to the Eastern Gulf Coast through Wednesday
morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Plains and the Middle Mississippi Valley through
Wednesday morning...

... Fire weather conditions forecast across the Great Basin...

A front extends from the Northeast roughly southwestward to the
Southern Plains, moves eastward off the Northeast Coast by Tuesday
evening and off most of the Southeast Coast by Wednesday morning.
High moisture content air will be pooling along the boundary
helping produce showers and thunderstorms along and ahead of the
front through late Tuesday night.  The WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over parts of
the southern Mid-Atlantic to the Eastern Gulf Coast through
Wednesday morning.  The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams the most vulnerable through Wednesday morning.  On
Wednesday, the excessive rainfall threat lessens as showers and
thunderstorms continue along the Gulf Coast and parts of the
Southeast into Thursday morning.

Additionally, a weak warm front over the Northern/Central Plains
will move eastward and dissipate overnight Tuesday. The boundary
will produce showers and thunderstorms over parts of the region.
The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Central Plains and the Middle Mississippi Valley
through Wednesday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, and hail.  The severe thunderstorm threat weakens on
Wednesday.

Meanwhile, a plume of moisture surges into the Southwest and
Southern California through Thursday morning.  Impulses of
upper-level energy moving around an upper-level high over the U.
S. and Mexican border will trigger showers and thunderstorms over
parts of Southern California and the Southwest early Wednesday
morning.  The showers and thunderstorms will expand into parts of
the Great Basin and the Central/Southern Rockies through Thursday
morning.  Arid soils, downslope wind, low relative humidity, and
gusty wind, along with dry thunderstorms, will create conditions
favorable for Elevated and Critical Risk of fire weather across
parts of the Great Basin and Southwest.

Furthermore, a front moving southward out of South-Central Canada
on Wednesday will move to parts of the Upper Midwest by Thursday.
The boundary will trigger showers and thunderstorms over parts of
the Upper Midwest Wednesday into Thursday.

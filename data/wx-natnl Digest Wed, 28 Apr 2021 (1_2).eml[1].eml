Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1142 AM CDT Tue Apr 27 2021

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

Location of the current elevated and critical delineation seems
appropriate based on morning visible satellite imagery and dryline
location. Some sustained winds of 20+ mph winds have already been
observed across portions of the southern High Plains. Expanded the
elevated area slightly southwest where elevated conditions are
already being observed. Cooler and more moist conditions are
expected to advect into this area during the afternoon, but at least
a few hours of elevated conditions appear likely before this occurs.

..Bentley.. 04/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 AM CDT Tue Apr 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
A high-amplitude upper-level trough has begun to translate eastward
towards Baja California this morning per recent water-vapor imagery.
Ahead of this wave, strong mid and upper-level flow is beginning to
overspread the Southwest and parts of the southern High Plains.
Surface pressure falls within the left-exit region of this jet
streak, along with broad synoptic ascent ahead of the trough axis,
will help anchor a surface low across east/southeast CO. Increasing
pressure-gradient winds to the south of this low will introduce
another day of fire weather concerns for portions of the southern
High Plains where fuels will support fire spread. While confidence
in the general fire weather threat remains high, details regarding
the spatial extent and duration of critical conditions is somewhat
uncertain.

...Southern High Plains...
Early morning surface observations from eastern NM and far western
TX reveal poor overnight relative humidity recovery with RH values
in the teens to low 20s. A slight moistening trend is anticipated
over the next 12-24 hours as modified Pacific moisture advects
northeastward from Mexico, but this will likely be insufficient to
prevent diurnal RH minimums from falling below 15-20% for most
locations. The previous days of dry, windy weather have maintained
very dry fuels across NM and west TX with large fires recently
reported in NM. Winds will likely increase to similar magnitudes
today as compared to yesterday (Monday) with 20-25 mph winds common
and frequent gusts up to 30-40 mph (and possibly up to 45-50 mph for
a few locations across eastern NM).

Despite the dry conditions and relatively high confidence in gusty
winds, a few factors continue to introduce uncertainty into the
forecast. The areal coverage of critical fire weather conditions may
be confined to a relatively narrow corridor along the NM/TX border
due to an approaching cold front from the west and a dryline to the
east. This dryline is expected to retreat westward during the late
afternoon/evening hours, but the quality of moisture return into
west TX remains uncertain. Additionally, morning IR imagery reveals
increasing cloud cover across the Southwest and southern High
Plains. These clouds will linger for much of the day and may limit
boundary-layer heating/mixing and allow RH values to remain closer
to 20%. As such, locations that manage to see breaks in the clouds
and can sufficiently warm by mid/late afternoon will see the highest
potential for sustained critical conditions.

...Northeast...
Conditions remain relatively dry across portions of MA, southeast
VT, and southern NH after a day of breezy conditions with relatively
low RH. Relative humidity values are expected to fall into the
25-35% range this afternoon, but winds will generally be lighter
(around 10 mph for most locations). Periodic elevated fire weather
conditions are possible where stronger gusts up to 15-20 mph can
occur, but this threat is expected to remain localized.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 27 2021

SYNOPSIS: A low amplitude pattern is forecast over the CONUS during Week-2,
which is expected to result in relatively quiet weather. Temperatures are
likely to be warmer than normal over the eastern CONUS as a weak upper-leve=
l
ridge takes hold for most of the week.

HAZARDS

No hazards are depicted in today's outlook as probabilities are not
anticipated
to reach pre-defined criteria during the forecast period at this time.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 30 - TUESDAY MAY 04:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!suHCDrcDAddgkJbMdWweVc6-z2HlUHY5Qr2kGX0oP-HCjDCLQIAIQawdjSy4B=
4ITG6c3olB-$

FOR WEDNESDAY MAY 05 - TUESDAY MAY 11: The Week-2 pattern is expected to
feature a weak amplitude trough/ridge pattern over the CONUS, with the
exception of a moderately strong shortwave that is forecast to move through
the
eastern U.S. during the middle of the week. There could be localized pocket=
s
of
heavy rainfall along the front that accompanies the shortwave, but there is=
n't
enough confidence of rainfall exceeding 1 inch per 24 hour period to warran=
t
an
associated hazard on the map.



The low amplitude pattern is forecast to return as soon as the shortwave
shifts
out to sea. Such low amplitude patterns are common during the warm season a=
s
the general circulation spins down, resulting in weak baroclinicity through=
out
the midlatitudes. Such an environment is conducive to convectively driven
precipitation, which is especially difficult to forecast on the Week-2
timescales due to its small spatial and temporal scales.



Above average temperatures are favored underneath the ridge for most of the
country. Some of these temperatures, particularly in Texas and the
southeastern
U.S. will likely be above their 85th climatological percentile. However, th=
e
temperatures are favored to remain below 95F in most places and low dew poi=
nts
below 70F are expected, so there is little concern for the potential of
hazardous heat.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Guidance this morning continues the theme of a relatively benign
larger scale pattern evolution as we transition into May. The
upper flow will be highlighted by an amplified ridge over the West
and trough over the East later this week, likely followed by a
period of flatter flow that becomes more amplified again early
next week with trough development over the West and ridging over
the East.  There are a couple of areas where models continue to
show below normal predictability--(a) the extent of phasing
between southern and northern streams late week into the weekend
across the northern tier states, as evidenced by erratic embedded
system run to run timing flip-flops; and (b) the westward extend
of precipitation along the Gulf Coast during the weekend.  There
has been a general model trend this morning for a faster eastward
progression of the northern stream energy.  Meanwhile, the ECMWF
and the CMC favor more QPF to linger over the western Gulf Coast
region due to a much slower progression of an upper low/trough
over southern Texas relative to the GFS/GEFS.  Both the EC and CMC
ensemble means are more progressive though.  Given the
uncertainty, opted again to take a middle-of-the-road approach
with a composite blend of the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, 00Z ECMWF/EC
ensemble mean and a smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC
mean, with increasing proportion of the ensemble means toward Day
7. This blend yielded a faster northern stream progression while
maintaining a weak reflection of a western Gulf Coast wave along a
warm front that later washes out as it lifts into the East Coast
early next week.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Uncertain upper trough energies are slated to focus convergence
into wavy lead fronts, with moisture and instability pooling
contributing to enhance rainfall that will spread over the East
Friday.  The front will settle over Florida to remain a focus for
convection into the weekend while some precipitation may linger
into the western Gulf Coast region.  Meanwhile, an amplified upper
ridge over the West will spread much above normal temperatures
with 15-20+F above normal anomalies Friday into Saturday across
the West and into the High Plains.  Some locations may reach daily
records for highs/warm lows.  An approaching Pacific trough aloft
and leading cold front will start a pronounced cooling trend back
toward climatology by the weekend and focus generally modest
Pacific Northwest to northern Rockies precipitation.  Steady
system progression and lead impulse ejections may combine with
measured Plains cyclogenesis/frontogenesis to favor an emerging
pattern focusing rainfall over the northern to central High Plains
early next week that should later shift eastward along an
increasingly sharp front extending into the Northeast with above
normal temperatures for much of the East and the South.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue April 27 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 03 - 07 2021

Dynamical model solutions are in good agreement regarding a transient 500-h=
Pa
flow pattern across the forecast domain during the outlook period. Ridging =
is
forecast to build across the eastern CONUS early in the period. As a result=
, a
tilt toward near to above normal heights is favored for much of the eastern
half of the CONUS. Both the ECMWF and Canadian ensembles depict stronger
ridging in the central Pacific compared to yesterday, which favors more
amplified troughing downstream. As a result, these models are more robust
bringing shortwave troughs into the western CONUS. The GEFS is comparativel=
y
weaker with the Pacific ridge and maintains positive height anomalies over
parts of the West. Due to the good agreement between the ECMWF and Canadian
ensembles, the Canadian was weighted more so than usual in the 6-10 day man=
ual
blend, which depicts near normal heights across most of the western CONUS, =
and
negative height anomalies across Alaska.

The low amplitude synoptic pattern featuring mean Pacific flow in the West =
and
positive height anomalies over the eastern CONUS favors increased
probabilities
for above normal temperatures across most of the CONUS, with the highest
probabilities (>60%) across parts of Texas and the Eastern Seaboard. This i=
s
consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Probabilities for belo=
w
normal temperatures are increased across much of Alaska, and extending into
the
Pacific Northwest underneath the greater influence of troughing.

Probabilities for below normal precipitation remain elevated for much of th=
e
south-central and western CONUS due to weak mid-level flow. However, increa=
sed
troughing in the West compared to yesterday promotes enhanced chances for
above
normal precipitation across the Pacific Northwest, along with a more active
downstream pattern across the central and eastern CONUS. The ECMWF reforeca=
st
tool now depicts a wetter forecast for the eastern half of the CONUS compar=
ed
to yesterday. Weak surface low pressure is forecast to move out of the Rock=
ies
in the mid to later portion of the period, bringing enhanced moisture and a=
n
associated frontal boundary through the East. Although the ECMWF depicts
enhanced probabilities for above normal precipitation across the Southeast =
and
Lower Mississippi Valley, the GEFS is noticeably drier, keeping much of the
precipitation further north. As a result, probabilities for above normal
precipitation are increased across portions of the Northern Plains eastward=
 to
the Northeast, with near normal precipitation favored to the south, where t=
he
climatologies are slightly higher and there is more model uncertainty. Acro=
ss
Alaska, a tighter mid-level pressure gradient and enhanced westerly flow
resulting from troughing over the Bering Sea favor increased chances for ab=
ove
normal precipitation across the southern Mainland, the Aleutians, and the
Panhandle, as depicted in the consolidation forecast tool. Near normal
precipitation chances are increased for the remainder of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by a transient, low amplitude pattern across much o=
f
the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 05 - 11 2021

Weak, transient mid-level flow is predicted across North America throughout
the
week-2 period resulting in a somewhat uncertain forecast. The GEFS, ECMWF, =
and
Canadian ensembles depict weakly positive height anomalies across much of t=
he
interior CONUS, with the ECMWF being more east with the positive height
anomaly
center compared to the GEFS, and the Canadian falling in between. There is
increased amplification over the Pacific compared to yesterday, with increa=
sed
ridging in the Central Pacific and more amplified troughing closer to the W=
est
Coast of the CONUS. The manual height blend for the 8-14 day period depicts
near normal heights for most of the CONUS and Alaska, except for portions o=
f
the east-central CONUS where slightly positive height anomalies are favored=
.

Increased probabilities for above normal temperatures are depicted for most=
 of
the CONUS from the Southern Rockies eastward to the Atlantic Coast. The
ridging
is predicted to decrease in amplitude compared to the 6-10 day period allow=
ing
for a decrease in mid-level heights across portions of the northern tier of
the
CONUS, and resulting in temperatures closer to normal for these areas.
Continued enhanced troughing across Alaska favors increased probabilities f=
or
near to below normal temperatures across most of the state. A slight tilt
toward above normal temperatures is highlighted over the Aleutians due to a
greater influence from the ridging to the south, and across the eastern
Mainland, consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools.

The 8-14 day precipitation forecast features increased probabilities for ne=
ar
to below normal precipitation across the southern half of the CONUS, and
enhanced chances for above normal precipitation across the northern tier.
Increased troughing in the West favors the development of one or more surfa=
ce
low pressure systems to eject out of the Rockies. Although these systems ar=
e
forecast to be weak, the less amplified ridging in the eastern CONUS would
favor these disturbances tracking through the northern CONUS or southern
Canada, bringing enhanced frontally focused precipitation across portions o=
f
the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast.
Probabilities for above normal precipitation are elevated across much of
Mainland Alaska, the Panhandle, and the Aleutians, consistent with continue=
d
westerly to southwesterly mid-level flow.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a weakly amplified pattern and increased uncertainty in the dynamical model
guidance in terms of the pattern evolution throughout the period.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Guidance this morning continues the theme of a relatively benign
larger scale pattern evolution as we transition into May. The
upper flow will be highlighted by an amplified ridge over the West
and trough over the East later this week, likely followed by a
period of flatter flow that becomes more amplified again early
next week with trough development over the West and ridging over
the East.  There are a couple of areas where models continue to
show below normal predictability--(a) the extent of phasing
between southern and northern streams late week into the weekend
across the northern tier states, as evidenced by erratic embedded
system run to run timing flip-flops; and (b) the westward extend
of precipitation along the Gulf Coast during the weekend.  There
has been a general model trend this morning for a faster eastward
progression of the northern stream energy.  Meanwhile, the ECMWF
and the CMC favor more QPF to linger over the western Gulf Coast
region due to a much slower progression of an upper low/trough
over southern Texas relative to the GFS/GEFS.  Both the EC and CMC
ensemble means are more progressive though.  Given the
uncertainty, opted again to take a middle-of-the-road approach
with a composite blend of the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, 00Z ECMWF/EC
ensemble mean and a smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC
mean, with increasing proportion of the ensemble means toward Day
7. This blend yielded a faster northern stream progression while
maintaining a weak reflection of a western Gulf Coast wave along a
warm front that later washes out as it lifts into the East Coast
early next week.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Uncertain upper trough energies are slated to focus convergence
into wavy lead fronts, with moisture and instability pooling
contributing to enhance rainfall that will spread over the East
Friday.  The front will settle over Florida to remain a focus for
convection into the weekend while some precipitation may linger
into the western Gulf Coast region.  Meanwhile, an amplified upper
ridge over the West will spread much above normal temperatures
with 15-20+F above normal anomalies Friday into Saturday across
the West and into the High Plains.  Some locations may reach daily
records for highs/warm lows.  An approaching Pacific trough aloft
and leading cold front will start a pronounced cooling trend back
toward climatology by the weekend and focus generally modest
Pacific Northwest to northern Rockies precipitation.  Steady
system progression and lead impulse ejections may combine with
measured Plains cyclogenesis/frontogenesis to favor an emerging
pattern focusing rainfall over the northern to central High Plains
early next week that should later shift eastward along an
increasingly sharp front extending into the Northeast with above
normal temperatures for much of the East and the South.

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible from the Southern
Plains to the Ohio Valley through Thursday...

...Fire danger narrows to the Southern/Central High Plains this
evening...

...Above average temperatures to be found across both the eastern
and western United States...

A busy spring weather pattern is in store for the central U.S. and
portions of the East over the next few days. The focus for the
active weather will be driven by an upper-level low currently
located over the Southwest and a slow-moving frontal boundary that
extends from the Northeast to the southern High Plains. The
biggest weather hazard associated with this system will be
multiple days of thunderstorms and heavy rain that will extend
across a large section of the country from Texas to the Ohio
Valley. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a slight risk of
severe thunderstorms for three separate areas this evening. The
areas of concern include central Wisconsin, portions of northeast
Colorado, southwest Nebraska, and northwest Kansas, as well as
much of the Southern Plains from south-central Texas to western
Missouri. Damaging wind gusts and large hail may accompany the
developing thunderstorms, with isolated tornadoes possible across
the Southern Plains and central High Plains. Heavy rain could also
lead to isolated flash flooding in these regions tonight.
Meanwhile, high elevation snow is expected to continue across the
central and southern Rockies through Wednesday afternoon. Winter
Storm Warnings remain in effect across north-central Colorado for
snow accumulations up to 12 inches.

As the frontal boundary slowly inches eastward on Wednesday,
additional thunderstorms and multiple rounds of heavy rain are
forecast to occur from the Southern Plains to Ohio Valley. The
best chance for severe weather will be confined to central Texas
and Oklahoma, where SPC has highlighted the region as having a
slight risk of severe thunderstorms. However, thunderstorms will
impact other areas and are likely to bring summer-like downpours
across the Ohio and Lower/Middle Mississippi valleys. Thus, WPC
has issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall across a large area
from southwest Ohio to south-central Texas. Through Thursday
night, as much as 2 to 4 inches of rain could fall across this
region, with locally high amounts possible. This could lead to
instances of scattered flash flooding for locations that receive
multiple rounds of heavy rain.

Elsewhere across the Lower 48, much of the West, Mid-Atlantic, and
Southeast will remain dry through Thursday. High temperatures will
soar 10 to 20 degrees above average and into the 80s on Wednesday
and Thursday throughout the Mid-Atlantic and interior Northwest.
Fire weather will also remain a concern through this evening
across the southern and central High Plains, where Red Flag
Warnings have been issued.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Tue Apr 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

Expanded the elevated area in the Trans Pecos northeastward into
portions of West Texas and eastern New Mexico based on the latest
high resolution guidance.

In addition, added an elevated area from eastern Montana to western
North Dakota. High resolution guidance shows drier surface
conditions and forecast soundings show mixing in excess of 3 km
which should allow for significant drying at the surface. Even if
relative humidity remains in the 20s, 20+ mph sustained winds appear
increasingly likely which supports an elevated delineation. Fuels in
the area have recovered recently with moist and cool conditions, but
dry and breezy conditions today should provide enough drying of fine
fuels to support the risk for some fire spread tomorrow.

..Bentley.. 04/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Tue Apr 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
The main synoptic wave, currently off the coast of Baja California,
will continue to shift into the southern High Plains through
Wednesday. A weak surface low is forecast to evolve over west Texas,
which will induce westerly downslope flow across southeast NM into
the Trans Pecos region of Texas. Further north, a building surface
high will drive breezy northerly winds across the Great Basin as
well as a cold front across the Northern Plains. Despite the
high-amplitude nature of the upper-level pattern, scattered
precipitation chances across the Southwest and southern Plains and
weak synoptic surface features will limit most fire weather
concerns.

...Trans Pecos...
Westerly winds are forecast to increase to 15-20 mph across most of
southwest TX and far southeast NM. Wind gusts up to 30 mph are
possible, especially for locations that typically see terrain
enhancements. Downslope warming and drying will help drive RH
reductions generally into the 15-25% range. While a few instances of
critical conditions are possible, most ensemble guidance suggests
sustained elevated conditions are more likely. Additionally, notable
spread in deterministic guidance introduces some uncertainty into
the duration and coverage of the fire weather threat. Forecast
refinements are likely as guidance comes into better agreement and
observed trends become apparent.

...Dakotas...
Building surface high pressure over the Pacific Northwest will help
drive a cold front southeastward from eastern MT into the Dakotas.
Modest cold advection within a dry air mass should allow for some
degree of boundary-layer mixing and may support RH reductions
between 20-30% immediately behind the cold front. Post-frontal winds
up to 15-20 mph may support a few hours of elevated fire weather
conditions for the region. However, confidence in the relative
humidity forecast remains low and precludes a risk area at this
time.

...Southern Colorado River Basin...
Northerly pressure-gradient winds are forecast to increase to 15-20
mph across much of the southern Great Basin and southern CO River
Valley by Wednesday afternoon. This should coincide with diurnal
humidity reductions to around 15% from southern NV into southern
CA/southwest AZ. While elevated, to potentially critical, fire
weather conditions are likely, limited fuels and recent rainfall
suggest the overall fire potential is low. Trends will be monitored
and the fire weather threat reassessed in subsequent updates.

Scattered showers and thunderstorms have brought beneficial rainfall
to portions of the Southwest over the past 24 hours, and additional
rain chances are expected through the day today across most of New
Mexico and west Texas. However, a few areas of the southern High
Plains remain dry, particularly over the Trans Pecos region of
southwest Texas. Increasing winds this afternoon will support a
regional fire weather concern. Further north, surface high pressure
will continue to build over the Pacific Northwest, driving a weak
cold front southeastward across the northern Plains.

...Trans Pecos...
An upper-level trough remains in place over northwest Mexico and
will gradually translate east through the day. Strong mid and
upper-level flow will reside over the southern Plains today, and
surface pressure falls will maintain a weak low over central TX.
Westerly downslope winds will increase to 15-25 mph behind a dryline
draped to the south of the low. Frequent gusts up to 30 mph will be
possible, and RH reductions into the 10-20% range appear likely. A
few locations may see critical conditions, but a slight influx of
boundary-layer moisture will make widespread elevated conditions
more likely. The elevated risk area has been trimmed to exclude
regions that have recently received rainfall from early-morning
thunderstorms, and additional refinements may be needed if
convection develops further south towards the Fort Stockton, TX
area.

...Northern Plains...
A cold front is forecast to progress from eastern MT into the
western Dakotas this afternoon. Dry air moving in behind the front,
along with weak cold advection, will help relative humidity values
fall into the 20-25% range. Breezy post-frontal winds will be
sustained between 15-20 mph and should support a few hours of
elevated conditions. Scattered light showers are possible along the
front across south-central ND, which may limit the duration of the
fire weather concern. Recent reports from Montana indicate that
fuels are mainly receptive across the northeastern portion of the
state. As such, the risk area has been adjusted to highlight the
area with the highest probability of sustained elevated conditions
over receptive fuels.

...Weekend south-central U.S. heavy rainfall/convection threat...
...North-central to east-central heavy rainfall/convection threat
early next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Models and ensembles may have converged upon a more well clustered
solution through much of the medium range period, bolstering
forecast confidence to average or better levels. The WPC product
suite was primarily derived from a composite blend of the 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF ensembles. Recent GFS/GEFS runs
trended in this direction, but were more progressive overall until
finally the latest 00 UTC runs.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A storm over the Canadian Maritimes Saturday will support strong
winds back over the Northeast as an amplified northern stream
upper troughing working over the region. A wavy trailing front
will stall down across Florida and the Gulf of Mexico and may
focus some locally enhanced weekend rainfall, but guidance has
backed off on amounts.

Meanwhile, slow moving southern stream troughing over the southern
Plains this weekend best favors a threat of heavy rainfall and
strong convection from Texas to the lower MS Valley as fueled by
deepening Gulf of Mexico moisture and instability. The system is
expected to shear northeastward into early next week along with a
waning rainfall focus across the east-central then eastern U.S.
with lead return flow.

Upstream, an approaching Pacific trough aloft and leading cold
front will start a pronounced cooling trend by the weekend and
focus generally modest Pacific Northwest to north-central Rockies
precipitation, albeit with a threat of terrain enhanced spring
snows. Steady system progression and lead impulse ejections may
combine with measured north-central Plains
cyclogenesis/frontogenesis and TX dryline formation to favor an
emerging pattern for ample Plains convection by early next week
that shifts eastward near an increasingly sharp and wavy front
from the east-central U.S. to the Northeast. Expect above normal
warm sector temperatures for the East and the South.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough currently residing over northwest Mexico is
forecast to gradually shift into the southern Plains by late
Thursday. As this occurs, a cold front will push southward along the
southern High Plains and usher in slightly cooler temperatures and
northerly winds. Additionally, this will bring rainfall chances to
portions of the Southwest, including the southern High Plains where
fuels have been dry. However, areas along the northeast New
Mexico/Texas border that do not see rainfall may experience a
localized fire weather concern within the post-frontal air mass.

...Northwest New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle...
Northerly winds are expected to increase into the 15-20 mph range
along the southern High Plains in the wake of an early-morning cold
frontal passage. Strong mid-level winds within the cold advection
may support wind gusts between 25-30 mph during the day. Although
there is some spread in guidance, dry air advecting into the region
and patchy clouds may support RH reductions down to 20% (and
elevated fire weather conditions) across northeast NM and the
western TX Panhandle. However, recent guidance has shown reasonable
agreement in wetting rainfall occurring over this region over the
next 24 hours, and possibly into Thursday morning. This would help
mitigate fuel readiness and limit any fire weather concerns. An
elevated fire weather concern may evolve by Thursday afternoon, but
this will be conditional on the coverage of wetting rainfall. An
elevated risk area may need to be introduced in subsequent updates.

...There is a Moderate risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Middle/Lower Mississippi and the Southern Plains...

...There is a Slight risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southern Plains and the Lower Great Lakes through Thursday
morning...

...There is a chance for record-breaking hi-low temperatures over
the East and below-average temperatures over the Southern
Rockies/Southwest into the Central High Plains...

A slow-moving front extending from the northern Mid-Atlantic
westward to Michigan, then southwest to the Central/Southern
Plains will inch eastward off the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Coast by
Friday.  The southern part of the boundary will extend from the
Southeast to the Central/Western Gulf Coast on Friday. Showers and
thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the front from the
Middle Mississippi Valley eastward to parts of the Northeast.  The
SPC has issued a Slight risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Lower Great Lakes through Thursday morning. The main hazards with
the severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Additionally, showers and thunderstorms will develop along and
ahead of the front over parts of the Central/Southern Plains.  The
SPC has issued a Slight risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southern Plains through Thursday morning.  The main hazards
with the severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  There is a
10% or greater probability of two-inch hail over parts of
south-central Texas.

The thunderstorms will produce heavy rain from parts of the Ohio
Valley to the Southern Plains.  The WPC has issued a Moderate risk
of excessive rainfall over parts of the Middle/Lower Mississippi
and the Southern Plains through Thursday morning.  The heavy rain
associated with the thunderstorm will produce numerous areas of
flash flooding over this region.  Many streams may flood,
potentially affecting larger rivers.  The severe threat will
lessen somewhat on Thursday as showers and thunderstorms continue
along and ahead of the boundary.  The showers and thunderstorms
will continue to develop along and ahead of the front through
Friday morning.  In the warm sector, south of the front, there is
a chance for record-breaking hi-low temperatures over the East on
Wednesday into Thursday.

Meanwhile, under the upper-level low over the Four Corners Region
rain and higher elevation snow will develop over parts of the
Central/Southern Rockies and the Southwest on Wednesday, ending on
Thursday morning.  Additionally, under the upper low, temperatures
will be 10 to 15 degrees below average on Wednesday.

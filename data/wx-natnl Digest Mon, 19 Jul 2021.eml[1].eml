Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1147 AM CDT Sun Jul 18 2021

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

The northward surge in monsoonal moisture can be seen this morning
in GOES satellite imagery arcing from Southern California to Nevada
and Arizona/Utah. Isolated thunderstorms have also been observed
over the last few hours along the northern periphery of the moisture
plume, with lightning detection networks showing occasional
cloud-to-ground lightning. The plume of mid-level moisture is also
evident in this mornings regional RAOBs with precipitable water
values at NKX - Miramar, CA at 1.84 inches (near a daily record) and
over 900 J/kg of most unstable convective available potential
energy.

...California/Nevada...
Current forecast remains on track, with thunderstorms
spreading/developing northward through the day/overnight across
California/Nevada as mid-level moisture surges northward. While
mixed wet/dry modes are expected, fuels are extremely dry across
much of the area (ERC values generally exceeding the 95th
percentile) suggesting new lightning ignitions are possible --
especially along the periphery of any heavier rainfall. The greatest
threat is expected along along/near the foothills and higher terrain
of the Sierras.

...Idaho/Wyoming/Montana...
Thunderstorm coverage is forecast to be very isolated this afternoon
across northern portions of the Great Basin and the northern Rockies
with thunderstorm coverage largely tied to terrain features.
Little-to-no precipitation is expected with this activity and fuels
remain extremely dry (ERC values exceeding the 95th percentile)
suggesting new fire ignitions are possible with any activity.

..Elliott.. 07/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0233 AM CDT Sun Jul 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-ridging will remain in place across the Inter-mountain West as
mid-level troughing persists across the Pacific Northwest. Modest
flow aloft accompanying the mid-level trough will overspread the
Cascades/northern Sierra, promoting dry and breezy conditions
favoring some fire-spread potential atop and to the lee of the
higher terrain. Mid-level moisture/buoyancy pivoting around the
upper ridge will also support at least isolated high-based
thunderstorm development, from the California Coast to the northern
Rockies, where dry strikes will be possible.

...California Coast to the northern Rockies...
Deeper mid-level moisture (i.e. 0.75-1.0 inch precipitable water
values) will gradually progress northwestward from the Lower
Colorado River Basin to support isolated thunderstorm development
across parts of the Great Basin into the Northern Rockies. Likewise,
a mid-level moisture surge is also expected along the windward side
of the Sierra, with isolated thunderstorm potential also expected
across much of California. Storms in Nevada/California may have a
higher ratio of wet strikes. However, record dry fuels may
compensate to support efficient lightning-ignition rates. Farther
north into the Northern Rockies, storms are expected to be
relatively drier. However, coverage is expected to be more sparse.
Nonetheless, fuels are also very receptive to fire spread in these
areas, with a dense enough storm coverage expected to warrant
isolated dry thunderstorm highlights.

...Northeast California, northwest Nevada, southeast Oregon...
With the onset of diurnal heating/boundary-layer mixing, westerly
downslope flow along the southern Cascades/northern Sierra will
promote Elevated conditions (i.e. widespread 15 mph sustained
westerly surface winds and 15-20% RH). These conditions will be most
likely in the higher terrain, leeward to the Harney Basin for at
least a few hours around afternoon peak heating.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0142 PM CDT Sun Jul 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN MONTANA AND FAR NORTHEAST
WYOMING...

...Northern Plains...
While sustained surface wind speeds will generally remain at or
below critical criteria (e.g., < 20 mph), extremely critical minimum
RH values coupled with extremely dry fuels (ERCs greater than 98th
percentile across much of the area) will support a critical fire
weather threat tomorrow afternoon into the late evening. Only minor
changes were needed to the Critical/Elevated areas based on the
latest high-resolution ensemble guidance.

...California Coast to the northern Rockies...
Primary adjustment with this outlook update was to remove portions
of central Nevada from the isolated dry thunderstorm area. The
latest high-resolution guidance suggests a rather high coverage of
wetting rainfall across this region and ERC percentiles are also
lower compared to farther north across the northern Great Basin.

...Columbia River Gorge...
Westerly low-level winds are forecast to increase late Day 2/Monday
afternoon coincident with a dry cold frontal passage. While RH
values will tend to increase through late evening, elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions are possible as minimum RH
values of 20-30% overlap 15-20 mph sustained surface wind speeds for
at least a few hours from mid/late afternoon to late evening. Fuels
across this region are also extremely dry with ERC exceeding the
98th percentile.

Please see previous discussion for more information on tomorrow's
fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 07/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0255 AM CDT Sun Jul 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper ridge across the Interior West flattens across the
Northern Rockies as upper troughing propagates eastward from the
Pacific Northwest tomorrow/Monday. The eastward progression of the
upper trough will in turn encourage surface lee troughing across the
northern High Plains, with dry and breezy southerly flow likely
mainly across eastern Montana. Otherwise, deep-layer ascent
associated with the impinging upper trough will overspread much of
California into the northern Rockies, promoting at least isolated
dry thunderstorm development.

...Eastern Montana into northeast Wyoming...
A pressure gradient will become established across the northern High
Plains as surface lee troughing intensifies tomorrow afternoon. The
latest guidance consensus suggests 20 mph sustained southeasterly
surface flow will overlap with 15-20% RH for several hours during
the afternoon. While the expected surface winds are somewhat
marginal, Critical highlights were still introduced for portions of
eastern Montana to account for the highly receptive fuels to fire
spread.

...California Coast to the northern Rockies...
Mid-level moisture will continue to spread northwestward across the
Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest through the period tomorrow,
with several areas potentially witnessing at/above 1 inch
precipitable water values. While several storms will produce
predominantly wet strikes, at least a few dry strikes are possible,
especially along the periphery of storm cores. Given the anomalously
dry/receptive fuels in place, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights
have been introduced despite the potential for some wetting rains.

...Heat will continue over the northern Plains and extend into the
Upper Midwest...

...Overview...

Models and ensembles continue to advertise a recurring synoptic
scale pattern across the the U.S. through the medium range period
where a persistent upper high anchored over or near the central
Rockies will be contrasted with a multiple shortwaves traveling
downstream toward a mean trough across the Northeast into eastern
Canada.  Meanwhile, an upper low just off the British Columbia
coast in the short-range period is forecast to push a front
against the upper high and should bring only slight moderation of
the hot weather into the northern Plains.  On the other hand the
combination of an upper vortex sliding across the southern Plains
and monsoonal moisture over and just west of the Four Corners
states will promote episodes of rain and thunderstorms along with
below normal high temperatures to the south of the upper high.
The eastern U.S. should see near to below normal temperatures
under mean troughing aloft while multiple fronts will likely
provide episodes of showers and thunderstorms.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

As has been the case lately, models have generally locked into the
aforementioned synoptic pattern in which agreement is good for the
mean flow while some spread exists for the embedded details.  The
faster northwesterly flow with multiple shortwaves downstream from
the upper high continues to introduce some uncertainty into the
forecast.  The 00Z EC mean was faster in carrying a batch of rain
across the Great Lakes late next week than the 06Z GEFS mean.  A
compromise of the two solutions was adopted.  Over the southern
Plains, models are now more eager to push the pre-frontal rainfall
farther south into southern Texas midweek with a flatter frontal
wave.  Meanwhile, there has been a general increase in the
monsoonal rainfall amounts across central Arizona where heavy rain
threat appears to have increased through the medium range period.
By next weekend, some deterministic models are indicating low
pressure development across the Great Lakes but this scenario is
not supported by the ensemble means at this time.  Finally, models
have trended slightly faster with the low pressure wave over the
northern High Plains next weekend.

A general model compromise among the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used
to compose the morning WPC medium range
package.  A smaller weight was given to the 06Z GFS beginning on
Day 5 when the predicted flow pattern appears too fast across the
Northeast.  A greater weight toward the ensemble means was used
for Days 6-7 to handle the uncertainty.  The results only deviated
slightly in details compared with the previous forecast package.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Portions of the northern Plains into Upper Midwest will likely see
highs up to 10-15F above normal on multiple days.  Highest
anomalies and best potential for parts of eastern Montana and the
Dakotas to reach at least 100F should be during Wednesday-Friday.
A front extending from Canadian low pressure will likely bring
temperatures down a little from west to east into the weekend but
perhaps by only a few degrees or so.  Plus 10F anomalies for highs
may also reach southward into the central Plains around late week.

Another period of enhanced monsoonal rainfall will be possible
over the Four Corners states after midweek, with some moisture
possibly reaching a little farther northward toward the northern
Rockies as well.  There is an increasing threat of heavy rain
across central Arizona where monsoonal moisture has increased.
The unsettled regime will keep highs up to 5-10F or so below
normal over the southwestern U.S.  Over Texas expect rainfall to
continue trending lighter and more scattered with time while below
normal highs trend somewhat closer to normal.

Lingering moisture along and south of a dissipating southern tier
front may provide localized enhancement to diurnal
showers/thunderstorms into the end of the week.  The northeastern
quadrant of the lower 48 should see areas of rain/thunderstorms
accompanying the fronts pushed along by flow within the mean
trough aloft.  Some rain may be locally moderate to heavy but
confidence in specifics is fairly low at this time.  Eastern U.S.
temperatures should be near to moderately below normal through the
period with another episode of rainfall possible.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun July 18 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
352 PM EDT Sun Jul 18 2021

Valid 00Z Mon Jul 19 2021 - 00Z Wed Jul 21 2021

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Northeast, Lower Mississippi Valley, and Southern
Rockies/Southwest through Monday morning...

...Excessive heat continues across the Northern Plains and
Northern Great Basin...

...Potential for dry lightning over Central and Northern
California could lead to conditions capable of producing
wildfires...

Low pressure over New England and associated slow-moving cold
front will produce scattered thunderstorms and heavy rain through
Monday morning. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams being the most vulnerable
through Monday morning.

The front over the southern parts of the country will become
quasi-stationary through Tuesday evening.  Showers and
thunderstorms will develop along and near the boundary from the
Southeast to parts of the Central/Southern Plains, as moisture
pools along the front.  The WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through
Monday morning.  On Monday, the excessive rainfall threat moves to
the Southeast Coast and over parts of the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley.

Meanwhile, monsoon moisture will stream into the Southwest and the
Southern Rockies through Tuesday.  The WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams being the
most vulnerable through Monday morning. Sections of central New
Mexico are under Flash Flood Watches.

High temperatures will continue into the triple digits are across
eastern Montana, where a few daily high-temperature records could
be tied or broken. Furthermore, the low temperatures are forecast
to only drop into the 70s at night, making it harder to recover
from the heat after sunset.  Additionally, Excessive Heat Warnings
and Heat Advisories have been issued over the Intermountain West.
Residents are advised to drink plenty of fluids and avoid extended
time outdoors to avoid heat-related illness.  Parts of California
have Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings over the area.
Dry lightning could be a concern for Northern and Central
California as monsoonal moisture enters from the south but
produces very little rain. If thunderstorms do form, extremely dry
fuels struck by lightning could produce new fires.

0144 AM CDT Mon Jul 19 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF EASTERN MONTANA INTO FAR
NORTHEAST WYOMING...

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will gradually weaken across the northern Rockies as a
mid-level trough approaches from the Pacific Northwest. Surface
heating/lee troughing across the northern Rockies will induce a
pressure gradient over eastern Montana, with dry and breezy
conditions supporting wildfire spread expected during the afternoon.
Relatively rich mid-level moisture will continue to pivot around the
mid-level anticyclone and support isolated to scattered
thunderstorms across California to the northern Rockies given
adequate deep-layer lift by the Pacific Northwest mid-level trough.
Modest mid-level winds will also accompany the mid-level trough,
supporting patches of dry and breezy conditions along the West
Coast.

...Northern High Plains...
During the afternoon, 20 mph sustained southeasterly surface winds
will likely overlap with 15-20% RH for at least a few hours. While
the winds are somewhat marginal for Critical highlights, a Critical
area has been maintained for portions of eastern Montana into far
northeast Wyoming given the presence of Critically/record dry fuels.
Areas surrounding the Critical delineation may also experience
several hours of Elevated dry and breezy conditions.

...West Coast - Dry and Breezy Conditions...
As modest southwesterly mid-level flow overspreads the West Coast
through the afternoon, downward mixing within a deep boundary layer,
as well as downslope flow atop and to the lee of the Cascades and
northern Sierra, is expected to support Elevated winds/RH. Elevated
highlights have been added where the more favorable winds/RH are
expected to overlap the longest. Furthermore, at least locally dry
and breezy conditions are expected along the lee of the Coast
Ranges, into parts of the San Joaquin Valley by late afternoon based
on some of the latest high-resolution guidance. Elevated highlights
may be needed in future outlooks if a more widespread area of
favorable overlapping winds/RH becomes evident.

...California to the northern Rockies - Dry Thunderstorms...
Widespread 0.8-1.0 inch precipitable water values will overspread
much of the western/northwest U.S by afternoon, with adequate lift
and buoyancy supporting isolated to scattered thunderstorms. Though
high-based, these storms are expected to produce predominantly wet
strikes. Nonetheless, fuels are Critically/record dry across much of
the Northwest. Efficient lightning-induced ignitions are possible
with drier strikes on the periphery of storm cores, warranting the
maintenance of broad isolated dry thunderstorm highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CDT Mon Jul 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper ridge across the Interior-West will continue to weaken as
a mid-level trough meanders eastward from the Pacific Northwest
tomorrow/Tuesday. Surface lee troughing will continue across the
northern High Plains, promoting modestly dry, breezy flow. Modest
mid-level flow will also support dry and breezy conditions across
higher-terrain areas of the Pacific Northwest. The mid-level trough
will also provide deep-layer ascent across the northwestern U.S,
that in tandem with mid-level moisture will continue to support
isolated to scattered thunderstorm development, with a couple dry
strikes possible.

...Northwestern U.S. - Dry Thunderstorm Potential...
By tomorrow/Tuesday afternoon, mainly wet thunderstorms are expected
to develop to the lee of the Cascades into Idaho and Montana given
1+ inch precipitable water values. Still, fuels across the region
are anomalously dry, with efficient lightning-induced fire starts
possible with any strikes peripheral to storm cores.

...Pacific Northwest - Dry and Breezy conditions...
Modest mid-level flow will continue to overspread the Pacific
Northwest, supporting 15+ mph sustained westerly downslope winds in
the higher terrain of and to the lee of the Cascades tomorrow
afternoon. 15-20% RH will coincide with the breezy conditions in
spots, with Elevated highlights introduced for areas most likely to
see overlapping favorable surface winds/RH for at least a few hours.

...Northern High Plains - Dry and Breezy Conditions...
As surface lee troughing continues across portions of Montana into
the northern High Plains, 15+ mph sustained south-southeasterly
winds amid 20% RH will be prevalent through the afternoon over fuels
very receptive to fire spread. At the moment, the expected winds/RH
warrant Elevated highlights. However, a Critical delineation may be
introduced in future outlooks if guidance trends any windier/drier
across the northern High Plains.

...Heat will continue over the northern Plains and extend into the
Upper Midwest...

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show a persistent mean pattern
featuring an upper high situated over the central Rockies/High
Plains while a combination of energy from northern/eastern Canada
and flowing around the northern side of the upper high will feed
into an eastern U.S. upper trough.  Northeastern Pacific troughing
will be in the process of reloading at the start of the period as
an ejecting upper low/trough reaches western Canada as of early
Thursday.  This upper low should continue into central Canada and
possibly merge with northern Canada flow.  The upstream trough
should approach the Pacific Northwest late in the period.  This
pattern will maintain well above normal temperatures over the
northern Plains and vicinity, with a front anchored by the
Canadian system likely bringing only a modest cooling trend.
Fronts reaching the East will bring episodes of showers/storms and
keep temperatures near to slightly below normal.  Farther south, a
weak upper low over the southern Plains and an active
Southwest/Four Corners monsoon will promote periods of
rain/thunderstorms and below normal high temperatures over those
areas.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Within the agreeable mean pattern there is still a struggle to
resolve embedded details whose smaller scale leads to low
predictability multiple days out in time.  One persistent
uncertainty is the details of short-range energy from Hudson Bay
and northward reaching the Northeast U.S./eastern Canada by
Friday-Saturday.  Models have been quite divergent and
inconsistent in the path of a compact upper low which could either
remain at high latitudes or drop into or just north of Maine.  At
the moment the GFS is the only model to drop it southward--the
opposite of 24 hours ago when the majority brought down the low
versus a mere shortwave in the GFS.  Upstream, a model/mean
approach tones down run-to-run variability for timing of the
Canadian system and trailing front that extends into the northern
U.S.  There has been a signal for leading low pressure to track
approximately from the northern Plains through the Upper Great
Lakes into the Northeast U.S./southeastern Canada but with a lot
of spread and variability for specifics.  The 12Z/18Z GFS runs
looked particularly questionable with how strongly this low
developed by early next week, while the new 00Z run appears more
reasonable.  Meanwhile guidance displays various ideas for the
path of the weak upper low over the southern Plains.  The 12Z
ECMWF was on its own with a more eastward drift.  GFS/CMC runs
offer potential for it to retrograde toward the Southwest U.S.
late in the period.  By next Monday the 18Z GFS was on the strong
side with various impulses reaching the Southwest/Great Basin with
the ridge adjusting farther east into the Plains than consensus.

The various forecast uncertainties led to a blended/mean approach
to represent the most agreeable aspects of the pattern and an
intermediate/majority scenario for the contentious details.
Guidance weight began with mostly operational model emphasis on
Thursday and trended somewhat more to the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means
late.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Portions of the northern Plains into Upper Midwest will likely see
highs up to 10-15F above normal on multiple days.  Highest
anomalies and best potential for parts of eastern Montana and the
Dakotas to reach at least 100F should be during Thursday-Friday,
when plus 10F anomalies for highs may also extend into the central
Plains.  A front extending from Canadian low pressure will likely
bring temperatures down a little from west to east into the
weekend but perhaps by only a few degrees or so.  Northern High
Plains temperatures could rebound some next Monday as another
upper trough approaching the Pacific Northwest could give a
northward push to the front stalled over the northern Rockies/High
Plains.

Another period of enhanced monsoonal rainfall appears likely over
the Four Corners states from late this week onward.  Some moisture
could reach a little farther northward and westward as well.
Coverage and intensity of rainfall will depend in part on
specifics of low-predictability impulses tracking around the
central Rockies upper high, including possibly the small upper low
initially over the southern Plains.  Rain/thunderstorms could be
heavy at times with highest totals during the period currently
expected over central Arizona.  The unsettled regime will keep
highs up to 5-10F or so below normal over the southwestern U.S.
Over Texas expect rainfall to continue trending lighter and more
scattered with time while below normal highs trend somewhat closer
to normal.

Lingering moisture along and south of a dissipating southern tier
front may provide localized enhancement to diurnal
showers/thunderstorms into the end of the week.  Locations from
the Upper Midwest through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic should see at least a couple episodes of
rain and thunderstorms with fronts that reach the eastern U.S.
Models are providing a general signal that some of this activity
could be locally moderate to heavy but continue to vary
considerably for the details which may take into the short-range
time frame to come into better focus.  The upper trough over the
Northeast will keep highs over that region moderately below
normal, especially late this week into the weekend.  The remainder
of the East should see readings within a few degrees on either
side of normal.

...Heavy rain and scattered flash flooding possible between the
Southeast and Southern Plains today, with the Southwest Monsoon
remaining active as well...

...Excessive heat continues across the Northern Plains...

...Elevated to critical fire weather found throughout the northern
High Plains, northern Great Basin, as well as northern
California...

A slow moving cold front extending from the Mid-Atlantic to the
Southern Plains is expected spark additional thunderstorms
throughout much of the south-central and southeastern United
States today. The main hazards associated with these storms are
expected to be from frequent lightning and flash flooding.
Isolated rainfall totals greater than 2 inches will be possible
with any thunderstorms that remain stationary for an extended
period of time and could lead to flooding across low-lying areas.
This frontal boundary and related rainfall chances are forecast to
linger over the region through midweek, while slowly inching
southward across Texas. Farther north, thunderstorms forming ahead
of an approaching cold front this afternoon and evening may
produce damaging wind gusts and large hail from central North
Dakota to northern Minnesota. Meanwhile, the Southwest Monsoon
should remain quite active for the foreseeable future and bring
much needed rainfall to this section of the country. However, the
potential for flash flooding will also continue for isolated
locations throughout the Southwest and central Great Basin,
especially over burn scars.

One final day of potentially record-breaking heat is in store for
the northern High Plains today before temperatures drop slightly
by Tuesday. Highs are forecast soar above the century mark and
close to 110 degrees throughout eastern Montana, with upper-90s
found across the rest of the Northern Plains. Excessive Heat
Warnings and Heat Advisories remain in effect for Montana. Cloud
cover and a weak cold front in the vicinity should drop
temperature on Tuesday, but highs will remain above average and
into the upper-90s over much of the Northern Plains.

Along with the above average temperatures, the combination of
extreme drought, gusty winds, and dry lightning could make
conditions ripe throughout the West for new wildfires to form and
spread uncontrollably. Areas of greatest concern today are
expected to be found between the northern High Plains and
California, where dry lightning is most likely over California and
the Northern Great Basin. Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather
Watches stretch from central California to northwest South Dakota.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1246 AM CDT Fri Jun 11 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Dry conditions will persist across much of the Southwest and Great
Basin where fuels are most receptive. However, upper-level height
rises across the western CONUS will result in generally weak flow at
the surface. This will mitigate most fire weather threats, though a
few localized concerns may evolve along the High Plains. Elsewhere,
widespread rain chances and high humidity will limit further
concerns.

...Southeast Montana...
Dry post-frontal conditions are expected by late afternoon as RH
falls into the 15-25% range for many locations. Westerly winds are
expected to gradually increase to near 15 mph and may support
localized elevated conditions where fuels are dry. Recent
precipitation over the region and marginal ERC values will limit the
spatial extent of this concern.

...Southern High Plains...
Relative humidity values are forecast to fall into the 15-20% range
behind a southward moving cold front by late afternoon across parts
of the Texas Panhandle and northeast NM. Post-frontal winds will
likely increase to 15-25 mph, but may be offset spatially from the
lowest humidity. Somewhat low ensemble probabilities of overlapping
low RH/strong winds support this idea, though localized elevated
conditions may develop. Furthermore, fuels across this region are
only modestly receptive with seasonal to below-seasonal ERC values
noted.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CDT Fri Jun 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will become established over the south-central
U.S. over the weekend, resulting in hot and dry, but relatively
calm, conditions across the Southwest. While fuels will continue to
cure, weak surface winds will yield only localized fire weather
concerns. Elsewhere, scattered rain chances and/or weak winds under
a surface high will mitigate additional fire weather threats.

...Southwest...
Localized elevated conditions will be possible along the Mogollon
Rim in AZ and into the Gila region of southwest NM Saturday
afternoon. Although flow will be weak over the region, deep
boundary-layer mixing and terrain-enhancements may result in winds
up to 15-20 mph coincident with RH values near 10%. To the east,
isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible along the southern
Rockies within an upslope flow regime. While wetting precipitation
is expected (and will most likely fall over modestly receptive
fuels), a few dry lightning strikes are possible.

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through next week across
much of the Interior West and at times into the northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...


...Overview...

Guidance agrees that a very strong upper ridge will be centered
over the Four Corners states next week while a mean trough
prevails over the East into about Thursday.  A portion of the
energy from an eastern Pacific upper trough/low will eject
northeastward and around the ridge, bringing a cold front into the
Northwest Tuesday-Wednesday and then continuing across the
northern tier states.  This shortwave energy will eventually help
to kick out the eastern trough late in the week.  The persistence
and strength of the western upper ridge will likely produce a
broad area of temperatures that approach/exceed daily record
values over the Interior West/Rockies on most days next week,
making for a hazardous heat wave event.  Some of this heat will
extend into the northern Plains for a time as well.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The models and means show better than average consensus for the
strength and position of the Four Corners ridge through the
period, leaving the guidance differences for areas around its
periphery.  Within the eastern North America mean trough, there
has been some spread for an eastern Canada upper low that may
track into or just north of New England.  12Z/18Z GFS runs and the
12Z UKMET were on the southern side of the envelope while the 12Z
ECMWF was on the northern side.  Preferred intermediate solution
appears to have support from latest guidance as the 00Z UKMET/GFS
have both adjusted their upper low track somewhat northward from
the prior run and the 00Z ECMWF adjusted southward.  Meanwhile the
models show typical variability for the details of the eastern
Pacific energy that ultimately tracks around the western ridge,
favoring a blend approach that includes some ensemble means later
in the period and which represents the most common elements of
guidance.  Farther south the models and means show an area of
increasing moisture and lower heights aloft/surface pressures
lifting into the Gulf of Mexico, with some signals for possible
tropical development.  By day 7 Friday the manual forecast shows a
surface trough over the western Gulf per an extrapolation of
yesterday's NHC-WPC coordinated forecast.  Monitor future
forecasts for any adjustments.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Within the broad area of heat across the western and northern
U.S., expect the most extreme anomalies to be over the northern
Rockies and High Plains during Monday-Wednesday with highs at
least 20-25F above normal.  Ejection of an eastern Pacific trough
and leading front that crosses northern portions of the West and
continues into the Plains will bring some relief to those areas
but otherwise the West should continue to see highs 10-20F above
normal along with a westward expansion of the heat mid-late week.
Morning lows should also be 10-20F above normal over a majority of
the West through the period, as well as the northern Plains into
Thursday.  The combination of extreme daily temperatures and
duration, as well as being rather early in the season for such an
event, should make this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups.

The eastern trough aloft and associated surface waves/fronts will
produce some areas of rain and thunderstorms of varying intensity
and during mid-late week some moderately below normal
temperatures.  The southern tier may see rain from both a wavy
front and typical diurnal convective activity.  Portions of the
Gulf Coast region could see an increase of rainfall toward the end
of the next week as moisture pushes northward across the Gulf.
Monitor forecasts/National Hurricane Center discussions over the
coming days for the latest information regarding any potential
tropical cyclone development.  The upper trough/surface front
initially near the Pacific Northwest will bring light-moderate
rain to the region during the first half of the week.  Toward late
week this system may produce some rainfall from the northeastern
Plains into the Great Lakes.

...A Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall is in place for parts of
the Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic region through tonight...

...Hot temperatures are likely for the Southern High Plains, and
heat begins building into parts of the West this weekend...

A slow-moving frontal boundary will help to focus moisture across
the Central Appalachians and into southern/central parts of the
Mid-Atlantic today and tonight, causing widespread showers and
thunderstorms. As storms could be slow-moving and portions of the
region have seen very heavy rain over the past day or two,
numerous flash floods are likely, and a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall is in place. Storm chances are likely to lessen there by
Saturday as the front drops southward.

A cold front shifting from the Northern/Central Plains into the
Midwest will also trigger showers and thunderstorms along it over
the next couple of days. Storms should weaken in the north-central
U.S. early this morning as they track eastward, but a Slight Risk
of severe thunderstorms is in place across mainly eastern Kansas
today for damaging wind and hail threats, and isolated flash
floods are possible as well. Also, scattered thunderstorms are
possible in the Southeast, where a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall is delineated today and tonight. Scattered thunderstorms
remain possible across much the eastern third of the country for
the weekend, but without much widespread heavy rain. Meanwhile,
rain chances continue in the Pacific Northwest.

An upper-level ridge will help cause hot weather for the Southwest
and Southern High Plains in particular today, where temperatures
will be well into the 100s and Heat Advisories are in effect.
Another warm day is forecast for the Midwest as well, with
temperatures rising into the 90s. Meanwhile, the West and East
Coasts should generally be below average for highs today.
Beginning this weekend, the ridge is forecast to start building
northward, allowing the Intermountain West and Rockies toward the
Northern Plains to see much above average temperatures, a pattern
that is expected to continue into next week.

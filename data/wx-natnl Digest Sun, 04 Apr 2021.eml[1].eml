Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CDT Sat Apr 03 2021

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

Morning surface observations support the ongoing forecast and only
minor adjustments are needed. Surface observations from the northern
Plains reveal humidity quickly falling into the 30-40% range with
increasing winds in the vicinity of a weak surface trough. This
remains in line with most guidance, and the forecast outlined in the
previous discussion below remains valid.

...East Coast...
Once again, most guidance is over-forecasting RH values along the
East Coast. Observed RH values in the 20-35% are common from GA
northward into the greater New England region. These values should
continue to decrease through the afternoon into the low 20s and
perhaps upper teens. Despite the dry conditions, winds will
generally remain weak and mitigate any robust fire weather concerns.
A few wind gusts upwards of 15 mph will introduce transient and
localized elevated conditions.

...Midwest...
Pressure-gradient winds are forecast to increase through the day to
20-25 mph over eastern IL into IN and OH. Relative humidity values
are currently falling into the 30-35% range, but this is within the
envelope of most ensemble guidance, which suggests RH values will
generally remain just above elevated thresholds (in the 25-30%
range). However, periods of elevated conditions are possible for
most locations in the region.

..Moore.. 04/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0126 AM CDT Sat Apr 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
A sprawling upper-level ridge will be in place across the CONUS
today. Stronger winds aloft will remain across the northern tier
states. A subtle shortwave will likely move through the northern
Rockies into the western Dakotas. At the surface, strong surface
heating and the influence of the shortwave trough will help develop
a surface trough in the northern High Plains. This feature will
shift eastward during the day into the Dakotas.

...Northern Plains...
Early Saturday surface observations show dry air in parts of the
central and northern Plains. Given the weak surface pressure
pattern, this airmass is not expected to modify or move
substantially until the surface trough induces enhanced southerly
winds during the afternoon in SD/ND. This will likely support areas
of 15-25% with 15-20 mph winds. Wind approaching 25 mph may occur in
a narrow corridor right near the boundary. Elevated to locally
critical fire weather is possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0148 PM CDT Sat Apr 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

Only minor adjustments are needed for the ongoing forecast. Recent
guidance continues to suggest mid to high-level clouds will
overspread much of MT through the day, which will limit the degree
of daytime heating and diurnal RH reduction. To the south,
confidence has increased in a swath of elevated to locally critical
conditions across the southern to central High Plains.

..Moore.. 04/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0217 AM CDT Sat Apr 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will continue across most of the U.S. on Sunday.
A trough will move into the Pacific Northwest later in the period.
Increasing westerly flow across the Northern Rockies will help
deepen a lee trough in the northern High Plains into adjacent
Plains.

...Montana...
Increasing flow aloft will coincide with a modestly enhanced surface
pressure gradient. 15-20 mph winds are possible with some higher
values in wind-prone areas. RH may drop to around 20% in some
locations, but the potential for mid/upper-level clouds will likely
impact how widespread the overall fire weather risk becomes.
Marginally elevated fire weather concerns are still expected,
however.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
While moisture return will be increasing to the east, a zone of dry
air appears probable near the surface trough from parts of the TX/OK
Panhandles into northwestern Kansas. With winds of 15-20 mph and RH
of 15-20%, elevated to locally critical fire weather concerns are
expected during the afternoon.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance this morning generally agrees that a shortwave will
march across the middle to eastern portion of the country through
the medium-range period as another upper trough with embedded
shortwaves approaches/reaches the Pacific Northwest late next
week.  The ensemble means from the ECMWF, GEFS, and CMC are
actually quite agreeable with one another through Day 7 regarding
the overall pattern evolution across the U.S., with excellent
timing agreement of west-to-east motion of a low pressure system
from the Plains to the East Coast.  The GEFS mean and the CMC mean
tracks the low slightly farther to the north toward the lower
Great Lakes than the EC mean which takes it across the Ohio
Valley.  A blend of these ensemble means should yield a good
starting point.  As for the deterministic solutions, the GFS has
continued to depict a deeper and larger low pressure system to
form over the central Plains during the middle of next week
compared with other models.  As for the subsequent evolution of
the system, the deterministic solutions are increasingly diverge,
with the GFS tracking it across the Great Lakes into Canada while

medium-range package was based mainly on a composite blend of the

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

The upper low emerging from the north-central Rockies along with
developing Plains/Midwest low pressure should promote an axis of
potentially heavy rainfall over parts of the north-central Plains
and Midwest during Tuesday or Tuesday night through at least
Wednesday.  Some snow will be possible over the north-central
Rockies and High Plains.  With time expect this system to spread
moisture into the East with some areas of locally moderate to
heavy rainfall possible.  Increasing uncertainty over system
details after Thursday decreases confidence for determining
highest rainfall totals and their location at that time, though
existing signals suggest they would be within an area from the
Ohio Valley into Tennessee Valley through parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast.  The Northwest should see one or more
periods of rain and mountain snow during the period but
uncertainty over shortwave details will keep confidence low for
specifics of coverage/timing/amounts.

From Tuesday into early Wednesday well above normal temperatures
(at least plus 10-20F anomalies) will prevail from the southern
Rockies/Plains into the Great Lakes.  The greatest anomalies
should be over the central Plains and Midwest where morning lows
may be 20-25F above normal.  This warmth will moderate somewhat as
it continues eastward ahead of the Plains system.  The East should
generally seeing highs of 5-15F above normal mid-late week while
clouds and rainfall will lead to warmer anomalies of plus 10-20F
for morning lows.  Farther west, parts of the north-central
Rockies/Plains may see modestly below normal highs into midweek
while the mean trough aloft nearby keeps the Pacific Northwest
somewhat below normal for highs.  Most of the Southwest and Great
Basin will likely see highs 5-10F above normal from midweek onward.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat April 03 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance this morning generally agrees that a shortwave will
march across the middle to eastern portion of the country through
the medium-range period as another upper trough with embedded
shortwaves approaches/reaches the Pacific Northwest late next
week.  The ensemble means from the ECMWF, GEFS, and CMC are
actually quite agreeable with one another through Day 7 regarding
the overall pattern evolution across the U.S., with excellent
timing agreement on the west-to-east motion of a low pressure
system from the Plains to the East Coast.  The GEFS mean and the
CMC mean track the low slightly farther to the north toward the
lower Great Lakes than the EC mean which takes it across the Ohio
Valley.  A blend of these ensemble means should yield a good
starting point.  As for the deterministic solutions, the GFS has
continued to depict a deeper and larger low pressure system to
form over the central Plains during the middle of next week
compared with other models.  As for the subsequent evolution of
the system, the deterministic solutions are increasingly diverged,
with the GFS tracking the system across the Great Lakes into
Canada while the ECMWF and CMC generally carry it into the East
Coast.  The WPC medium-range package was based mainly on a
composite blend of the 06Z GEFS, 00Z EC mean, a smaller
contribution from the 00Z CMC mean, together with some from the
00Z ECMWF and a lesser amount from the 06Z GFS and the 00Z CMC.
This resulted in a solution that depicts a low pressure system
tracking from the central Plains to the East Coast with some
coastal development by next weekend.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

The upper low emerging from the north-central Rockies along with
developing Plains/Midwest low pressure should promote an axis of
potentially heavy rainfall over parts of the north-central Plains
and Midwest during Tuesday or Tuesday night through at least
Wednesday.  Some snow will be possible over the north-central
Rockies and High Plains.  With time expect this system to spread
moisture into the East with some areas of locally moderate to
heavy rainfall possible.  Increasing uncertainty over system
details after Thursday decreases confidence for determining
highest rainfall totals and their location at that time, though
existing signals suggest they would be within an area from the
Ohio Valley into Tennessee Valley through parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast.  The Northwest should see one or more
periods of rain and mountain snow during the period but
uncertainty over shortwave details will keep confidence low for
specifics of coverage/timing/amounts.

From Tuesday into early Wednesday well above normal temperatures
(at least plus 10-20F anomalies) will prevail from the southern
Rockies/Plains into the Great Lakes.  The greatest anomalies
should be over the central Plains and Midwest where morning lows
may be 20-25F above normal.  This warmth will moderate somewhat as
it continues eastward ahead of the Plains system.  The East should
generally see highs of 5-15F above normal mid-late week while
clouds and rainfall will lead to warmer anomalies of plus 10-20F

while the mean trough aloft nearby keeps the Pacific Northwest

uncertainty over shortwave details will keep confidence low for
specifics of coverage/timing/amounts.

From Tuesday into early Wednesday well above normal temperatures
(at least plus 10-20F anomalies) will prevail from the southern
Rockies/Plains into the Great Lakes.  The greatest anomalies
should be over the central Plains and Midwest where morning lows
may be 20-25F above normal.  This warmth will moderate somewhat as
it continues eastward ahead of the Plains system.  The East should
generally see highs of 5-15F above normal mid-late week while
clouds and rainfall will lead to warmer anomalies of plus 10-20F
for morning lows.  Farther west, parts of the north-central
Rockies/Plains may see modestly below normal highs into midweek
while the mean trough aloft nearby keeps the Pacific Northwest
somewhat below normal for highs.  Most of the Southwest and Great
Basin will likely see highs 5-10F above normal from midweek onward.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
344 PM EDT Sat Apr 03 2021

Valid 00Z Sun Apr 04 2021 - 00Z Tue Apr 06 2021

...Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above normal over parts
of the Northern/Central High Plains/Plain and over the Upper
Middle Mississippi Valley...

...Elevated Risks of fire weather are in place for the Plains
supported by warm temperatures in the western and central CONUS...

A cold dome of high pressure over the Southeast will continue to
moderate over the next few days.  Frost Advisories are posted over
parts of North and Southern Carolina through Easter Sunday morning
due to the associated cold temperatures.

Broad upper-level ridging over the Western and North-Central U.S.
can expect temperatures to be 10 to 25 degrees above normal over
parts of the Northern/Central High Plains/Plain and over the Upper
Middle Mississippi Valley through Monday evening.  The Southwest
should see temperatures in the upper 90s and nearing 100 degrees,
while the 80s are forecast for Northern/Central portions of the
Plains.  These warm temperatures combined with dry soils, low
relative humidity, and gusty winds will lead to the potential for
fire weather for parts of the Plains. Per the Storm Prediction
Center, today's Fire Weather Outlook indicates an Elevated Risk
across the Northern Plains. On Sunday, the SPC has Elevated Risks
across portions of Montana and parts of the Southern/Central.

Meanwhile, a front moving onshore over the Pacific Northwest
overnight Saturday will move eastward to the Upper Midwest by
Monday evening.  The system will produce light rain and higher
elevation snow over parts of the Northwest and into parts of the
Northern Rockies on Saturday evening through Monday evening.  The
associated boundary extending from the Northern Plains to the
Great Lakes and the Mid-Atlantic will help produce showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the Upper Midwest into the Central
Plains, as moisture from the Gulf of Mexico streams northward over
the Plains.  As the front slowly moves eastward, the showers and
thunderstorms will continue over parts of the Upper Great Lakes
into parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley, as rain develops
along the warm front over parts of the Great Lakes into the Ohio
Valley on Monday.  Elsewhere, upper-level energy and gulf moisture
will produce rain and showers /thunderstorms over parts of Texas
from Saturday evening to Monday evening.  There will be a break
overnight Sunday into Monday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 AM CDT Sun Apr 04 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge across most of the country will continue to
slowly shift east today. The ridge will begin to erode from the west
as a shortwave trough moves into the Pacific Northwest. Some
increasing flow across the northern/central Rockies will help a
surface trough in the Plains to the east.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
With the southeastern surface high maintaining some strength
tomorrow, increasing winds within the lowest 2-3 km will promote
15-25 mph winds from northeastern New Mexico into western Kansas.
Dry south-southwesterly winds tend to limit moisture return into the
area as compared to points eastward. RH will likely fall to 15-20%
with low teens locally, perhaps. Elevated conditions are probable
with locally critical conditions possible.

...Montana...
Increasing mid/high-level cloud cover will tend to limit heating
during the afternoon. However, dry low-level conditions will remain
with modest westerly surface winds. RH may fall under 20% in
localized areas, but will generally be 20-25% for a majority of
northern/northeastern Montana. Models have continued to trend
downward in terms of wind speeds. The greatest chance for sustained
elevated conditions will likely be in terrain-favored locations.

...Western Dakotas...
Dry air will remain across the region tomorrow with RH of 15-20%
expected. Winds will be more questionable than previous days.
However, some guidance shows a weak surface low developing in the
northern High Plains vicinity which could locally enhance surface
winds. Elevated conditions may be sustained for a few hours
conditional on the strength of the surface trough/weak low.

...Northeast Iowa into Western Wisconsin...
A warm front will lift northward through the region tomorrow
morning. Low-level winds will continue to strengthen as the trough
deepens to the west. Despite moisture increasing during the day, the
primary surge will likely be late. This could leave a narrow window
where elevated conditions exist at least briefly. RH of 20-25% may
occur, but there is a wide range of values forecast in guidance.
Even with the drier solutions tending to perform well as of late,
the limited spatial extent, duration, and increasing cloud cover
precludes highlights this outlook.

256 AM EDT Sun Apr 04 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Apr 07 2021 - 12Z Sun Apr 11 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest guidance continues to have different ideas for some
specifics within the increasingly blocky regime expected to
develop over parts of eastern North America as well as for
individual shortwaves within a mean trough over the northwestern
part of the continent and extending down to portions of the West
Coast.

Early in the period there is decent clustering for the upper low
forecast to track over the Plains/Midwest.  However by days 4-5
Thursday-Friday GFS/UKMET runs with some hint in GEFS members have
been bringing leading western trough energy quickly toward the
Midwest upper low, leading to varied interactions or forming of a
new upper low near the Great Lakes.  The 12Z CMC was somewhat
closer to the consistently slower ECMWF/ECMWF mean for the western
trough (which would let the Midwest upper low drift along on its
own for a longer time) but the new run has trended more to the GFS
cluster.  Regardless of the scenario, by late week there has been
a recent trend toward greater downstream ridging aloft over the
East Coast/western Atlantic and eastern Canada, thus slowing
progression of the system.  By late in the period recent D+8
multi-day means have agreed on establishment of a strong core of
positive height anomalies to the east-northeast of Hudson Bay.
Teleconnections relative to this feature suggest a zone favorable
for one or more upper lows from the Great Lakes into southeastern
Canada and the Canadian Maritimes.  Guidance is signaling this
idea but with no real clustering or continuity for specifics over
this area.  Returning to the mean trough to the west, recent
GFS/GEFS trends have been eastward toward other guidance for
upstream energy that digs into the feature during the late
week/weekend time frame.  The ECMWF/ECMWF mean have also trended a
bit eastward over the past couple days.

Persistence of the GFS cluster for energy emerging from the
western U.S./Canada and heading into the Midwest upper low
suggested a closer to even balance for which scenario may occur
based on guidance through the 18Z cycle.  Given the ongoing
uncertainty, preference to stay closer to continuity in principle
led to trending the initial operational model blend more toward
the past couple ECMWF runs, 12Z CMC (only into day 5), and 18Z
GEFS/12Z ECMWF means--with the understanding that meaningful
future change in some details may be possible.  This blend
maintained the idea of slow progression of the parent system over
the Midwest while an East Coast wave develops by next weekend.
Specifics of one or more fronts over the West will depend on the
uncertain shortwave details aloft.  The new 00Z ECMWF has jumped
to the GFS cluster for leading western trough energy,
significantly raising the probability of that scenario, but at
least the general ideas of an upper low drifting into the Great
Lakes and a wave developing near the East Coast next weekend
remain intact.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Some locally heavy rain may fall over parts of the Midwest around
midweek, near the upper low and associated surface system
affecting the region.  Other areas of enhanced rainfall will be
possible along the trailing front--most likely from near the
south-central Mississippi Valley into the southern Appalachians.
The lingering front may provide a focus for additional showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the South through at least Friday or
Saturday.  Many other portions of the eastern U.S. will also see
one or more days of rain with varying intensity.  The Northwest
should see periods of rain and mountain snow, with highest totals
over favored terrain in the Olympics and Washington Cascades.
Specifics of coverage, timing, and amounts are still uncertain
with significant shortwave differences.

Locations from the Midwest into Ohio Valley and Great Lakes will
see well above normal temperatures during mid-late week.  Morning
lows should be particularly anomalous with some areas seeing a day
or two of 20-25F above normal readings.  Warmest highs should be
10-20F above normal.  Clouds and precipitation should keep min
temperatures above normal over the East into the weekend.  Expect
Texas to be very warm to hot during the period with highs 10-20F
above normal most days.  Above normal temperatures initially over
a majority of the West will likely moderate with time while below
normal highs become more common from the Northwest into northern
Rockies.

0221 AM CDT Sun Apr 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough within the Pacific Northwest will progress to
the southeast during the day, Monday. Mid-level winds will intensify
across the central/southern Great Basin into the Southwest. At the
surface, a front will accompany the trough and reach the Four
Corners by the end of the period. Farther east, a surface cyclone
will deepen along the Kansas/Colorado border.

...Central/Southern Great Basin...
Strong mid-level winds along the southern flank of the approaching
trough will overlap an increasing surface pressure gradient ahead of
the front approaching from the northwest. Winds of 20-25 mph will be
possible, particularly in eastern Nevada into western Utah.
Terrain-favored areas will also see higher winds. RH of 10-20% is
likely during the afternoon. While these critical meteorological
conditions will exist, fuels in most locations still appear
marginally receptive to fire spread.

...Southwest and Southern High Plains...
Mid-level winds will also increase across parts of Arizona as a
southern stream jet moves eastward during the day. There is some
question as to the duration of strong surface winds with southern
extent, but most areas into central Arizona will likely see 15-20
mph with locally higher values possible. RH will be similarly low at
10-20%. Given the ongoing drought, there will be areas of dry fuels
even though ERCs are near normal in most locations. Elevated
conditions will likely extend into New Mexico and southeastern
Colorado with the deepening High Plains surface low. Mid-level winds
will be weaker that far east, which should keep the potential for
critical conditions lower.

...Much warmer than normal temperatures in the western and central
U.S. will support Elevated Risks of fire weather...

...Precipitation is expected for the Northwest beginning today and
increasing in the central U.S. Monday...

The southwestern to north-central U.S. can continue to expect warm
temperatures over the next couple of days underneath broad
upper-level ridging. The Desert Southwest should see temperatures
in the upper 90s and nearing 100 degrees, while 80s are forecast
for northern/central portions of the Plains--about 20 to 30
degrees above average for the Dakotas and Nebraska. Several daily
high temperature records could be set. These warm temperatures
combined with dry soils, low relative humidity, and gusty winds
will lead to the potential for fire weather. Per the Storm
Prediction Center, today's Fire Weather Outlook indicates an
Elevated Risk across parts of Montana and central portions of the
High Plains. On Monday, the risk should shift to portions of
Nevada into the Four Corners region. Meanwhile, the southeastern
U.S. will see one more cold morning today, and Frost Advisories
are in place for portions of the Southeast, Carolinas, and
Tennessee/Ohio Valleys.

After generally dry weather over the past few days, precipitation
chances are expected to increase beginning in the Northwest today
as an upper-level trough/low comes in and pushes a surface front
through the region. Rain and snow will spread across the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies today and slowly southwestward
tonight and Monday, affecting the Central Rockies and
Northern/Central High Plains. Snow totals in higher elevations are
forecast to be 4 to 8 inches through Monday night. Also on Monday
and Monday night, rain and thunderstorms are expected for the
Central Plains and Midwest in the vicinity of a frontal system.
Strong thunderstorms are possible, with the current Storm
Prediction Center outlook showing a Marginal Risk of severe
weather for wind and hail threats centered in Minnesota on Monday.

Elsewhere, precipitation is likely over Maine through Monday,
where rain and snow could wrap around from a slow-moving surface
low pressure system in the Atlantic. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms are also possible in the south-central U.S., and a
few isolated thunderstorms could be strong to severe ahead of a
dryline in the Texas Panhandle Monday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1134 AM CDT Tue May 11 2021

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

Latest guidance shows the potential for spotty Elevated conditions
around afternoon peak heating across portions of southern New
England. However, 1+ inch accumulated rainfall within the past week
likely has dampened fuel receptiveness to fire spread, precluding an
Elevated delineation. The previous forecast for portions of northern
California and northwest New Mexico remain on track, with no changes
or additions made. Please see the previous forecast below for more
details.

..Squitieri.. 05/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Tue May 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
...Northwest New Mexico...
Moderate to strong mid-level flow across the Four Corners region
will persist through much of the day today. Deep mixing is expected
with temperatures increasing into the 60s to low 70s across northern
Arizona and northwest New Mexico. This deep mixing will bring some
of this stronger flow to the surface amid relative humidity in the
10 to 15 percent range. Therefore, some elevated fire weather
conditions are expected during the afternoon/early evening.

...Northern Sacramento Valley...
Weak northerly flow is present in the Sacramento Valley this morning
as an inverted pressure trough is centered across California. These
winds are expected to gradually increase through the day. Valley
parallel mid-level flow will likely mix to the surface which will
help to strengthen the northerly winds. Some sustained winds may
reach 15 mph during the afternoon with relative humidity around 10
to 15 percent.

FXUS21 KWNC 111756
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 11 2021

SYNOPSIS: At the beginning of the forecast period an advancing cold front is
likely to interact with moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially bringing
heavy rain to portions of the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley. In general,
model guidance has trended away from forecasting mid-level low pressure across
the West, resulting in lessening concerns for high winds across portions of
the
Rockies, High Plains, and Southwest. Elsewhere, mid-level high pressure is
forecast across the Great Lakes with a mid-level low over the Bering Sea. The
former feature would yield heat-related concerns if it were to occur during
the
summer with warmer climatological maximum temperatures, while the latter
feature is closely aligned with climatology.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain across portions of the Southern Plains and the
Middle
and Lower Mississippi Valley, Wed-Thu, May 19-20.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY MAY 14 - TUESDAY MAY 18:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!v2WUITVyx0dQeaWZkAB-t6ohmihCEOv8gY_S8ntQs9_0KXkgfoLEPEclnOCowfCrh_Ru3T6z$

FOR WEDNESDAY MAY 19 - TUESDAY MAY 25: Ensemble mean guidance from today's 6Z
GEFS and 0Z ECMWF continues to show daily total rainfall in excess of a half
inch for parts of the ArkLaTex early in Week-2 tied to an advancing frontal
boundary interacting with Gulf moisture. A slight risk of heavy rain is posted
across this region for May 19th and 20th where today's 0Z calibrated ECMWF
ensemble supports at least a 20% chance of an inch of rain falling within 24
hours. The Weather Prediction Center anticipates the area under the slight
risk
for heavy rain to experience anywhere from 1 to 5 inches of precipitation
during the prior week, while observed soil moisture levels across the
Mississippi Valley generally exceed the 70th historical percentile. Both of
these factors could yield localized river or flash flooding concerns. For a
refresher on flood safety please consider the resources found at:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/flood__;!!DZ3fjg!v2WUITVyx0dQeaWZkAB-t6ohmihCEOv8gY_S8ntQs9_0KXkgfoLEPEclnOCowfCrhwHF4vZq$ .



ECMWF guidance has trended toward yesterday's GEFS outlooks featuring less
anomalous troughing across areas west of the Rockies. Despite the Canadian
holding on to increased negative height departures over the West, the GEFS and
ECMWF solutions support the removal of the slight risk of high winds from the
previous outlook that spanned the Southwest, Rockies, and High Plains.



Models continue to show no obvious hazardous weather concerns for Alaska based
on predefined hazardous threshold criteria. Model guidance has consistently
weakened the anomalous 500-hPa troughing featured over the Bering Sea in
yesterday's forecasts, leaving a trough north of the Aleutians in the Week-2
mean, which is a climatological feature. Reforecast tool signals for anomalous
temperatures remain mixed for the state, with the ECMWF being relatively
warmer
than the GEFS. By Week-2 the vast majority of river ice should be broken up
across Alaska, thus no temperature concerns are apparent.

...Heavy rainfall possible next Monday and Tuesday for parts of
the Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley...

...Overview...

The best clustering of guidance shows an evolution toward some
degree of mean troughing over the West while mean ridging
progresses across the central U.S. into the East behind a broad
upper trough that departs from the East Coast this weekend. There
is a small minority that trends out of phase with this idea by
late in the period though. As the most likely pattern develops,
expect a gradual increase in coverage and intensity of rainfall
over the central U.S. with time. Some rain/thunderstorms could
eventually extend into parts of the East while parts of the
Rockies may see some precipitation as well. Contrasting
temperature anomalies late this week with warmth over the West and
cooler than normal readings to the east of the Rockies should
generally moderate with time, leaving many areas fairly close to
normal by early next week.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The 00z/06z guidance continues to show decent agreement with
either an amplified shortwave/closed low over California around
early Friday. This energy would then eject eastward into the
southern Rockies or High Plains by early next Tuesday. As was seen
24 hours ago, significant divergences develop for the large scale
pattern by late in the period. Although the GFS appears to have
fixed some of its prior issues with its western/northern Pacific
forecast, by the latter half of the period it still becomes slower
and more amplified with flow from the eastern Pacific into North
America, leading to showing a ridge over the West by early next
week while developing a fairly deep closed low over or near the
Great Lakes. In contrast, most remaining guidance shows some
degree of cyclonic flow arriving into the Northwest U.S. while
above normal heights/ridging prevail over the East. GEFS mean
reflects a compromise, being a little slower than the ECMWF/CMC
and their means with troughing that heads toward the Northwest
while depicting only a shortwave reaching the Great Lakes and
vicinity. WPC favored a blend close to previous shift continuity,
leaning on the deterministic runs days 3-5, with increasing weight
towards the ensemble means/ECMWF late period.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Expect central U.S. rainfall to focus initially over parts of the
Central Plains and Midwest ahead and north of a wavy warm front.
Some of the activity over the Midwest could eventually reach into
the Ohio Valley/eastern states as the focusing warm front extends
farther eastward. Rain and thunderstorms should also expand
southward and become heavier as return flow behind eastern U.S.
high pressure brings in more Gulf moisture and western U.S.
shortwave energy/possible upper low approaches the Plains. The
guidance shows a signal for heavy rainfall, especially over parts
of the Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley next
Monday/Tuesday. Parts of this area has seen much above normal
precipitation over the past several weeks, which may increase
flooding concerns. Across the Rockies/High Plains, there may be
some enhancement of precipitation near the central Rockies/High
Plains late in the period depending on the evolution of the
feature emerging from the West. In most cases any precipitation to
the west of the Rockies should be fairly light and scattered.
Meanwhile, the upper trough moving through the East late this week
into the weekend should promote areas of mostly light rainfall
from the Appalachians into the Northeast.

Well above normal temperatures centered over the Great Basin and
vicinity will extend into Friday with plus 10-20F anomalies for
highs. Then an upper trough/potential closed low should promote a
cooling trend over the southern half or so of the West, with parts
of the far southwestern U.S. possibly seeing a day or two with
slightly below normal highs. A trailing upper ridge may promote a
brief rebound over the Interior Northwest on Sunday followed by
cooling trend and southward suppression of remaining above normal
readings as cyclonic flow aloft approaches/arrives. Over the
eastern half of the country expect below normal temperatures to
prevail over many areas late this week. Locations near the
southeastern coast could see highs up to 10F or so below normal on
Friday. Then a moderating trend will likely yield near normal
highs and slightly above normal lows over the eastern half of the
lower 48 by early next week.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Subtle mid-level troughing over the northern plains will encourage a
low-level mass response in the form of a 5-15 mph sustained
southerly surface wind field across portions of eastern North Dakota
into far northwest Minnesota. Here, 25-35% minimum surface RH is
expected by afternoon peak heating based on the latest model
guidance consensus. Near record high ERCs are also in place,
suggesting that fuels are very receptive to wildfire-spread. While
the overall weaker surface wind speeds preclude an Elevated
introduction this outlook, Elevated highlights may be needed in
future outlooks if model guidance continues to trend higher in wind
speeds.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Tue May 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will build across the western CONUS on Wednesday
with weak to moderate mid-level flow across the Rockies and southern
High Plains. Surface high pressure and a lack of stronger mid-level
flow will likely limit the overall fire weather threat. However,
deep mixing may allow some gusty conditions in portions of New
Mexico with localized elevated conditions. Otherwise, fire weather
conditions should remain benign.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue May 11 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 17 - 21 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian dynamical models are in fair agreement today
with
regard to the 6-10 day 500-hPa geopotential height pattern over North America.
Troughing is predicted over the Bering Sea and across the western CONUS, while
ridging is forecast across the eastern U.S.

Increased probabilities of near to above normal temperatures are highlighted
over the Northeast and central CONUS, extending westward to most of the
interior western CONUS, underneath near to above normal mid-level heights and
low level southerly flow. Near to below normal temperatures are forecast over
parts of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska Panhandle, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. Near to above normal temperatures are favored
across much of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, due to forecast enhanced
southerly surface and mid-level flow ahead of a mean trough forecast over the
Bering Sea.

Near to below normal precipitation is favored over parts of the East Coast,
underneath above normal 500-hPa heights. Predicted southerly flow and frontal
activity significantly increase odds of above normal precipitation over the
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes and parts of the Central and Southern Plains.
Below normal precipitation is favored for the Northern High Plains, Northern
Rockies and parts of the northwestern CONUS, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool. Over central and southern Alaska, an active storm track is
forecast on the northern periphery of the mean Pacific ridge, leading to
increased odds of above normal precipitation. Below normal precipitation is
slightly favored for parts of western Mainland Alaska, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 4 out of 5, due to good
agreement in the model precipitation and temperature forecasts, offset by
differences among the forecast tools in the predicted temperature and
precipitation fields.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 19 - 25 2021

The predicted 500-hPa height pattern during the Week-2 period depicts mean
mid-level troughing and near to below normal heights across the western CONUS.
Positive height anomalies are predicted elsewhere over the CONUS, underneath
mean ridging and anticyclonic mid-level flow. Over Alaska, negative 500-hPa
height anomalies are predicted for much of the Mainland and Aleutians,
associated with mean troughing over the Bering Sea and western Alaska.

Near to below normal temperature probabilities are increased across parts of
the Pacific Northwest and Alaska Panhandle, associated with forecast troughing
over the region. As predicted high pressure shifts eastward across the eastern
CONUS throughout the period, return flow from the Gulf of Mexico favors
increased probabilities of near to above normal temperatures for the remainder
of the CONUS. Mean southerly to southwesterly flow favors above normal
temperatures across most of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians.

Odds tilt toward below normal precipitation for much of the Northeast and
parts
of the Great Lakes, underneath forecast above normal heights. Increased odds
of
above normal precipitation in most of the Central CONUS and parts of the
Southeast are associated with southerly flow and moisture advection from the
Gulf of Mexico behind surface high pressure predicted over the Southeast, and
ahead of a mean mid-level trough forecast over the West. Despite the mean
trough over the Western CONUS, energy crossing the northwestern CONUS and
southern High Rockies is not expected to amplify until it reaches the Plains,
leading to enhanced below normal precipitation probabilities in the
northwestern CONUS, Four Corners Region, and Southern High Rockies. Above
normal precipitation chances continue to be increased over most of Alaska due
to troughing forecast over the Bering Sea and western Mainland Alaska, and the
ridging over the eastern Pacific, favoring an active storm track across much
of
Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
day-to-day consistency in the ECMWF and Canadian ensemble model guidance,
offset by continued uncertainty in dynamical mode forecast precipitation and
temperature fields over the CONUS and Alaska.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...Widespread rain and thunderstorms to persist across the Gulf
Coast states...

...Below average temperatures to begin receding into Deep South
tomorrow...

A meandering frontal boundary is forecast to remain across the
Gulf Coast states and eventually slowly sink southward on
Wednesday into Thursday. Moist inflow from the Gulf of Mexico
interacting with the front should enable widespread showers and
thunderstorms in those areas, especially through tonight. There is
a Slight Risk of Severe Weather tonight for parts of southern
Texas. The overnight nature of the Severe threat poses a special
risk as folks may be caught off guard by strong winds and hail
shrouded in the cover of darkness. An inch or two of rain, with
locally higher amounts possible, is expected for portions of
eastern Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Southeast.
This rainfall along with wet antecedent conditions will lead to
the potential for scattered flash floods in those areas. A Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall as well as a Flash Flood Watch are in
place through Wednesday afternoon. Strong to severe thunderstorms
are also a possibility. Some showers and thunderstorms are
possible Wednesday, though are expected to lessen in coverage
later Wednesday into Thursday as the front gets suppressed.

Meanwhile in the Northeast, a sequence of low pressure waves could
cause light to moderate precipitation through Wednesday. Mainly
rain is expected, but higher elevations could see some mix or
light snow overnight.

Another couple of days of cooler than normal temperatures are
forecast for the central, southern and eastern U.S. behind the
potent cold front and beneath an area of substantial high
pressure. Freeze and Frost Warnings are once again in effect for
portions of the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest. Low temperatures
are expected to be in the 30s in the Great Lakes, with some areas
reaching 20 degrees below normal tonight. There's a potential for
setting records of low maximum temperatures over the Carolinas,
parts of Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Florida can expect warm temperatures south of the
front, and the West Coast will also see building warmth with above
normal temperatures over the next few days. The Elevated Fire
Weather threat over northern California and the four corners
region should come to an end this evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CDT Wed May 12 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
The surface pressure gradient is forecast to strengthen across the
northern Plains through the day today between an area of strong high
pressure in the Midwest and weak lee troughing in Montana. In
addition, a very dry airmass is in place across North Dakota
Minnesota with dewpoints in the teens to 20s F. This afternoon
relative humidity is expected to be around 20 to 25 percent. Winds
are forecast to peak near 15 mph. While this is only borderline
elevated criteria, record dry fuels and critically dry RH are
sufficient to support an elevated delineation.

Otherwise, some locally elevated conditions may be present in
northwesterly flow across the Southwest, but it will be too
localized to add any elevated delineation.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0137 AM CDT Wed May 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Weak downslope flow is expected in the lee of the Sierra which could
lead to some elevated conditions in portions of Nevada, but at this
time conditions appear too localized to warrant an elevated
delineation.

Conditions in northeast North Dakota and northwest Minnesota will be
similar on Thursday to today (Wednesday). However, an increase in
moisture is expected which should lead to higher relative humidity.
Showers and thunderstorms may accompany this increased moisture as a
weak mid-level shortwave trough traverses the region. PWAT values
will be very dry around 0.5 to 0.6 inches and record dry fuels are
present. Therefore, at least some consideration will need to be
given toward the potential for dry thunderstorms and lightning
induced grass fires. Will not introduce an IsoDryT area at this time
due to limits in predictability and storm coverage as well as dry
thunderstorms being a rare event in this region, but later forecasts
will closely examine this potential.

...Heavy rainfall possible over parts of the Southern Plains into
the Mississippi Valley Monday-Wednesday...

...Overview...

Thanks to recent trends in GFS runs toward the ongoing majority
consensus, today's guidance shows better agreement with the large
scale evolution during the period. Within a mean trough aloft
forecast to be established over the West, a leading trough/upper
low progressing from California through the Southwest or Great
Basin and then ejecting into the Plains should be followed by an
upstream trough that should reach the West by next
Tuesday-Wednesday. Meanwhile the combination of an initial
Rockies/Plains ridge and a faster moving southern Canada/northern
tier U.S. ridge will likely build into the East toward the middle
of next week. The mean evolution aloft along with a surface
pattern that should promote a multi-day feed of Gulf moisture will
favor the best potential for heavy rainfall over portions of the
Plains and Mississippi Valley. Weak shortwave energy filtering
through the generally rising heights aloft over the East may
extend some areas of meaningful rainfall into parts of the East.
Also expect some precipitation over portions of the Rockies while
the second Pacific trough should bring some rain and high
elevation snow into the Northwest. Double-digit temperature
anomalies should be mostly of the warm variety and are most likely
from the Northwest into the northern High Plains.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Over the past day the GFS has made significant progress in
adjusting its Pacific through North America pattern faster toward
other guidance. So instead of developing a Great Lakes closed low
from northern tier/southern Canada shortwave energy, the GFS is
weaker and waits until New England and the Canadian Maritimes to
show amplification--a more plausible scenario with latest CMC runs
and GEFS/ECMWF means also suggesting this possibility. However
there are still issues with this energy and possibly other weak
low-predictability shortwaves over the East, creating a lot of
latitude spread for rainfall/convective systems that may extend
eastward from the Midwest. Preference is for an intermediate
solution, between the more amplified GFS/GEFS and least amplified
(with strongest ridging) 12Z ECMWF. Farther west, guidance is
still waffling a bit with specifics of the trough/upper low
initially over California but the consensus timing appears to be
fairly consistent through at least Monday followed by typical
divergence with some dependence on upstream flow. As for the
second western trough, a blend approach represents the mean
pattern well while downplaying the more extreme details such as
the 12Z ECMWF developing more southeastward amplitude than most
other guidance by next Wednesday. Late the period the new 00Z
ECMWF compares better to the guidance average in both respects.
Based on guidance comparisons the starting blend incorporated a
composite of operational guidance for the weekend and then trended
toward 40-70 percent total input of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means
by days 6-7 Tuesday-Wednesday as confidence in various model
specifics declined.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Early in the period expect weak shortwave energy and a wavy front
to focus one area of rainfall over parts of the Central Plains and
Midwest while improving Gulf inflow will begin to increase
rainfall over the Southern Plains. Some of the activity over the
Midwest could eventually reach into the Ohio Valley/eastern states
as the focusing front and shortwave energy extend farther
eastward, though currently there is some uncertainty over the
precise latitude of this axis. Confidence is somewhat greater for
a multi-day threat of heavy rainfall over the Southern Plains and
parts of the Mississippi Valley through early-mid week as the low
level flow of Gulf moisture should persist and the initial western
U.S. upper system emerges into the Plains. Parts of this area have
seen much above normal precipitation over the past several weeks,
which may increase flooding concerns. Across the Rockies/High
Plains, there may be some enhancement of precipitation due to
potential for some easterly upslope flow along with the system
emerging from the West. In most cases any precipitation to the
west of the Rockies should be fairly light and scattered. Activity
reaching the Northwest late in the period may be somewhat better
organized but should still be on the lighter side of the spectrum.
Higher elevations may see some snow. The upper trough about to
depart from the East Coast may produce areas of mostly light
mid-late day rainfall from the northern Mid-Atlantic into the
Northeast during the weekend.

One or more days with highs of 10-15F or so above normal will
extend from the Northwest U.S. into the northern High Plains with
an upper ridge moving over the area and warm flow ahead of a
frontal system moving into the West. In contrast the system
crossing southern parts of the West should bring moderately below
normal highs to areas from the far southwestern U.S. into southern
High Plains. The Northwest should see highs drop to below normal
levels by next Tuesday-Wednesday behind the late-period front.
Meanwhile moderately cool temperatures over the eastern half of
the country during the weekend (though up to minus 10F or so
anomalies for morning lows over the southern
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast on Saturday) will moderate to yield
near-normal highs and somewhat above normal lows Monday-Wednesday.

...Showers and thunderstorms will persist over the Gulf Coast
states through tonight and lessen by tomorrow...

...Below normal temperatures are expected east of the Rockies
while the western U.S. warms...

A frontal boundary that has been meandering along the southeastern
U.S. for a few days will finally start to push offshore by
tomorrow and dry out the region for the most part. However,
through tonight, additional showers and thunderstorms are possible
across the Gulf Coast states and into the Carolinas. Flash floods
remain possible, especially since the Gulf Coast region has seen
wet conditions over the past several weeks. Additionally, portions
of the Southeast could see strong to severe thunderstorms, with
strong winds and hail possible in southeastern Alabama, southern
Georgia, and northern Florida.

Elsewhere, scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible for
the Northern and Central Plains over the next couple of days. On
Thursday, some storms could have strong winds associated with them
in the Central Plains. Some light showers are also possible in the
Northeast today, mainly in the form of rain, but some light snow
is also possible this morning in the highest elevations.

Temperatures are forecast to be below normal generally east of the
Continental Divide, though Florida should remain warmer than
normal today before the cold frontal passage. Cold morning lows
will once again cause Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories across
the the Central Plains, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and into the
Northeast. Cool high temperatures could set daily records across
the south-central to southeastern U.S. today, with highs only in
the 50s and 60s. Meanwhile, temperatures are forecast to be 10 to
20 degrees above normal in the West, with temperatures in the 90s
in some areas and rising to 100 degrees in the Desert Southwest.

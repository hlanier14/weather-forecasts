...Historic heat wave continues across interior sections of the
Northwest and Northern Rockies...

...A stagnant airmass over the central United States will lead to
additional chances for flash flooding from the Southern High
Plains to the Middle Mississippi Valley today and Wednesday...

...Oppressive heat found across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic to
end the month of June before a cold front approaches the region on
Wednesday, accompanied by the threat of severe weather...

It has been a historic stretch of heat throughout the Northwest
over the last few days, with numerous all-time temperature records
falling throughout Washington and Oregon. The unprecedented heat
will continue through the rest of this week for the Northern Great
Basin and Northern Rockies, while areas east of the Cascade
Mountains enjoy temperatures closer to normal starting today. The
upper-level high pressure system responsible for the
record-shattering heat is forecast to slide eastward along the
U.S.-Canada border near northern Idaho today and eventually weaken
by Thursday. As a result, the core of the extreme heat will be
found across interior Washington and Oregon through midweek, as
well as northern Idaho and northwest Montana. High temperatures
are expected to soar into the 100s and 110s across this region
(20-30+ degrees above average). Cities such as Spokane, WA and
Boise, ID could threaten monthly temperature records. In fact, the
forecast high temperature of 110 degrees today for Spokane, WA
would also break their all-time temperature record (108 degrees
set in August of 1961). Warm overnight low temperatures in the 70s
are forecast as well, which can make conditions even more
dangerous. Excessive Heat Warnings are in effect throughout the
Northern Great Basin and Northern Rockies, as well as parts of
western Nevada and interior California where high temperatures
into the triple digits can be expected. Residents are advised to
stay in air conditioned buildings, drink plenty of water, and
avoid strenuous outdoor activities.

For the central U.S., a lingering stationary front is expected to
continue producing scattered showers and thunderstorms capable of
triggering instances of flash flooding. This boundary currently
bisects the country between the Great Lakes and Southern High
Plains. Additionally, much of the central/southern Plains and
Middle Mississippi Valley has experienced a very active and wet
week, which can lead to compromised soil and a more vulnerable
flash flooding risk. A Slight Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive
Rainfall has been issued for today across southeast New Mexico,
and both today and Wednesday for parts of southeast Kansas and
southwest Missouri. Flash Flood Watches have also been issued and
parallel the aforementioned stationary boundary between northern
Illinois and West Texas.

Oppressive heat will be the main weather story today across the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Above average temperatures and heat
indices into the triple digits will make for a great day to cool
off indoors, by the pool, or at the beach. High temperatures are
forecast to reach the mid-to-upper 90s today and Wednesday, with a
few daily high temperature records possible between Philadelphia,
PA and Boston, MA. Excessive Heat Warnings have been issued for
parts of New Jersey, northern Delaware, and southeast
Pennsylvania, with Heat Advisories stretching into Upstate New
York and southern Maine. A cold front approaching the region is
expected to bring relief from the heat by Wednesday evening, but
will also bring the potential for damaging wind gusts. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe
thunderstorms for much of the Northeast and New England between
eastern Maine and central Pennsylvania.

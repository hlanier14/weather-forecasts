Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1027 AM CST Sun Feb 14 2021

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed for the ongoing forecast. Morning surface
observations from the southern CO River Valley show RH values
already near 20% with increasing northerly winds. Winds will likely
increase into the afternoon and support elevated wind/RH
combinations. However, fuels remain either too sparse and/or
unreceptive to support a robust or widespread fire weather threat.

..Moore.. 02/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1141 PM CST Sat Feb 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level trough will impact the Southwest into the central
and southern Plains today. A substantial surface high pressure
system will continue to reinforce cold air east of the Divide. Fire
weather concerns will be minimal across a vast portion of the U.S.
Dry and windy conditions are possible in the lower Colorado River
Valley as a strong northwesterly mid-level jet moves overhead during
the afternoon. This, in combination with a weak surface trough to
the east will produce 15-25 mph winds with RH approaching 15-20%.
Sparse fuels will limit the threat to locally elevated concerns.

...Much below temperatures will continue this week across much of
the central part of the Nation...

...Stormy weather this week coast to coast with potential for
significant storm system to impact Southeast and East Coast late
this week...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

After a lengthy period of a highly amplified upper level pattern
over parts of the CONUS, there are signs for a pattern change with
increasing chances of a flattening/zonal upper level pattern by
next weekend. This setup would allow for a moderation in
temperatures across much of the lower 48 and a less active storm
pattern from the central/eastern U.S.. In the meantime and leading
up to that potential pattern change, the prevailing amplified mean
trough over the central U.S. will feature upstream western energy
digging into the Plains/northern Mexico by Thursday and then
progressing through the eastern half of the country. The
associated low pressure/frontal system will emerge from the Gulf
and continue northeastward late in the week. With cold air
remaining in place, a widespread area of wintry weather and area
of heavy rainfall is likely to extend from the Southern Plains
through the Northeast. Overall, given the amplified pattern in the
day 3-5 time frame, there is reasonably good agreement between the
latest guidance. Compared to the previous cycle, the Southeast to
East Coast QPF footprint shifted some south/southeast. The WPC
blend incorporated mostly a near equal blend of the
ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET early on (day 3-5) followed by mostly a blend
of the ECMWF/ECENS and GFS/GEFS for day 6-7.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The storm system brewing over the Gulf that is expected to lift
through the Southeast toward the Northeast late this week will
bring a variety of hazards, including potential for severe
weather, heavy rainfall, and a swath of winter precipitation on
its northern edge. The risk for heavy rainfall is mainly confined
to portions of the Gulf Coast through the Tennessee River Valley
and portions of the Mid-Atlantic, while the Storm Prediction
Center is monitoring potential for severe weather over the central
Gulf Coast states. On the cold side of this system, a swath of
snow/wintry mix is increasingly likely from portions of the
Arklatex region through the Ohio Valley and portions of the
interior Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The latest WWO has moderate
to high probabilities for 0.25 inch liquid equivalent of
snow/sleet. Details on the individual hazards and fine tuning the
rain/snow/wintry mix transition zones will become clearer over the
course of this week.

Behind this system, another couple fronts reaching the Northwest
between Thursday and Saturday should bring the potential for
additional focused rainfall along coastal portions of
Washington/Oregon with heavy mountain snows in the
Washington/Oregon Cascades and northern Rockies. Meaningful
rain/high elevation snow may extend into parts of northern
California as well.

For temperatures, the record cold and much below normal
temperatures over the central U.S. will moderate somewhat while
shifting eastward toward the East Coast. Widespread readings 20F
to as much as 40F below normal will be possible Wednesday and
Thursday over the Southern Plains, while readings of 10-20F below
normal will be possible from the Ohio Valley and
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast late this week.  Temperatures in the West
will be near to moderately below normal through midweek followed
by a warming trend, especially over the Southwest where highs may
reach 5-10F or so above normal Friday-Sunday. The extreme
Southeast/Florida will be the one area of persistent warmth
through early Friday, with morning lows in particular expected to
be well above normal. However, below normal temperatures should
spread across the Sunshine State by later Friday/Saturday after
passage of the front anchored by the system affecting much of the
East.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1208 PM CST Sun Feb 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the forecast are needed. Recent guidance continues to
suggest low probability for meeting elevated wind/RH criteria over
southern AZ where the lowest humidity will be found. Furthermore,
regional ERC values near seasonal normal indicate modest fuel
readiness.

..Moore.. 02/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1144 PM CST Sat Feb 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
For Monday, the southern Plains trough will shift to the east.
Upper-level flow across the West will become less amplified and more
broadly cyclonic. Though stronger flow aloft will continue across
parts of the Southwest, a fairly weak surface pattern will limit
winds in areas of low RH. Continued cold air and precipitation over
the remaining portions of the U.S. will once again keep fire weather
concerns minimal.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun February 14 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Over 120 million Americans are currently under Winter Storm
Warnings, Ice Storm Warnings, Winter Storm Watches, or Winter
Weather Advisories as impactful winter weather continues from
coast-to-coast...

...Major winter storm to spread heavy snow and significant ice
accumulations from the Plains to the Northeast...

...Continued winter weather is expected for the Pacific Northwest
tonight, spreading southeastward through Tuesday...

...Frigid Arctic air and dangerously cold wind chills to persist
in the Heartland through a good part of the week...

...Severe thunderstorms, heavy rain, and warm temperatures are
expected for southern Georgia and Florida...

The contiguous U.S. remains active with winter weather hazards due
to the persistent Arctic high over the central U.S. and an active
storm track along its periphery. Snow is ongoing across much of
the Central/Southern Plains into parts of the Mississippi Valley,
with freezing rain beginning in southeastern Texas. Heavy snow and
freezing rain are forecast to spread northeastward through Monday
across the central and eastern parts of the country. A large swath
of 6 to 12 inches of snow is forecast for much of the Ohio Valley
into parts of the Great Lakes region and interior Northeast. South
of the snow axis, freezing rain is a threat, with over a tenth of
an inch of ice in the forecast for southeastern Texas
northeastward to southern New England. Higher ice amounts of a
quarter to a half an inch are expected in the portions of the
Lower Mississippi, Tennessee, and Lower Ohio Valleys, leading to
dangerous travel conditions, numerous power outages, and extensive
tree damage. Precipitation will likely stay rain for the southern
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast where cold air is more limited.

In the West, precipitation should continue throughout the evening
as Pacific moisture streams in, along with a weak low pressure
system. A bit more wintry weather is possible in lower elevations
of the Pacific Northwest, while locally heavy rain could cause
localized flooding issues for far southwestern Oregon into far
northwestern California. Another low pressure system approaching
and tracking through the Great Basin and Rockies Monday and
Tuesday will lead to additional precipitation for much of the
West. Heavy snow of 1 to 2 feet is likely in the Cascades and
Northern Rockies through Tuesday, with notable snow spreading into
the Wind River Mountains/Tetons, Wasatch, and Central/Southern
Rockies as well. Avalanches are a threat particularly in portions
of Utah and Colorado. This system should spread another round of
wintry weather to the south-central U.S. for midweek.

The aforementioned Arctic high across the central U.S. is forecast
to slowly weaken, but still maintain its grip across the Heartland
through the first half of the week. Thus bitterly cold
temperatures are expected to continue between the Rockies and
Appalachians through midweek, though moderate just a bit, with
some areas of the north-central U.S. finally seeing above 0F
temperatures Monday or Tuesday. However, dangerous cold is still
forecast, with lows in the -20s and -10s for the Northern/Central
Plains and Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley. Wind Chill Warnings
and Advisories extend as far south as the Southern Plains and as
far east as the Ohio Valley. Temperature anomalies are likely to
be 25 to 50 degrees below normal again for much of the central
U.S. on Monday. Hundreds of daily low maximum and minimum
temperatures have been/will be broken with this prolonged cold
event, with some February and even all-time low temperature
records in jeopardy.

Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms are ongoing across parts of
the Southeast near and along a stationary front. Severe
thunderstorms are in the forecast through tonight and tomorrow for
southern Georgia and into the Florida peninsula, with Slight Risks
of severe weather in place from the Storm Prediction Center. Heavy
rain could also cause localized flooding across portions of
Florida, Georgia, and the eastern Carolinas through tonight,
especially where rain falls on wet ground. Florida will also be
the warm spot in the CONUS, with highs above normal and generally
in the 80s.

Short Range Forecast Discussion

312 PM EST Sun Feb 14 2021

Valid 00Z Mon Feb 15 2021 - 00Z Wed Feb 17 2021

...Over 120 million Americans are currently under Winter Storm
Warnings, Ice Storm Warnings, Winter Storm Watches, or Winter
Weather Advisories as impactful winter weather continues from
coast-to-coast...

...Major winter storm to spread heavy snow and significant ice
accumulations from the Plains to the Northeast...

...Continued winter weather is expected for the Pacific Northwest
tonight, spreading southeastward through Tuesday...

...Frigid Arctic air and dangerously cold wind chills to persist
in the Heartland through a good part of the week...

...Severe thunderstorms, heavy rain, and warm temperatures are
expected for southern Georgia and Florida...

The contiguous U.S. remains active with winter weather hazards due
to the persistent Arctic high over the central U.S. and an active
storm track along its periphery. Snow is ongoing across much of
the Central/Southern Plains into parts of the Mississippi Valley,
with freezing rain beginning in southeastern Texas. Heavy snow and
freezing rain are forecast to spread northeastward through Monday
across the central and eastern parts of the country. A large swath
of 6 to 12 inches of snow is forecast for much of the Ohio Valley
into parts of the Great Lakes region and interior Northeast. South
of the snow axis, freezing rain is a threat, with over a tenth of
an inch of ice in the forecast for southeastern Texas
northeastward to southern New England. Higher ice amounts of a
quarter to a half an inch are expected in portions of the Lower
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Lower Ohio Valleys, leading to
dangerous travel conditions, numerous power outages, and extensive
tree damage. Precipitation will likely stay rain for the southern
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast where cold air is more limited.

In the West, precipitation should continue throughout the evening
as Pacific moisture streams in, along with a weak low pressure
system. A bit more wintry weather is possible in lower elevations
of the Pacific Northwest, while locally heavy rain could cause

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1221 AM CST Mon Feb 15 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Cold air will be in place across much of the U.S. as broad
upper-level troughing develops throughout the period. A few areas of
dry conditions are possible in the Southwest, but winds should
remain weak given the nebulous surface pressure gradient. Across the
U.S. fire weather concerns will remain quite low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1224 AM CST Mon Feb 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad upper-level troughing across the U.S. will amplify slightly
within the Southwest and southern High Plains. A strong belt of
mid-level winds will persist across the West Coast into the lower
Colorado River Valley. At the surface, high pressure will continue
to remain situated in the Plains. With the approach of a shortwave
trough, weak surface low development in the Southwest and eventually
the southern High Plains will help to enhance surface winds. Dry and
windy conditions are possible in the lower Colorado River Valley
ahead of a southeastward-moving cold front. RH may fall as low as
15% with winds increasing to 15-20 mph during the afternoon. With
the conditions mostly occurring within the desert areas, only
locally elevated fire weather concerns are expected.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1148 AM CDT Tue Apr 13 2021

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA AND SOUTHWEST
NEW MEXICO...

...Eastern Utah and western Colorado...
Morning satellite imagery shows widespread cloud cover across the
region consistent with previous model forecasts. Despite the ongoing
clouds, surface dewpoints in the teens to single digits are
significantly lower than previous guidance indicated. This suggests
even modest warming through the day will result in relative humidity
values of 15-25%. The presence of gusty winds of 20-25 mph in close
proximity to the dry air and anomalously dry low-elevation fuels
will support the potential for pockets of elevated/critical fire
weather conditions along the western slope through the afternoon.
Precipitation chances are expected to increase later in the day with
the arrival of lift from the upper low, but should remain infrequent
enough that some fire weather threat develops before more widespread
precipitation begins tonight. There also exists the low probability
for a few dry storms and lightning strikes given weak buoyancy from
the increasing mid-level moisture ahead of the upper low. The
elevated area has been expanded northward to account for these
threats.

The rest of the forecast remains on track with only minor
adjustments. Portions of the Southeast will see dry but calm
conditions with locally elevated fire weather potential while
critical fire weather conditions are expected across the southern
Great Basin into the Southwest.

..Lyons.. 04/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CDT Tue Apr 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the Interior West as a
surface low deepens across the lower Great Basin today. Dry
southwesterly flow will develop during the afternoon across the
southern Great Basin and Lower Colorado River Basin, promoting
conditions favorable for wildfire spread across the lower terrain,
where fuels are most receptive to fire spread.

...Southern Great Basin into the Lower Colorado River Basin...
The combination of diurnal heating, increased gradient wind speeds
with the intensifying surface low, and downslope flow will promote
widespread 15-25 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds
across much of the lower Great Basin into the Lower Colorado River
Basin, where 10-20% RH will be common. Latest guidance consensus
continues to depict portions of southern Nevada into northwest
Arizona and far southeast Arizona into western New Mexico as primary
regions for longer-term, overlapping Critical winds/RH. Still, at
least locally Critical conditions are possible across the remainder
of the Elevated area.

...Portions of the Southeast...
Relatively dry surface air is expected to meander across portions of
the southeast this afternoon, from South Carolina into the Florida
Peninsula. While much of the Southeast has experienced 2+ inch
rainfall within the past week, a minimum in precipitation
accumulations is noted across eastern Georgia into central and
southern South Carolina, where RH may dip into the 25-35% range by
afternoon peak heating. Fire weather highlights are being withheld
since mainly light and variable winds are present. However,
localized fire-spread concerns exist where 30% or less surface RH
overlaps dry fuels.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 13 2021

SYNOPSIS: A strong ridge is forecast to encompass most of Alaska and the
western CONUS during Week-2. This should result in warm, quiet weather
throughout those regions. Model guidance forecasts a weak trough over much of
the East during the week. There is a slight chance that temperatures will be
cold enough at night to damage sensitive vegetation throughout parts of the
eastern U.S.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures from the Central Plains to the
Ohio Valley and as far south as the interior Gulf Coast, Wed-Sun, Apr 21-25.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 16 - TUESDAY APRIL 20:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!uzLxnGn5bwCpLL1wLrUwWP7YIX1yUmOyeMnkcvyRTs8DZNEsZ78pECP48SM7V7oYzMSDcxNU$

FOR WEDNESDAY APRIL 21 - TUESDAY APRIL 27: The GFS and ECMWF ensembles are in
good agreement regarding Week-2. Positive height anomalies are forecast to
reach from Alaska to the Rockies. Negative height anomalies are forecast to be
concentrated over eastern Canada, with weak troughing expected over the
eastern
U.S. The surface temperature pattern is expected to follow this pattern
closely, with above normal temperatures underneath the ridging and below
normal
temperatures underneath the troughing.



There are some ensemble members that forecast minimum temperatures in the
eastern U.S. reaching the bottom 15th percentile during the first four days of
the forecast period. Some areas in the Central Plains and Ohio Valley could
experience overnight temperatures near or below freezing, which might damage
sensitive vegetation. The spatial coverage of the associated hazard has been
expanded, and extended by two days compared to yesterday, due to updated model
guidance that suggests that temperatures might remain cold for longer.



There are indications that winds could be 20-25 mph throughout much of the
mid-Atlantic as the trough over the eastern U.S. shifts out to sea during the
middle of Week-2. The forecast wind speeds are not high enough to warrant a
posted hazard, but interested parties should bear this potential in mind.



The warmest temperatures are expected throughout the West Coast, especially
within interior California. Daily maximum temperatures are forecast to be
within their upper 15th percentile, but should not reach our thresholds for
hazardous weather. Still, these warm temperatures and dry conditions will
exacerbate the ongoing drought conditions throughout the Southwest.

...Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat Lingers Into This
Upcoming Weekend...
...Heavy Rainfall Threat For Central Gulf Coast and Portions of
Florida This Weekend and Early Next Week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A somewhat blocky pattern early on in the medium range period is
expected to evolve over the period and by early to mid next week,
much of the central/eastern U.S. could be within a troughing
regime while some sort of upper ridging remains in place over the
western U.S.. The exit of the closed low over the Northeast U.S.
this weekend and the ridging anchored over southwestern Canada
will allow for another strong shortwave to drop southward through
the Plains/northern Rockies. This feature is expected to carve out
a closed low over the Central Rockies and likely lead to a heavy
snow upslope event. The deeper troughing over the central U.S.
will keep a frontal boundary suppressed south into the Gulf Coast
region and this stationary boundary interacting with waves of low
pressure and moisture transport will be the focus for episodes of
heavier rainfall. The latest guidance showed average to above
average agreement and continuity from the previous cycle. The WPC
blend was composed of the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GFS, 00Z CMC, and 00Z
UKMET initially then transitioned toward a blend favoring the 00Z
ECENS/00Z GEFS means by day 6/7 where there was higher model
spread. This resulted in a blend that trended well from
continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Closed low/trough dropping southward through the Rockies and its
associated High pressure building across the Plains will favor
below normal temperatures and a heavy upslope snow event for
portions of the Central Rockies of WY/CO. As upstream ridging
builds over the western U.S. and eastern Pacific, the troughing
over the Rockies will remain in place with the threat of heavier
snow sagging southward through this weekend. Daytime high
temperature anomalies of 20F to perhaps 25F below normal are
possible Friday and this weekend. Conversely, the upper ridging
over the Pacific will lead to highs 15-20F above normal,
particularly for northern California to Oregon and Washington.

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf and portions of the
Florida peninsula this weekend and early next week will be the
focus for several rounds of potentially heavier rainfall. The
greatest risk area appears to be from central/eastern Gulf Coast
toward the Florida peninsula and much of this area has seen above
normal precipitation the last 14 days (200-300 percent of normal)
and this additional rainfall could worsen or initiate flooding in
the area.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue April 13 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 19 - 23 2021

Today's ensemble means are in good agreement on the longwave 500-hPa pattern
forecast over North America during the 6-10 day period. A closed mid-level low
is predicted south of Alaska, while anomalous ridging is forecast along the
western coast of the CONUS, extending north along western coastal Canada and
over Alaska. Downstream of this ridging, a large-scale trough is predicted
over
the eastern half of the CONUS. Despite the agreement among most of today's
models, the 0z deterministic ECMWF model forecasts a deep 500-hPa closed low
developing near the California coast. If this solution verifies, surface
temperatures would be much lower than in the other model solutions today.
Since
this is an outlier, it is not included in today's manual 500-hPa blend, but it
does indicate uncertainty and the potential for changes in future runs.

Beneath large positive height anomalies, above normal temperatures are favored
for western portions of Alaska and the western third of the CONUS, and near to
below normal precipitation is favored for Alaska. Despite positive height
anomalies over all of Alaska, forecast cold surface high pressure and an
easterly flow increases chances of near to below normal temperatures for the
Alaska Panhandle and eastern portions of Mainland Alaska. Ridging along the
west coast of the CONUS is forecast to suppress storm system activity and
increase chances of below normal precipitation from the west coast of the
CONUS
to much of the eastern U.S. Beneath the mean trough forecast over eastern
portions of the CONUS, cold surface high pressure is forecast to funnel cold
air from Canada into much of the East, favoring below normal temperatures for
most of the eastern two thirds of the CONUS. One exception is the Northeast,
where periods of southerly low-level flow favor above normal temperatures. A
potential short-wave trough forecast to swing south around the trough enhances
the likelihood of near to above normal precipitation for parts of the
Southwest
and Southern Plains. As a forecast frontal boundary stalls across Florida
during the 6-10 day period, above normal precipitation is favored there. Above
normal temperatures are slightly favored for the southern tip of the Florida
Peninsula to the south of this stalled boundary.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's
operational 0z GFS centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement on the large-scale pattern, good agreement among the
temperature and precipitation tools, and offset slightly by some uncertainty
over the Southwest.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 21 - 27 2021

By the week-2 period, the amplitude of the overall large-scale pattern is
forecast to decrease due to increased uncertainty and a potential pattern
change across parts of the domain. The pattern is also forecast to shift
slightly eastward. The temperature probability forecast for week-2 is similar
to the forecast for the 6-10 day period, with a few minor differences.
Probabilities are generally lower due to the increased uncertainty during
week-2. The potential southerly low-level flow in the Northeast during the
early part of the 6-10 day period is forecast to occur before week-2, so a
transition to near to below normal temperatures is favored there during
week-2.
The mid-level ridging forecast in the West shifts a bit to the east by the
week-2 period, expanding enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures
towards the High Plains. The precipitation probability forecast is similar to
the 6-10 day period for Alaska and the western third of the CONUS. The
forecast
shortwave affecting the Southwest and Southern Plains during the 6-10 day
period occurs before the week-2 period, and a relative lack of precipitation
during week-2 increases chances of below normal precipitation for those areas.
In addition, one or more potential storm systems within the large-scale
forecast trough increase chances of above normal precipitation for much of the
East, though probabilities are low due to a good deal of uncertainty.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the dynamical models and temperature and precipitation
tools over most of the country, offset by poor run-to-run continuity in recent
GFS runs.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CDT Tue Apr 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST ARIZONA INTO
NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO...

...Carolinas and eastern GA...
Minor changes have been made to the previous elevated area with some
trimming across the northern half. Models remain split on the nature
of the dry boundary layer across the region with several hi-res
members indicating very dry surface RH below 15%. While winds are
not forecast to be overly strong (10-15 mph) exceptionally dry fuels
over south Carolina will support elevated fire weather conditions. A
slight chance of rain across the northern half of the elevated area
may hamper some fire weather potential with northward extent but
this impact is expected to be relatively minor.

...Western Colorado and Eastern Utah...
Widespread elevated/near critical fire weather conditions are likely
across the western slope through Day2. Model guidance has come into
better agreement on the positioning of the cold front and overnight
precipitation corridor expected to develop ahead of the upper low.
The latest guidance suggests the heaviest precipitation and cooler
temps will remain north of the I-70 corridor leaving a rather large
area with strong winds and very dry surface conditions. With less
than 0.15 inches of QPF expected, any degradation of the fire
weather environment from overnight precipitation should be minimal.
While some uncertainty still remains, at minimum, elevated fire
weather conditions are likely across the low and mid-elevations
where substantial dry fuels exist. An upgrade to critical is
possible should Day1 precipitation prove even lighter than expected.

..Lyons.. 04/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0227 AM CDT Tue Apr 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
The amplifying mid-level trough and associated surface low that will
promote favorable wildfire-spread conditions across the Southwest on
Day 1 will meander across the Interior West as a cutoff low on Day
2. Given the lack of anticipated rainfall, fuels will continue to
cure and support wildfire spread, especially across the lower
terrain. Meanwhile, a weak mid-level shortwave trough is expected to
traverse the Southeast U.S., with a surface lee trough promoting a
strong enough surface wind field coincident with very dry air across
the southeast to promote some wildfire spread concerns.

...Portions of the Southwest U.S...
Through the afternoon, widespread sustained southwesterly 15-25 mph
surface winds are expected to develop with daytime heating,
coinciding with 10-20% RH in most places across the Lower Colorado
River Valley, where Elevated highlights were introduced.  Guidance
currently depicts northern Arizona into west-northwest New Mexico as
the most likely location for Critical winds/RH to overlap for well
over 3 hours, hence the Critical highlights. At least locally
Critical conditions are expected across the Elevated area, and
expansions to the Critical delineation may be needed in future
outlooks.

...Portions of the Southeast U.S...
20-30% RH may develop across portions of eastern Georgia into South
Carolina by afternoon peak heating tomorrow. Compared to previous
days though, the passage of a surface lee trough and associated wind
shift may result in at least 10-15 mph sustained southwesterly winds
across the area before moister conditions and potential rainfall
arrive. This surface wind/RH combination atop drying fine fuels
(devoid of meaningful precipitation for over a week) may encourage
Elevated conditions for fire spread. Some disagreement exists among
guidance members, with some models showing a lack of favorable
winds/RH. However, enough of a consensus has been reached among
individual model members and ensemble guidance for the confidence in
delineating Elevated fire weather highlights.

...Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat Lingers Into This
Upcoming Weekend...
...Heavy Rainfall Threat For Central Gulf Coast and Portions of
Florida This Weekend and Early Next Week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A somewhat blocky pattern early on in the medium range period is
expected to evolve over the period and by early to mid next week,
much of the central/eastern U.S. could be within a troughing
regime while some sort of upper ridging remains in place over the
western U.S.. The exit of the closed low over the Northeast U.S.
this weekend and the ridging anchored over southwestern Canada
will allow for another strong shortwave to drop southward through
the Plains/northern Rockies. This feature is expected to carve out
a closed low over the Central Rockies and likely lead to a heavy
snow upslope event. The deeper troughing over the central U.S.
will keep a frontal boundary suppressed south into the Gulf Coast
region and this stationary boundary interacting with waves of low
pressure and moisture transport will be the focus for episodes of
heavier rainfall. The latest guidance showed average to above
average agreement and continuity from the previous cycle. The WPC
blend was composed of the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GFS, 00Z CMC, and 00Z
UKMET initially then transitioned toward a blend favoring the 00Z
ECENS/00Z GEFS means by day 6/7 where there was higher model
spread. This resulted in a blend that trended well from
continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Closed low/trough dropping southward through the Rockies and its
associated High pressure building across the Plains will favor
below normal temperatures and a heavy upslope snow event for
portions of the Central Rockies of WY/CO. As upstream ridging
builds over the western U.S. and eastern Pacific, the troughing
over the Rockies will remain in place with the threat of heavier
snow sagging southward through this weekend. Daytime high
temperature anomalies of 20F to perhaps 25F below normal are
possible Friday and this weekend. Conversely, the upper ridging
over the Pacific will lead to highs 15-20F above normal,
particularly for northern California to Oregon and Washington.

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf and portions of the
Florida peninsula this weekend and early next week will be the
focus for several rounds of potentially heavier rainfall. The
greatest risk area appears to be from central/eastern Gulf Coast
toward the Florida peninsula and much of this area has seen above
normal precipitation the last 14 days (200-300 percent of normal)
and this additional rainfall could worsen or initiate flooding in
the area.

...A slow-moving storm will bring widespread snows to the Great
Basin and Central Rockies, with heavy accumulations for the
mountains...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Gulf Coast and Southern Plains, Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Central Gulf Coast...

...Critical Fire Weather conditions are expected across portions
of the Southwest, Great Basin, and Southern Rockies...

A slow-moving area of low pressure over the Upper Mississippi
Valley will move eastward to the Lower Great Lakes by Thursday
evening.  The system will produce widespread precipitation across
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, including some late-season
accumulating snows from Montana to the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan.  Precipitation is expected to continue into Wednesday
before diminishing west to east across the Plains as the system
inches eastward.  As the system moves east, scattered rain will
begin to develop across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on
Wednesday, continuing into Thursday.

An associated quasi-stationary front over the Gulf Coast States
will interact with increasing moisture, producing showers and
thunderstorms across the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley on Tuesday evening into Wednesday.  The SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Central Gulf
Coast and Southern Plains through Wednesday morning. The main
hazards with these storms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and an isolated tornado through
Wednesday morning.   Additionally, these storms will produce heavy
rain.  The WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
associated with these storms.  The main flash flood threat will be
mainly localized over urban areas, roads, and small streams.

As the Midwest's lead system drifts east, another slow-moving
upper-level low over the Pacific Northwest will sink slowly
southeastward into the Central Rockies by Thursday.  The system
will produce higher elevation snow and valley rain across the
Great Basin and Rockies through Thursday evening.

In contrast to the wet conditions along the Central Gulf Coast
into the Lower Mississippi Valley, dry conditions, low relative
humidity, and gusty winds will support an Elevated to Critical
Fire Weather Threat over the Southwest Tuesday evening into
Wednesday.  Red Flag Warnings are in effect on Tuesday for a
significant portion of the California deserts, southern Nevada,
northwestern Arizona, and southern Utah.

...Appreciable mountain snow for the central Rockies today into
Thursday...

...Heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding over parts of the
Central Gulf Coast today...

...Critical Fire Weather conditions are expected across portions
of the Four Corners region...

An unsettled pattern in the West will be slow to evolve over the
next two days, as a result of a stationary frontal boundary over
the central Rockies. An upper-level low will gradually move
through through the Great Basin over the next day or so, promoting
locally heavy snow over Wyoming. Over a foot of snow is forecast
for some areas of the Equality State and into northern Colorado,
with lesser amounts over lower elevations where temperatures may
be more marginal. Nonetheless, travel may become difficult with
blowing snow over the roadway.

A quasi-stationary front across the Southeast will interact with
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to produce showers and
thunderstorms from Texas eastward today. Some rainfall may be
heavy over Louisiana where there is a Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall and flash flooding. Especially prone areas may be within
urban areas, across low-lying roads, and astride small streams.

A wrapped-up storm over the Great Lakes will translate eastward
today into Thursday, spreading light rain across the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic while lingering showers diminish over Michigan and
Wisconsin. By late Thursday, as the system shifts its energy
toward the New York bight and the lead frontal system off
Virginia, colder air will filter into New England and upstate New
York changing the rain to snow.

Over parts of the Southwest/Four Corners region, dry and windy
weather will make for Critical Fire conditions today. Blowing dust
will be a concern over parts of northeastern Arizona as well as
southwest winds may gust to 40-50 miles per hour. Red Flag
warnings are in effect for portions of the Four Corners states.

...Heavy Rainfall Threat for Florida...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and
12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian days 3-5 (Saturday-Monday) in a
pattern with above normal predictability. Opted for a composite
blend of the 18 UTC GEFS mean, 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean and the
01 UTC National Blend of Models days 6/7 (Tuesday/next Wednesday)
amid growing forecast spread in a pattern with average
predictability for these longer time frames. This acts to maintain
good WPC continuity in an overall forecast scenario that seems in
line with latest 00 UTC models and ensembles, albeit with some
varied system timing differences.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf and Florida this weekend
and next week will be the focus for several rounds of potentially
heavy rainfall as upper impulses induce a series of moisture and
instability focusing waves. The greatest risk area appears to be
from central/eastern Gulf Coast to especially Florida and portions
of this area has seen more than double normal April rainfall. This
additional rainfall could worsen or initiate flooding. The
potential also then exists for moderate coastal cyclogenesis up
off the East Coast with these series of waves, but these systems
seem to be primarily a maritime concern well in the wake of a
windy lead coastal storm exiting New England waters this weekend.

Upstream, a series of energetic northern stream shortwave troughs
digging southward to the lee of an amplified and warming West
Coast upper ridge are expected to combine with several cold air
surges/upslope to favor periods of moderately heavy snow over the
Rockies. Temperature anomalies with these surges should range from
10-20+ degrees below normal. Lead energy offers a lingering snow
threat over the south-central Rockies Saturday and subsequent
energy may focus snows over the north-central Rockies Sunday into
Monday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST ARIZONA INTO NORTHWEST
NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughs and associated surface lows/lee troughs are
expected to propagate across the Interior West and to the lee of the
Appalachians along the East Coast today, promoting favorable
wildfire-spread conditions across portions of the Lower Colorado
River Valley and Central Savannah River area. Across the Southwest
U.S., wildfire-spread concerns are greatest in the low-terrain
areas, where fuels are most receptive to fire spread.

...Lower Colorado River Valley...
A belt of 60+ kt mid-level flow is expected to overspread the Four
Corners region by afternoon peak heating, when boundary-layer mixing
is projected to be strongest. The optimal timing of the
overspreading mid-level winds and associated downward momentum
transport within the dry boundary layer suggests that widespread 20+
mph sustained southwesterly surface winds are likely across much of
the Southwest in tandem with 10-20% RH. Critical highlights have
been introduced where 25+ mph sustained winds and 10-15% RH are
likely to overlap for at least a few hours, with at least locally
Critical conditions possible through the remainder of the Elevated
area. Brief, localized Extremely Critical meteorological conditions
are also possible close to the Kaibab Plateau towards the Black Mesa
and Chuska Mountains.

...Portions of the Southeast...
Afternoon boundary-layer mixing across portions of eastern Georgia
into South Carolina is expected to foster 25-35% surface RH values,
while a passing surface lee trough will encourage 10-15 mph
sustained southwesterly winds (perhaps with higher gusts). Since the
favorable overlapping surface winds/RH are expected to overspread
dry fuels across the region, Elevated fire weather highlights have
been maintained across the region.

0216 AM CDT Wed Apr 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN ARIZONA INTO
CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will begin to move offshore into the Atlantic as
a second trough aloft ejects into the Plains states tomorrow. Cooler
air will surge southeastward across the eastern U.S. as surface high
pressure ushers in, while dry and breezy conditions take shape
across the Southwest due to downslope flow and surface lee-troughing
present across the southern High Plains.

...Portions of the Lower Colorado River Valley...
60+ kt mid-level flow will overspread Arizona and New Mexico as the
mid-level trough ejects into the Plains states. A deep, dry boundary
layer will induce downward mixing/momentum transport to encourage
widespread 25+ mph sustained westerly surface winds. These stronger
winds will overlap with 10-20% RH for several hours during the
afternoon, warranting the introduction of Critical highlights. A
broader region of Elevated surface conditions will also be present
across the Southwest, however, at least locally Critical conditions
will also be possible throughout the Elevated area.

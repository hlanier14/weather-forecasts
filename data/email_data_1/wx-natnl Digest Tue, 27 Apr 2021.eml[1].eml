Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1150 AM CDT Mon Apr 26 2021

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FOUR CORNERS AND THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

Relatively minor changes to the existing critical area in parts of
eastern Colorado and western Kansas. Given current surface
observations, critical conditions appear probable to extend slightly
farther north than previously forecast. Elsewhere the forecast
remains unchanged. See the previous discussion below.

..Wendt.. 04/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CDT Mon Apr 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals an upper-level wave
deepening along/just off the California coast. Enhanced mid and
upper-level winds continue to shift from the Great Basin into the
Four Corners region ahead of the wave. At the surface, a broad
surface low currently over central and eastern WY will begin to
consolidate to the south across eastern CO this afternoon amid
increasing pressure falls. In response, surface winds will
strengthen across the Four Corners and southern High Plains region.
Ongoing drought conditions and recent days of very dry and windy
conditions have maintained receptive fuels across the region, which
will support another day of widespread fire weather concerns.

...Four Corners and the Southern High Plains...
Widespread critical conditions appear likely again today across most
of NM and into western KS. Recent surface observations from west TX
into the Four Corners region show poor overnight relative humidity
recovery as RH values struggle to climb out of the teens and low
20s. Although modest moisture return is possible across west TX
through noon, widespread single-digit to low teen RH values will
overspread the region again as the dryline mixes east in response to
the deepening surface low. The strengthening pressure gradient
across the region will support widespread sustained winds near 25
mph, though a few locations may see periods of 30 mph sustained
winds. Strong diurnal heating will drive deep boundary-layer mixing
by mid to late afternoon, which will support downward transfer of
35-45 mph winds. Mid and high-level cloud cover from southern NV
into eastern UT and southern WY, as well as an approaching cold
front from the west, introduce some uncertainty into the RH forecast
for this region, but strong winds between 20-25 mph appear likely.

...Central High Plains...
Guidance has come into better agreement regarding the potential for
elevated, to locally critical, fire weather conditions and westerly
downslope winds increase this afternoon. Fuel guidance trends across
this region suggest that fine fuels are in the process of drying out
in the lower elevations, and should support at least some fire
concern. Although elevated to critical wind/RH combinations are
possible further west, improving fuel conditions introduce
uncertainty in the fire weather potential.

...Northeast...
CoCoRaHs reports from the past 24 hours show 0.1 to 0.35 inches of
rainfall have fallen along the Northeast coast. While this has
helped mitigate fuel receptiveness to some degree, locations further
inland received less rainfall and likely still have receptive fuels.
Breezy northwesterly winds will usher in drier air from southeast
Ontario/Quebec through the day and support RH reductions down to
30-35%. Consequently, areas of elevated fire weather conditions are
possible across portions of MA, VT, and NH. This threat is expected
to be relatively localized, but a broader risk area may be
introduced in future updates if observations trend drier than
currently expected.

...Heavy rain threat Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys and
Central Gulf Coast Mid-Week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The evolution of the large scale pattern from a more amplified
ridge west/trough east is forecast to move to more zonal/fast flow
with some hints of a western trough late in the forecast period.
This change results in lower predictability at first with the
phasing or lack of between the southern/northern streams early on
(day 3/4). There continues to be some timing differences with the
southern stream shortwave progression, where the GFS is on the

deeper and digs the trough further into the Southeast. As the
system lifts northeast, it phases with northern stream energy and
this should favor a faster progression as depicted by the GFS.
Given uncertainty and with an eye toward best possible WPC product
continuity, opted to take a middle of the road approach with a
blend of the ECMWF/GFS/CMC early on and then favored the
ECENS/GEFS means day 5-7 to mitigate forecast spread and maintain
continuity from the previous forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Along and ahead of a slow moving frontal boundary, moisture and
instability pooling will contribute to locally heavy rainfall
Thursday from portions of eastern Texas to the Mid-Mississippi
River Valley and portions of the Lower Ohio Valley. This threat
will spread toward the TN Valley and Southern Appalachians late
Thursday into Friday. In the wake of the frontal passage, more
benign sensible weather is forecast for the CONUS. The
aforementioned front will settle/stall over Florida and could be
the focus for unsettled weather. Meanwhile, as the western U.S.
ridge breaks down late in the forecast period, another storm
system will spread precipitation across portions of the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Rockies.

The strong upper ridge building into the West past midweek will
spread much above normal temperatures with 15-20+F above normal
anomalies Thursday into Saturday across much of the West and High
Plains. Some locations may reach daily records for highs/warm
lows. The approaching Pacific trough aloft and leading cold front
will start a pronounced cooling trend back toward climatology by
next weekend.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 26 2021

SYNOPSIS: A low amplitude pattern is forecast over the CONUS during Week-2,
which is expected to result in relatively quiet weather. Temperatures are
likely to be slightly warmer than normal over the eastern CONUS as a weak
upper-level ridge takes hold for most of the week.

HAZARDS

No hazards are depicted in today's outlook as probabilities are not
anticipated
to reach pre-defined criteria during the forecast period at this time.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 29 - MONDAY MAY 03:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!sDXjRQzQFBoeypxteeMfBcZ0meqFm7njlYaAKcZP00d-BdwB0UHGfD2kCNT7t_aVknSMyM5n$

FOR TUESDAY MAY 04 - MONDAY MAY 10: Shortwave troughs are expected over
central
Alaska and the central CONUS at the start of the Week-2 period. Both of these
shortwaves are expected to move eastward and weaken with little fanfare during
the first half of the period. In a time averaged sense, this pattern appears
as
weak troughing over Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, and weak ridging over
most of the CONUS during Week-2.



Such low amplitude patterns are common during the warm season as the general
circulation spins down, resulting in weak baroclinicity throughout the
midlatitudes. Such an environment is conducive to convectively driven
precipitation, which is especially difficult to forecast on the Week-2
timescales due to its small spatial and temporal scales.



Above average temperatures are favored underneath the ridge for most of the
country. Some of these temperatures, particularly in Texas and the
southeastern
U.S. will likely be above their 85th climatological percentile. However, the
temperatures are favored to remain below 95F in most places and seasonably low
dew points below 70F are expected, so there is little concern for the
potential
of hazardous heat.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon April 26 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 02 - 06 2021

Dynamical model solutions are in good agreement regarding a transient 500-hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain during the outlook period. Troughing
is
forecast to move off the East Coast of the CONUS at the start of the period,
with enhanced ridging building in its wake across the central and eastern
CONUS. As a result, a tilt toward near to above normal heights is favored for
much of the east-central CONUS. The pattern across the West is forecast to be
variable, with a series of shortwave troughs moving through Alaska and into
the
western CONUS, favoring below normal heights over Alaska, and near normal
heights across much of the western half of the CONUS.

The low amplitude synoptic pattern featuring predominately zonal flow in the
West and positive height anomalies downstream over central and eastern CONUS
favors increased probabilities for above normal temperatures across most of
the
CONUS, with the highest probabilities (>70%) across parts of the Central and
Southern Plains. This is consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools.
Probabilities for below normal temperatures are increased across much of
Alaska, and extending into the Pacific Northwest underneath the greater
influence of troughing.

The weak flow across the CONUS favors increased chances for below normal
precipitation for many areas. The exception is over the Northern Plains, Upper
Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes, where shortwave troughing to the West may
result in weak surface lows ejecting out of the Rockies and enhancing
precipitation over these areas. Additionally, parts of the Northern Plains are
climatologically dry this time of year, increasing the likelihood that any
precipitation that does fall would push this region into the above normal
category. Across Alaska, a tighter mid-level pressure gradient and enhanced
westerly flow resulting from troughing over the Bering Sea favor increased
chances for above normal precipitation across the Aleutians, the Alaska
Peninsula, and parts of southwestern mainland Alaska, as depicted in the ECMWF
reforecast tool. Near to below normal precipitation chances are increased for
the remainder of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
model agreement, offset by a transient, low amplitude pattern across much of
the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 04 - 10 2021

Weak, transient mid-level flow is predicted across North America throughout
the
week-2 period resulting in a somewhat uncertain forecast. The GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensembles depict weakly positive height anomalies across much of the
interior CONUS, with the Canadian being the furthest to the east. The 500-hPa
height pattern is forecast to be weakly amplified across the Pacific, with
troughing forecast over the Bering Sea and ridging south of the Aleutians. As
a
result of the increased uncertainty, the week-2 forecast is based on
persistence from the 6-10 day outlook, with many of the same features present,
just weaker in amplitude. Todays manual blend depicts near to above normal
heights for most of the CONUS, and near to below normal heights over Alaska.

Increased probabilities for above normal temperatures are depicted for most of
the CONUS from the Rockies eastward to the Atlantic Coast. The ridging is
predicted to decrease in amplitude compared to the 6-10 day period allowing
for
a decrease in mid-level heights across portions of the Great Lakes and
Northeast, and resulting in temperatures closer to normal for these areas.
This
evolution is supported by the analog tool, as well as the forecast weak
negative phase of the NAO, which would favor backdoor cold front activity
across portions of the Northeast given the weakening ridge. Continued enhanced
troughing across Alaska favors increased probabilities for near to below
normal
temperatures across most of the state. A slight tilt toward above normal
temperatures is highlighted over the Aleutians due to a greater influence from
the ridging to the south.

The 8-14 day precipitation forecast is very similar to the 6-10 day forecast
with increased probabilities for below normal precipitation favored for most
of
the CONUS. Above normal precipitation chances are enhanced across the Northern
Plains to the Northeast due to increased potential for surface low tracks
across north-central CONUS. A weakening of the ridge may also allow these
systems to track further east, supporting the increased above normal
precipitation probabilities in the Northeast. Probabilities for above normal
precipitation are elevated across the southern half of Alaska, consistent with
dynamical model guidance. The consolidation forecast tool depicts increased
probabilities for below normal precipitation across northern Alaska. However,
due to the dry climatology and some of the individual dynamical models
depicting increased chances for above normal precipitation, near normal
precipitation is favored in todays forecast for the northern Mainland.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
a weakly amplified pattern and increased uncertainty in the dynamical model
guidance in terms of the pattern evolution throughout the period.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The evolution of the large scale pattern from a more amplified
ridge west/trough east is forecast to move to more zonal/fast flow

This change results in lower predictability at first with the

this should favor a faster progression as depicted by the GFS.
Given uncertainty and with an eye toward best possible WPC product

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Along and ahead of a slow moving frontal boundary, moisture and

Thursday from portions of eastern Texas to the Mid-Mississippi
River Valley and portions of the Lower Ohio Valley. This threat
will spread toward the TN Valley and Southern Appalachians late
Thursday into Friday. In the wake of the frontal passage, more
benign sensible weather is forecast for the CONUS. The
aforementioned front will settle/stall over Florida and could be
the focus for unsettled weather. Meanwhile, as the western U.S.
ridge breaks down late in the forecast period, another storm
system will spread precipitation across portions of the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Rockies.

The strong upper ridge building into the West past midweek will
spread much above normal temperatures with 15-20+F above normal
anomalies Thursday into Saturday across much of the West and High
Plains. Some locations may reach daily records for highs/warm
lows. The approaching Pacific trough aloft and leading cold front
will start a pronounced cooling trend back toward climatology by
next weekend.

...Heavy rain threat Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys and
Central Gulf Coast Mid-Week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The evolution of the large scale pattern from a more amplified
ridge west/trough east is forecast to move to more zonal/fast flow
with some hints of a western trough late in the forecast period.
This change results in lower predictability at first with the
phasing or lack of between the southern/northern streams early on
(day 3/4). There continues to be some timing differences with the
southern stream shortwave progression, where the GFS is on the
faster side while the ECMWF is slower. The UKMET was noticeably
deeper and digs the trough further into the Southeast. As the
system lifts northeast, it phases with northern stream energy and
this should favor a faster progression as depicted by the GFS.
Given uncertainty and with an eye toward best possible WPC product
continuity, opted to take a middle of the road approach with a
blend of the ECMWF/GFS/CMC early on and then favored the
ECENS/GEFS means day 5-7 to mitigate forecast spread and maintain
continuity from the previous forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Along and ahead of a slow moving frontal boundary, moisture and
instability pooling will contribute to locally heavy rainfall
Thursday from portions of eastern Texas to the Mid-Mississippi
River Valley and portions of the Lower Ohio Valley. This threat
will spread toward the TN Valley and Southern Appalachians late
Thursday into Friday. In the wake of the frontal passage, more
benign sensible weather is forecast for the CONUS. The
aforementioned front will settle/stall over Florida and could be
the focus for unsettled weather. Meanwhile, as the western U.S.
ridge breaks down late in the forecast period, another storm
system will spread precipitation across portions of the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Rockies.

The strong upper ridge building into the West past midweek will
spread much above normal temperatures with 15-20+F above normal
anomalies Thursday into Saturday across much of the West and High
Plains. Some locations may reach daily records for highs/warm
lows. The approaching Pacific trough aloft and leading cold front
will start a pronounced cooling trend back toward climatology by
next weekend.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CDT Mon Apr 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

The forecast remains unchanged. The overall spatial extent of where
critical fire weather will be possible appears appropriate. The main
question is the duration of those conditions. Uncertainty in the
position of the boundaries as well as cloud cover in the region will
likely mean some highlighted areas will experience relatively brief,
but intense, dry/windy conditions. The cloud cover in particular may
not have a significant impact given how dry the low-level airmass
is. See the previous discussion for more details.

..Wendt.. 04/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Mon Apr 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough currently residing off the California coast
is forecast to deepen over Baja California by early Tuesday. Strong
southwesterly mid and upper-level flow is forecast to remain in
place from northern Mexico into the central Plains through the day,
and there are some indications in recent guidance that an embedded
impulse could bring a period of enhanced flow during the day. Broad
synoptic ascent will help anchor a surface low across southeast CO,
which will support another day of strong pressure-gradient winds at
the surface. While precipitation chances will generally increase
across the region, a narrow corridor along the southern High Plains
will likely remain dry and see elevated to critical fire weather
conditions.

...Southern High Plains...
Although recent guidance has come into somewhat better agreement
regarding the timing and placement of the main synoptic features,
regional details remain uncertain. Confidence is reasonably high in
widespread sustained 20-25 mph surface winds west of the dryline
where fuels remain receptive after several days of hot, dry, and
windy conditions. However, the approach of a cold front from the
west across NM and thunderstorm development along the dryline (along
with a potential westward retreat of the dryline during the early
evening hours) will leave a narrow spatial window for favorable
relative humidity reductions into the 10-15% range. The placement
and progression of these features through the day will likely
determine the spatial extent of the fire weather threat. Aloft, the
main jet axis should remain over the region and support another day
of 30-40 mph wind gusts. There are some indications that a weak
mid-level impulse could propagate through the region and support
higher gusts closer to 40-50 mph within the critical risk area, but
the timing of this wave may be offset from peak diurnal mixing and
confidence in this wind potential is generally low.

...Northeast...
Dry northwesterly flow is expected again on Tuesday with winds
generally between 10-15 mph. Little moisture recovery is anticipated
over the next 48 hours, which should keep fuels dry and may support
another day of localized elevated fire weather concerns. As with
Monday's fire weather potential, the spatial extent of the threat
appears confined to portions of MA, NH, possibly into western ME.
The narrow spatial extent precludes a risk area at this time, but
trends will continue to be monitored.

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding possible across the

Mississippi Valley and western Ohio Valley on Wednesday...

...Widespread fire danger remains a concern for the Four Corners
region and southern High Plains through Tuesday...

...Above normal temperatures to spread across much of the eastern
U.S. to start the week, while below average temperatures linger
over the Southwest...

An upper-level low currently located over the Intermountain West
and a slow-moving frontal boundary extending from the Ohio Valley
to the Southwest will be the focus for active weather over the
next few days. Rain and snow showers are forecast to continue over
the Rockies, Great Basin, and Southwest through Wednesday morning.
Snow could be heavy at times across mountain ranges throughout the
central Rockies and central Great Basin, where over 6 inches of
total snowfall is likely. Meanwhile, as the upper-level low sinks
into the Southwest on Tuesday it will funnel atmospheric moisture
into the southern Plains. This will aid in thunderstorm
development along a dryline located across West Texas. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
that extends from south-central Kansas to central Texas.
Thunderstorms in this region on Tuesday could produce damaging
wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes. A few instances of
flash flooding will be possible as well, particularly across
southeast Kansas, central Oklahoma, and north-central Texas.

By Wednesday the stormy weather will slowly shift eastward and
into the Middle Mississippi and Ohio valleys, with showers and
thunderstorms remaining across the southern Plains as well.
Multiple rounds of heavy rain are forecast to form along and ahead
of a very slow-moving cold front as it crosses the central Plains
on Wednesday. Rainfall totals over 3 inches are possible from
northern Texas to southern Illinois. This amount of rain within a
short time frame could lead to flooding concerns. Thus, WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for Wednesday that
highlights a large region from Indiana to Texas.

Across the Four Corners Region and southern High Plains, critical
fire weather remains a concern through Tuesday as gusty winds and
low relative humidity is found across the area ahead of the
approaching storm system. Temperatures will also be quite warm
ahead of the cold front throughout the central and eastern United
States. High temperatures will soar into the 80s on Tuesday and
Wednesday as far north as the Midwest, Lower Great Lakes, and
Mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, below average temperatures will remain
across the Southwest and Great Basin on Tuesday before shifting
into the central and southern Rockies on Wednesday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon April 26 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 02 - 06 2021

Dynamical model solutions are in good agreement regarding a transient 500-hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain during the outlook period. Troughing
is
forecast to move off the East Coast of the CONUS at the start of the period,
with enhanced ridging building in its wake across the central and eastern
CONUS. As a result, a tilt toward near to above normal heights is favored for
much of the east-central CONUS. The pattern across the West is forecast to be
variable, with a series of shortwave troughs moving through Alaska and into
the
western CONUS, favoring below normal heights over Alaska, and near normal
heights across much of the western half of the CONUS.

The low amplitude synoptic pattern featuring predominately zonal flow in the
West and positive height anomalies downstream over central and eastern CONUS
favors increased probabilities for above normal temperatures across most of
the
CONUS, with the highest probabilities (>70%) across parts of the Central and
Southern Plains. This is consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools.
Probabilities for below normal temperatures are increased across much of
Alaska, and extending into the Pacific Northwest underneath the greater
influence of troughing.

The weak flow across the CONUS favors increased chances for below normal
precipitation for many areas. The exception is over the Northern Plains, Upper
Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes, where shortwave troughing to the West may
result in weak surface lows ejecting out of the Rockies and enhancing
precipitation over these areas. Additionally, parts of the Northern Plains are
climatologically dry this time of year, increasing the likelihood that any
precipitation that does fall would push this region into the above normal
category. Across Alaska, a tighter mid-level pressure gradient and enhanced
westerly flow resulting from troughing over the Bering Sea favor increased
chances for above normal precipitation across the Aleutians, the Alaska
Peninsula, and parts of southwestern mainland Alaska, as depicted in the ECMWF
reforecast tool. Near to below normal precipitation chances are increased for
the remainder of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
model agreement, offset by a transient, low amplitude pattern across much of
the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 04 - 10 2021

Weak, transient mid-level flow is predicted across North America throughout
the
week-2 period resulting in a somewhat uncertain forecast. The GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensembles depict weakly positive height anomalies across much of the
interior CONUS, with the Canadian being the furthest to the east. The 500-hPa
height pattern is forecast to be weakly amplified across the Pacific, with
troughing forecast over the Bering Sea and ridging south of the Aleutians. As
a
result of the increased uncertainty, the week-2 forecast is based on
persistence from the 6-10 day outlook, with many of the same features present,
just weaker in amplitude. Todays manual blend depicts near to above normal
heights for most of the CONUS, and near to below normal heights over Alaska.

Increased probabilities for above normal temperatures are depicted for most of
the CONUS from the Rockies eastward to the Atlantic Coast. The ridging is
predicted to decrease in amplitude compared to the 6-10 day period allowing
for
a decrease in mid-level heights across portions of the Great Lakes and
Northeast, and resulting in temperatures closer to normal for these areas.
This
evolution is supported by the analog tool, as well as the forecast weak
negative phase of the NAO, which would favor backdoor cold front activity
across portions of the Northeast given the weakening ridge. Continued enhanced
troughing across Alaska favors increased probabilities for near to below
normal
temperatures across most of the state. A slight tilt toward above normal
temperatures is highlighted over the Aleutians due to a greater influence from
the ridging to the south.

The 8-14 day precipitation forecast is very similar to the 6-10 day forecast
with increased probabilities for below normal precipitation favored for most
of
the CONUS. Above normal precipitation chances are enhanced across the Northern
Plains to the Northeast due to increased potential for surface low tracks
across north-central CONUS. A weakening of the ridge may also allow these
systems to track further east, supporting the increased above normal
precipitation probabilities in the Northeast. Probabilities for above normal
precipitation are elevated across the southern half of Alaska, consistent with
dynamical model guidance. The consolidation forecast tool depicts increased
probabilities for below normal precipitation across northern Alaska. However,
due to the dry climatology and some of the individual dynamical models
depicting increased chances for above normal precipitation, near normal
precipitation is favored in todays forecast for the northern Mainland.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
a weakly amplified pattern and increased uncertainty in the dynamical model
guidance in terms of the pattern evolution throughout the period.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A high-amplitude upper-level trough has begun to translate eastward
towards Baja California this morning per recent water-vapor imagery.
Ahead of this wave, strong mid and upper-level flow is beginning to
overspread the Southwest and parts of the southern High Plains.
Surface pressure falls within the left-exit region of this jet
streak, along with broad synoptic ascent ahead of the trough axis,
will help anchor a surface low across east/southeast CO. Increasing
pressure-gradient winds to the south of this low will introduce
another day of fire weather concerns for portions of the southern
High Plains where fuels will support fire spread. While confidence
in the general fire weather threat remains high, details regarding
the spatial extent and duration of critical conditions is somewhat
uncertain.

...Southern High Plains...
Early morning surface observations from eastern NM and far western
TX reveal poor overnight relative humidity recovery with RH values
in the teens to low 20s. A slight moistening trend is anticipated
over the next 12-24 hours as modified Pacific moisture advects
northeastward from Mexico, but this will likely be insufficient to
prevent diurnal RH minimums from falling below 15-20% for most
locations. The previous days of dry, windy weather have maintained
very dry fuels across NM and west TX with large fires recently
reported in NM. Winds will likely increase to similar magnitudes
today as compared to yesterday (Monday) with 20-25 mph winds common
and frequent gusts up to 30-40 mph (and possibly up to 45-50 mph for
a few locations across eastern NM).

Despite the dry conditions and relatively high confidence in gusty
winds, a few factors continue to introduce uncertainty into the
forecast. The areal coverage of critical fire weather conditions may
be confined to a relatively narrow corridor along the NM/TX border
due to an approaching cold front from the west and a dryline to the
east. This dryline is expected to retreat westward during the late
afternoon/evening hours, but the quality of moisture return into
west TX remains uncertain. Additionally, morning IR imagery reveals
increasing cloud cover across the Southwest and southern High
Plains. These clouds will linger for much of the day and may limit
boundary-layer heating/mixing and allow RH values to remain closer
to 20%. As such, locations that manage to see breaks in the clouds
and can sufficiently warm by mid/late afternoon will see the highest
potential for sustained critical conditions.

...Northeast...
Conditions remain relatively dry across portions of MA, southeast
VT, and southern NH after a day of breezy conditions with relatively
low RH. Relative humidity values are expected to fall into the
25-35% range this afternoon, but winds will generally be lighter
(around 10 mph for most locations). Periodic elevated fire weather
conditions are possible where stronger gusts up to 15-20 mph can
occur, but this threat is expected to remain localized.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Guidance overall agrees in showing a rather benign larger scale
pattern evolution as we transition into May. The upper flow will
be highlighted by an amplified ridge over the West and trough over
the East later this week, likely followed by a period of flatter
flow that leads into trough development over the West and a
ridging into the East early next week. There is in particular
below normal predictability with respect to the sensitive extent
of phasing between southern and northern streams late week into
the weekend that has given the models fits recently as best
evidenced by erratic embedded system run to run timing flip-flops.
Given uncertainty and with an eye toward best possible WPC product
continuity, opted again to take a middle of the road approach with
a composite blend of reasonably well clustered guidance of the 18
UTC GEFS mean, 12 UTC UKMET, 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01
UTC National Blend of Models. The 00 UTC models still do not seem
to present much of a common forecast trend with embedded system
and phasing issues, but the WPC blend remains in line with the
ensemble means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Uncertain upper trough energies are slated to focus convergence
into wavy lead fronts, with moisture and instability pooling
contributing to enhance rainfall that will spread over the East
Friday. The front will settle over Florida to remain a focus for
convection into the weekend. Meanwhile, an amplified upper ridge
over the West will spread much above normal temperatures with
15-20+F above normal anomalies Friday into Saturday across the
West and into the High Plains. Some locations may reach daily
records for highs/warm lows. An approaching Pacific trough aloft
and leading cold front will start a pronounced cooling trend back
toward climatology by the weekend and focus generally modest
Pacific Northwest to northern Rockies precipitation. Steady system
progression and lead impulse ejections may combine with measured
Plains cyclogenesis/frontogenesis to favor an emerging strong
convective pattern focus over the central U.S. early next week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CDT Tue Apr 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
The main synoptic wave, currently off the coast of Baja California,
will continue to shift into the southern High Plains through
Wednesday. A weak surface low is forecast to evolve over west Texas,
which will induce westerly downslope flow across southeast NM into
the Trans Pecos region of Texas. Further north, a building surface
high will drive breezy northerly winds across the Great Basin as
well as a cold front across the Northern Plains. Despite the
high-amplitude nature of the upper-level pattern, scattered
precipitation chances across the Southwest and southern Plains and
weak synoptic surface features will limit most fire weather
concerns.

...Trans Pecos...
Westerly winds are forecast to increase to 15-20 mph across most of
southwest TX and far southeast NM. Wind gusts up to 30 mph are
possible, especially for locations that typically see terrain
enhancements. Downslope warming and drying will help drive RH
reductions generally into the 15-25% range. While a few instances of
critical conditions are possible, most ensemble guidance suggests
sustained elevated conditions are more likely. Additionally, notable
spread in deterministic guidance introduces some uncertainty into
the duration and coverage of the fire weather threat. Forecast
refinements are likely as guidance comes into better agreement and
observed trends become apparent.

...Dakotas...
Building surface high pressure over the Pacific Northwest will help
drive a cold front southeastward from eastern MT into the Dakotas.
Modest cold advection within a dry air mass should allow for some
degree of boundary-layer mixing and may support RH reductions
between 20-30% immediately behind the cold front. Post-frontal winds
up to 15-20 mph may support a few hours of elevated fire weather
conditions for the region. However, confidence in the relative
humidity forecast remains low and precludes a risk area at this
time.

...Southern Colorado River Basin...
Northerly pressure-gradient winds are forecast to increase to 15-20
mph across much of the southern Great Basin and southern CO River
Valley by Wednesday afternoon. This should coincide with diurnal
humidity reductions to around 15% from southern NV into southern
CA/southwest AZ. While elevated, to potentially critical, fire
weather conditions are likely, limited fuels and recent rainfall
suggest the overall fire potential is low. Trends will be monitored
and the fire weather threat reassessed in subsequent updates.

...There is a Slight risk of Severe Thunderstorms over parts of

...Fire danger narrows to the Southern /Central High Plains
Wednesday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above average from the
Middle Mississippi Valley eastward to the Mid-Atlantic, while
Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average over the
Southwest...

A wave of low pressure over the Central Plains will move eastward
to the Ohio Valley by Thursday as the trailing front lingers over
the Southern Plains.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along
and ahead of a dryline over the Central/Southern Plains on Tuesday
evening into Wednesday.  The SPC has issued a Slight risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southern/Central Plains
through Wednesday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  There is a 10% or greater
probability of two-inch or larger diameter hail with the severe
thunderstorms.  The heavy rain associated with the thunderstorms
may produce isolated areas of flash flooding.  Furthermore,
showers and thunderstorms will develop along and north of the
boundary from the Central/Northern Plains into the Upper Great
Lakes on Tuesday into Tuesday evening.

Overnight Tuesday, the showers and thunderstorms will expand into
parts of the Lower Great Lakes and into parts of the Northeast by
Wednesday morning.  Additional severe weather may develop over
parts of the Southern Plains on Wednesday.  The showers and
thunderstorms will slowly move into parts of the Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley by Wednesday morning while lingering over parts
of the Southern Plains.

Meanwhile, an upper-level low over the Great Basin will move
eastward to Texas while weakening by Thursday.  The system will
produce rain and snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest to the
Northern Rockies southward to the Great Basin, Southern
California, and the Southwest on Tuesday. The rain and snow will
end over the Northwest by Tuesday afternoon, while the rain and
snow will move into parts of the Central Rockies.  The rain and
higher elevation snow will move into parts of the Southern Plains
by Wednesday morning.  The rain and snow will end over the
Central/Southern Rockies by Thursday morning.

While the weather will relieve the fire weather threat over the
Southwest and Southern Rockies, a Critical and Elevated fire
weather threat will continue over the Southern/Central High Plains
into Wednesday morning.  Elsewhere, under the upper-level low
temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average over the
Southwest.  The temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above
average from the Middle Mississippi Valley eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.

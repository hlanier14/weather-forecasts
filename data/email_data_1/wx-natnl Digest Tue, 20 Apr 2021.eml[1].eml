.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Mon Apr 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted mid-level shortwave trough will dig from the
Northwest into the Great Basin today. As it moves southeastward,
cyclogenesis is expected in portions of the Southwest. A
strengthening pressure gradient as a result of this cyclogenesis and
deep mixing bringing stronger mid-level flow to the surface will
combine for gusty winds from the northern Great Basin into the
Southwest. Dry conditions will be present across this region and
therefore, some fire weather concerns are expected. The primary
concern will be across portions of eastern Nevada, Utah, northern
Arizona, and western Colorado where some dry fuels are present and
the strongest winds are expected.

Additionally, some dry and breezy conditions are expected in the
Texas Panhandle as cyclogenesis strengthens across New Mexico.
However, the longevity and strength of the winds preclude the need
for an elevated delineation at this time.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
209 PM EDT Mon Apr 19 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 22 2021 - 12Z Mon Apr 26 2021

...Record cold likely for parts of the central U.S. Thursday
morning...
...Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat across the South into the
weekend...

...Overview...

Blocky upper ridging forecast over Alaska and Greenland at high
latitudes and over the Greater Antilles in lower latitudes favors
upper troughing over much of the CONUS. As an upper low south of
Alaska splits off its southern portion toward the West Coast this
weekend, additional troughing will sink southward out of Canada
through the Great Lakes. Ridging will build in between these two
systems next week across the Plains. The pattern is rather chilly
for late April with precipitation chances focused over the South,
East Coast, and the West.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Model solutions seem better clustered today with the mid-larger
scale flow evolution days 3-7 despite a pattern over the lower 48
states with multiple streams and the surrounding blocky flow.
System timing differences remain evident, but seem mitigated by a
favored composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS, 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. This
blend is consistent with ensembles/newer 12 UTC models and
maintains good WPC product continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A southern stream system ejecting from the Southwest and southern
Rockies Fri will work over the Southern Plains where rainfall will
expand along and ahead of a warm front with return of Gulf of
Mexico moisture and instability. Heavy rainfall is likely from the
southern Plains through the lower MS Valley and Southeast Fri-Sat.
Runoff and flooding issues are expected, especially given portions
of the region have received much above normal rainfall in April.
The system may then lift up the East Coast under influence of
northern stream energy from the Great Lakes to bring enhanced
rainfall across the Mid-Atlantic and windy New England Sun/Mon.

Meanwhile well upstream, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low
and surface front will work into the West Coast over the weekend
into early next week, eventually bringing a lower elevation
rain/mountain snow focus into CA, mainly the Sierra.

Areas east of the Rockies will see below normal temperatures
Thursday, perhaps by 10-20 degrees which would support record cold
low temperatures from Texas northeastward toward the Corn
Belt/Midwest. That cold air mass will push eastward but moderate
into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic. With northern stream troughing
nosing southward out of Canada, areas along the border will see
below normal temperatures as well. This should support moderately
heavy snow over the north-central Rockies Thu into Fri with
upslope. An area of above normal temperatures will be over parts
of the West/Great Basin ahead of the upper trough/low while
offshore. As that trough works inland into early next week, the
milder air should shift eastward across the Rockies and into the

...Record cold likely for parts of the central U.S. Thursday
morning...
...Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat across the South into the
weekend...

...Overview...

Blocky upper ridging forecast over Alaska and Greenland at high
latitudes and over the Greater Antilles in lower latitudes favors
upper troughing over much of the CONUS. As an upper low south of
Alaska splits off its southern portion toward the West Coast this
weekend, additional troughing will sink southward out of Canada
through the Great Lakes. Ridging will build in between these two
systems next week across the Plains. The pattern is rather chilly
for late April with precipitation chances focused over the South,
East Coast, and the West.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Model solutions seem better clustered today with the mid-larger
scale flow evolution days 3-7 despite a pattern over the lower 48
states with multiple streams and the surrounding blocky flow.
System timing differences remain evident, but seem mitigated by a
favored composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS, 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. This
blend is consistent with ensembles/newer 12 UTC models and
maintains good WPC product continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A southern stream system ejecting from the Southwest and southern
Rockies Fri will work over the Southern Plains where rainfall will
expand along and ahead of a warm front with return of Gulf of
Mexico moisture and instability. Heavy rainfall is likely from the
southern Plains through the lower MS Valley and Southeast Fri-Sat.
Runoff and flooding issues are expected, especially given portions
of the region have received much above normal rainfall in April.
The system may then lift up the East Coast under influence of
northern stream energy from the Great Lakes to bring enhanced
rainfall across the Mid-Atlantic and windy New England Sun/Mon.

Meanwhile well upstream, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low
and surface front will work into the West Coast over the weekend
into early next week, eventually bringing a lower elevation
rain/mountain snow focus into CA, mainly the Sierra.

Areas east of the Rockies will see below normal temperatures
Thursday, perhaps by 10-20 degrees which would support record cold
low temperatures from Texas northeastward toward the Corn
Belt/Midwest. That cold air mass will push eastward but moderate
into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic. With northern stream troughing
nosing southward out of Canada, areas along the border will see
below normal temperatures as well. This should support moderately
heavy snow over the north-central Rockies Thu into Fri with
upslope. An area of above normal temperatures will be over parts
of the West/Great Basin ahead of the upper trough/low while
offshore. As that trough works inland into early next week, the
milder air should shift eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains.

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 191827
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 19 2021

SYNOPSIS: A transient mid-level height pattern is forecast for week-2 across
North America. The most significant feature is predicted to be mid-level low
pressure moving through the central and eastern lower-48 early in the period,
which is favored to bring enhanced precipitation chances to portions of the
east-central U.S. Otherwise, minimal amplification and near normal heights
over
most of the domain favor decreased chances for prolonged hazardous weather
during the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the east-central CONUS,
Tue-Thu, Apr 27-29.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Southwest, Southern Rockies, and
the Central and Southern Plains, Tue-Wed, Apr 27-28.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 22 - MONDAY APRIL 26:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!oRICMbCvGTFWclOu15AINcRtqhsP5kyw9ikXnpXkngdve5niU7YhGWkxikjaTRGpLQAbxoqh$

FOR TUESDAY APRIL 27 - MONDAY MAY 03: Dynamical model guidance from the 6z
GEFS
and 0z ECMWF ensemble depict shortwave troughing moving into the central CONUS
early in the period, with associated surface low pressure ejecting out of the
Rockies. At the same time, surface high pressure is forecast to move over the
western Atlantic. This favors increasing southerly flow across much of the
east-central CONUS, leading to enhanced chances for heavy rain over the region
as the surface low moves through. The ECMWF reforecast tool shows a large area
of the east-central CONUS having at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation
totals exceeding the 85th percentile for the first part of the period. The
GEFS
is less robust, only showing these enhanced probabilities over portions of the
Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi Valley. However, uncalibrated guidance from
both tools depict heavier precipitation totals further south, extending to the
Gulf of Mexico Coast. As a result, a broad slight risk for heavy precipitation
is highlighted across much of the east-central CONUS for Apr 27-29. The ECMWF
ensemble favors some of this enhanced rainfall shifting toward the Eastern
Seaboard by the 29th, but the GEFS is not as aggressive, and therefore, the
hazard is not extended further east at this time.



Increased wind speeds are possible across portions of the Southwest, Southern
Rockies, and Central and Southern Plains as the aforementioned surface low
moves out of the Rockies. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict
parts
of these regions having at least a 20% chance that sustained wind speeds
exceed
25-mph, and therefore a slight risk for high winds is highlighted for Apr 27
and 28. A fairly robust low level jet is forecast to accompany the surface low
as it moves across the central CONUS, and this may bring increased wind speeds
to areas further east and north. However, there is uncertainty whether or not
these high winds mix down, as the forecast surface wind speeds in both models
look modest at best. For this reason, the wind hazard is not extended, but the
potential for gusty winds is noted across the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio
Valleys as the surface low moves by given the tight pressure gradient forecast
to be in place.



Elsewhere across North America, the transient synoptic pattern reduces the
chances of hazardous weather. Increased Pacific flow and atmospheric river
activity may increase the chances for heavy precipitation across portions of
the West Coast of the CONUS, but none of the tools depict rainfall totals
reaching hazards criteria. Unseasonably warm temperatures are possible across
portions of south Texas early in the period, with some areas near the
Texas/Mexico border having temperatures in the upper 90s along with elevated
dew points resulting in heat indices over 100 deg F. However, these
temperatures, although hot, are not expected to have any significant impacts
for the region, and therefore no related hazard is highlighted. Weak mid-level
flow is favored across Alaska resulting in a generally dry pattern through the
period. This should at least limit additional water being added to the
hydrological system during river break up season.

A compact mid-level shortwave trough will move southeastward across
California through the day Tuesday. This will lead to lee
cyclogenesis across southern Nevada. The strengthening low-level
flow field in response to the tightening pressure gradient will
overlap dry surface conditions and dry fuels across portions of
central and north-central Arizona. There may still be some pockets
of moist fuels, especially at higher elevations, but most guidance
indicates critical or near critical fuels in the region with ERCs
near the maximum value recorded this time of year.

...Snow continues to spread south into the Central Rockies/High
Plains this evening before swinging out into the Central Plains,
Midwest, and the Lower Great Lakes on Tuesday...

...Record cold and subfreezing temperatures expected across much
of the south-central United States on Wednesday morning...

...Additional rounds of heavy rain to continue across central
Florida over the next few days...

A late-season upslope snow event is in progress from Wyoming to
northern Colorado as a surge of cold air from Canada continues to
plunge southward. The cold surge will bring rapidly falling
temperatures as well as a quick burst of snow through the northern
and central Rockies/High Plains tonight before overspreading much
of Kansas and southern Nebraska by early Tuesday morning. As a low
pressure wave forms along the sharp cold front, the snow will then
swing eastward through the Midwest and the Lower Great Lakes on
Tuesday. The highest additional snowfall amounts are expected to
occur along the north-central Colorado Rockies, where an
additional foot of snow could fall. Meanwhile, over 2 inches of
snow is likely across the northern half of Kansas and northwest
Missouri. Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories
remain in effect for these regions. As the area of low pressure
moves towards the Great Lakes on Tuesday, a few inches of wet snow
can be expected to accumulate between central Illinois to
northwest Ohio. Snow will struggle to accumulate during the
daytime hours given the high April sun-angle, therefore much of
the snow will stick to grassy surfaces and while falling at night.
By Wednesday, much of the wintry precipitation and accumulating
wet snow will be found across northern and western portions of New
York State and the northern Appalachians.

Unseasonably cold air behind this strong cold front will lead to
widespread freeze and frost concerns beginning tonight across
Midwest and central/southern Plains. Numerous daily record low
temperatures are forecast to be tied or broken on Wednesday
morning as temperatures dip to around 20 degrees below average.
Hard Freeze Warnings and Watches have been issued in eleven states
from North Texas to western Ohio.

Meanwhile, active weather is expected to linger across central
Florida as low pressure waves develop along a slow-moving front.
Occasional showers, heavy at times, together with embedded
thunderstorms can be expected to continue through Tuesday. A few
storms could turn severe. In addition, flash flooding will be a
concern due to upwards of 5 inches of rain forecast to fall across
central Florida during the next few days. By Wednesday morning,
the rain chances should slowly diminish and edge southward into
southern Florida.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon April 19 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 25 - 29 2021

Todays model solutions are in fair agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern forecast across North America and adjacent ocean
areas during the 6-10 day period. Shortwave troughing is predicted to move to
the East Coast, while anomalous ridging with positive 500-hPa anomalies is
forecast over Mainland Alaska. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the
ECMWF and GEFS ensemble mean slightly greater than the Canadian ensemble
means,
due to recent model skill. The resultant manual blend features negative 500-
hPa
height anomalies across most of the northern CONUS, while near to slightly
above normal 500-hPa heights are expected across the southern CONUS.

Probabilities for below normal temperatures are elevated across southern
Oregon, California,Nevada, western Arizona, and from the Northern Great Basin
and Northern Rockies eastward to the western Great Lakes. Meanwhile, above
normal temperature probabilities are favored over most of the south-central
CONUS and Florida, consistent with the operational autoblend and consolidation
forecast tools. Above normal temperature probabilities are increased across
much of Alaska, under the anomalous ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights.

Above normal precipitation is favored over the Western CONUS due to the
potential emergence of shortwaves ahead of a trough offshore of the West
Coast.
Chances of near to below normal precipitation are enhanced across parts of the
Central and Southern Rockies, the Central and Southern Plains, and the Middle
and Lower Mississippi Valley, while above normal precipitation is likely over
parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley, the Upper Great Lakes, and the
Northeast, consistent with operational Autoblend and ERF Consolidation tools.
Below normal precipitation is favored across Alaska, under anomalous ridging
and above normal 500-hPa heights.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
fair model agreement with some disagreement among the the temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 27 - MAY 03, 2021

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in fair agreement on the
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
Anomalous troughing with below normal 500-hPa heights is forecast south of the
Gulf of Alaska. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF ensemble
mean greater than the GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to recent model
skill. The resultant manual blend features near normal heights over much of
the
CONUS and Alaska.

Probabilities for below normal temperatures are higher across parts of the
Northern Plains, the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, and the Upper Great
Lakes, while above normal temperatures are likely over most of the eastern and
south-central CONUS, supported by the operational autoblend and ERF
consolidation tools. Above normal temperatures are favored over Alaska,
consistent with GEFS and ECENS Calibrated refrecast tools.

Chances of below normal precipitation are enhanced across parts of the
Southern
Plains and the Four Corners Region, while near to above normal precipitation
is
favored over the remainder of the CONUS, consistent with operational Autoblend
and ERF Consolidation tools. Below normal precipitation is likely  across
Alaska, supported by GEFS and ECENS calibrated refrecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
fair model agreement with some disagreement among the the temperature and
precipitation tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...Record cold likely for parts of the central U.S. Thursday
morning...
...Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat across the South into the
weekend...

...Overview...

Blocky upper ridging forecast over Alaska and Greenland at high
latitudes and over the Greater Antilles in lower latitudes favors
upper troughing over much of the CONUS. As an upper low south of
Alaska splits off its southern portion toward the West Coast this
weekend, additional troughing will sink southward out of Canada
through the Great Lakes. Ridging will build in between these two
systems next week across the Plains. The pattern is rather chilly
for late April with precipitation chances focused over the South,
East Coast, and the West.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Model solutions seem better clustered today with the mid-larger
scale flow evolution days 3-7 despite a pattern over the lower 48
states with multiple streams and the surrounding blocky flow.
System timing differences remain evident, but seem mitigated by a
favored composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS, 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. This
blend is consistent with ensembles/newer 12 UTC models and
maintains good WPC product continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A southern stream system ejecting from the Southwest and southern
Rockies Fri will work over the Southern Plains where rainfall will
expand along and ahead of a warm front with return of Gulf of
Mexico moisture and instability. Heavy rainfall is likely from the
southern Plains through the lower MS Valley and Southeast Fri-Sat.
Runoff and flooding issues are expected, especially given portions
of the region have received much above normal rainfall in April.
The system may then lift up the East Coast under influence of
northern stream energy from the Great Lakes to bring enhanced
rainfall across the Mid-Atlantic and windy New England Sun/Mon.

Meanwhile well upstream, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low
and surface front will work into the West Coast over the weekend
into early next week, eventually bringing a lower elevation
rain/mountain snow focus into CA, mainly the Sierra.

Areas east of the Rockies will see below normal temperatures
Thursday, perhaps by 10-20 degrees which would support record cold
low temperatures from Texas northeastward toward the Corn
Belt/Midwest. That cold air mass will push eastward but moderate
into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic. With northern stream troughing
nosing southward out of Canada, areas along the border will see
below normal temperatures as well. This should support moderately
heavy snow over the north-central Rockies Thu into Fri with
upslope. An area of above normal temperatures will be over parts
of the West/Great Basin ahead of the upper trough/low while
offshore. As that trough works inland into early next week, the
milder air should shift eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1240 AM CDT Tue Apr 20 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
A compact mid-level shortwave trough will become more amplified
through the period as it drops southeastward through California. Lee
cyclogenesis is expected in Nevada which will tighten the surface
pressure gradient across portions of the Southwest and Great Basin.
This tightening pressure gradient and downward transport of
mid-level flow amid deep mixing will lead to some windy conditions
across portions of central Arizona with winds of 15 to 20 mph. In
addition, very dry surface relative humidity is forecast in the
single digits. These conditions warrant an elevated fire weather
delineation across mostly central Arizona.

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF ARIZONA AND WESTERN NEW
MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
On Wednesday, a strong mid-level jet streak will round the base of
an amplifying mid-level trough and overspread much of Arizona. At
the surface, lee cyclogenesis is expected to continue with a ~1000mb
surface low located somewhere in the southern Great Basin by
Wednesday evening. Farther east, a strong surface low will deepen as
it moves up the East Coast with a cold front trailing along the
coast through the day Wednesday. Strong northwesterly winds will
develop in the wake of this cold front along much of the East Coast.

...Southwest...
Strong surface winds are expected to begin early in the day across
portions of Arizona in response to the strengthening pressure
gradient. However, these winds will strengthen further through the
day as heating leads to deep mixing above 3km AGL. The strongest
winds are expected in north-central Arizona where the core of the
50+ mph mid-level jet streak is forecast to track and where
elevation will make them more susceptible to strong winds. In fact,
extremely critical meteorological conditions are expected with winds
in excess of 30 mph and relative humidity in the single digits.
However, fuels in this area, while dry, are not extremely dry
despite ongoing drought conditions. Therefore, no extremely critical
area is warranted.

...Northern California...
On the northwest side of the surface low, the strengthening pressure
gradient and valley parallel deep layer flow amid deep mixing may
lead to some elevated fire weather conditions in northern portions
of the Central Valley.

...Northern Plains...
Some locally elevated conditions are possible in northern Montana
and North Dakota Wednesday afternoon. It appears more widespread
elevated conditions will remain north of the border, but an hour or
two of winds in excess of 15 mph and relative humidity of 15 to 20
percent is possible.

...Eastern Carolinas...
Breezy northwesterly conditions are expected across much of the
eastern seaboard on Wednesday in the wake of a cold front which will
move through the region. Most guidance keeps the frontal passage
dry. ERC values are still low across Georgia, but ERCs are above the
90th percentile in the eastern Carolinas with some areas above the
97th percentile. Similarly dry and breezy conditions are anticipated
in eastern Virginia, but there is a better chance for precipitation
as the front passes through this region. Winds are expected to be 15
to 20 mph with relative humidity of 25 to 35 percent.

...Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat across the South Friday into
this Weekend...

...Overview...

Blocky upper ridging forecast over Alaska and Greenland at high
latitudes and across the Greater Antilles at lower latitudes
favors upper troughing over much of the CONUS during the medium
range. One system will push into the West Coast this weekend as
another moves through the Southeast and turns the corner up along
the coast as a nor'easter into Monday. Ridging will build in
between these two systems next week across the Plains ahead of the
advancing western system. The pattern is rather chilly for late
April with precipitation chances focused near each frontal system
in the West, South, and East.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z model cycle, a blended deterministic solution
sufficed for the first few days of the forecast. Finally the
models have mostly converged on the system timing out of the
West/Southwest, mostly in line toward the ECMWF-thinking. Trend
has been a bit quicker through the lower Mississippi Valley, but
was hesitant to jump as quick as the ECMWF at this point. A
middle-ground solution fit well. As the system lifts toward the
coastal Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF formed a
reasonable pairing near their ensemble means and each other
(Canadian too weak and farther south), wrapping up another
occluded system near Maine. Back to the West, trend has been only
a bit quicker, perhaps still within the noise, with much better
ensemble overlap than in the previous several days. Gave extra
weighting to the ECMWF ensemble mean as it has been most stalwart
in this wintry/blocky flow pattern, though the GEFS mean depicted
a plausible solution as well. Utilized the 00Z/01Z NBM for most of
the gridded fields with some added ECMWF ensemble mean influence.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Rainfall will expand along and ahead of a warm front across the
lower Mississippi Valley on Friday, aided by Gulf of Mexico
moisture and instability. Locally heavy rainfall is likely into
the Southeast through late Saturday as the area of low pressure
moves eastward. Runoff and flooding issues are quite possible,
especially in areas that have received much above normal rainfall
this month. The system is then forecast to lift up the East Coast
as trailing northern stream energy from the Great Lakes merges
into the coastal system. Enhanced rainfall is possible into New
England with windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens.

In the West, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will work into the West Coast over the weekend into early
next week, eventually bringing a lower elevation rain/mountain
snow focus into CA (mainly the Sierra, but even down into the
higher elevations of Southern California). Rainfall does not
appear to be more than light to perhaps modest along the coast.
Once the system moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will
increase for convectively-driven rainfall.

A chilly air mass Friday over the East (but especially eastern
Montana) will moderate this weekend. An area of above normal
temperatures over parts of the West/Great Basin ahead of the upper
trough/low will shift eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains by next week. Cooler than normal temperatures will spread
into the West Mon-Tue as readings may be 5-15 degrees colder than
normal.

...Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat across the South Friday into
this Weekend...

...Overview...

Blocky upper ridging forecast over Alaska and Greenland at high
latitudes and across the Greater Antilles at lower latitudes
favors upper troughing over much of the CONUS during the medium
range. One system will push into the West Coast this weekend as
another moves through the Southeast and turns the corner up along
the coast as a nor'easter into Monday. Ridging will build in
between these two systems next week across the Plains ahead of the
advancing western system. The pattern is rather chilly for late
April with precipitation chances focused near each frontal system
in the West, South, and East.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z model cycle, a blended deterministic solution
sufficed for the first few days of the forecast. Finally the
models have mostly converged on the system timing out of the
West/Southwest, mostly in line toward the ECMWF-thinking. Trend
has been a bit quicker through the lower Mississippi Valley, but
was hesitant to jump as quick as the ECMWF at this point. A
middle-ground solution fit well. As the system lifts toward the
coastal Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF formed a
reasonable pairing near their ensemble means and each other
(Canadian too weak and farther south), wrapping up another
occluded system near Maine. Back to the West, trend has been only
a bit quicker, perhaps still within the noise, with much better
ensemble overlap than in the previous several days. Gave extra
weighting to the ECMWF ensemble mean as it has been most stalwart
in this wintry/blocky flow pattern, though the GEFS mean depicted
a plausible solution as well. Utilized the 00Z/01Z NBM for most of
the gridded fields with some added ECMWF ensemble mean influence.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Rainfall will expand along and ahead of a warm front across the
lower Mississippi Valley on Friday, aided by Gulf of Mexico
moisture and instability. Locally heavy rainfall is likely into
the Southeast through late Saturday as the area of low pressure
moves eastward. Runoff and flooding issues are quite possible,
especially in areas that have received much above normal rainfall
this month. The system is then forecast to lift up the East Coast
as trailing northern stream energy from the Great Lakes merges
into the coastal system. Enhanced rainfall is possible into New
England with windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens.

In the West, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will work into the West Coast over the weekend into early
next week, eventually bringing a lower elevation rain/mountain
snow focus into CA (mainly the Sierra, but even down into the
higher elevations of Southern California). Rainfall does not
appear to be more than light to perhaps modest along the coast.
Once the system moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will
increase for convectively-driven rainfall.

A chilly air mass Friday over the East (but especially eastern
Montana) will moderate this weekend. An area of above normal
temperatures over parts of the West/Great Basin ahead of the upper
trough/low will shift eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains by next week. Cooler than normal temperatures will spread
into the West Mon-Tue as readings may be 5-15 degrees colder than
normal.

...Snow is expected to spread quickly from the Central Plains to
the Midwest today, and then across northern New England on
Wednesday into Thursday...

...Subfreezing record cold temperatures expected across much of
the south-central U.S. Wednesday morning, shifting to parts of the
eastern U.S. Thursday morning...

...Threat of heavy rain gradually diminishes across central and
southern Florida over the next couple days...

Snow associated with a late-season upslope snow event over the
central Rockies is now spreading eastward across the Central
Plains as a low pressure wave develops along the sharp cold front.
 This wave is forecast to track quickly northeastward to bring
mixed rain and snow across the Midwest today and a round of snow
across the Ohio Valley tonight.  On Wednesday, the system is
forecast to intensify more rapidly as it moves across New England.
 A swath of wet snow is expected to the north of the storm track
with 6 to locally 12 inches possible near the Canadian border.
Mixed wintry precipitation is expected near the storm track while
rain and a few thunderstorms pass to the south.

Unseasonably cold air will be ushered southward behind the
intensifying storm, leading to widespread freeze and frost
concerns tonight across the central/southern Plains the Midwest.
Numerous daily record low temperatures are forecast to be tied or
broken on Wednesday morning as temperatures dip to below freezing,
which is about 20 degrees below average.  Hard Freeze Warnings and
Watches have been issued from northern Texas to the lower Great
Lakes. The record low temperatures are forecast to shift into
parts of the eastern U.S. by Thursday morning.

Meanwhile, active weather across Florida as been edging very
slowly southward into southern Florida ahead of a slow-moving
front.  Occasional showers, heavy at times, together with embedded
thunderstorms can be expected to continue today into Wednesday
morning across southern Florida before improving conditions set in
later on Wednesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0948 AM CST Sun Feb 28 2021

Valid 281700Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA AND
SOUTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO...

The ongoing forecast is generally on track and no changes are
needed.  Elevated to critical fire-weather conditions remain likely
for several hours this afternoon.  Over time, surface winds will
shift to northwesterly across the critical area in southeastern
Arizona/southwestern New Mexico and while the airmass will remain
dry, temperatures will cool into the 30s and 40s in lower elevation
areas.  This wind shift may complicate any ongoing fire suppression
efforts.

See the previous discussion below for more information.

..Cook.. 02/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CST Sun Feb 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
...Southwest...
Mid-level flow is expected to strengthen above 50 mph near the
confluence of Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico by this afternoon.
Deep mixing is expected in the region, and thus, some of this
stronger flow is expected to be transported toward the surface. In
addition, the surface pressure gradient is expected to tighten as
low-pressure develops in southern New Mexico. As a result, winds are
expected to be around 25 mph with relative humidity around 5 to 10
percent.

...Southern California...
Offshore flow has started across southern California early this
morning, and is expected to strengthen substantially through
mid-morning as mid to upper level winds strengthen. While
temperatures will remain quite cool across the region, winds are
expected to be very strong and thus an elevated delineation is
warranted. Offshore flow is expected to continue through the day and
into tonight, but the strongest winds (and the majority of the fire
weather concerns) are expected to wane by late afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1114 AM CST Sun Feb 28 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Recent high resolution guidance indicates lingering offshore flow
across portions of the San Diego County Mountains through mid-day,
with terrain-favored areas experiencing gusts to 20 mph.  This will
result in locally elevated fire-weather conditions, though surface
winds may not exceed elevated thresholds in a widespread-enough
basis for an elevated delineation.

Farther north, areas of eastern Montana will experience breezy
westerly surface flow and sub-20% RH values at times during the
afternoon.  Snowpack is evident on satellite imagery, however, which
may limit drying of fuels despite the dry near-surface airmass.
Locally elevated fire-weather is possible where fuels are dry.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0129 AM CST Sun Feb 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Monday, surface high pressure is expected to dominate much of the
western CONUS into the northern Plains, bringing mostly light winds
and cool temperatures. Therefore, fire weather concerns will be
minimal.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

During the course of the past 12 to 24 hours or so, models and
ensembles have made another significant adjustment pertaining to
the synoptic pattern evolution through the medium-range period
across U.S. mainland.  The issue remains to be the timing of an
upper low that is forecast to track across the Southwest later
this week, together with its subsequent interaction with a broad
trough that is forecast to dip into the eastern U.S.  Recent
global model runs have significantly delayed the time of arrival
of the upper low into the Southwest.  This delay in arrival time
leads to less interaction with the broad upper trough dipping into
the eastern U.S., which would lessen the potential for late-week
cyclogenesis over the southern Plains.  In fact, there is now
general model consensus to suppress further development of the a
frontal wave over the southern High Plains late this week due to
amplification of the East Coast upper trough.  The WPC
medium-range forecasts followed this model trend and showed only a
suppressed frontal wave over the southern High Plains late this
week.

Earlier in the forecast period, models generally agree that a
developing frontal wave will move off the Southeast U.S. coast at
a slightly faster pace on Wednesday.  Meanwhile,
as upper troughing amplifies off the West Coast mid-late week,
latest model consensus continues to showing a trend of pushing the
trough slightly faster toward land.  The 12Z CMC was a compromise
though on the fast side with the upstream feature.  Some aspects
of each solution could have some merit.  The GFS is the fastest
with respect to pushing the trough inland across the Pacific
Northwest on Saturday versus the ECMWF's Sunday arrival. The
typical GFS biases suggest it could be too fast but at that time
frame there has been a modest faster trend with this feature in
most guidance recently.  Also the idea of a flatter shortwave
ejecting into the downstream ridge could have some merit versus
the ECMWF/ECMWF mean that bring more height falls into the ridge.
Thus a blended approach seems best for the purposes of a single
deterministic forecast.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived based on a
multi-model consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z
GFS/GEFS with smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean and
the 00Z NAEFS.  Beginning on Day 5, more of the 06Z GEFS together
with the 00Z EC mean were used to account for the increasing
forecast uncertainty.

On Wednesday expect precipitation over the Southeast/southern
Mid-Atlantic to taper off as a wave initially along the
southeastern coast moves off into the Atlantic.  Some rainfall
could still be locally heavy early in the day depending on timing
of this system.  The upper low closing off to the west of
California during the short range period should move through the
Southwest and into the Plains during the latter half of the week.
This system will bring some rain into parts of southern California
and rain/higher elevation snow to portions of the Southwest and
southern Rockies.  Then rainfall over the Plains should stay
suppressed at least as far south as the southeastern quadrant of
the lower 48 as the surface system drops toward the Gulf Coast and
possibly dissipating before reaching the coast.  Precipitation
across the Southeast is now much suppressed late week into the
weekend compared with previous forecasts.  Expect most effects to
remain offshore the East Coast if low pressure develops over the
western Atlantic next weekend.

Precipitation ahead of the amplifying eastern Pacific trough aloft
will initially focus primarily over Vancouver Island and into the
Olympics, with some moderate to heavy totals possible.  Expect
rain and mountain snow of varying intensity to extend southward to
the central West Coast by late week and the weekend.  Some light
precipitation will be possible at times during the period over the
northern Rockies, and possibly over parts of the Interior
West/central Rockies next weekend depending on the details of
shortwave energy aloft.

The forecast is very consistent in showing above normal
temperatures over the Northern Plains and vicinity through the
period, with decent coverage of plus 10-25F anomalies for highs
and plus 10-20F anomalies for morning lows.  Gradual amplification
of the large scale pattern will bring a warming trend to the West.
 The warmest days should be around Friday-Saturday with the Great
Basin the most likely to see readings up to 10-15F above normal.
On the other hand areas near the East Coast will see a cooling
trend that could bring highs down to 5-15F below normal by next
weekend.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

During the course of the past 12 to 24 hours or so, models and
ensembles have made another significant adjustment pertaining to
the synoptic pattern evolution through the medium-range period
across U.S. mainland.  The issue remains to be the timing of an
upper low that is forecast to track across the Southwest later
this week, together with its subsequent interaction with a broad
trough that is forecast to dip into the eastern U.S.  Recent
global model runs have significantly delayed the time of arrival
of the upper low into the Southwest.  This delay in arrival time
leads to less interaction with the broad upper trough dipping into
the eastern U.S., which would lessen the potential for late-week
cyclogenesis over the southern Plains.  In fact, there is now
general model consensus to suppress further development of the a
frontal wave over the southern High Plains late this week due to
amplification of the East Coast upper trough.  The WPC
medium-range forecasts followed this model trend and showed only a
suppressed frontal wave over the southern High Plains late this
week.

Earlier in the forecast period, models generally agree that a
developing frontal wave will move off the Southeast U.S. coast at
a slightly faster pace on Wednesday.  Meanwhile,
as upper troughing amplifies off the West Coast mid-late week,
latest model consensus continues to showing a trend of pushing the
trough slightly faster toward land.  The 12Z CMC was a compromise
though on the fast side with the upstream feature.  Some aspects
of each solution could have some merit.  The GFS is the fastest
with respect to pushing the trough inland across the Pacific
Northwest on Saturday versus the ECMWF's Sunday arrival. The
typical GFS biases suggest it could be too fast but at that time
frame there has been a modest faster trend with this feature in
most guidance recently.  Also the idea of a flatter shortwave
ejecting into the downstream ridge could have some merit versus
the ECMWF/ECMWF mean that bring more height falls into the ridge.
Thus a blended approach seems best for the purposes of a single
deterministic forecast.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived based on a
multi-model consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z
GFS/GEFS with smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean and
the 00Z NAEFS.  Beginning on Day 5, more of the 06Z GEFS together
with the 00Z EC mean were used to account for the increasing
forecast uncertainty.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southern Plains and the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys
through Monday morning...

...Some snow is possible across parts of the Northeast and the
Southern Rockies/Southern High Plains...

A front extending roughly from the Mid-Atlantic southwestward to
the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley will slowly move off
most of the East Coast by Monday evening. In contrast, a
quasi-stationary front lingers over the Southeast/Central Gulf
Coast through Tuesday.  Moisture will pool along the boundary
producing showers and thunderstorms from parts of the Southern
Plains to the Tennessee Valley on Sunday evening into Monday
morning.  The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
over parts of the Southern Plains and the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys through Monday morning.  The
greatest threat from the severe thunderstorms will be hail, with a
10% chance of hail two inches or greater over parts of the
Ark-La-Tex region.  Other threats with severe thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, damaging severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail,
and tornadoes.  Areas of heavy rain are also expected with some of
the thunderstorms. As the front moves eastward, the severe threat
diminishes on Monday, while a few areas of heavy rain are
possible.  Rain will also develop over parts of the Ohio
Valley/Great Lakes into the Mid-Atlantic and moving into the
Northeast on Sunday evening.  Overnight Sunday, the rain will move
into parts of New England.

Meanwhile, a front over the Upper Great Lakes snaking roughly
northwestward to the Northern High Plains will move eastward into
the Northeast by Monday evening.  The system will produce light
snow over parts of the Upper Great Lakes on Sunday evening, ending
overnight, as rain over the Lower Great Lakes changes over to
light snow by Monday morning.  The rain over the Central
Appalachians will change over to snow on Monday afternoon before
ending by Monday evening.  Also, by Monday evening, the rain over
New England will change over to snow.  Light lake effect snow will
linger downwind from the Great Lakes overnight Monday ending by
Tuesday morning.

Furthermore, upper-level energy over the Southwest/Southern
Rockies will move eastward into the Southern Plains by Tuesday
morning.  The energy will help produce light snow over parts of
the Southern Rockies and move into the Southern High Plains on
Monday morning.  The light snow will end overnight Monday.
Elsewhere, a weak front will move onshore over the Pacific
Northwest overnight Monday, producing light snow areas over parts
of the Northern Cascades and Northern Rockies early Tuesday into
Tuesday evening.  On the southern end of an upper-level trough
over the West, gusty winds are possible for California into the
Desert Southwest and Southern High Plains. Scattered High Wind
Warnings and Wind Advisories are in effect, and the winds could
cause elevated fire danger as well, with Red Flag Warnings and a
Critical Risk of fire weather for southeastern Arizona and
southwestern New Mexico.

30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR MARCH 2021

The updated March 2021 temperature and precipitation outlooks are not too
significantly changed from the previous mid-month outlook. The updated
outlooks
utilized the latest short-range, medium-range, extended-range and subseasonal
dynamical model forecast guidance for some adjustments. In addition, the most
recent assessment of boundary conditions (anomalous soil moisture and snow
cover), the MJO state and the AO state are also considered in making the
update.



The uncertainty whether short-range forecasts of a change to a positive AO
phase would persist and be supported by changes in stratosphere troposphere
interaction have been removed as the extended range forecasts of the AO
support
continuation of the current positive AO phase through at least mid-month.



The MJO influence described at mid-month, however, remains in play as
predictions of the MJO signal (i.e., RMM) are forecast to shift from Phase 5/6
(Indonesia/far western Pacific) to potentially Phase 8/1 over the next two
weeks. This increases uncertainty in the temperature outlook some for the
Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley and Northeast as the odds for below-normal temperatures
would increase for the 3rd and 4th weeks of March. This is strongly at adds
with the latest Week 3-4 dynamical model guidance which continues persistence
of favored above-normal temperatures for the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS
from Week-2.



Anomalous snow cover and depth remains strongly negative across the northern
plains as noted in the mid-month outlook. Soil moisture anomalies are likely
to
become increasingly positive for areas in the lower Mississippi Valley, the
Tennessee Valley and lower Ohio Valley as a combination of antecedent
conditions from recent snowmelt and heavy rains in some areas prior to the
start of the month.



Based on the above factors, the updated March 2021 temperature outlook keeps
elevated odds for monthly mean below-normal temperatures for southern Alaska,
and the Far West - which is a more narrow area than the mid-month outlook
depiction. Above-normal monthly mean temperatures remain favored for the
eastern two-thirds of the CONUS, however, there are some changes. First,
above-normal temperatures in the Southwest were shifted eastward in the
updated
outlook and probabilities across the northern Plains and Great Lakes are
increased. Lower probabilities are located in a zonal swath for the Tennessee
and lower Ohio Valley's due to possible impact from above-normal surface
wetness and also along the eastern seaboard due to cooler temperatures
forecast
early in the month and also due to the potential impact from the MJO, albeit
highly uncertain.



For precipitation, the latest dynamical model guidance, especially in the
short
term help better focus favored above-normal precipitation in the Tennessee
Valley at the start of the month of March. This region and areas northward to
the Great Lakes are slightly modified from the half month lead outlook.
Below-normal precipitation is highlighted from the interior West and Southwest
eastward to the central and southern Plains and along the Gulf Coast and
Florida. Changes in these regions from the earlier outlook include removal of
the slightly elevated odds for above-normal precipitation in the northern
Rockies, removal or reducing of chances for below normal precipitation for
parts of California and the central and southern Great Basin and Rockies. A
strong jet forecast to impinge western Alaska through at least the first half
of the month, favors elevated odds for above-normal precipitation for much of
Alaska with removal of the small region of elevated odds for below-normal
precipitation along the Alaska south coast in the mid-month outlook.



****************************************************************************

****************************************************************************



As we approach the month of March, the pattern across the greater North
America
region appears to be in the process of changing from the last few weeks. Week
2
dynamical model forecast guidance supports a change to anomalous ridging over
the north central Pacific with the central North America mean trough shifted
westward and deepening over portions of western North America including into
western CONUS. Downstream of this, more amplified ridging and positive 500-hPa
height departures are forecast for much of the southeast U.S. favoring a more
southwesterly-westerly mean flow for the eastern half of the CONUS then in
recent weeks.



The most recent Week 3-4 guidance from the CFS, ECMWF and extended GEFS
support
a continuation of this change, in the mean, for approximately the first two
weeks of March. March CFS forecasts as well as those from the majority of the
NMME and Copernicus model suites also favor this pattern and associated
anomalous temperature and precipitation patterns which are consistent with
typical La Nina conditions in many ways during this point in the seasonal
cycle.



Other factors to consider in addition to a review of the available dynamical
model guidance across time scales, is the state and forecast evolution of the
MJO, the AO and most recent anomalous snow cover.



The MJO has been active during January and February resulting in both
constructive and destructive interference with La Nina impacting anomalous
tropical rainfall, circulation and other variables in the Pacific basin.
Forecast information suggests that the MJO is likely to weaken or become less
coherent entering March and is not strongly utilized in the March outlook due
to this as well as indications that much of recent mid-latitude temperature
and
precipitation anomalies have most likely been driven by high latitude
subseasonal variability.



Predictions in the short-term (next 10 days) indicate the phase of the AO
(which has returned to near zero) to remain near zero or weakly positive in
the
mean as compared to the strongly negative phase of the last couple months. The
Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) of early-mid January would continue to
elevate odds for a negative AO phase into the month of March resulting in the
continuation of potential cold air outbreaks into the mid-latitudes. There is
high uncertainty, however, in whether the negative phase of the AO will return
and persist and if so where troughing and so favored below-normal temperatures
are most likely to develop at forecast lead times well into the month of
March.



Finally, substantially below-normal snow cover and snow depth exist across
parts of the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley. Although, early in
the seasonal cycle, taken alone, this is likely to favor above-normal
temperatures in these areas.



After consideration of the factors described above, the March temperature
outlook favors monthly mean below-normal temperatures for a region stretching
from south-central Alaska southeastward to include northern California, the
Pacific Northwest and the northern Rockies. This is strongly supported by
dynamical model guidance across time scales and is consistent with La Nina
conditions. Elevated probabilities for above-normal temperatures are depicted
for parts of the north and west coast of Alaska based on negative sea ice and
positive ocean surface temperature trends especially later in the month of
March.



Dynamical model guidance and in some cases typical La Nina conditions and
positive temperature trends favor above-normal temperatures for a region from
the Southwest eastward to include the southern CONUS and northward to
encompass
the central Mississippi Valley, eastern Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and eastern
seaboard. Only slightly tilted odds of above-normal temperatures or
Equal-Chances (EC) are depicted for the northern and central Plains, central
and upper Mississippi Valley and parts of the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes and
Tennessee Valley due to the uncertainty and conflicting indicators described
above with respect to the phase of the AO, anomalous snow cover and snow depth
and dynamical model guidance.



For precipitation, below-normal monthly total precipitation amounts are most
likely for the southern tier of the CONUS with some expansion of this
highlighted area to the central Great Plains, primarily based on dynamical
model guidance which is consistent with La Nina typical impacts. For similar
reasons, elevated odds for above-normal precipitation is forecast for a small
region in the northern Rockies and for the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region.
For Alaska, elevated odds for above-normal precipitation is depicted for parts
of the north and west coasts associated with anticipated more open and warmer
waters in nearby areas as well as typical La Nina impacts. Below-normal
precipitation is most likely for the south-central coast and far northern
Alaska Panhandle.

FORECASTER: Jon Gottschalck

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1981 and 2010, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

The next monthly outlook...for Apr ... will be issued on Thu Mar 18 2021

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1981-2010 base period.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun February 28 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1232 AM CST Mon Mar 01 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Mid-to upper level ridging and surface high pressure in the western
CONUS (where the only dry fuels reside) will limit the overall fire
weather threat. Some dry and breezy conditions are possible in
eastern Montana and western North Dakota as an area of low pressure
moves across the Canadian Prairies and strengthens the pressure
gradient. However, fuels are still quite moist in this region and
therefore, no elevated area is warranted.

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Weak lee troughing in eastern Colorado may lead to some gusty winds
in eastern New Mexico. However, the lee troughing does not appear
strong enough for widespread winds in excess of 15 mph. Some dry
northwesterly flow will be present in the northern Plains, but fuels
are still quite moist in this region. Therefore, no fire weather
areas are warranted this outlook.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Latest models and means continue to show a fairly amplified large
scale upper pattern featuring a west-central U.S./Plains ridge
between mean troughs over the eastern Pacific and East Coast.
Embedded within this pattern will be an upper low that should
reach the southwestern U.S. and then the Southern Plains after
midweek, followed by rather pronounced suppression of the upper
energy and surface reflection beneath the eastern mean trough
aloft.  The axis of this trough should be far enough eastward to
keep any developing Atlantic low pressure by the weekend/early
next week well offshore.  The eastern Pacific mean trough will
feature two primary features, one likely reaching the West Coast
early in the weekend (with leading wavy front) and then ejecting
inland followed by amplifying upstream energy that should bring
another system toward the Northwest toward late weekend/early next
week.

Guidance has stabilized since runs from 24 hours ago had adjusted
slower for the upper low tracking into the southwestern U.S. and
Southern Plains, followed by suppression of most moisture/surface
waviness around the southern periphery of high pressure that
builds over parts of the east-central/eastern U.S. and Southern
Plains.  Hopefully this evolution represents something close to a
"final answer" after multiple days of wildly diverse and
inconsistent solutions, first for whether an upper low would form
to begin with and then the low's track/timing.

The primary forecast discrepancy upstream regards how the leading
trough off the West Coast ejects inland after guidance maintains
good consensus into Friday.  Thus far there have generally been
two persistent clusters, a slower/sharper ECMWF-led majority that
ultimately brings the remaining shortwave energy
eastward/east-northeastward as it continues across the lower 48,
and the faster/flatter GFS-GEFS mean that take more of the energy
around the ridge.  CMC runs through 12Z have been somewhat of a
compromise.  A blended approach still looks reasonable, leaning
two-thirds or so toward the majority cluster near the West Coast
into Saturday while toning down the strength of this energy
relative to the 12Z ECMWF as it continues into the large scale
mean ridge.  The 00Z GFS/GEFS mean have adjusted a little slower
than their prior runs, the CMC has adjusted close to the ECMWF
idea, and the new ECMWF has become less amplified as the energy
ejects inland--in sum maintaining general support for current
preferences.  The next system that reloads the East Pacific mean
trough aloft shows fairly good large scale agreement in most
models and means (00Z CMC could be somewhat flat).  Thus a
model/ensemble mean composite represents the large scale pattern
well while downplaying low-predictability details during the
latter part of the forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The upper low likely to reach the Southwest/Great Basin area by
early Thursday will produce locally enhanced rain and higher
elevation snow over the Four Corners states with moisture then
extending eastward into the Plains.  Some moderate to heavy
rainfall is possible over the Plains but likely over a fairly
small area.  Then most of the rainfall should trend lighter as it
gets suppressed along and south of the Gulf Coast, though activity
could rebound again over parts of the Florida Peninsula during the
weekend.  Continue to expect any low pressure development over the
western Atlantic from the weekend into early next week to be well
offshore.  From late week into the weekend the eastern Great Lakes
could see some lake effect activity in prevailing cool cyclonic
flow.

Precipitation associated with the first eastern Pacific upper
trough/surface front will focus primarily over Vancouver Island
and into the Olympics at first and then extend southward toward
the central West Coast and possibly farther south over California.
 A frontal wave nearing the coast may support a band of heavier
precipitation by Saturday.  Rain and mountain snow will trend
lighter as the upper shortwave continues inland, with mostly light
totals over the Interior West and Rockies.  The next system should
bring another episode of rain and mountain snow to the northern
half or two-thirds of the West Coast.

Expect temperatures over the Northern Plains and vicinity to
remain well above normal through the period with plus 10-25F
anomalies for highs and only slightly less extreme for morning
lows.  The amplified pattern aloft will also bring a more moderate
warming trend to the West including warmest anomalies of plus
10-15F for highs from portions of the Interior West into the
Southwest and eventually southern Rockies.  Meanwhile the upper
trough near the East Coast will keep that part of the country on
the chilly side.  Highs of 5-15F below normal are likely to be
most widespread Friday-Sunday.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Latest models and means continue to show a fairly amplified large
scale upper pattern featuring a west-central U.S./Plains ridge
between mean troughs over the eastern Pacific and East Coast.
Embedded within this pattern will be an upper low that should
reach the southwestern U.S. and then the Southern Plains after
midweek, followed by rather pronounced suppression of the upper
energy and surface reflection beneath the eastern mean trough
aloft.  The axis of this trough should be far enough eastward to
keep any developing Atlantic low pressure by the weekend/early
next week well offshore.  The eastern Pacific mean trough will
feature two primary features, one likely reaching the West Coast
early in the weekend (with leading wavy front) and then ejecting
inland followed by amplifying upstream energy that should bring
another system toward the Northwest toward late weekend/early next
week.

Guidance has stabilized since runs from 24 hours ago had adjusted
slower for the upper low tracking into the southwestern U.S. and
Southern Plains, followed by suppression of most moisture/surface
waviness around the southern periphery of high pressure that
builds over parts of the east-central/eastern U.S. and Southern
Plains.  Hopefully this evolution represents something close to a
"final answer" after multiple days of wildly diverse and
inconsistent solutions, first for whether an upper low would form
to begin with and then the low's track/timing.

The primary forecast discrepancy upstream regards how the leading
trough off the West Coast ejects inland after guidance maintains
good consensus into Friday.  Thus far there have generally been
two persistent clusters, a slower/sharper ECMWF-led majority that
ultimately brings the remaining shortwave energy
eastward/east-northeastward as it continues across the lower 48,
and the faster/flatter GFS-GEFS mean that take more of the energy
around the ridge.  CMC runs through 12Z have been somewhat of a
compromise.  A blended approach still looks reasonable, leaning
two-thirds or so toward the majority cluster near the West Coast
into Saturday while toning down the strength of this energy
relative to the 12Z ECMWF as it continues into the large scale
mean ridge.  The 00Z GFS/GEFS mean have adjusted a little slower
than their prior runs, the CMC has adjusted close to the ECMWF
idea, and the new ECMWF has become less amplified as the energy
ejects inland--in sum maintaining general support for current
preferences.  The next system that reloads the East Pacific mean
trough aloft shows fairly good large scale agreement in most
models and means (00Z CMC could be somewhat flat).  Thus a
model/ensemble mean composite represents the large scale pattern
well while downplaying low-predictability details during the
latter part of the forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The upper low likely to reach the Southwest/Great Basin area by
early Thursday will produce locally enhanced rain and higher
elevation snow over the Four Corners states with moisture then
extending eastward into the Plains.  Some moderate to heavy
rainfall is possible over the Plains but likely over a fairly
small area.  Then most of the rainfall should trend lighter as it
gets suppressed along and south of the Gulf Coast, though activity
could rebound again over parts of the Florida Peninsula during the
weekend.  Continue to expect any low pressure development over the
western Atlantic from the weekend into early next week to be well
offshore.  From late week into the weekend the eastern Great Lakes
could see some lake effect activity in prevailing cool cyclonic
flow.

Precipitation associated with the first eastern Pacific upper
trough/surface front will focus primarily over Vancouver Island
and into the Olympics at first and then extend southward toward
the central West Coast and possibly farther south over California.
 A frontal wave nearing the coast may support a band of heavier
precipitation by Saturday.  Rain and mountain snow will trend
lighter as the upper shortwave continues inland, with mostly light
totals over the Interior West and Rockies.  The next system should
bring another episode of rain and mountain snow to the northern
half or two-thirds of the West Coast.

Expect temperatures over the Northern Plains and vicinity to
remain well above normal through the period with plus 10-25F
anomalies for highs and only slightly less extreme for morning
lows.  The amplified pattern aloft will also bring a more moderate
warming trend to the West including warmest anomalies of plus
10-15F for highs from portions of the Interior West into the
Southwest and eventually southern Rockies.  Meanwhile the upper
trough near the East Coast will keep that part of the country on
the chilly side.  Highs of 5-15F below normal are likely to be
most widespread Friday-Sunday.

...Rain and thunderstorms are forecast across the Gulf Coast
states over the next couple of days...

...Light snow and gusty winds are expected in the Great Lakes to
Northeast through tonight...

After a wet several days in the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys,
rainfall there will end this morning behind a cold frontal
passage. For the first part of the workweek, rain and
thunderstorms are expected to focus across the Gulf Coast states
as moisture from the Gulf of Mexico streams into the region. As a
surface low pressure system moves eastward along a front, rain
will shift from eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley
today and tonight toward the Southeast on Tuesday. Rainfall
amounts of 1 to locally 3 inches are forecast for these areas, and
Marginal Risks of excessive rainfall are in place, indicating
isolated flash floods are possible. On the back edge of the
precipitation, light snow is possible for the Southern
Rockies/Southern High Plains early today. Then light snow or mixed
precipitation is possible for the Southern/Central Appalachians
Tuesday night into Wednesday.

Rain should also clear out of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast today
after the cold front passes, but gusty westerly winds are likely
behind the cold front, prompting Wind Advisories for much of the
region. Additionally, snow is forecast to spread across the Great
Lakes region and toward the Northeast today into tonight. Snow
amounts will generally be light, but localized accumulations of a
few inches are possible. Snow showers could continue for the
interior Northeast Tuesday, but should generally be insignificant.
Elsewhere, the rest of the U.S. should remain dry through early
Wednesday, with the exception of light precipitation in the
Pacific Northwest.

In terms of temperatures, the East Coast can expect warmer than
average conditions today, with daily records for warm minimum
temperatures in jeopardy this morning. Temperatures should then
flip to cooler than average across the East Coast on Tuesday (with
the exception of the Florida peninsula), along with a cooler than
normal Southeast due to the cloudiness and rain. The Southern High
Plains will be cooler than normal especially in terms of high
temperatures today. Meanwhile, the Northern/Central Plains can
expect warmer than average temperatures, particularly on Tuesday
when highs could rise into the 50s and 60s.

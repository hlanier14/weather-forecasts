NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0946 AM CST Fri Feb 05 2021

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed for the ongoing forecast. Mid-morning surface
observations across east NM/west TX show weak winds and relative
humidity values slightly higher than this time yesterday due to the
recent cold air intrusion into the region. Water-vapor imagery hints
at stronger mid-level flow approaching from the west/northwest,
which matches well with guidance and should support increased
downslope warming/drying this afternoon. However, localized elevated
conditions still appear to be the most likely scenario along the lee
of the higher elevation as outlined in the previous discussion
below.

..Moore.. 02/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CST Fri Feb 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
An expansive upper-level trough will remain anchored over the
central U.S., with a broad region of enhanced northwesterly
mid-level flow overspreading much of the western CONUS, extending
into parts of the Southwest and southern High Plains. Diurnal
heating and vertical mixing will result in sustained winds
approaching 15-20 mph along and east of the Sacramento/Guadalupe
Ranges in south-central New Mexico during the afternoon, while RH
values fall to near 20%. This combination of parameters should yield
at least locally elevated fire-weather conditions for perhaps a few
hours, however, such conditions appear too localized/transient amid
marginally receptive fuels to warrant the inclusion of an elevated
area at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

1242 PM CST Fri Feb 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Recent guidance has come into better agreement regarding the
evolution of the mid-level shortwave trough and the associated
surface low and cold front. The post-frontal wind and relative
humidity conditions outlined in the previous discussion remain valid
and should support at least a few hours of elevated fire weather
conditions. These conditions appear most likely to occur over the
Rolling Plains of northwest TX where fuels are not as receptive as
locations further west/southwest. As such, no risk areas are
introduced. However, it should be noted that localized elevated
conditions are possible along the NM/TX border and southwest TX
during the early afternoon when winds will remain elevated and RH
values will begin to reach their diurnal minimums.

..Moore.. 02/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CST Fri Feb 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
The broad upper-level trough will remain quasi-stationary over the
CONUS. Meanwhile, an embedded mid-level short-wave trough will
quickly traverse portions of the southern High Plains during the
forecast period, with an attendant region of enhanced mid-level
flow. At the surface, a cold front will sweep across much of the
Southern Plains. Post-frontal winds of 15-20 mph, gusting to 25-30
mph, appear possible, with RH values falling to near 20% during the
afternoon. There exists a fair amount of disagreement among the
mid-range guidance on the evolution in the aforementioned short-wave
trough. Consequently, uncertainty exists in the placement of surface
features that would yield an elevated fire-weather designation.
Therefore, while elevated fire-weather conditions seem quite
possible, despite marginally receptive fuels over the region, no
highlights have been introduced at this time.

...Northern Plains to Midwest Arctic outbreak gradually expanding
to the south and east...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles still advertise a pattern favorable for
extremely cold conditions persisting over the central U.S. through
next week with gradual expansion of the cold air farther
south/east with time.  The West will see more moderate
temperatures but with a general cooling trend.  During the
forecast period the eastern half of the lower 48 should see
multiple precipitation areas of various types, with a general
tendency for the rain-snow line/possible icy mix transition zone
to push farther south by late in the week.

Consensus continues to show a blocky Canada pattern holding a deep
upper low just north of the U.S.-Canada border through at least
midweek and possibly beyond, while mean ridging persists over the
eastern Pacific.  These features will help to maintain cyclonic
mean flow over the continental U.S. next week.  Teleconnection
relationships seem to provide some background on the developing
guidance spread that becomes significant over some areas by late
in the week.  Multi-day mean charts at the D+8 time frame
generally highlight two positive height anomaly centers, one over
the eastern Pacific and another just northeast of Hudson Bay.  The
Pacific center favors positively tilted troughing over the West
and moderately above normal heights over about the southeastern
third of the CONUS (along with near/moderately above normal
temperatures in the East).  In contrast the core of positive
anomalies near Hudson Bay would favor moderately below normal
height anomalies over the East (and below normal temperatures over
the southern two-thirds of the region), though with agreement on
some degree of troughing over the West.  Questions include how
quickly the southern Canada upper low begins to depart/shear out
as initial northern Canada ridging weakens and flow tries to
adjust toward some composite of the telecon relationships
(GFS/GEFS runs slowest, 00Z ECMWF fastest but prior run slower),
along with the relative influence of the Pacific/Canadian
features.  For the late week forecast, current uncertainty favors
a multi-guidance/multi-run approach to yield a deterministic
solution that maximizes flexibility depending on how future runs
adjust/cluster.

As for other details, guidance offers some significant differences
in northern tier U.S. upper flow and associated surface evolution
over and near New England by midweek.  Lack of agreement among
fast GFS runs/12Z CMC, slow UKMET runs, and the deep 00Z
ECMWF--and low predictability for specifics of the fast
flow--recommend an intermediate solution for the time being.
Meanwhile there is reasonable agreement with weak shortwave energy
filtering through the East Pacific ridge aloft early-mid week but
with a general consensus for it to produce lighter precipitation
than a number of GFS runs have been showing over parts of the
West.  The late period blend reflects some degree of west-central
U.S. troughing that would expand moisture over the
southern/eastern U.S while keeping the forecast between the GFS
and 00Z ECMWF extremes.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Terrain/upslope snow over the northern Rockies and vicinity should
begin to slowly taper off on Monday as the main shortwave energy
slides eastward to support frontal wave development over the
Northeast mostly on Tuesday with some effects possibly lasting
into Wednesday.  This should lead to a band of potentially
meaningful snow from the Midwest into the Northeast from Monday
into Tuesday.  Over the Midwest/Lower Great Lakes the guidance has
decreased totals somewhat over the past day, while models have
been conflicted over how the Northeast wave will evolve, so
precise effects remain uncertain.  Meanwhile, a stationary front
across southern Florida as of early Monday will lift northward and
likely provide a period of enhanced rainfall from the eastern Gulf
Coast region to the southeastern U.S. coast.  By later next week,
there is an increasing chance for Gulf moisture to return and
expand in coverage across the southern tier states and possibly
the East in an overrunning pattern north of a stationary front
across the northern Gulf.  Depending on details of upper flow
there is also potential for this front/embedded wave(s) to lift
farther northward over the East.  With the cold air in place
farther inland, a swath of wintry weather is possible from
portions of the southern tier into the Northeast later next week
but with lower confidence on the specifics.

The forecast is fairly consistent in showing coldest anomalies of
at least 20-30F below normal early in the week from the
northern-central Plains into the Midwest, with some readings
possibly as low as 30-45F below normal over parts of Montana.
During the rest of the week this core of cold air will remain in
place and steadily push to the south and east.  Temperatures
reaching 20-35F below normal may extend into the southern Plains
and much of the Mississippi Valley by later in the week but
uncertainty in the eastern U.S. pattern lowers confidence in
exactly how cold the East will be at that time.  Most locations
west of the Rockies will see a general cooling trend.  Northern
areas should start out near to moderately below normal and trend a
bit colder, while the Great Basin/Southwest start the weak
moderately above normal and then decline toward normal (or
slightly below in parts of the Great Basin).

...Northern Plains to Midwest Arctic outbreak gradually expanding
to the south and east...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles still advertise a pattern favorable for
extremely cold conditions persisting over the central U.S. through
next week with gradual expansion of the cold air farther
south/east with time.  The West will see more moderate
temperatures but with a general cooling trend.  During the
forecast period the eastern half of the lower 48 should see
multiple precipitation areas of various types, with a general
tendency for the rain-snow line/possible icy mix transition zone
to push farther south by late in the week.

Consensus continues to show a blocky Canada pattern holding a deep
upper low just north of the U.S.-Canada border through at least
midweek and possibly beyond, while mean ridging persists over the
eastern Pacific.  These features will help to maintain cyclonic
mean flow over the continental U.S. next week.  Teleconnection
relationships seem to provide some background on the developing
guidance spread that becomes significant over some areas by late
in the week.  Multi-day mean charts at the D+8 time frame
generally highlight two positive height anomaly centers, one over
the eastern Pacific and another just northeast of Hudson Bay.  The
Pacific center favors positively tilted troughing over the West
and moderately above normal heights over about the southeastern
third of the CONUS (along with near/moderately above normal
temperatures in the East).  In contrast the core of positive
anomalies near Hudson Bay would favor moderately below normal
height anomalies over the East (and below normal temperatures over
the southern two-thirds of the region), though with agreement on
some degree of troughing over the West.  Questions include how
quickly the southern Canada upper low begins to depart/shear out
as initial northern Canada ridging weakens and flow tries to
adjust toward some composite of the telecon relationships
(GFS/GEFS runs slowest, 00Z ECMWF fastest but prior run slower),
along with the relative influence of the Pacific/Canadian
features.  For the late week forecast, current uncertainty favors
a multi-guidance/multi-run approach to yield a deterministic
solution that maximizes flexibility depending on how future runs
adjust/cluster.

As for other details, guidance offers some significant differences
in northern tier U.S. upper flow and associated surface evolution
over and near New England by midweek.  Lack of agreement among
fast GFS runs/12Z CMC, slow UKMET runs, and the deep 00Z

Meanwhile there is reasonable agreement with weak shortwave energy

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 05 2021

SYNOPSIS: Arctic high pressure is forecast to become centered across the Great
Plains and Midwest by mid-February, likely delivering the coldest temperatures
of the winter to these areas. A strong cold front is expected to become
stationary near the Gulf Coast with the potential for surface low development
and an associated winter weather risk from the Southern Appalachians northeast
to New England during mid-February. Temperatures are likely to moderate across
Alaska by week-2 as Arctic air shifts southeastward to the mid-latitudes of
North America.



HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the Great Plains,
Midwest, Mississippi Valley, and Ohio Valley, Sat-Sun, Feb 13-14.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the central and
eastern U.S., Sat-Tue, Feb 13-16.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for nearly all of the central
and
eastern U.S. along with parts of the Pacific Northwest and Great Basin,
Sat-Fri, Feb 13-19.

Slight risk of heavy snow for parts of the Tennessee Valley, Southern
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, Sat-Tue, Feb 13-16.



DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY FEBRUARY 08 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 12:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vEMKQLHuUYn4sD9nK6NhEHZIEksNzNCm56aABua5fYZOxOHzdlAetcL5yesHdTf6AcSXWH0V$

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 13 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 19: Model solutions continue to
depict Arctic high pressure shifting south to the Great Plains and Midwest
next
week. The anomalous cold across the central and eastern U.S. is likely to peak
in strength from February 10 to 15. A high risk of much below normal
temperatures (Feb 13-14) is posted where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
depict minimum temperatures having at least a 60 percent chance of falling
below the 15th percentile of the climatological distribution. Based on these
tools, subzero minimum temperatures remain probable for the Central Great
Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley. Given the model trend and predicted
pattern with surface high pressure nosing southward to northern Mexico, a
freeze could extend as far south as the Lower Rio Grande Valley. On February
13, the reforecast tools indicate that there is a 30 to 50 percent chance of
near record cold across a very large spatial area, covering the Central to
Southern Great Plains and Ohio Valley. Although a moderate risk (40 percent
chance) of much below normal temperatures is designated for parts of the
eastern U.S., forecast confidence is lower of Arctic Air overspreading areas
east of the Appalachians. A large spatial area is designated for a slight risk
of much below normal temperatures through the entirety of week-2 due to
uncertainty regarding the evolution of the longwave pattern by the end of the
outlook period.



A strong cold front is forecast to push well south into the Gulf of Mexico
later next week with the potential for one or two waves of low pressure to
develop along this front and track northeast. If a surface low develops,
anomalously cold temperatures would support snow to the northwest of its
track.
Based on analog tools and the preferred ECMWF ensemble mean which depicts at
least a 20 percent chance of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding 0.5 inch
(liquid equivalent), a slight risk of heavy snow is posted from the Southern
Appalachians northeast to the Mid-Atlantic and New England, Feb 13 to 16. This
snow hazard is consistent with a negatively tilted 500-hPa trough across the
east-central U.S. and subtropical ridging over the southwestern Atlantic. Due
to the predicted shallow Arctic Air becoming established by week-2, there
would
also be an increased risk for an ice storm if any precipitation spreads
northward into the southern Great Plains, Ozarks, and Tennessee Valley.
Freezing rain could also affect the Mid-Atlantic, depending on the depth of
the
Arctic Air.



The slight risk of much below normal temperatures for Alaska is discontinued
as
ensemble means depict a transition to near or above normal temperatures by the
beginning of week-2. This temperature change is consistent with Arctic high
pressure shifting southeast and away from Alaska.

...Multiple rounds of heavy snow on the way for the Cascades and
Northern/Central Rockies & Plains, life-threatening wind chills
enter the Northern Plains tonight...

...Heavy lake effect snow likely through Saturday across the
eastern shores of the Great Lakes...

...Developing coastal low may produce heavy snow from the Central
Appalachians to the Northeast I-95 corridor, showers and
thunderstorms likely in the Southeast...

Waves of low pressure will lead to periods of snow from the
northern Rockies and Plains to the central Plains this weekend.
The first area of low pressure, currently producing
moderate-to-heavy snowfall Montana and the central Rockies, tracks
into the central Plains tonight. Winter Weather Advisories are in
place for much of Nebraska and northeast Kansas through Saturday
morning where 3 to 6 inches of snow are in the forecast.
Meanwhile, a second wave of low pressure ushers in another round
of moderate-to-heavy snow in the northern Rockies and Plains. This
long duration stretch of snowfall has led to the issuance of
Winter Storm Warnings for parts of Montana that last into Sunday
afternoon. By Sunday evening, snowfall will likely be measured in
feet along the highest elevations of the Cascades, Bitterroots,
and northern Rockies. Periods of light snow will likely linger
into Sunday night across the northern Rockies as well. In addition
to the snow, bitterly cold temperatures and dangerous wind chills
will be common in the northern Plains and Upper Midwest this
weekend. High temperatures will struggle to get above zero from
Montana and North Dakota to Minnesota both Saturday and Sunday
with wind chills potentially as low as -50 degrees. This has
resulted in the issuance of Wind Chill Warnings for northern North
Dakota and Minnesota, while bone chilling wind chills are also
expected within counties under Wind Chill Advisories that span
from eastern Montana to northwest Wisconsin.

Over the Great Lakes, brisk and persistent westerly winds and
bitter temperatures support favorable conditions for lake effect
snow in the typical snowbelts. The lake effect snow machine
continues to pump out bands of heavy snowfall when conditions are
ripe due to ice coverage across the Great Lakes being well below
average. Weekend snowfall totals are likely to include several
inches of snow along the western shores of Michigan with as much
as 6 to 12 inches (locally higher amounts possible) downwind of
Lakes Erie and Ontario.

Attention turns to an upper level disturbance that will lead to
the development of low pressure near the Florida Panhandle
Saturday evening. Numerous showers and even some thunderstorms are
possible across the Southeast with the best chance for
thunderstorms occurring across Florida. In fact, a Marginal Risk
for severe weather is in place over central Florida. As low
pressure tracks northeast Saturday night, its shield of
precipitation on its northern flank looks to fall in the form of
snow from the southern Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic. There is
still some uncertainty as to the storm's exact track and location
by Sunday morning, but the latest forecast calls for snow, falling
heavily at times, from the DC/Baltimore metro areas up the I-95
corridor to southern New England. Snowfall totals could range
anywhere from a couple inches to as much as 6 inches in the higher
elevations of the central Appalachians. Winter Storm Watches have
been issued for parts of western North Carolina, southwest
Virginia, and eastern West Virginia. Interests in the Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast will want to monitor the forecast closely this
weekend for additional updates.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 11 - 15 2021

Todays dynamical models are in very good agreement on broad longwave 500-hPa
troughing across the CONUS. Upstream of this trough, ridging is forecast to
expand across the Northeast Pacific. This favors increasing heights along the
West Coast of the CONUS and Alaska. The manual height blend depicts negative
height anomalies for most of the CONUS. The only exceptions are across parts
of
the Southeast, where near normal heights are forecast, and along the West
Coast
where above normal heights are forecast underneath the ridge over the
Northeast
Pacific.

There remains high confidence for a major cold air outbreak across much of the
CONUS, beginning this weekend and persisting throughout the 6-10 day period,
as
the Arctic Oscillation (AO) is forecast to become strongly negative.
Temperature anomalies of negative 20-30 deg F are forecast across parts of the
Northern Plains and Midwest, with subzero temperatures likely across these
areas, and possibly falling below -15 deg F closer to the Canadian border.
Todays forecast depicts 80% or higher probabilities of below normal
temperatures over parts of the Great Plains, Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes,
Tennessee Valley, and Ohio Valley, with some probabilities exceeding 90%,
illustrating high confidence. Even outside of these areas that are forecast to
have the most anomalous cold, probabilities of below normal temperatures are
elevated for most of the CONUS, consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools. The exceptions are over the southern Florida Peninsula where above
normal temperature probabilities are increased, as well as over parts of
central and southern California and southwestern Arizona, where near normal
temperatures are forecast. Both of these areas are favored to have relatively
higher 500-hPa heights than the rest of the CONUS. Despite the positive 500-
hPa
height anomalies forecast over Alaska, strong easterly flow favors increased
near to below normal temperature probabilities across the Mainland and the
Panhandle. A slight tilt toward increased above normal temperature
probabilities is highlighted across the Aleutians and Alaska Peninsula as
upstream troughing over the Central Pacific is forecast to become more
influential, leading to increased southerly mid-level flow over these areas.

Below normal precipitation probabilities are increased over most of the
Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast, in association with the aforementioned
trough axis, and surface high pressure favoring sinking air over these areas.
The greatest frontal convergence is favored to set up across the Mid-Atlantic,
Southeast and along the Gulf of Mexico coast where above normal precipitation
probabilities are increased. The mid-level ridging forecast to expand across
the Northeast Pacific favors increased probabilities of below normal
precipitation over parts of the western CONUS. A slight tilt toward above
normal precipitation chances is depicted across portions of the Rockies and
High Plains, mainly due to typically little precipitation this time of year,
combined with the potential for intermittent disturbances to track along the
periphery of the expanding ridge axis to the west. Across Alaska, most
forecast
tools have flipped to a wetter solution across the state compared to yesterday
as a result of the Central Pacific troughing and associated surface low
pressure shifting closer to the state toward the end of the period. As a
result, near to above normal precipitation chances are favored for the
Mainland
and the Aleutians, with below normal precipitation probabilities remaining
increased across the Panhandle due to prolonged influence of the ridge.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GFS

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to excellent tool agreement, and high confidence regarding below normal
temperatures across nearly the entire CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 13 - 19 2021

A continuation of the same synoptic pattern is forecast during week-2 across
North America. Troughing is favored over the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS,
with ridging becoming established over the East Pacific, and extending more
into the western CONUS compared to the 6-10 day period. Todays manual 500-hPa
height blend for week-2 depicts below normal heights east of the Rockies, and
above normal heights to the west of the Rockies, as well as for Alaska.

Predicted large scale troughing leads to enhanced probabilities of below
normal
temperatures for much of the CONUS, with the highest chances across parts of
the east-central CONUS. The magnitude of the negative temperature anomalies is
forecast to decrease, compared to the 6-10 day period, as the cold air mass
continues to moderate across the region, and the magnitude of the negative AO
is forecast to decrease. However, it remains uncertain if the AO will remain
negative or switch back to a positive phase toward late-February. A more
negative AO favors a continuation of colder weather across the CONUS. Near to
above normal temperatures are favored across southwestern portions of the
CONUS
as a result of increased ridging and positive height anomalies forecast across
the region. A trend toward warmer temperatures is forecast for Alaska as
troughing moves over the Aleutians allowing a more southerly component to the
mid-flow across the state. Increased probabilities for above normal
temperatures are favored across the southern Mainland and the Aleutians, with
near normal temperatures forecast across the Panhandle and most of the central
and northern Mainland. A small area of increased below normal temperature
probabilities remains favored over the west-central Mainland.

Probabilities of above normal precipitation remain slightly increased on the
east side of the mean longwave trough axis over the CONUS, specifically over
parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, consistent with the continued
potential for enhanced frontal activity across the region. There is some
uncertainty in regards to the westward extent of the increased above normal
precipitation probabilities, with the uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble being
farther
west compared to the GEFS. A blend between the two solutions is used in todays
forecast. Below normal precipitation probabilities are increased over much of
the southwestern CONUS due to increased ridging. These elevated below normal
precipitation chances also extend through parts of the Central and Southern
Plains, Middle Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and the Northeast as a result
of the influence of surface high pressure. Increased above normal
precipitation
probabilities are depicted across the Northern Rockies and Plains, consistent
with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools and a continued potential for
disturbances to track overtop the ridge axis to the west, as noted in the 6-10
day outlook discussion. Below normal precipitation is likely for northern
Alaska underneath forecast above normal heights, with a slight tilt toward
increased above normal precipitation probabilities across the Aleutians,
southern Mainland, and the Panhandle due to increasing southerly mid-level
flow
as the ridge axis shifts to the east.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement on a continued amplified pattern, offset by increasing uncertainty
in
regards to the precipitation forecast over the eastern CONUS, as well as the
surface pattern evolution across Alaska.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

...Multiple rounds of heavy snow on the way for the Cascades and
Northern/Central Rockies & Plains, life-threatening wind chills
enter the Northern Plains tonight...

...Heavy lake effect snow likely through Saturday across the
eastern shores of the Great Lakes...

...Developing coastal low may produce heavy snow from the Central
Appalachians to the Northeast I-95 corridor, showers and
thunderstorms likely in the Southeast...

Waves of low pressure will lead to periods of snow from the
northern Rockies and Plains to the central Plains this weekend.
The first area of low pressure, currently producing
moderate-to-heavy snowfall Montana and the central Rockies, tracks
into the central Plains tonight. Winter Weather Advisories are in
place for much of Nebraska and northeast Kansas through Saturday
morning where 3 to 6 inches of snow are in the forecast.
Meanwhile, a second wave of low pressure ushers in another round
of moderate-to-heavy snow in the northern Rockies and Plains. This
long duration stretch of snowfall has led to the issuance of
Winter Storm Warnings for parts of Montana that last into Sunday
afternoon. By Sunday evening, snowfall will likely be measured in
feet along the highest elevations of the Cascades, Bitterroots,
and northern Rockies. Periods of light snow will likely linger
into Sunday night across the northern Rockies as well. In addition
to the snow, bitterly cold temperatures and dangerous wind chills
will be common in the northern Plains and Upper Midwest this
weekend. High temperatures will struggle to get above zero from
Montana and North Dakota to Minnesota both Saturday and Sunday
with wind chills potentially as low as -50 degrees. This has
resulted in the issuance of Wind Chill Warnings for northern North
Dakota and Minnesota, while bone-chilling wind chills are also
expected within counties under Wind Chill Advisories that span
from eastern Montana to northwest Wisconsin.

Over the Great Lakes, brisk and persistent westerly winds and
bitter temperatures support favorable conditions for lake effect
snow in the typical snowbelts. The lake effect snow machine
continues to pump out bands of heavy snowfall when conditions are
ripe due to ice coverage across the Great Lakes being well below
average. Weekend snowfall totals are likely to include several
inches of snow along the western shores of Michigan with as much
as 6 to 12 inches (locally higher amounts possible) downwind of
Lakes Erie and Ontario.

Attention turns to an upper level disturbance that will lead to
the development of low pressure near the Florida Panhandle
Saturday evening. Numerous showers and even some thunderstorms are
possible across the Southeast with the best chance for
thunderstorms occurring across Florida. In fact, a Marginal Risk
for severe weather is in place over central Florida. As low
pressure tracks northeast Saturday night, its shield of
precipitation on its northern flank looks to fall in the form of
snow from the southern Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic. There is
still some uncertainty as to the storm's exact track and location
by Sunday morning, but the latest forecast calls for snow, falling
heavily at times, from the DC/Baltimore metro areas up the I-95
corridor to southern New England. Snowfall totals could range
anywhere from a couple inches to as much as 6 inches in the higher
elevations of the central Appalachians. Winter Storm Watches have
been issued from western North Carolina and southwest Virginia to
the major cities of Washington D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia.
Interests in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will want to monitor
the forecast closely this weekend for additional updates.

...Northern Plains to Midwest Arctic outbreak gradually expanding
to the south and east...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles still advertise a pattern favorable for
extremely cold conditions persisting over the central U.S. through
next week with gradual expansion of the cold air farther
south/east with time.  The West will see more moderate
temperatures but with a general cooling trend.  During the
forecast period the eastern half of the lower 48 should see
multiple precipitation areas of various types, with a general
tendency for the rain-snow line/possible icy mix transition zone
to push farther south by late in the week.

Consensus continues to show a blocky Canada pattern holding a deep
upper low just north of the U.S.-Canada border through at least
midweek and possibly beyond, while mean ridging persists over the
eastern Pacific.  These features will help to maintain cyclonic
mean flow over the continental U.S. next week.  Teleconnection
relationships seem to provide some background on the developing
guidance spread that becomes significant over some areas by late
in the week.  Multi-day mean charts at the D+8 time frame
generally highlight two positive height anomaly centers, one over
the eastern Pacific and another just northeast of Hudson Bay.  The
Pacific center favors positively tilted troughing over the West
and moderately above normal heights over about the southeastern
third of the CONUS (along with near/moderately above normal
temperatures in the East).  In contrast the core of positive
anomalies near Hudson Bay would favor moderately below normal
height anomalies over the East (and below normal temperatures over
the southern two-thirds of the region), though with agreement on
some degree of troughing over the West.  Questions include how
quickly the southern Canada upper low begins to depart/shear out
as initial northern Canada ridging weakens and flow tries to
adjust toward some composite of the telecon relationships
(GFS/GEFS runs slowest, 00Z ECMWF fastest but prior run slower),
along with the relative influence of the Pacific/Canadian
features.  For the late week forecast, current uncertainty favors
a multi-guidance/multi-run approach to yield a deterministic
solution that maximizes flexibility depending on how future runs
adjust/cluster.

As for other details, guidance offers some significant differences
in northern tier U.S. upper flow and associated surface evolution
over and near New England by midweek.  Lack of agreement among
fast GFS runs/12Z CMC, slow UKMET runs, and the deep 00Z
ECMWF--and low predictability for specifics of the fast
flow--recommend an intermediate solution for the time being.
Meanwhile there is reasonable agreement with weak shortwave energy
filtering through the East Pacific ridge aloft early-mid week but
with a general consensus for it to produce lighter precipitation
than a number of GFS runs have been showing over parts of the
West.  The late period blend reflects some degree of west-central
U.S. troughing that would expand moisture over the
southern/eastern U.S while keeping the forecast between the GFS
and 00Z ECMWF extremes.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Terrain/upslope snow over the northern Rockies and vicinity should
begin to slowly taper off on Monday as the main shortwave energy
slides eastward to support frontal wave development over the
Northeast mostly on Tuesday with some effects possibly lasting
into Wednesday.  This should lead to a band of potentially
meaningful snow from the Midwest into the Northeast from Monday
into Tuesday.  Over the Midwest/Lower Great Lakes the guidance has
decreased totals somewhat over the past day, while models have
been conflicted over how the Northeast wave will evolve, so
precise effects remain uncertain.  Meanwhile, a stationary front
across southern Florida as of early Monday will lift northward and
likely provide a period of enhanced rainfall from the eastern Gulf
Coast region to the southeastern U.S. coast.  By later next week,
there is an increasing chance for Gulf moisture to return and
expand in coverage across the southern tier states and possibly
the East in an overrunning pattern north of a stationary front
across the northern Gulf.  Depending on details of upper flow
there is also potential for this front/embedded wave(s) to lift
farther northward over the East.  With the cold air in place
farther inland, a swath of wintry weather is possible from
portions of the southern tier into the Northeast later next week
but with lower confidence on the specifics.

The forecast is fairly consistent in showing coldest anomalies of
at least 20-30F below normal early in the week from the
northern-central Plains into the Midwest, with some readings
possibly as low as 30-45F below normal over parts of Montana.
During the rest of the week this core of cold air will remain in
place and steadily push to the south and east.  Temperatures
reaching 20-35F below normal may extend into the southern Plains
and much of the Mississippi Valley by later in the week but
uncertainty in the eastern U.S. pattern lowers confidence in
exactly how cold the East will be at that time.  Most locations
west of the Rockies will see a general cooling trend.  Northern
areas should start out near to moderately below normal and trend a

...Northern Plains to Midwest Arctic outbreak gradually expanding
to the south and east...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles still advertise a pattern favorable for
extremely cold conditions persisting over the central U.S. through
next week with gradual expansion of the cold air farther
south/east with time.  The West will see more moderate
temperatures but with a general cooling trend.  During the
forecast period the eastern half of the lower 48 should see
multiple precipitation areas of various types, with a general
tendency for the rain-snow line/possible icy mix transition zone
to push farther south by late in the week.

Consensus continues to show a blocky Canada pattern holding a deep
upper low just north of the U.S.-Canada border through at least
midweek and possibly beyond, while mean ridging persists over the
eastern Pacific.  These features will help to maintain cyclonic
mean flow over the continental U.S. next week.  Teleconnection
relationships seem to provide some background on the developing
guidance spread that becomes significant over some areas by late
in the week.  Multi-day mean charts at the D+8 time frame
generally highlight two positive height anomaly centers, one over
the eastern Pacific and another just northeast of Hudson Bay.  The
Pacific center favors positively tilted troughing over the West
and moderately above normal heights over about the southeastern
third of the CONUS (along with near/moderately above normal
temperatures in the East).  In contrast the core of positive
anomalies near Hudson Bay would favor moderately below normal
height anomalies over the East (and below normal temperatures over
the southern two-thirds of the region), though with agreement on
some degree of troughing over the West.  Questions include how
quickly the southern Canada upper low begins to depart/shear out
as initial northern Canada ridging weakens and flow tries to
adjust toward some composite of the telecon relationships
(GFS/GEFS runs slowest, 00Z ECMWF fastest but prior run slower),
along with the relative influence of the Pacific/Canadian
features.  For the late week forecast, current uncertainty favors
a multi-guidance/multi-run approach to yield a deterministic
solution that maximizes flexibility depending on how future runs
adjust/cluster.

As for other details, guidance offers some significant differences
in northern tier U.S. upper flow and associated surface evolution
over and near New England by midweek.  Lack of agreement among
fast GFS runs/12Z CMC, slow UKMET runs, and the deep 00Z
ECMWF--and low predictability for specifics of the fast
flow--recommend an intermediate solution for the time being.
Meanwhile there is reasonable agreement with weak shortwave energy
filtering through the East Pacific ridge aloft early-mid week but
with a general consensus for it to produce lighter precipitation
than a number of GFS runs have been showing over parts of the
West.  The late period blend reflects some degree of west-central
U.S. troughing that would expand moisture over the
southern/eastern U.S while keeping the forecast between the GFS
and 00Z ECMWF extremes.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Terrain/upslope snow over the northern Rockies and vicinity should
begin to slowly taper off on Monday as the main shortwave energy
slides eastward to support frontal wave development over the
Northeast mostly on Tuesday with some effects possibly lasting
into Wednesday.  This should lead to a band of potentially
meaningful snow from the Midwest into the Northeast from Monday
into Tuesday.  Over the Midwest/Lower Great Lakes the guidance has
decreased totals somewhat over the past day, while models have
been conflicted over how the Northeast wave will evolve, so
precise effects remain uncertain.  Meanwhile, a stationary front
across southern Florida as of early Monday will lift northward and
likely provide a period of enhanced rainfall from the eastern Gulf
Coast region to the southeastern U.S. coast.  By later next week,
there is an increasing chance for Gulf moisture to return and
expand in coverage across the southern tier states and possibly
the East in an overrunning pattern north of a stationary front
across the northern Gulf.  Depending on details of upper flow
there is also potential for this front/embedded wave(s) to lift
farther northward over the East.  With the cold air in place
farther inland, a swath of wintry weather is possible from
portions of the southern tier into the Northeast later next week
but with lower confidence on the specifics.

The forecast is fairly consistent in showing coldest anomalies of
at least 20-30F below normal early in the week from the
northern-central Plains into the Midwest, with some readings
possibly as low as 30-45F below normal over parts of Montana.
During the rest of the week this core of cold air will remain in
place and steadily push to the south and east.  Temperatures
reaching 20-35F below normal may extend into the southern Plains
and much of the Mississippi Valley by later in the week but
uncertainty in the eastern U.S. pattern lowers confidence in
exactly how cold the East will be at that time.  Most locations
west of the Rockies will see a general cooling trend.  Northern
areas should start out near to moderately below normal and trend a
bit colder, while the Great Basin/Southwest start the weak
moderately above normal and then decline toward normal (or
slightly below in parts of the Great Basin).

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1248 AM CST Sat Feb 06 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
A broad upper-level trough anchored over the central U.S. will
remain quasi-stationary throughout the day. Enhanced mid-level flow
along the southern periphery of the trough will gradually shift
northeastward across the Southern Plains. At the surface, a cold
front will quickly sweep through much of the Southern Plains
throughout the day. Behind the front, surface winds will increase
during the afternoon as diurnal heating and vertical mixing
processes allow the aforementioned mid-level flow to mix toward the
surface. This will result in sustained winds of 20-25 mph, gusting
to 35 mph for a few hours during the afternoon. Meanwhile, RH values
should fall into the low 20s and upper teens across much of the
Southern Plains, with lower RH values expected with westward extent.
Despite marginally receptive fuels across the region, the wind/RH
combo expected should yield an elevated fire-weather risk. An
elevated area has been included for portions of northwest Texas,
where agreement in the wind/RH overlap is highest among the latest
short-term model guidance.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1252 AM CST Sat Feb 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough positioned over the central U.S. is forecast
to remain quasi-stationary through Sunday. Although guidance
suggests most of the enhanced mid-level flow should continue
shifting northward into the central Rockies/Plains, the trough
should pivot about the upper-low, allowing for more zonal flow
trajectories along the far southern extent of the trough to
overspread much of the southern High Plains.

Diurnally driven momentum transfer should result breezy surface
winds of 15-20 mph, with locally higher gusts, along the lee side of
high terrain from central/southern New Mexico into portions of far
West Texas. A dry post-frontal airmass remains in place, and added
drying from down-slope winds will yield RH values into the teens and
perhaps single digits. Despite these conditions, fuels across the
region remain marginally receptive to large-fire spread. Thus, an
elevated fire-weather risk has been introduced for the
aforementioned areas of central/southern New Mexico into portions of
far West Texas for Sunday afternoon.

...Northern Plains to Midwest Arctic outbreak followed by possible
northeast U.S. winter storm later next week...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles still advertise a pattern favorable for
extremely cold conditions persisting over the central U.S. through
next week.  However, there has been a general model trend for the
arctic air mass to slow its expansion farther into the Deep South
and the Southeast.  Meanwhile, models have shown further
adjustments in the way they handle the blocky synoptic pattern
across Canada.  The ECMWF has now trended toward the GFS by
further retrograding the polar vortex westward into the Canadian
prairies.  These synoptic adjustments would tend to encourage
further intrusion of Gulf moisture into the Deep South which would
then be carried up the East Coast later next week along with a
higher chance for cyclogenesis.  The GFS has led the trend for
more robust cyclogenesis over the Northeast later next week.  On
the other hand, the ECMWF tends to retain the cold air mass in
place but the latest run (00Z) appears to agree better with the
GFS in terms of the potential for late-week East Coast
cyclogenesis.

Elsewhere, the adjusted synoptic evolution also helps to develop a
swath of mostly light snow to traverse the north-central U.S.
during the latter part of next week in response to upper-level
impulses exiting the central Rockies under the retrograding polar
vortex in the Canadian prairies.  Meanwhile, upslope snows will
likely linger over the Colorado Rockies in the vicinity of the
arctic front.  The West will see more moderate temperatures but
with a general cooling trend as the arctic air filters in from the
north.  Models have shown a slowing trend of the arctic front
moving across the West.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 18Z GFS/GEFS, together with a
smaller contribution from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean.  Less of the
GFS/GEFS was used on Days 6 and 7 when the 12Z NAEFS was used
instead of the CMC mean.  More of the ensemble means were used on
Days 6 and 7 as well given the increasing model uncertainties.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A band of meaningful snow is expected from the Midwest into the
Northeast from Monday into Tuesday associated with a developing
frontal wave, although details remain somewhat elusive.
Meanwhile, a stationary front across southern Florida will lift
northward and likely provide a period of enhanced rainfall from
the eastern Gulf Coast region to the southeastern U.S. coast.  By
later next week, there is an increasing chance for Gulf moisture
to return and expand in coverage across the southern tier states
and possibly the East in an overrunning pattern north of a
stationary front across the northern Gulf.  Depending on details
of upper flow there is also potential for this front/embedded
wave(s) to lift farther northward over the East.  With the cold
air in place farther inland, a swath of wintry weather is possible
from portions of the southern tier into the Northeast later next
week but with lower confidence on the specifics.

The forecast is fairly consistent in showing coldest anomalies of
at least 20-30F below normal early in the week from the
northern-central Plains into the Midwest, with some readings
possibly as low as 30-45F below normal over parts of Montana.
During the rest of the week this core of cold air will remain in
place and steadily push to the south and east.  Temperatures
reaching 20-35F below normal may extend into the southern Plains
and much of the Mississippi Valley by later in the week but
uncertainty in the eastern U.S. pattern lowers confidence in
exactly how cold the East will be at that time.  Most locations
west of the Rockies will see a general cooling trend.  Northern
areas should start out near to moderately below normal and trend a
bit colder, while the Great Basin/Southwest start the weak
moderately above normal and then decline toward normal (or
slightly below in parts of the Great Basin).

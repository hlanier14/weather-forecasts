Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1134 AM CDT Thu Jun 03 2021

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
to the dry thunder area for the latest guidance. Locally elevated
fire weather conditions may develop today in the lee of the Cascades
as dry westerly flow begins to overspread the Northwest. Low
confidence on the forecast coverage of dry and windy conditions will
preclude the addition of an elevated area. See the previous forecast
discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 06/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0126 AM CDT Thu Jun 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughs will be traversing the West and East Coasts while
a mid-level ridge propagates across the Interior West into the
Plains states today. Deep-layer ascent and adequate low-level
moisture/buoyancy ahead of the Pacific Northwest mid-level trough
will foster thunderstorm potential, with some wildfire spread threat
apparent. Locally dry and breezy surface conditions may promote
brief Elevated conditions across terrain-favoring areas of the lower
Colorado River Valley, westward to central California. Otherwise,
low-level moist conditions or weak surface winds are expected across
much of the CONUS east of the Rockies, precluding significant
wildfire concerns.

...Parts of the Pacific Northwest/northwestern Great Basin...
At least isolated thunderstorm development is expected across the
higher terrain of the Sierra, northward to the lee of the southern
Cascades by mid afternoon. Though storm motions are expected to be
slow, 0.50-0.75 inch precipitable water values and the presence of a
surface-500 mb sub-cloud layer suggests that several of the storms
may produce dry strikes with some ignition efficiency, especially
given unseasonably dry fuels. A couple of strong, erratic wind gusts
may also accompany the outflow of the stronger storms. Please see
the Day 1 Convective Outlook for more details on severe potential.
Preceding storm development, locally dry and breezy westerly flow
may also be observed to the lee of the Cascades and Sierra. An
Elevated area may need to be added in the Day 1 outlook update
pending stronger winds in future guidance or observations.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 03 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure is favored to bring anomalously
warm
temperatures and possible excessive heat over the northern tier of the
contiguous U.S throughout week-2. Potentially heavy rainfall forecast over =
the
Southern Plains is likely to aggravate flooding conditions over portions of
Texas and Louisiana. An increasing chance of tropical cyclone formation in =
the
western Caribbean during mid-June may bring heavy rainfall to parts of Flor=
ida
and the Gulf Coast late in the period. Over Alaska, mid-level high pressure
forecast over the Bering Sea favors drier than normal conditions over parts=
 of
the Mainland.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern and Central Plai=
ns,
Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and the Ohio Valley, Fri,
Jun
11.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Rockies, Northern and
Central
Plains, and the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Mon-Thu, Jun 14-17.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of Florida and the eastern
Gulf
coast, Wed-Thu, Jun 16-17.

Flooding possible for parts of southern and eastern Texas and the Lower
Mississippi Valley.

the Great Lakes. At the peak of this mid-level ridging, some of the hottest
temperatures of the year to date are likely over portions of the northern
CONUS, with maximum temperatures approaching 100 degrees across the Norther=
n
Plains, and in the low to mid 90's over the Northeast prior to the start of
the
outlook period. By the start of week-2, there is continued agreement in the
GEFS and ECMWF ensembles which favor a weakening of mid-level positive heig=
ht
departures to allow for a moderation of temperatures, however, there are
indications of this anomalous ridging retrograding westward over the CONUS =
and
restrengthening by the middle of period. Compared to the 0z GEFS, this
evolution is more pronounced in the 0z ECMWF ensemble mean, depicting a lar=
ge
coverage of positive height departures over the north-central CONUS and 582=
-
dam
heights centered over the Northern Plains that encroaches the Canadian bord=
er
by day 11 (Jun 14). As a result, much of the north-central CONUS may
experience
a reprieve to the anomalously warm temperatures before potential excessive
heat
concerns return by the middle of week-2.



At the start of period, both the GEFS and the ECMWF reforecast tools contin=
ue
to indicate a broad region with at least 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile, and 90 degrees F from the Northern Plains to
the
Ohio Valley, and a slight risk of excessive heat is maintained for the regi=
on
for Jun 11. Relative to yesterday's outlook, the slight risk coverage over =
the
Northeast is removed due to reduced support from the reforecast tools as mo=
re
mid-level troughing is favored in the latest ensembles over eastern Maritim=
e
Canada.  As cooler conditions are anticipated over the eastern CONUS on day=
s 9
and 10, anomalously warm temperatures are favored to return further west ti=
ed
to the aforementioned retrograding mid-level ridge. This is reflected in th=
e
ECMWF reforecast tool with increasing probabilities reaching as high as 40%
for
maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile focused over the Central
and
Northern High Plains and portions of the Rockies by the middle of the perio=
d.
Here, there is also at least a 20% chance maximum temperatures reach 95
degrees
and a slight risk for excessive heat is added to the outlook from Jun 14 to
Jun
17. With below-normal precipitation predominately favored over the region
through mid-June, the anomalously warm conditions forecast over the
north-central CONUS are likely to worsen moderate (D1) to extreme (D3) drou=
ght
conditions being felt over the Northern Plains and portions of the Upper
Mississippi Valley.



Across the southwestern CONUS, there is good agreement in the reforecast to=
ols
depicting increased signals for 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the
85th
percentile across the Desert Southwest and Southern High Plains by the midd=
le
of the period. While these rains are not expected to be heavy, the increase=
d
rainfall and ground moisture is likely to benefit extremely dry soils obser=
ved
throughout much of the region. Farther east, however, there are persisting
signals in the ECMWF reforecast tool for potentially heavy precipitation ov=
er
the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley during the middle of the
period. While the GEFS is less supportive of this potential to preclude a
corresponding hazard, any additional rainfall is likely to exacerbate the
saturated conditions being felt across the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley. Many areas along the Gulf coast of Texas have experienc=
ed
more than twice their normal rainfall accumulation since early May, and wit=
h
enhanced precipitation forecast by the Weather Prediction Center (another 2=
 to
5 inches of rainfall over the region during week-1), a flooding possible
hazard
remains issued over southern and eastern Texas and into Louisiana as the
observed minor to moderate river flooding may persist into week-2.



Across the tropics, the large-scale environment remains favorable for tropi=
cal
cyclogenesis in the Atlantic with eastward propagating wave features predic=
ted
to traverse the Americas. Ensemble guidance and probabilistic tools continu=
e
to
support tropical cyclogenesis near Cuba, with an area of mean low pressure
that
is favored to deepen by the middle portion of the period. Compared to
yesterday, there are more ensemble member low centers in the 0z and 6z GEFS
that track northward with increased precipitation amounts favored across th=
e
Gulf of Mexico and into Florida later in the period. Given this trend in th=
e
GEFS, as well as support from the ECMWF ensemble and reforecast tool for
precipitation amounts exceeding an inch, a slight risk for heavy precipitat=
ion
is added to the outlook for Florida and portions of the eastern Gulf Coast.
This potential system will continue to be monitored and addressed in upcomi=
ng
hazard outlooks.



Over Alaska, anomalous mid-level ridging favored by both the GEFS and ECMWF=
 is
anticipated to bring below-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatur=
es
over parts of the Mainland during week-2. A continuation of these warm and
drier than normal conditions are likely to be unfavorable for ongoing wildf=
ire
activity into mid-June.

...Record Heat Threat from the Northern Plains to the Northeast....

...Multi-Day Heavy Rainfall Event For the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance highlights the amplification and persistence of a West
Coast mean upper trough throughout the period which will promote
mean ridging over most of the East. This will spread much above
normal temperatures from the Great Basin/Northern Plains to the
Great Lakes and Northeast next week. In between, expect a
slow-moving upper low/trough to generate unsettled weather and
potentially heavy rainfall over parts of the already over
saturated Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley. Shortwave
energy passing over the East Coast this weekend may form a modest
upper low embedded within the ridge off the Mid-Atlantic coast,
but with low confidence for maritime details.

Model solutions remain well clustered days 3-5 (Sun-Tue), with the
00 UTC GFS/ECMWF seemingly best supported by the latest GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means in a pattern with above normal predictability. The
WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from the 00
UTC GFS/ECMWF along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models and
WPC continuity in this time frame. The 00 UTC GFS/ECMWF maintain
amplified West Coast upper troughing into Days 6/7 (Wed/next Thu)
more in line with ensemble means and pattern continuity while the
06/12 UTC GFS runs become less amplified as more energy works
inland. The 12 UTC ECMWF remains on the amplified side of the
forecast envelope and the 12 UTC Canadian has trended more
amplified than the 00 UTC run, bolstering confidence. Considering
increasing forecast spread and lingering uncertainty, WPC guidance
was mainly derived from the ensemble means in this longer time
period.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A multi-day heavy rainfall event is likely across portions of
Texas, Louisiana, and into the ArkLaTex region with a persistent
deep-layer flow of Gulf moisture interacting with the Southern
Plains upper level trough/low and a western Gulf Coast surface
front. Models continue to suggest the potential for several inches
or more of rain within a region which has seen well above normal
precipitation over recent weeks, leading to flooding concerns. As
the trough opens up and elongates, rainfall should become lighter
with time with moisture also extending northward over the
east-central U.S. toward the middle of next week. Elsewhere, the
Northeast should remain fairly dry with diurnally-favored showers
lingering over parts of the Southeast and flow around Bermuda high
pressure may eventually extend some moisture northward through the
Appalachians. Out West, increasing moisture over the Pacific
Northwest is expected this weekend, with ejecting
shortwaves/frontal systems extending some activity into the
northern Rockies and eventually the northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley.

Extreme temperature anomalies are likely from parts of the Great
Basin/northern Plains to the Upper Great Lakes and Northeast.
Highs and/or morning lows may reach up to 15-20+F above normal.
Especially across parts of the Northeast next week, these values
may exceed daily records for highs and warm lows. Meanwhile
Texas/Louisiana and vicinity are likely to see slightly below
normal highs early next week due to persistent clouds and
rainfall. West Coast highs will refresh to moderately below normal
as amplified upper troughing becomes established over the region.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 PM CDT Thu Jun 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Pacific Northwest and northwest Nevada...
With the main shortwave trough moving overhead early in the forecast
period, strong mid-level flow of 50-70 kts will overspread the
Cascades and portions of the northern Great Basin. Moderate west to
east surface pressure gradients behind the cold front will drive
westerly low-level flow over the higher terrain and down into
portions of lower Washington, Oregon, Nevada, and Idaho. Orographic
drying should support widespread humidity values of 10-20% near peak
heating. Drying in combination with surface winds of 10-20 mph
should be sufficient for widespread elevated and locally critical
fire weather conditions through the afternoon. The previous elevated
area was expanded into portions of northern Nevada to better account
for the threat of warm, dry, and breezy conditions.

Elsewhere, the rest of the forecast remains on track with only minor
changes.

..Lyons.. 06/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0218 AM CDT Thu Jun 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will gradually build across much of the central U.S.
as a mid-level trough traverses the northwest CONUS tomorrow.
Surface lee troughing across the northern CONUS associated with the
passing upper-level impulse will support dry and breezy conditions
ahead of a cold front across portions of North Dakota, while
downslope flow along the lee of the Cascades will also promote
wildfire-spread potential. Deep-layer ascent ahead of the upper
trough will foster thunderstorm development atop a dry boundary
layer from the northern Rockies into the central Great Basin, with
some dry strikes likely.

...Pacific Northwest...
15-25 mph sustained westerly surface flow amidst 15-20% RH is likely
during the afternoon hours tomorrow to the lee of the Cascades due
to both downslope flow and boundary-layer mixing. Elevated
highlights have been introduced given the presence of unseasonably
dry, receptive fuels. Some of the latest guidance also depicts
locally Critical conditions across portions of the Columbia and
Harney Basin areas. Critical highlights may be needed in future
outlooks if 20+ mph sustained westerly winds appear more widespread
and longer lasting than currently expected.

...Northern North Dakota...
Ahead of a southward-sagging cold front, southwesterly flow ahead of
the surface lee trough is expected to sustain at/above 15 mph for at
least a few hours prior to frontal passage. Guidance consensus has
been trending drier across portions of northern North Dakota, with
RH dropping to 20-25% by afternoon peak heating, warranting the
introduction of Elevated highlights.

...Northern Rockies into the Great Basin...
Deep-layer lift ahead of the upper trough will promote isolated to
widely scattered thunderstorm development during the afternoon to
early evening hours. Storms are expected to be slow moving, but will
be developing atop a deep, dry boundary layer amidst 0.5-0.8 inch
precipitable water values, with dry strikes likely in spots. As
such, highlights for isolated dry thunderstorms were added across
parts of the northern Rockies and parts of the Great Basin, where
dry strikes are most likely and where fuels are most receptive to
fire spread.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu June 03 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 09 - 13 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast mean ridging over =
the
North Pacific, centered south of the Aleutians. Downstream, a deep mean tro=
ugh
is predicted over the Gulf of Alaska, extending over parts of the Pacific
Northwest coast. Across the CONUS, mean ridging is forecast.

Ridging forecast over the Aleutians increases the likelihood of above norma=
l
temperatures for the Aleutians and southwest Mainland Alaska. The trough
predicted over the eastern Pacific favors near to below normal temperatures
along the Western CONUS coast. Probabilities of near to above normal
temperatures are enhanced for most of the rest of the CONUS under above nor=
mal
500-hPa heights, except over much of Texas and western Louisiana due to
forecast persistent storm system activity and cloudiness.

Anomalous ridging enhances the likelihood of below normal precipitation for
much of Alaska. Ahead of the trough forecast off the west coast of the CONU=
S,
probabilities of above normal precipitation are slightly elevated along par=
ts
of the Pacific Northwest coast. A predicted mean ridge centered over the
Plains
favors increased probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of th=
e
West and parts of the central CONUS. Increased probabilities of near to abo=
ve
normal precipitation are indicated over parts of the Southern Plains,
Mississippi Valley, and Mid-Atlantic region related to potential storm syst=
ems
associated with shortwave troughs and anomalous southerly surface flow. Bel=
ow
normal precipitation is favored slightly over New England and the Florida
Peninsula, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 60% of Today's
operational 0z GFS centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemb=
le
Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offse=
t
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 11 - 17 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is generally forecast to
persist, but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, while ensemble spre=
ad
and uncertainty increases.

The temperature pattern forecast over the CONUS for the week-2 period is ve=
ry
similar to the 6-10 day outlook period, except that above normal temperatur=
es
are favored along the West Coast, consistent with the forecast consolidatio=
n
tool. The precipitation forecast is also similar to week-2, with a few
differences. The Eastern Pacific  trough is expected to weaken during the
week-2 period, leading to near normal precipitation along the West Coast
during
week-2. Chances of above normal precipitation are enhanced over parts of th=
e
Southern Rockies, Southern Plains and much of the southeastern CONUS, relat=
ed
to potential storm systems associated with shortwave troughs and anomalous
southerly surface flow. The probabilities of above normal precipitation in =
the
East are restricted to the Southeast as one or more storm systems move
offshore. Due to the potential for tropical activity during parts of week-2=
,
probabilities of above normal precipitation are elevated for the Florida
Peninsula.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Yesterday's
operational 12z GFS centered on Day 10, and 60% of Today's 0z European
Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecas=
t
tools.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Record heat spreading from the western U.S. into the northern
Plains and upper Midwest...

...Severe weather and scattered flash flooding possible into this
evening across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...

...Thunderstorms and heavy rain expected to shift from southern
Texas toward the Louisiana coast during the next couple of days...

A strong upper-level ridge of high pressure over the interior
western U.S. responsible for the record-breaking heat from the
Great Basin to the Intermountain West today will gradually give
way to an upper-level trough moving into the Pacific Northwest.
The record heat will then shift northeastward into the northern
Plains towards the upper Midwest on Friday behind a warm front,
where widespread high temperatures in the upper-90s to near the
century mark are in the forecast.  Temperatures this hot can
increase the potential for heat-related illnesses.  As such, Heat
Advisories are in effect from eastern Washington to portions of
Montana.  Parts of the Great Basin into California and the Desert
Southwest are under Excessive Heat Warnings.  Much of this region
is also in the middle of extreme or exceptional drought
conditions, which will also promote the danger of wildfires in
portions of these areas.  A cold front entering the Pacific
Northwest today will filter in much cooler temperatures during the
next couple of days for sections of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.
 This frontal boundary could also trigger scattered thunderstorms
from the northern Rockies to the northern High Plains on Friday.

For the eastern and south-central United States, an increasingly
warm and humid airmass will promote scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Northeast to the western Gulf Coast. High
pressure located in the western Atlantic will continue to bring
southerly winds and ample moisture up the eastern third of the
country, with a weak cold front located across the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys to help spark thunderstorm activity.  A few
severe thunderstorms are possible into this evening across the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with damaging wind gusts and isolated
tornadoes possible.  In addition, WPC has highlighted the
Mid-Atlantic for a slight potential for flash flooding due to
scattered heavy rain.

Further south, linger precipitation will also be found across
portions of Louisiana and southern Texas. This section of the
country has experienced a plethora of rainfall over the last
month, which has made ground conditions susceptible for flash
flooding. Due to this concern and the potential for an additional
1 to 3 inches of rain today across South Texas, WPC has issued
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for the region.  Rain chances
will continue into the early part of the weekend as well, thanks
to a slow-moving upper level low located over the Lone Star State,
with a tendency to shift the heavy rain toward the Louisiana coast
by Saturday.

...Record Heat Threat from the Northern Plains to the Northeast....

...Multi-Day Heavy Rainfall Event For the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance highlights the amplification and persistence of a West
Coast mean upper trough throughout the period which will promote
mean ridging over most of the East. This will spread much above
normal temperatures from the Great Basin/Northern Plains to the
Great Lakes and Northeast next week. In between, expect a
slow-moving upper low/trough to generate unsettled weather and
potentially heavy rainfall over parts of the already over
saturated Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley. Shortwave
energy passing over the East Coast this weekend may form a modest
upper low embedded within the ridge off the Mid-Atlantic coast,
but with low confidence for maritime details.

Model solutions remain well clustered days 3-5 (Sun-Tue), with the
00 UTC GFS/ECMWF seemingly best supported by the latest GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means in a pattern with above normal predictability. The
WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from the 00
UTC GFS/ECMWF along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models and
WPC continuity in this time frame. The 00 UTC GFS/ECMWF maintain
amplified West Coast upper troughing into Days 6/7 (Wed/next Thu)
more in line with ensemble means and pattern continuity while the
06/12 UTC GFS runs become less amplified as more energy works
inland. The 12 UTC ECMWF remains on the amplified side of the
forecast envelope and the 12 UTC Canadian has trended more
amplified than the 00 UTC run, bolstering confidence. Considering
increasing forecast spread and lingering uncertainty, WPC guidance
was mainly derived from the ensemble means in this longer time
period.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A multi-day heavy rainfall event is likely across portions of
Texas, Louisiana, and into the ArkLaTex region with a persistent
deep-layer flow of Gulf moisture interacting with the Southern
Plains upper level trough/low and a western Gulf Coast surface
front. Models continue to suggest the potential for several inches
or more of rain within a region which has seen well above normal
precipitation over recent weeks, leading to flooding concerns. As
the trough opens up and elongates, rainfall should become lighter
with time with moisture also extending northward over the
east-central U.S. toward the middle of next week. Elsewhere, the
Northeast should remain fairly dry with diurnally-favored showers
lingering over parts of the Southeast and flow around Bermuda high
pressure may eventually extend some moisture northward through the
Appalachians. Out West, increasing moisture over the Pacific
Northwest is expected this weekend, with ejecting
shortwaves/frontal systems extending some activity into the
northern Rockies and eventually the northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley.

Extreme temperature anomalies are likely from parts of the Great
Basin/northern Plains to the Upper Great Lakes and Northeast.
Highs and/or morning lows may reach up to 15-20+F above normal.
Especially across parts of the Northeast next week, these values
may exceed daily records for highs and warm lows. Meanwhile
Texas/Louisiana and vicinity are likely to see slightly below
normal highs early next week due to persistent clouds and
rainfall. West Coast highs will refresh to moderately below normal
as amplified upper troughing becomes established over the region.

...Record Heat Threat from the Northern Plains to the Northeast....
...Multi-Day Heavy Rainfall Event For the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The large scale pattern remains locked on the amplification and
persistence of a West Coast upper trough next week while
downstream ridging is forecast to build and anchor over much of
the Southeast to Mid-Atlantic. A weakness in the ridge over the
central U.S. and an associated surface boundary will be the
focus/lift for widespread precipitation, some of which could be
locally heavy and result in flash flooding over portions of Texas,
Louisiana, and the ArkLaTex region. With troughing established
over the West Coast, storm systems are expected to track along a
quasi-stationary boundary from the central/northern Rockies into
the northern Plains.

While the model guidance is reasonably clustered and agreeable for
days 3-5 (Mon-Wed), there is considerable uncertainty for the
Western U.S. with the evolution of shortwave energy coming out of
the Gulf of Alaska and Eastern Pacific. The ECMWF is actually fast
to eject energy out of the Gulf of Alaska through the base of the
trough into the Pacific Northwest by Friday while the GFS bottles
this energy back offshore into a closed low. By day 7, the
deterministic runs of the GFS/ECMWF are almost out of phase over
the Northwest. The ensembles (ECENS/GEFS) are a bit slower and
depict a solution toward the GFS idea instead of the faster ECMWF.
With this in mind, the WPC blend this cycle used mostly a
ECMWF/GFS/UKMET blend early on then mostly GEFS/ECENS blend for
day 6-7 to help offset some of the higher uncertainty for the
Pacific Northwest.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The combination of deep flow from the Gulf of Moisture interacting
with a surface boundary along the western/central Gulf Coast will
continue to provide episodes of heavy rainfall and possible flash
flooding late this weekend into early next week from portions of
Texas, Louisiana, and gradually northward across the ArkLaTex and
Lower/Mid Mississippi River Valley where the greatest risk area
for several inches of rainfall totals exists. Over time next week,
the associated surface trough is forecast to weaken and lift
northward which will bring numerous to widespread showers and
thunderstorms to portions of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes
regions, although with lighter rainfall amounts expected at this
time. Meanwhile, diurnally driven showers and storms will be
possible across the southern to central Appalachians and perhaps
into portions of the Mid-Atlantic with the flow around a strong
Bermuda high. The West will remain dry aside from some light
precipitation across the Pacific Northwest and far northern
Rockies.

The greatest temperature anomalies during the period are expected
to be across the northern tier of the CONUS where daytime highs
15F to 20F above normal. Record highs will be possible, especially
across the Northeast Monday and Tuesday. The South will see normal
to even slightly below normal temperatures thanks to increased
cloud cover and precipitation chances while the West Coast will
experience slightly below normal readings in response to the
troughing in place over the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0118 AM CDT Fri Jun 04 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will begin to dominate much of the CONUS today, but
with a well-defined mid-level impulse and associated surface
lee-trough cresting the ridge across the northern Rockies. Dry and
breezy downslope flow along the lee of the Cascades will promote
some wildfire-spread potential. Deep-layer lifting of a buoyant
airmass atop a dry boundary layer will support dry thunderstorm
potential from parts of the Great Basin to the northern Plains.
Farther southwest, dry and breezy conditions may be observed across
portions of the lower Colorado River Valley this afternoon, with
more localized favorable surface conditions across central
California to the lee of the Coast Ranges.

...Lee of the Cascades and Sierra...
During the afternoon, westerly downslope flow is expected to
contribute to widespread 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds
along the lee of the entire Cascades and northern Sierra,
overlapping with 15-20% RH. Fuels across this area are unseasonably
dry and are at least modestly receptive to fire spread, warranting
the continuation of Elevated highlights. Locally Critical conditions
are still expected across the Columbia and Harney Basins per latest
guidance consensus, but widespread coverage of Critical remains too
low for introducing highlights this outlook.

...Parts of the Great Basin into the Four Corners Region...
Deep-layer ascent ahead of the upper trough will promote isolated to
widely scattered high-based thunderstorms across much of the
Interior West during the afternoon into early evening hours. While
isolated thunderstorms across the Great Basin into the Four Corners
will be slow moving, 0.5-0.75 inch precipitable water values and a
very dry surface-500 mb sub-cloud layer suggest that dry strikes
will be common. Fuels are at least modestly receptive to fire spread
across western Nevada, to near critically receptive along the
Nevada/Utah/Arizona border and points southeast, warranting isolated
dry thunderstorm highlights for much of the Great Basin.

...Northern Rockies into North Dakota...
Farther north across parts of Montana into North Dakota, fuel
receptiveness becomes more nebulous, with 100-hr fuels supporting
some fire-spread potential despite relatively low ERCs. Precipitable
water values are also expected to exceed 1.0 inches across much of
eastern Montana and points east. Nonetheless, fast-moving storms
will develop atop a deep, dry sub-cloud layer, with the potential to
produce several dry strikes in addition to strong, erratic wind
gusts (please see the Day 1 Convective Outlook for more details on
severe potential). Dry and breezy ambient conditions verging on
Elevated thresholds (albeit more localized) are also expected across
parts of the northern Rockies into western North Dakota. Many of the
aforementioned conditions may compensate for high precipitable water
values/marginally receptive fuels to foster at least some
grassfire-ignition potential, with isolated dry-thunderstorm
highlights introduced where the best overlap of these favorable
conditions is expected.

Farther east into north-central North Dakota to northwest Minnesota,
more widespread Elevated conditions are expected ahead of a
southward-sagging cold front. Here, 15 mph sustained southwesterly
winds are expected to overlap with 20-25% RH for at least a few
hours, with Elevated highlights maintained given the very dry fuels
in place.

...Lower Colorado River Basin...
Latest guidance consensus has trended upward in surface wind speeds
across portions of central Arizona to the Nevada and New Mexico
border areas, given the presence of heat-low-induced gradient winds.
15 mph sustained westerly winds are expected to be common this
afternoon, and will overlap with 10-20% RH and very dry fuels, hence
the introduction of Elevated highlights.

...Early season heatwave across the north-central states...

...Additional heavy rain for portions of the Gulf Coast...

Impressive early season heat is expected across much of the
northern tier of the U.S. for Friday and extending into Saturday
as a large upper level ridge dominates the weather pattern across
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest.  Highs well into the 90s
and perhaps near 100 degrees are likely across portions of the
Dakotas and Minnesota, and this will likely challenge some daily
record highs.  It will also be quite warm across the Desert
Southwest with 100+ degree readings expected for the lower
elevations.  Some relief is expected for portions of the Pacific
Northwest and the Intermountain West by this weekend as a cold
front gradually sinks south.   It will not be as hot across Texas
and the Deep South owing to a weak upper low and abundant cloud
cover and rainfall.

Another thing making weather headlines to close out the week will
be additional heavy rainfall across the central and western Gulf
Coast region, particularly along the Interstate 10 corridor
between Houston and New Orleans.  Moisture rich flow from the Gulf
of Mexico will intercept a weak low level boundary over this
region, and promote the development of numerous showers and storms
through Saturday, with the potential for 2 to 4 inches of rain
that may result in some instances of flooding.  Moderate to
locally heavy rain is also expected along the Southeast U.S. coast
and the Florida Peninsula, although the heaviest rain should be
offshore by Friday morning.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 AM CDT Fri Jun 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will gradually deepen while propagating across
the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies/northern Plains, as
an upper ridge breaks down across the CONUS tomorrow. Surface
lee-troughing will prevail across the Plains states, with gradient
winds and a mixing boundary layer contributing to widespread dry and
breezy conditions to portions of the Northern Rockies into the
Interior West. Deep-layer ascent and adequate moisture ahead of the
upper trough will also pose a low, conditional threat of isolated
dry thunderstorms across portions of the Great Basin into the Four
Corners region. However, details of Day 1 precipitation and greatest
coverage of dry strikes preclude isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights this outlook.

...Interior West...
By afternoon peak heating, downslope flow along the lee of the
southern Cascades/Sierra will contribute to widespread 15-25 mph
sustained westerly surface winds and 10-20% RH across southeast
Oregon into Idaho and western Nevada. Similar surface winds/RH are
expected from eastern Nevada into southwest Utah and much of central
Arizona, given boundary-layer drying and downward momentum transport
of modest mid-level flow. A broad area of Elevated highlights were
introduced, given widespread, unseasonably dry fuels. At least
locally Critical conditions are expected across much of the Elevated
area, with several of the latest guidance members depicting
potentially widespread Critical conditions. Lack of stronger upper
support with southward extent was the primary reason for withholding
Critical highlights this outlook, though Critical highlights may be
needed in future outlooks if models continue to trend drier and
windier across portions of the Interior West.

In addition, a lobe of relatively higher mid-level moisture may move
into the Great Basin tomorrow ahead of the upper trough, where the
latest guidance shows classic inverted-V soundings and strong enough
low/mid-level wind speeds to support fast storm motions. Questions
remain regarding the coverage of storms across the area. However, if
confidence increases in better storm coverage across the area,
isolated dry thunderstorm highlights may be introduced in future
outlooks given at least modestly receptive fuels across the area.

...Northern Rockies...
60+ kt mid-level flow will overspread the region tomorrow afternoon
as the upper trough passes overhead. Downward momentum transport
within a relatively dry boundary layer will foster widespread 15-25
mph sustained westerly surface winds and 15-25% RH. While the
marginal receptiveness of fuels to fire spread and potential impacts
of Day 1 precipitation may negatively influence wildfire-spread
potential to a degree, the widespread high-end Elevated to Critical
conditions warrant the introduction of Elevated highlights.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1159 AM CDT Mon Aug 02 2021

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

Expanded the isolated dry thunderstorm area slightly southeast into
far northern Nevada based on morning high-resolution guidance.
Otherwise, the forecast remains on track. See previous discussion
below.

..Bentley.. 08/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CDT Mon Aug 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early-morning water vapor imagery shows a low-amplitude wave off the
California coast that is forecast to shift into the Pacific
Northwest over the next 24 hours. Residual monsoonal moisture will
support enough instability for isolated thunderstorms across central
OR this afternoon. Elsewhere, localized fire weather concerns are
possible across northern California and central Montana, but modest
flow will limit the overall threat.

...Central to Southeast Oregon...
The 00z Boise, ID sounding and GOES PWAT estimates show plentiful
moisture in place across the Pacific Northwest early this morning.
PWAT values will diminish through the day as drier Pacific air,
noted in low/mid-level water vapor imagery attendant to the
upper-level wave, filters into the region. However, forecast
soundings remain in good agreement that residual moisture will be
sufficient for 250-500 J/kg MUCAPE by this afternoon. Lift ahead of
the wave will support isolated thunderstorm development this
afternoon amid peak daytime heating. Deep, well-mixed boundary
layers will not only limit rainfall amounts, but may allow for
strong downburst winds (see the Day 1 Convective Outlook for
details). MRMS estimates show much of central/southeast OR has
missed out on appreciable rainfall over the past 72 hours, which has
maintained dry fuels. While a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms is
expected, the potential for several lightning strikes over dry fuels
warrants the dry thunderstorm risk area.

...Northern California...
Mid-level flow is expected to increase somewhat with the passage of
the shortwave trough over northern CA and southern OR. While surface
pressure-gradient winds will remain weak, a few locations will
likely see wind gusts up to 15-20 mph this afternoon when diurnal
mixing is maximized. With RH values in the teens expected, periodic
and localized elevated fire weather conditions are possible.

...Central Montana...
A lee surface trough is forecast to gradually deepen through the day
as an upper-level impulse progresses over the northern Rockies. The
surface mass response will be modest owing to the low-amplitude
nature of the impulse and associated flow aloft, which will limit
the potential for sustained winds over 15 mph. However, sustained
winds between 10-15 mph may gust upwards of 20 mph across central MT
where fuels are dry and RH values in the 15-25% range are expected.
This idea of localized/transient elevated fire weather conditions is
supported by recent ensemble guidance, though highlights may be
needed if winds trend stronger than expected.

...Lingering heavy rainfall threat for the coastal Carolinas
Thursday...

...Overview...

Upper pattern will undergo a reshuffling of the anomaly centers
from the Pacific across CONUS into the western Atlantic later this
week into next week. Initial trough/ridge/trough pattern over the
PacNW/Rockies/Great Lakes and Midwest will shift toward broad
troughing from the northern Rockies to the Upper Midwest with
weaker ridging into the East. This translates to a generally drier
pattern with warming temperatures out of the Plains into the East.
The Northwest will see cooler and unsettled weather overall.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

For the 00z/06z cycles, the models and ensembles show good
clustering the first half of the period, with the typical detail
and timing uncertainties arising thereafter. The GFS has shifted
north with it's placement of the upper low into the PacNW Friday
into Saturday, and is now more in line with the ECMWF and ensemble
means. The CMC is now the model farthest south with the low, and
the ECMWF by days 6 and 7 takes it a little north into Central
Canada, whereas the GFS hangs close to the US/Canadian border. For
days 3-5, a majority deterministic blend worked well as a starting
point for this cycle of the WPC forecast. After that, opted to
lean more on the ensemble means, while still maintaining at least
50% of the deterministic ECMWF/GFS. This approach also worked well
for the Eastern U.S. and maintains good continuity with the
previous WPC forecast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Stalled frontal boundary over the Carolinas and along the East
Coast will slowly dissipate this coming weekend, after likely
being a focus for several days of widespread rain and locally
heavy amounts that could cause flooding issues. Upper trough
responsible for its orientation will weaken in concert, allowing
the focused rainfall to abate. With increased flow across the
U.S./Canadian border, rainfall will expand out of the
PacNW/northern Rockies through the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
as a system traverses the northern tier. Rainfall will focus near
and north of an area of low pressure as well as south of a
northern stream boundary. Rainfall in the Southwest will be more
isolated this weekend but could increase a bit next week as the
upper high shifts away and weak troughing settles into California
and Nevada.

Temperatures will trend cooler as the Pacific front moves ashore
the Pacific Northwest Friday--about 5-15 degrees cooler than
normal. Ahead of the front, temperatures will be 5 to 10 degrees
above normal over the Plains Thu/Fri then into the Corn Belt/Great
Lakes this weekend and to the East Coast by next Monday. Much of
the East/Southeast will see near to below normal max temperatures
along and behind the stationary front--perhaps as much as 10
degrees below normal on some days over Texas/New Mexico and over
the Carolinas Thu-Fri before a warm-up this weekend back toward
more typical values. In the Southwest, excessive heat may continue
into Thursday but should moderate Friday and into the weekend. As
the upper high shifts out of the Southwest and into the Deep
South, heat and humidity may combine to bring heat indices to near
100-110F late period across portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley.

...Lingering heavy rainfall threat for the coastal Carolinas
Thursday...

...Overview...

Upper pattern will undergo a reshuffling of the anomaly centers
from the Pacific across CONUS into the western Atlantic later this
week into next week. Initial trough/ridge/trough pattern over the
PacNW/Rockies/Great Lakes and Midwest will shift toward broad
troughing from the northern Rockies to the Upper Midwest with
weaker ridging into the East. This translates to a generally drier
pattern with warming temperatures out of the Plains into the East.
The Northwest will see cooler and unsettled weather overall.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

For the 00z/06z cycles, the models and ensembles show good
clustering the first half of the period, with the typical detail
and timing uncertainties arising thereafter. The GFS has shifted
north with it's placement of the upper low into the PacNW Friday
into Saturday, and is now more in line with the ECMWF and ensemble
means. The CMC is now the model farthest south with the low, and
the ECMWF by days 6 and 7 takes it a little north into Central
Canada, whereas the GFS hangs close to the US/Canadian border. For
days 3-5, a majority deterministic blend worked well as a starting
point for this cycle of the WPC forecast. After that, opted to
lean more on the ensemble means, while still maintaining at least
50% of the deterministic ECMWF/GFS. This approach also worked well
for the Eastern U.S. and maintains good continuity with the
previous WPC forecast.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 02 2021

SYNOPSIS: Positive mid-level height anomalies are predicted for the
northwestern and northeastern lower 48 during week-2, favoring increased
likelihood for above normal temperatures in these areas. Mid-level high
pressure combined with enhanced moisture levels at the beginning of the period
may support excessive heat across parts of the northeastern contiguous U.S.
The
mid-level pattern is anticipated to generally weaken throughout week-2, with
the potential for weak mid-level low pressure forming over the Ohio Valley and
Great Lakes by the middle of the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of the northeastern CONUS, Tue-Thu,
Aug 10-12.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY AUGUST 05 - MONDAY AUGUST 09:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!un0tjkCsKpnDboOiYCxDyUJ1zFs86jHJtDW-r5bf4XcCN0j70yCn3gqGLkM1Mym93O6lk1Et$

FOR TUESDAY AUGUST 10 - MONDAY AUGUST 16: There is relatively good agreement
in
the 0Z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensemble means indicating mid-level ridging
across the northeastern CONUS amplifying by the beginning of week-2. This
pattern combined with anticipated enhanced moisture across the northeastern
CONUS may support heat index values reaching excessive heat criteria. The GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 40% chance of maximum air
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile across this region, with
temperatures exceeding 85 Deg F across New England and 90 Deg F across the
Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley. A slight risk for excessive heat
is
highlighted for parts of the northeastern CONUS where the calibrated GEFS and
ECMWF heat tool indicates at least a 20% chance of heat index values being
greater than the 90th percentile, with heat index values ranging from
exceeding
90 Deg F across New England to 95 Deg F across the Ohio Valley, and over 100
Deg F across parts of the Mid-Atlantic. The greatest likelihood for excessive
heat is for day 8 (Aug 10), with decreasing chances by day 10 (Aug 12). The
National Blended Models shows some parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and the D.C.
area approaching record high temperatures during the highlighted risk period.
Of additional concern is the potential for some of the risk areas having
nighttime temperatures in the upper 70s and low 80s.



The 0Z GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means show a transition from mid-level
troughing
across the northwestern CONUS to weak mid-level ridging by day 9 (Aug 11).
Unlike the GEFS and ECMWF, The 0Z Canadian ensemble mean keeps the anomalous
ridging off the West Coast. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies across the
Northwest support above normal temperatures across parts of the western third
of the CONUS. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20%
chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 Deg F, Aug
11 to 14, across parts of the Great Basin and Four Corners region, with parts
of the Central Valley of California exceeding 100 Deg F. The GEFS week-2
ensemble mean show a greater expanse of positive 500-hPa anomalies compared to
the ECMWF and Canadian, resulting in the GEFS reforecast tool having a
stronger
signal for excessive heat across parts of the Northwest, including Northern
California. The raw 0Z GEFS ensemble mean shows positive maximum temperature
anomalies exceeding 10 Deg F across parts of the West Coast states throughout
much of week-2, whereas the 0Z ECMWF shows significantly weaker anomalies. Due
to these significant model differences, a risk of excessive heat is not
included at this time but could be included in the next few days if there is
greater model agreement for temperatures reaching hazards criteria.



The 0Z ECMWF and 0Z GEFS ensemble means show possible low formation across the
Great Plains, with possible frontal activity across the Midwest which could
bring above normal precipitation to the region. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools indicate parts of the Midwest receiving 3-day rainfall totals exceeding
the 85th percentile at the beginning of the period, although totals do not
exceed one inch. A heavy precipitation risk is not designated due to expected
rainfall totals not exceeding hazards criteria.



Across the Four Corners region, there is significant variability in the
depiction of the mid-level ridge placement among the model ensemble means. The
0Z GEFS ensemble mean generally shows the ridge being located further north in
the Four Corners compared to the ECMWF, which would be more favorable for
enhanced monsoonal moisture. Tropical cyclone activity is favored in the East
Pacific during the period which could promote enhanced moisture into the
region
which would increase the potential for heavy rainfall in the Desert Southwest.
The accumulated week-2 precipitation reforecast tools are significantly
different, with the ECMWF reforecast tool favoring below normal precipitation
across the southwestern CONUS and the GEFS reforecast tool favoring near to
above. Despite high model uncertainty regarding heavy precipitation potential,
possible thunderstorm activity could still support localized flash flooding.



The 0Z GEFS and 0Z ECMWF indicate the possibility of surface low formation
across central Mainland Alaska, with frontal activity in the Gulf of Alaska
approaching the South Coast of Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle at the
beginning
of the period. This feature may support enhanced precipitation across parts of
the southwestern Mainland and the Alaska Panhandle. The GEFS reforecast tool
shows at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th
percentile and 1.5 inches across southeastern coastal Mainland Alaska and the
northern half of the Alaska Panhandle during from the beginning to middle of
week-2. However, the ECMWF reforecast tool precipitation totals do not
highlight this region for potential for heavier precipitation. Therefore no
related precipitation hazards are posted at this time.

...Monsoonal showers to bring heavy rains and localized flash
flooding through the Rockies Monday night through Wednesday...

..Heavy rains and flooding possible from the Central Gulf coast,
northeastward across the coastal Southeast and eastern Carolinas...

...Below average temperatures expected from the Lower Mississippi
Valley into the East.  Above average temperatures expected from
the Southwest into the Pacific Northwest and eastward into the
Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi...

Monsoonal showers will remain active on the northern and eastern
peripheries of the mid to upper level ridge that is building from
the Southwest into the Pacific Northwest.  This pattern will
support active monsoonal showers through much of the Rockies from
Monday night through Wednesday. These heavy rains, however, will
be to the east of where the heaviest rains have fallen recently
from the Southwest into the Great Basin.  However, with moisture
values expected to be above average in the region of expected
monsoonal showers, localized flash flooding is possible over the
next few days through the Rockies.  This is especially so in area
of recent burn scars and in regions of steep terrain.

As the mid to upper level ridge builds from the Southwest into the
Pacific Northwest, above average temperatures are expected across
these regions and eastward into the Northern Plains/Upper
Mississippi Valley region.

A frontal boundary is expected to remain nearly stationary over
the next few days from the Gulf coast, across the coastal
Southeast and eastern Carolinas.  This front will be the focus for
a multi day heavy rain event as several rounds of potentially
heavy rains move along the front where moisture values are
expected to remain much above average.  Much of the region in the
vicinity of this stationary front has seen above average rain
totals over the past few weeks. This, along with the potential for
additional heavy rains will pose an increasing threat of flooding
and flash flooding across these regions.

In addition to the heavy rains in the vicinity of the above
mentioned stationary front, temperatures are expected to remain
much below average over the next few days with high temperatures
10-15 degrees colder than average from North Florida into the
Southeast and Carolinas.
A few record low maximum temperatures are possible across portions
of the Southeast over the next 2 days where highs are forecast to
remain in the 70s.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon August 02 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 08 - 12 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. The models predict a deep closed low over the Aleutians and
Bering Sea, associated with large negative height anomalies over the Aleutians
and Mainland Alaska. A ridge is forecast downstream over the Gulf of Alaska,
associated with large positive height anomalies over the Alaska Panhandle,
extending into parts of the Pacific Northwest. Over the CONUS, a trough is
forecast over parts of the western U.S., leading to relatively weak negative
height anomalies from parts of the Rockies and Four Corners Region to the
Plains. Over the eastern portions of the country, ridging and positive height
anomalies are forecast to prevail.

A deep closed low forecast over the Bering Sea favors negative height
anomalies
across most of Alaska, supporting increased odds of below normal temperatures
for Alaska. Increased storm system activity around this low also favors above
normal precipitation for most of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Downstream
of the ridge forecast over the Gulf of Alaska, increased chances of above
normal temperatures are favored for parts of Northern California, Nevada, and
parts of the Pacific Northwest. This forecast ridge is likely to suppress
storm
system activity coming onshore and progressing eastward, favoring near to
below
normal precipitation for the western half of the CONUS. Weak troughing
forecast
over the interior West favors increased probabilities for below normal
temperatures across parts of the Rockies and Great Basin. Persistent above
normal heights forecast across much of the East favors above normal
temperatures for the eastern two thirds of the CONUS, particularly for the
Great Lakes region and Northeast, where temperature anomalies are forecast to
be especially large during parts of the period. This ridge is forecast to
suppress rainfall over the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic Region and parts of coastal
New England, except for the Great Lakes Region where a front is expected to
progress eastward across the region.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's
operational 0z GFS centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to good agreement among the dynamical models and tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 10 - 16 2021

By the week-2 period, much of the large-scale 500-hPa pattern is forecast to
become less amplified. The only feature that is expected to remain amplified
is
the ridge over the Gulf of Alaska. Nevertheless the forecast features remain
in
nearly the same position. This leads to a very similar temperature forecast to
the 6-10 day period, with a few differences. Anomalous ridging is forecast to
extend further inland in the western CONUS, increasing the area of favored
above normal temperatures. The trough is forecast to weaken in the interior
western CONUS, further increasing above normal temperature probabilities over
the region. The precipitation forecast for the week-2 period is very similar
to
the 6-10 day period. One difference is that the front forecast during the 6-10
day period is predicted to reach the East Coast during the week-2 period,
leading to increased chances of above normal precipitation for most of the
Mid-Atlantic Region into the Northeast, in addition to the Great Lakes and
Ohio
Valley.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to good agreement among the dynamical models and tools.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Lingering heavy rainfall threat for the coastal Carolinas
Thursday...

...Overview...

Upper pattern will undergo a reshuffling of the anomaly centers
from the Pacific across CONUS into the western Atlantic later this
week into next week. Initial trough/ridge/trough pattern over the
PacNW/Rockies/Great Lakes and Midwest will shift toward broad
troughing from the northern Rockies to the Upper Midwest with
weaker ridging into the East. This translates to a generally drier
pattern with warming temperatures out of the Plains into the East.
The Northwest will see cooler and unsettled weather overall.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

For the 00z/06z cycles, the models and ensembles show good
clustering the first half of the period, with the typical detail
and timing uncertainties arising thereafter. The GFS has shifted
north with it's placement of the upper low into the PacNW Friday
into Saturday, and is now more in line with the ECMWF and ensemble
means. The CMC is now the model farthest south with the low, and
the ECMWF by days 6 and 7 takes it a little north into Central
Canada, whereas the GFS hangs close to the US/Canadian border. For
days 3-5, a majority deterministic blend worked well as a starting
point for this cycle of the WPC forecast. After that, opted to
lean more on the ensemble means, while still maintaining at least
50% of the deterministic ECMWF/GFS. This approach also worked well
for the Eastern U.S. and maintains good continuity with the
previous WPC forecast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Stalled frontal boundary over the Carolinas and along the East
Coast will slowly dissipate this coming weekend, after likely
being a focus for several days of widespread rain and locally
heavy amounts that could cause flooding issues. Upper trough
responsible for its orientation will weaken in concert, allowing
the focused rainfall to abate. With increased flow across the
U.S./Canadian border, rainfall will expand out of the
PacNW/northern Rockies through the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
as a system traverses the northern tier. Rainfall will focus near
and north of an area of low pressure as well as south of a
northern stream boundary. Rainfall in the Southwest will be more
isolated this weekend but could increase a bit next week as the
upper high shifts away and weak troughing settles into California
and Nevada.

Temperatures will trend cooler as the Pacific front moves ashore
the Pacific Northwest Friday--about 5-15 degrees cooler than
normal. Ahead of the front, temperatures will be 5 to 10 degrees
above normal over the Plains Thu/Fri then into the Corn Belt/Great
Lakes this weekend and to the East Coast by next Monday. Much of
the East/Southeast will see near to below normal max temperatures
along and behind the stationary front--perhaps as much as 10
degrees below normal on some days over Texas/New Mexico and over
the Carolinas Thu-Fri before a warm-up this weekend back toward
more typical values. In the Southwest, excessive heat may continue
into Thursday but should moderate Friday and into the weekend. As
the upper high shifts out of the Southwest and into the Deep
South, heat and humidity may combine to bring heat indices to near
100-110F late period across portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Mon Aug 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

Moved the IsoDryT area slightly east based on the latest forecast
guidance. Otherwise, the forecast appears on track. See previous
discussion below.

..Bentley.. 08/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Mon Aug 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave trough, currently off the California coast,
will consolidate as it moves inland and bring another round of
thunderstorm chances to the Pacific Northwest. Despite the deepening
wave, surface pressure patterns will remain nebulous and result in
generally modest flow. While no robust or widespread wind-driven
fire weather threats are expected, a few regional concerns may
evolve.

...Pacific Northwest...
Forecast soundings suggest enough residual mid-level moisture will
remain in place over the Pacific Northwest to support weak, but
sufficient, instability for thunderstorms Tuesday afternoon. PWAT
amounts near 0.75 inches are expected, but deep, well-mixed boundary
layers could limit rainfall amounts and yield a mix of wet and dry
storms. Additionally, fast storm motions (near 20 knots) may limit
precipitation over any one area. Recent reports suggest fuels remain
dry over central OR, which should support the potential for
lightning starts Tuesday afternoon barring wetting rainfall over the
next 24 hours (though the coverage of rain today/Monday is
uncertain).

...Northern California...
Isolated elevated fire weather conditions are possible Tuesday
afternoon across northern CA into far southern OR as mid-level winds
gradually strengthen in response to the passing upper-level wave.
Although the wave is forecast to deepen to some degree, the surface
response will be modest with most ensemble members showing winds
between 10-15 mph. However, deeper boundary-layer mixing by late
afternoon may allow for occasional gusts up to 20 mph. Warm/dry
conditions will foster RH reductions to the teens and low 20s,
which, when combined with the aforementioned winds, may support
localized elevated conditions.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1243 AM CDT Tue Aug 03 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Another round of isolated thunderstorms is expected across the
Pacific Northwest this afternoon as a pair of weak upper-level
disturbances move into the region. This will pose a threat for at
least a few dry lightning strikes over dry fuels. Localized
wind-driven fire weather concerns are possible across northern
California, but weak winds elsewhere will mitigate additional fire
weather potential.

...Pacific Northwest...
Although drier air has begun filtering into the region, 00z observed
soundings and forecast soundings suggest lingering mid-level
moisture and gradually cooling temperatures aloft will support weak
instability by this afternoon. The general thermodynamic environment
appears similar to the previous 24 hours, which supported a mix of
wet and dry thunderstorms over OR. As such, a similar scenario is
expected today as a pair of weak upper-level shortwave troughs
(noted in water-vapor imagery off the CA and WA coasts) migrate
through the region. In addition to dry lightning strikes,
thunderstorms may produce strong outflow winds (see the Day 1
Convective Outlook for details). Precipitation over the past 48
hours has been sparse enough to maintain dry fuels over the region,
which will support another day of lightning-driven fire weather
concerns.

...Northern California...
Very dry conditions will persist across much of CA and into southern
OR today with RH values in the single digits to teens likely.
Although southwesterly flow aloft will increase somewhat with the
passage of an upper-level wave, the surface response is expected to
be weak with 10-15 mph winds likely across northern CA. Locations
that typically see terrain-enhanced winds will likely see periods of
elevated fire weather conditions, though this threat appears too
limited spatially and temporally to warrant highlights at this time.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
205 AM EDT Tue Aug 03 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Aug 06 2021 - 12Z Tue Aug 10 2021

...Overview...

Troughing will continue through the medium range in the West
(especially the Northwest) as ridging builds into the East. A
drier pattern overall is expected with rainfall focused mostly
along the Canadian border but also along the Gulf Coast and into
the Southwest, though with less coverage/intensity. Temperatures
will warm up in the East well into the 80s and 90s while the
Northwest stays below normal.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the models/ensembles that paired best
included the 12Z GFS/ECMWF/Canadian and 12Z GEFS mean/ECMWF
ensemble mean while the 12Z UKMET and 18Z GFS/GEFS were not
preferred. The UKMET has had a string of runs with questionable
details and timing of systems that has not seemed to pan out, so
it was discounted again from day 3 onward. The 18Z GFS/GEFS seemed
to have an odd run where it likely over-amplified a shortwave out
of northern Canada across Hudson Bay late Fri into Sat which led
to a much slower system through the Northeast compared to the
consensus. Its 12Z run was much more aligned with the
ECMWF/Canadian and ensembles. By next week, the deterministic
consensus was decidedly quicker with the trough progression along
~50N compared to the ensembles, but this could be a function of
the lower amplitude flow and lack of details in the broader
ensemble means. Utilized a much larger deterministic component to
day 7 despite the usual increase in uncertainty given a preference
for a quicker pace as evidenced by a multi-day trend from the
Northeast Pacific eastward this weekend into next week.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Stalled frontal boundary over the Carolinas and along the East
Coast will slowly dissipate this coming weekend, after likely
being a focus for several days of widespread rain and locally
heavy amounts that could cause flooding issues. Upper trough
responsible for its orientation will weaken in concert, allowing
the focused rainfall to abate around the start of the medium
range. With increased flow across the U.S./Canadian border,
rainfall will expand out of the PacNW/northern Rockies through the
Upper Midwest and Great Lakes as a system traverses the northern
tier. Rainfall will focus near and north of an area of low
pressure as well as south of a northern stream boundary dipping
into the Great Lakes. Some rainfall could be heavy on Saturday
over the Upper Midwest. Rainfall in the Southwest will be more
isolated but could affect terrain locations and perhaps some lower
valley locations as well.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest behind the lead cold front Fri-Sun before a
slight moderation. Ahead of the front, temperatures will be 5 to
10 degrees above normal over the Plains Fri-Sun and to the East
Coast Sun-Tue (especially the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast).
As upper ridging builds into the Deep South next week, heat and
humidity may combine to bring heat indices to near 100-110F across
portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley and around 100F in the
Mid-Atlantic.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
205 AM EDT Tue Aug 03 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Aug 06 2021 - 12Z Tue Aug 10 2021

...Overview...

Troughing will continue through the medium range in the West
(especially the Northwest) as ridging builds into the East. A
drier pattern overall is expected with rainfall focused mostly
along the Canadian border but also along the Gulf Coast and into
the Southwest, though with less coverage/intensity. Temperatures
will warm up in the East well into the 80s and 90s while the
Northwest stays below normal.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the models/ensembles that paired best
included the 12Z GFS/ECMWF/Canadian and 12Z GEFS mean/ECMWF
ensemble mean while the 12Z UKMET and 18Z GFS/GEFS were not
preferred. The UKMET has had a string of runs with questionable
details and timing of systems that has not seemed to pan out, so
it was discounted again from day 3 onward. The 18Z GFS/GEFS seemed
to have an odd run where it likely over-amplified a shortwave out
of northern Canada across Hudson Bay late Fri into Sat which led
to a much slower system through the Northeast compared to the
consensus. Its 12Z run was much more aligned with the
ECMWF/Canadian and ensembles. By next week, the deterministic
consensus was decidedly quicker with the trough progression along
the lower amplitude flow and lack of details in the broader
ensemble means. Utilized a much larger deterministic component to
day 7 despite the usual increase in uncertainty given a preference
for a quicker pace as evidenced by a multi-day trend from the
Northeast Pacific eastward this weekend into next week.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Stalled frontal boundary over the Carolinas and along the East
Coast will slowly dissipate this coming weekend, after likely
being a focus for several days of widespread rain and locally
heavy amounts that could cause flooding issues. Upper trough
responsible for its orientation will weaken in concert, allowing
the focused rainfall to abate around the start of the medium
range. With increased flow across the U.S./Canadian border,
rainfall will expand out of the PacNW/northern Rockies through the
Upper Midwest and Great Lakes as a system traverses the northern
tier. Rainfall will focus near and north of an area of low
pressure as well as south of a northern stream boundary dipping
into the Great Lakes. Some rainfall could be heavy on Saturday
over the Upper Midwest. Rainfall in the Southwest will be more
isolated but could affect terrain locations and perhaps some lower
valley locations as well.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest behind the lead cold front Fri-Sun before a
slight moderation. Ahead of the front, temperatures will be 5 to
10 degrees above normal over the Plains Fri-Sun and to the East
Coast Sun-Tue (especially the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast).
As upper ridging builds into the Deep South next week, heat and
humidity may combine to bring heat indices to near 100-110F across
portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley and around 100F in the
Mid-Atlantic.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Tue Aug 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
A more robust upper-level trough is forecast to begin moving onshore
across the Pacific Northwest through the day Wednesday. This will
bring another day of thunderstorm chances to parts of Oregon and the
northern Rockies, as well as strengthening winds across the northern
Sierra into southern Oregon where conditions have been dry.

...Pacific Northwest...
Forecast soundings continue to suggest sufficient mid-level moisture
will be in place to support weak instability east of the Cascades
and into the northern Rockies (though uncertainty in the western
extent of favorable moisture across central OR is noted). Modest
PWAT values near 0.6 to 0.8 inches and deep, well-mixed boundary
layers will support a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms. Similar
thermodynamic profiles are noted across parts of central ID and into
far southwest MT, but recent wetting rainfall over this region has
likely mitigated fuel readiness to some degree. As such, the
dry-thunderstorm risk area is confined to locations with receptive
fuels and sufficient confidence in thunderstorm potential. Further
refinement to the risk area is possible as confidence in the spatial
coverage of thunderstorms increases and fuels respond to warming
temperatures.

...Northern Sierra into Southern Oregon...
Southwesterly mid-level winds ahead of the main trough axis are
forecast to increase over northern CA into adjacent areas of
northwest NV and southern OR. While sustained winds will likely
remain near 15 mph, deep boundary-layer mixing coincident with the
increasing winds will support frequent gusts up to 20-25 mph
(possibly higher in terrain-favored locations). An increasing
downslope component will maintain dry conditions across the region
as afternoon RH values fall into the upper single digits and low
teens. With dry fuels already in place, elevated fire weather
conditions appear likely as winds increase.

...Monsoonal showers expected to bring heavy rains and localized
flash flooding across central to southern Rockies through tonight
before gradually diminishing...

..Heavy rains and flooding possible along the central Gulf coast
northeastward across the coastal Southeast and into eastern
Carolinas...

...Below average temperatures from the central Plains to the East
Coast while heat returns across the interior West Coast and into
the northern Plains...

A mid to upper level ridge building from the Southwest into the
Pacific Northwest will continue to spread drier conditions across
the interior sections of the West Coast while shifting the most
active monsoonal showers further eastward into the central and
southern Rockies.  Heavy downpours associated with some of the
thunderstorms could lead to localized flash flooding today.  This
is especially so in area of recent burn scars and in regions of
steep terrain.  By Wednesday, these showers and storms are
expected to become less active.  By Thursday morning, the high
pressure ridge is forecast to bring enough stability into the
region to further suppress the monsoonal rainfall.  Meanwhile, the
drying trend brought by the building ridge will lead to the return
of above average temperatures across the Desert Southwest and up
to the interior Pacific Northwest.  Some of the heat will also
spread into the northern Plains where high temperatures are
forecast to reach into the 90s for the next couple of days.

A frontal boundary is expected to remain nearly stationary over
the next few days stretching along the Gulf Coast and along the
Southeast U.S. coast.  This front will be the focus for a multi
day heavy rain event as several rounds of potentially heavy rains
move along the front where low pressure waves are forecast to
form.  Much of the region in the vicinity of this front has seen
above average rain totals over the past few weeks.  This, along
with the potential for additional heavy rains will pose an
increasing threat of flooding and flash flooding from the central
Gulf Coast to the coastal sections of the Southeast into the
eastern Carolinas.

In addition to the heavy rains in the vicinity of the above
mentioned stationary front, temperatures are expected to remain
much below average over the next few days with high temperatures
10-15 degrees colder than average from North Florida into the
Southeast and Carolinas.
A few record low maximum temperatures are possible across portions
of the Southeast over the next 2 days where highs are forecast to
remain in the 70s.  Below normal temperatures will also stretch
across the central U.S. into the central/southern Rockies.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1138 AM CDT Wed Jul 07 2021

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

Shifted the western edge of the dry thunderstorm line out of Oregon
as the convective activity has now shifted farther northeast. The
morning thunderstorms and continued thunderstorm activity have been
very dry in nature with weak reflectivity and fast moving storms
with hundreds of lightning flashes already observed. Expect this to
continue through the day across northern Washington and portions of
northern Idaho and northwest Montana with wetter convection expected
farther east into Montana where PWAT values are higher.

In addition, expanded the elevated area into far southwest Wyoming
and northern Utah based on the latest forecast guidance showing 15
to 20 mph winds in this region.

..Bentley.. 07/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0103 AM CDT Wed Jul 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level wave currently just off the OR/WA coast will continue
to support isolated to scattered thunderstorms across the Northwest
and northern Rockies today. Increasing low and mid-level flow
associated with the wave combined with antecedent hot/dry conditions
and receptive fuels will drive additional fire weather concerns
across the Northwest and parts of the Great Basin.

...Pacific Northwest/Northern Rockies...
A few isolated and transient thunderstorms are noted in
early-morning satellite and lightning data across eastern OR and far
western ID ahead of the approaching wave. The 00z sounding from BOI
captures the thermodynamic environment well, featuring a deep,
well-mixed boundary layer under mid-level moisture and elevated
instability. The plume of mid-level moisture sampled by the sounding
is noted in recent GOES PWAT imagery, and is forecast to continue
northeastward into eastern WA, ID, and western MT over the next 24
hours. Thunderstorm chances will increase early this morning through
the evening hours with isolated dry thunderstorms likely across
eastern WA/OR and ID early today before transitioning to
predominantly wet thunderstorms across western MT by late
afternoon/early evening. An area of scattered dry thunderstorms is
possible across northern ID and along the ID/MT border, but forecast
PWAT values between 0.6-0.8 inches hint at a possible mix of dry/wet
thunderstorms, which precludes a scattered risk area for this
outlook.

...Columbia Basin...
The passage of weak cold front through the day will turn winds more
westerly by mid/late afternoon. The deepening of a lee trough across
the northern Rockies will also help tighten the surface pressure
gradient, resulting in sustained winds near 15 mph. Zonal downslope
winds will aid in drying/warming across the Columbia Basin, and
support wind gusts up to 25-35 mph - especially closer to any
terrain features. Given very dry fuels in place across the region,
elevated, to locally critical, fire weather conditions are expected.

...Great Basin...
Surface winds will increase across the western Great Basin as well
this afternoon as the surface low deepens to the northeast. A broad
swath of 15 mph winds is expected with embedded areas of stronger
winds closer to 20 mph near terrain features such as in the lee of
the Sierra Nevada and within the Snake River Valley in southern ID.
Single digit to low teen RH values are expected, and fuels across
the region are generally receptive. Elevated fire weather conditions
are likely, and brief/localized critical conditions are possible.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 07 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure is expected to sustain the risk for
excessive heat across western lower 48 at the beginning of the period, with
this risk shifting eastward over the north-central contiguous U.S. by the
middle of week-2. Surface low pressure development increases the potential for
heavy precipitation across the Midwest, with possible hydrological impacts
focused over Illinois. An active North American Monsoon circulation is
expected
to promote above-normal precipitation and possible flooding over the Desert
Southwest.  Increased chances for above normal temperatures forecast over
Alaska during week-2 may dry fuels for ongoing wildfire activity across the
Mainland.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western and north-central CONUS,
Thu-Wed, Jul 15-21.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Middle Mississippi
Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Central Appalachians, Thu-Sat, Jul 15-
17.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across coastal parts of California,
Thu-Wed, Jul 15-21.

Possible flooding for portions of Illinois.

Possible flooding for portions of Arizona and New Mexico.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY JULY 10 - WEDNESDAY JULY 14:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!t3poQdbU1vZRbxVKjzf9fflJByhiGuBI6TwNNNEKtoAUNcDpOukZs_L2DyDsVqh12crbaqLA$

FOR THURSDAY JULY 15 - WEDNESDAY JULY 21: Compared to late week-1, dynamical
models favor a more deamplified 500-hPa height pattern by the outset of the
period. This is anticipated to lead to some moderation of temperatures and
lower the potential for excessive heat conditions, which have adversely
impacted many parts of the western CONUS since late June. Much of this
weakening is tied to the development of anomalous mid-level troughing featured
in the last several runs of the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles over western Canada,
with much of the positive mid-level height departures focused further east
across the northern tier of the CONUS and southern Canada. However, there are
indications in the ensemble guidance that this troughing will be short-lived,
allowing for the return of positive height departures over the northwestern
and
north-central CONUS, and raise excessive heat concerns over this part of the
country by the middle of week-2.



Despite this weakening of the mid-level pattern aloft early in the period,
reforecast tools maintain a broad coverage of elevated chances (>20%) for
daily
maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 degrees F extending
from the Great Basin to the Northern Plains. Higher probabilities (>40%) exist
in the GEFS reforecast tool over the higher elevations of the Rockies early in
the period that are not evident in the ECMWF reforecast tool which appears to
be more consistent with the evolution of the pattern aloft. By the middle of
the period, both tools indicate increasing probabilities across the Northern
Plains and the Northern Intermountain region associated with the
aforementioned
return of positive mid-level heights, though these signals are not strong
enough to support the inclusion of a moderate risk of excessive heat at this
time. Thus, a broad slight risk area for excessive heat is issued for much of
the western and north-central CONUS for the entirety of week-2. Combined with
below-normal precipitation anticipated through the middle of July, the
continuation of above-normal temperatures and possible excessive heat is
likely
to worsen ongoing moderate (D1) to extreme drought (D4) conditions being felt
throughout this part of the country. As before, heat-driven impacts expected
also include locally elevated fire weather conditions as well as direct health
risks for human and animal populations across the highlighted region.



Surface low formation and frontal activity remains favored in the GEFS and
ECMWF ensemble guidance over the Midwest early in week-2. Surface high
pressure
is also favored over the Southeast to advect Gulf moisture into the central
and
eastern CONUS, which supports increased chances for above-normal and possible
heavy precipitation across the Midwest. Although the GEFS reforecast tool
remains fairly weak regarding the potential for heavy precipitation, the ECMWF
reforecast tool depicts an area from the Middle Mississippi Valley to the
eastern Great Lakes with at least a 20% chance 3-day rainfall accumulations
exceed the 85th percentile and 1 inch. Given support from the raw 0z ECMWF
ensemble, which also shows increased chances (40%) for 3-day amounts exceeding
an inch early in the period, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is issued
for
the region from Jul 15 to 17. Above-average precipitation favored across the
Midwest during week-1 (the Weather Prediction Center forecasts over 4 inches
over parts of Iowa and northern Illinois) supports the addition of a possible
flooding hazard along the Illinois River, where ongoing minor to moderate
flooding conditions may persist into the week-2 period.



The North American Monsoon appears to be well underway, as dynamical models
continue to favor mid-level ridging (594 dm) over the Four Corners region to
enhance moist, easterly flow underneath the ridge axis. The potential for
easterly waves to induce mesoscale convective systems across Mexico, as well
as
tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific during week-2 is likely to
trigger Gulf of California moisture surges and promote above-normal rainfall
over the Southwest. There is good support from the reforecast guidance,
particularly the ECMWF reforecast tool, depicting increased chances for 3-day
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile from eastern Arizona to the Rio
Grande basin. Although totals are not expected to exceed pre-defined hazard
thresholds, there is a continued risk of locally heavy, convective rainfall
over areas that are experiencing extreme drought to elevate the potential for
enhanced runoff across the higher elevations into the valleys. A possible
flood
risk area remains issued and now covers northeastern Arizona and northwestern
New Mexico in today's outlook due to increased wet signals here in the latest
guidance.



Over western North America, mean surface high pressure remains forecast across
the northeastern Pacific, into parts of the Pacific Northwest, while mean
surface low pressure is anticipated over the Great Basin and Desert Southwest
during week-2. The strong mean pressure gradient situated over coastal
California increases chances for episodic high winds in the region, where both
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of sustained wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile. A slight risk of high winds remains posted
across coastal portions of California for the entirety of week-2, and is
expanded further south beyond the San Francisco Bay area relative to
yesterday's outlook in accordance with the latest guidance. Across Alaska,
anomalous mid-level ridging favors slightly elevated chances for above normal
temperatures for the Mainland during week-2. This pattern may help to dry
fuels
for ongoing wildfire activity, where over 142,000 acres have been burned since
the beginning of the year statewide.

...Excessive Western Heat...
...Weekend Heavy Rainfall Threat for the Midwest/Mid-South...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave under the upper ridge will continue for the
Great Basin to the Coastal Ranges and lower CO River Basin this
weekend and into next week with temperatures 10-20F above normal
each day with locally higher readings possible. Several daily
temperature records are possible each day primarily over the
western Great Basin through interior California to Arizona.

Meanwhile, expect a heavy rainfall threat will emerge by the
weekend for parts of the eastern Plains/Mississippi Valley and
Midwest/Ohio Valley as fueled by return/pooling Gulf Moisture and
instability along with lingering upper trough support and surface
frontal system passages. Slow overall pattern/system translations
and reinforcements suggest a threat for repeat/training cells that
may offer a local runoff problem with main weekend focus over the
Midwest/Mid-South.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread in the wake of Elsa remains
lower than normal over much of the lower 48 states through medium
range time scales in a slowly evolving pattern with seemingly
above normal predictability. The WPC medium range product suite
was primarily derived from a blend of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF/NAEFS ensembles along with the 13
UTC National Blend of Models. This broad composite tends to
mitigate smaller scale guidance differences consistent with
lingering uncertainties. The latest 12 UTC guidance overall
remains in line with this scenario.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN NEVADA INTO SOUTH-CENTRAL
IDAHO...

Expanded the elevated area slightly farther east in Wyoming based on
12Z forecast guidance, otherwise no changes to the elevated and
critical fire weather areas.

Added additional isolated dry thunderstorm areas from north-central
Washington to far northwest Montana and from northeast Oregon into
west-central Montana. The majority of thunderstorm activity during
the afternoon and evening is expected to be in British Columbia.
However, there will likely be ample instability across northern
Washington, Idaho, and Montana and there may be sufficient forcing
for a few storms south of the border.

Later Thursday night, elevated storms are possible from northeast
Oregon into west-central Montana ahead of a shortwave trough moving
across the Northwest. Thermodynamic profiles appear to be similar to
this morning when hundreds of lighting flashes occurred across the
northern Rockies with numerous new fire starts reported. This is
somewhat concerning and thus trends will be monitored to see if
scattered lightning coverage appears more likely as the event nears.

..Bentley.. 07/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Wed Jul 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
A second upper-level impulse is expected to move through the Pacific
Northwest/northern Great Basin on the heels of today's disturbance.
Increasing low and mid-level flow over the Great Basin and northern
Rockies will introduce regional fire weather concerns given the
antecedent dry conditions and receptive fuels. A few isolated dry
thunderstorms will also be possible late Thursday afternoon across
parts of the northern/central Rockies.

...Great Basin...
Surface pressure falls are expected through the day across the
northern Great Basin as the upper-level wave approaches the region
with surface winds increasing to 15-20 mph in response. A belt of
stronger mid-level flow should become established from roughly
northern CA into southeast ID by late afternoon. Deep boundary-layer
mixing will help downward transport of 25-35 mph winds and support a
corridor of critical wind speeds. Recent ensemble guidance suggests
this corridor is most likely to occur from northwest NV into
southeast ID, though 20+ mph winds may occur just outside of this
strip and in proximity to any terrain features. With RH values in
the teens likely and receptive fuels in place, critical fire weather
conditions are expected within this corridor surrounded by elevated,
to perhaps briefly critical, conditions.

...Southern Montana...
A surface trough/weak cold front is expected to progress southward
along the northern High Plains through the day Thursday. Breezy
post-frontal winds up to 15 mph are likely with gusts up to 20-25
mph possible depending on the depth of boundary-layer mixing. Dry
continental air and diurnal warming/mixing will support RH values in
the teens across the region. Although some areas have received
recent rainfall, the latest fuel analyses indicate fine fuel
moisture is generally below 10%, which should be sufficient for at
least a low-end fire weather concern. The coverage of elevated
conditions is uncertain due to spread in short and medium range
guidance, so further refinement to the risk area is possible in
subsequent updates.

...Central Rockies...
Forecast soundings from WY and northwest CO show well-mixed boundary
layers under a plume of mid-level moisture that may support modest,
but sufficient, instability for dry thunderstorms. The combination
of lift ahead of the wave and orographic ascent will favor isolated
storm coverage, and fuels across this region are generally
receptive. Isolated to scattered convection is possible further
south and east across central CO and eastern WY, but rainfall across
these regions has mitigated fuel readiness.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed July 07 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 13 - 17 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical model solutions forecast subtropical ridging across
the southwestern and southeastern CONUS. A weakness in this subtropical
ridging
is predicted over the central CONUS, punctuated by a mean trough forecast over
the western Great Lakes. Ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
likely for the northeastern CONUS ahead of this trough. Ensemble means from
the
GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models show a persistent trough or closed low near
the Alaska Panhandle. Above normal heights are generally forecast farther to
the north and west across most of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians.

Enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures are indicated across much
of the West and Northern Plains, under a predicted ridge and positive 500-hPa
height anomalies. However, a cooling trend is likely for the Pacific Northwest
as a trough is forecast to develop near the coast. Below normal temperatures
are favored from the Southern Plains to parts of the Southwest underneath a
predicted weakness in subtropical ridging. Above normal temperatures are
likely
across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states ahead of a mean trough forecast
over the western Great Lakes. Conversely, below normal temperatures are
favored
for the Alaska Panhandle associated with a persistent mid-level trough or
closed low forecast nearby. Above normal temperature probabilities are
elevated
across much of Mainland Alaska underneath predicted above normal heights.

Below normal precipitation is favored for the eastern Aleutians and across
much
of Mainland Alaska, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Predicted
troughing leads to elevated chances of above normal precipitation across the
Alaska Panhandle. Below normal precipitation is likely for the northwestern
CONUS into the Northern Plains, under a predicted ridge. Above normal
precipitation is favored from the Southwest and parts of the Southern Plains
underneath a predicted weakness in the subtropical ridging. Enhanced
probabilities of above normal precipitation are indicated for parts of the
Middle and Upper Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast,
associated with a mean trough predicted over the east-central CONUS.
Conversely, a drier than normal pattern is likely for parts of the Southeast
underneath predicted subtropical ridging.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 25% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 15 - 21 2021

During the week 2 period, 500-hPa ridging across the West is forecast to build
northeastward over the Northern Plains. In its wake, heights are generally
predicted to lower across the Pacific Northwest, relative to the 6-10 day
period. A mean trough is forecast to shift eastward across the Great Lakes
while a weakness in the subtropical ridge is forecast to continue across the
Rio Grande Valley. A trough and associated below normal heights are forecast
to
persist near the Alaska Panhandle throughout most of week-2. Near to slightly
above normal heights are favored across the Mainland ahead of a developing
trough forecast near the Bering Strait.

Above normal temperatures are favored to persist across much of the West.
However, the greatest confidence for increased heat shifts eastward to the
Northern Plains with time as a cooling trend is favored across the Pacific
Northwest. A predicted weakness in subtropical ridging leads to increased odds
of below normal temperatures for much of the Southern Plains as well as parts
of the Southwest and Lower Mississippi Valley. Above normal temperatures
remain
likely across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic ahead of a trough predicted over
the Great Lakes. Near to above normal temperatures are favored for much of
Mainland Alaska under weakly positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
temperatures are favored for the Alaska Panhandle near a predicted trough.

Below normal precipitation is likely for much of the northwestern and central
CONUS as an expansive ridge is forecast to shift eastward. Mean troughing
predicted ahead of this ridge leads to elevated probabilities of above normal
precipitation for the Ohio Valley as well as parts of the Middle Mississippi
Valley, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and eastern Great Lakes. Below normal
precipitation is slightly favored farther to the south, across parts of the
Gulf Coast Region and Florida Peninsula, due to mean surface high pressure.
Probabilities of above normal precipitation are elevated for much of the
Southwest and the Rio Grande Valley due to the potential advection of
monsoonal
moisture. Above normal precipitation remains favored for much of the Alaska
Panhandle near persistent troughing. As a separate trough is forecast to
develop near the Bering Strait during week-2, a trend toward a wetter pattern
is likely across northwestern Mainland Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 30%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
fairly good agreement among dynamical model guidance.


FORECASTER: Scott H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Elsa to produce gusty winds, heavy rain, and isolated tornadoes
across parts of southeast Georgia and South Carolina tonight,
before pushing into the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday and Northeast by
Friday...

...High Risk for Excessive Rainfall and the potential for
life-threatening flash flooding found throughout portions of the
middle and lower Texas Coast...

...Dangerous heat continues throughout much of the West, expanding
into the Central Plains on Friday...

Tropical Storm Elsa made landfall late this morning along the
North Florida Gulf Coast and is continuing to track northward
through northern Florida and into southern Georgia by tonight.
Elsa is expected to produce damaging wind gusts and heavy rain
over southeast Georgia and the Lowcountry of South Carolina
through early Thursday morning. Rainfall totals up to 8 inches
across this region could lead to considerable flash and urban
flooding. A few isolated tornadoes are also possible. By Thursday,
impacts from Elsa are forecast to shift into eastern North
Carolina and the Mid-Atlantic, before reaching the Northeast and
southern New England by Friday. Additional pockets of heavy rain
and isolated instances of flash flooding can be expected between
the Mid-Atlantic and New England, with periods of gusty winds
found along coastal regions to the east of where the center of
Elsa tracks. Please refer to the National Hurricane Center for
more information and the latest on Tropical Storm Elsa.

Meanwhile, an abundance of tropical moisture and very little
upper-level steering flow has produced an environment ripe for
torrential downpours throughout parts of South Texas this evening
and into Thursday. As much as 5 to 10 inches of additional
rainfall is possible across this region, with a Moderate to High
Risk of Excessive Rainfall along the middle and lower Texas Coast.
Some areas have already received 8+ inches of rain over the last
few days, which has severely compromised soils and low-lying areas
prone to flooding. Widespread flash flooding is likely, with
life-threatening situations possible. Rain chances are expected to
continue through at least Friday afternoon.

Farther north, a frontal boundary sliding eastward across the
Great Lakes and into the Northeast will support showers and
thunderstorms this evening capable of producing heavy rainfall
and/or severe weather. The threat for flash flooding is forecast
to increase  across the Northeast on Thursday as the approaching
frontal boundary begins to interact with moisture associated with
Elsa. The western portion of this boundary could also bring the
threat for severe thunderstorms to parts of the Northern Plains
tonight and Thursday, shifting into the Central Plains and Middle
Mississippi Valley by Friday.

Excessive heat continues across much of the Western U.S. as
daytime highs soar into the 90s and lower 100s through the end of
this week, with more daily records possible. Excessive Heat
Warnings, Watches, and Heat Advisories remain in effect across
central California, the Southwest, and parts of the
central/northern Great Basin. High temperatures into the upper 90s
and close the century mark are forecast to shift into the Central
Plains on Friday ahead of an approaching cold front, potentially
reaching into record territory as well. For parts of the Northwest
and Great Basin, the combined hot and dry conditions may lead to
an elevated to critical risk for fire weather this evening and
Thursday. Red Flag Warnings are in effect.

...Excessive Western Heat...
...Weekend Heavy Rainfall Threat for the Midwest/Mid-South...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave under the upper ridge will continue for the
Great Basin to the Coastal Ranges and lower CO River Basin this
weekend and into next week with temperatures 10-20F above normal
each day with locally higher readings possible. Several daily
temperature records are possible each day primarily over the
western Great Basin through interior California to Arizona.

Meanwhile, expect a heavy rainfall threat will emerge by the
weekend for parts of the eastern Plains/Mississippi Valley and
Midwest/Ohio Valley as fueled by return/pooling Gulf Moisture and
instability along with lingering upper trough support and surface
frontal system passages. Slow overall pattern/system translations
and reinforcements suggest a threat for repeat/training cells that
may offer a local runoff problem with main weekend focus over the
Midwest/Mid-South.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread in the wake of Elsa remains
lower than normal over much of the lower 48 states through medium
range time scales in a slowly evolving pattern with seemingly
above normal predictability. The WPC medium range product suite
was primarily derived from a blend of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF/NAEFS ensembles along with the 13
UTC National Blend of Models. This broad composite tends to
mitigate smaller scale guidance differences consistent with
lingering uncertainties. The latest 12 UTC guidance overall
remains in line with this scenario.

...Excessive Western Heat Persists into Next Week...
...Heavy Rainfall Threat Returns to the Midwest by the Middle of
Next Week...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave under the upper ridge will continue for the
Great Basin to the Coastal Ranges and lower CO River Basin into
next week with temperatures 10-20F above normal through Tuesday
with locally higher readings possible. Several daily high
temperature records are likely through Tuesday primarily over the
Great Basin through interior California to Arizona.

Meanwhile, expect a heavy rainfall threat to persist over the
Midwest and focus over the lower MS Valley on Sunday as fueled by
return/pooling Gulf Moisture and instability along with lingering
upper trough support and surface frontal system passages. Then, by
the middle of next week the next Midwest system looks to bring
heavy rainfall to the upper MS Valley which has been rather wet
over the past few weeks.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread into next week are low in a
slowly evolving pattern with mean Midwest trough/low and the
western ridge suppressing south and west to southern Cal early
next week. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived for Days 3-5 from a blend of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian with Days 5-7 then focusing on the 18Z GEFS
and 12Z ECENS means. This broad composite mitigates smaller scale
guidance differences for shortwave activity over the Northwest
coming into the mean Midwest trough.

western ridge suppressing south and west to southern Cal early
next week. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived for Days 3-5 from a blend of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian with Days 5-7 then focusing on the 18Z GEFS
and 12Z ECENS means. This broad composite mitigates smaller scale
guidance differences for shortwave activity over the Northwest
coming into the mean Midwest trough.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA INTO SOUTHEAST
IDAHO...

...Synopsis...
A series of shortwave troughs will continue propagating along the
northern periphery of an upper-level ridge and across the Pacific
Northwest/northern Rockies today and into tonight. This will lead to
another round of isolated to scattered thunderstorms along the
international border and into the northern and central Rockies.
Additionally, increasing mid and low-level winds associated with the
passage of a shortwave this afternoon will support fire weather
concerns for parts of the northern Great Basin.

...Great Basin and central Rockies...
Surface pressure falls across the inter-mountain West and central
High Plains will help strengthen winds across the northern Great
Basin and southern WY through the day. Sustained winds near 15 mph
are expected, and a corridor of stronger winds near 20 mph remains
likely under a mid-level jet axis. Per recent ensemble guidance,
this axis will most likely reside from northwest NV into parts of
southern ID (though brief periods of critical wind speeds will be
possible elsewhere within the elevated risk area). Deep
boundary-layer mixing by late afternoon may support wind gusts up to
25-35 mph in this corridor. Little to no moisture recovery is
expected at the surface, yielding another day of RH values generally
in the teens. With dry conditions in place across the region,
elevated to critical fire weather conditions remain likely.

...Southern Montana...
The passage of a weak surface trough/cold front will shift winds to
the west/northwest through the day. Increasing downslope winds
coupled with diurnal warming will allow temperatures to climb into
the 90s and RH values fall into the teens and low 20s. Sustained
winds between 15-20 mph over dry fine fuels will support areas of
elevated fire weather conditions this afternoon.

...Pacific Northwest...
Lift is forecast to increase ahead of a progressive shortwave trough
across the Pacific Northwest and southwest Canada this afternoon. An
influx of mid-level moisture into the region will support the
potential for convection this afternoon and late tonight, and PWAT
values between 0.6 to 0.8 inches hint at a possible mixture of dry
and wet storms. Thunderstorm chances are highest on the Canadian
side of the border, but fuels across the Northwest are very
receptive with several fires recently started by lightning strikes
in the past 24 hours. Given the fuel status and potential for at
least a few dry thunderstorms, the risk area remains warranted.

...Central Rockies - Dry Thunderstorm...
Mid-level moisture currently in place over WY/northern CO (sampled
by the 00z RIW sounding) is on the fringe of monsoonal moisture that
is moving northward on the western edge of a mid-level high. While
moisture quality may degrade through the day, it should be
sufficient to support at least isolated convection this afternoon.
Fuels across this region are generally receptive, and forecast PWAT
values near 0.5-0.7 inches with dry boundary layers will favor dry
thunderstorms.

...California/Nevada...
Early morning GOES precipitable water imagery shows a plume of
monsoonal moisture gradually shifting northward through southern CA.
This moisture plume was sampled by the NKX and VEF 00z soundings,
which will remain over the region over the next 24 hours. Strong
diurnal heating through the day will result in profiles featuring
deep, well-mixed boundary layers with 200-300 J/kg MUCAPE by late
afternoon. Although synoptic forcing for ascent will be weak,
boundary-layer heating and orographic ascent may allow for one or
two isolated dry thunderstorms.

...Tropical Storm Elsa to produce gusty winds and heavy rain from
parts of the Southeast to New England through Friday...

...Significant rainfall and life-threatening flash flooding will
continue through Thursday for portions of the middle and lower
Texas Coast...

...Dangerous heat continues throughout much of the West, expanding
into the Central Plains on Friday...

Tropical Storm Elsa, currently moving through the Southeast this
morning, will continue to bring tropical storm force winds and
heavy rainfall to portions of southeastern Georgia and the
lowcountry of South Carolina today with rainfall totals of 3-5
inches, and locally higher, which may result in considerable flash
and urban flooding. Through Friday, Elsa is expected to track
along the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coast bringing tropical storm
conditions as far north as southern New England. From eastern
North Carolina northward into the Northeast, rainfall totals of 1
to 3 inches, with locally higher amounts, are possible leading to
a threat for flash and urban flooding. A couple of tornadoes
cannot be ruled out either, especially for parts of the coastal
Carolinas. Please refer to the National Hurricane Center for the
latest information regarding Tropical Storm Elsa.

Meanwhile, an abundance of tropical moisture and very little
upper-level steering flow has produced an environment ripe for
significant rainfall throughout parts of South Texas which will
continue through Thursday. As much as 5 inches, isolated higher,
of additional rainfall is possible across this region, with a
Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall continuing along the middle
and lower Texas Coast. Some areas have already received 8+ inches
of rain over the last few days, which has severely compromised
soils and low-lying areas prone to flooding. Widespread flash
flooding is likely, with life-threatening situations possible.
Rain chances are expected to continue through at least Friday as
well.

Farther north, a frontal boundary sliding eastward through the
Ohio Valley and into the Northeast will support showers and
thunderstorms on Thursday. The threat for excessive rainfall is
forecast to increase across the Northeast on Thursday as the
approaching frontal boundary begins to interact with moisture
associated with Elsa. The western portion of this boundary could
also bring the threat for severe thunderstorms to parts of the
Northern Plains on Thursday, shifting into the Central Plains and
Middle Mississippi Valley by Friday. Heavy to excessive rainfall
is also possible on Friday across parts of the mid-Mississippi
Valley.

Excessive heat will continue across much of the Western U.S. as
daytime highs soar well into the 90s and lower 100s through the
end of this week, with more daily records possible. Widespread
Excessive Heat Warnings, and some heat advisories, remain in
effect across interior California, the Southwest, and parts of the
central Great Basin. Much above normal temperatures will also
shift into the Rockies and Central Plains by Friday with some
record high values possible. For parts of the Northwest and Great
Basin, the combined hot and dry conditions may lead to an elevated
to critical risk for fire weather Thursday and Friday where Red
Flag Warnings remain in effect.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST IDAHO INTO SOUTHERN
WYOMING AND ADJACENT AREAS OF NORTHEAST UTAH AND NORTHWEST
COLORADO...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave trough currently moving onshore across the
Pacific Northwest is forecast to dig southeastward into the central
Rockies/central High Plains through the day Friday. As this occurs,
mid and upper-level flow will increase over the inter-mountain West,
which should result in strengthening winds at the surface amid deep
boundary-layer mixing. This will introduce a fire weather threat to
the region given the dry, receptive fuels in place. The trough
passage will also support dry thunderstorm concerns for parts of the
central Rockies.

...Inter-mountain West...
Increasing west to northwest winds in the 850-600 mb layer are
forecast to increase to 25-45 mph across eastern ID into southern WY
through the day Friday. Deep mixing will help transport these winds
to the surface and aid in sustaining winds between 15-25 mph across
the northeastern Great Basin into parts of the central High Plains.
Despite an influx of monsoonal moisture aloft, dry boundary layers
and diurnal heating will yield RH values in the single digits to low
teens. Critical conditions appear most likely within the Snake River
Valley in eastern ID and across southern WY where terrain influences
(overlapping with the axis of stronger winds aloft) will result in
the driest/windiest conditions. Frequent wind gusts up to 35-40 mph
are expected in these areas, though gusts upwards of 45-50 mph
appear possible given sufficiently deep boundary-layer mixing.

...Colorado...
The approach of the shortwave trough will not only provide synoptic
lift across the central Rockies, but will also allow for cooling
aloft and steepen mid-level lapse rates. While CO will be on the
fringe of the better monsoonal moisture, modest moisture and
steepening lapse rates will be sufficient to support 250-500 J/kg
MUCAPE over the state. PWAT values between 0.4-0.6 inches suggest
dry thunderstorms are likely. While thunderstorms are expected
across much of the central Rockies, the risk area is confined to
locations with more receptive fuels. Additional dry thunderstorm
chances exist further southwest across AZ and into the Sierra
Nevada, but confidence in the propensity of dry thunderstorms
(versus wetting storms) is too low for additional risk areas in this
outlook.

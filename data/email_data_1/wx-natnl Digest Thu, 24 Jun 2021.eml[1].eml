Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1139 AM CDT Wed Jun 23 2021

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

No changes to the ongoing forecast. Two disturbances are evident in
water vapor imagery in eastern California and central Arizona. These
features will help initiate thunderstorms in the Great Basin today.
Areas of cloud cover may slow development in some areas. More
isolated coverage can be expected to the north and west. See the
previous discussion for more details.

..Wendt.. 06/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0203 AM CDT Wed Jun 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper low along the West Coast will move little as mid-level
ridging lingers over the Rockies and High Plains. Mid-level
moisture, within deep southerly flow ahead of the low, will move
northward across the Four Corners and Great Basin. Dry thunderstorm
activity is expected across much of the Southwest, while elevated
fire weather conditions will develop across Wyoming.

...Great Basin and Southwest Dry Thunder...
Ahead of the stalled upper low, moisture will spread north into
portions of the Great Basin and Southwest. Forcing for ascent will
gradually increase through the morning, as a shortwave trough along
the eastern edge of the upper low moves into southern Arizona.
Thunderstorm activity will increase through the day, with initiation
expected first along the crests of the higher terrain, before
gradually expanding through much of the Four Corners and Great
Basin. Storm coverage should remain isolated, though local coverage
across Arizona and southern Utah may become scattered, given greater
upper-air support with the approaching shortwave trough.

Model soundings show deep and well-mixed boundary layers beneath the
plume of mid-level moisture supporting isolated dry lightning
strikes across much of Arizona, western Colorado, Nevada, and Utah.
Fuels in the region remain highly susceptible to lightning
ignitions, necessitating dry thunder probabilities. Uncertainty
increases with northward extent across portions of Oregon and Idaho.
Here, greater PWAT values and scattered storm coverage may reduce
ignition efficiency. However, the threat for lightning in volatile
fuels suggests enough concern exists for dry thunder probabilities.

...Southern Wyoming...
Lee troughing will strengthen through the day across the central
High Plains, as flow aloft increases over the Rockies. Surface
pressure gradients will drive westerly winds down the leeward slopes
through southern and central Wyoming. Adiabatic warming and drying
will allow relative humidity values to drop below 20% during the
afternoon. The combination of gusty winds near 15-20 mph and low RH
will support elevated to near critical fire weather conditions.

...Lee of the Cascades...
On the backside of a departing mid-level jet, westerly flow will
develop along the southern Cascades. Enhancement of the flow along
the lee slopes will increase surface winds to around 15-20 mph.
These gusty winds will overlap with a warm and dry airmass
containing surface RH below 30%. Locally elevated conditions may
occur for a few hours where fuels are fully cured.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 23 2021

SYNOPSIS: Excessive heat is likely to be ongoing across much of the West and
portions of the Great Plains at the beginning of the period tied to mid-level
high pressure extending along the Rockies. The high is forecast to weaken
through mid-week, possibly bringing some respite to heat concerns by
Independence Day. A cold front may stall across the Lower Mississippi Valley
early in the period and yield heavy rainfall potential. Mid-level low pressure
over the Aleutians and high pressure over the Yukon could cause favorable fire
weather conditions across the Eastern Interior of Alaska.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Intermountain Region,
Northern Rockies, and Northern Plains, Thu-Fri, July 1-2.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Pacific Northwest,
Northern
California, Northern Intermountain Region, Great Basin, Northern and Central
Rockies, and Northern Plains, Thu-Sat, July 1-3.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the West and portions of the
Northern
Plains, Central Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley, Thu-Wed, July 1-7.

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of East Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas,
Thu-Sat, July 1-3.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY JUNE 26 - WEDNESDAY JUNE 30:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!uhjfRP-HN7KcLAAaKV-jKP9Wcp89Nll04GmTkxUWHJlKeVDnGAvW3bRDTmtw-9rr75w-gAwL$

FOR THURSDAY JULY 01 - WEDNESDAY JULY 07: Model guidance consistently shows
500-hPa height anomalies of 12-18 dam over the Northern Rockies near the

heat. A high risk of excessive heat is posted for parts of the Northern
Intermountain Region, Northern Rockies, and Northern Plains on July 1st and
2nd
where reforecast guidance supports a >60% chance of daily high temperatures
exceeding the 85th climatological percentile. The high risk region also aligns
well with the National Blend of Models forecast anticipating daily record high
temperatures being approached or surpassed on these dates. Across lower
elevations within the high risk area daytime highs are likely to be in the
triple digits, while higher elevations could still see temperature reach the
mid 90s. A moderate risk of excessive heat exists for areas east of the
Pacific
Intercoastal range from the Olympic Peninsula southward through the Bay Area
and extends eastward through northwestern Colorado and near the border of
Minnesota and the Dakotas on July 1-3. The moderate risk area coincides with
reforecast guidance showing a >40% chance of maximum temperatures being in the
top 15% of climatology and also sees some possible record highs (e.g. Salt
Lake
City forecast to match their record of 103 degrees F on the 2nd, Grand Forks
possibly besting their record by a degree at 95 degrees F on the 2nd).



The greatest mid-level height departures shift westward with time, becoming
focused over the North Pacific by the middle of Week-2, as the ridging
retrogrades westward. Nevertheless, a slight risk of excessive heat is
maintained across much of the West and portions of the Northern and Central
Plains and the Upper Mississippi Valley throughout Week-2, with reforecast
guidance generally highlighting the Northern Tier to have the greatest signals
relative to climatology. Heat-driven impacts are expected to include:
persistence and worsening of ongoing drought over the West, continued
emergence
of flash drought over the Northern Plains, locally elevated fire weather
conditions amidst the hot and dry air mass for much of the West, and direct
health risks for people, pets and livestock across the highlighted regions.
Heat remains the top weather-related killer in the U.S., so consider reviewing
the National Weather Service's heat safety page to help beat the heat:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat__;!!DZ3fjg!uhjfRP-HN7KcLAAaKV-jKP9Wcp89Nll04GmTkxUWHJlKeVDnGAvW3bRDTmtw-9rr74GMDniG$ .



Mid-level heights show a weakness across the southeastern quarter of the
CONUS,
potentially opening up the south-central and eastern portions of the Lower-48
to heavy precipitation concerns. The Weather Prediction Center surface
analysis
on June 30th (Day 7) shows a cold front extending from the Chicago area though
the Lower Mississippi Valley. Model guidance shows the potential for the
southern portion of this cold front to stall across the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley and interact with Gulf moisture during the early part
of Week-2. As a result, a slight risk for heavy rain exists across parts of
East Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley on July 1-3. Soil moisture
observations for this region are generally in the 70th through 90th historical
percentile, so localized flooding could occur but is not anticipated to be
widespread enough to include a flooding possible designation. There are also
some modest heavy rain signals with the northern portion of the cold front,
but
this portion of the boundary appears more progressive so no heavy rain is
indicated outside of the South.



Tropical cyclone activity over the East Pacific has been conditioning the
monsoonal region for what is hopefully a robust monsoon year to help with the
ongoing drought. Dolores brought some moisture to the region last week, while
model guidance suggests a moisture surge up the Gulf of California could occur
during Week-2 in association with the disturbance currently being monitored
for
cyclogenesis off the southern Coast of Mexico. Some consideration was given to
a flooding possible hazard, but ensemble mean rainfall totals over 3-day
periods fail to surpass a half inch. Tropical cyclone activity over the East
Pacific appears likely to wane beyond Independence Day as the suppressed phase
of a Kelvin wave crosses the Pacific, so any flooding considerations may need
to wait until the second half of July as climatological precipitation and
moisture ramps up.



Model guidance tilts generally cool and wet across western Alaska during
Week-2
tied to a mid-level low forecast over the Aleutians and high pressure over the
Yukon. While this would serve to wet fuels for western Alaska, it also
introduces an increased threat for thunderstorm activity. Further east drier
conditions appear likely, with a possible Chinook setup along the Alaska Range
bringing warm, dry, and breezy weather across the Eastern Interior that could
increase fire concerns during the first part of Week-2.

...Dangerous Heat Wave to build with Daily to Monthly Record
Temperatures across the Northwest/West...
...Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Rockies/Plains to
Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast...

18Z Update:  Similar to yesterday's 12Z guidance, the
deterministic models and the ensemble means are in above average
agreement through Monday, with the exception of the CMC that is
more suppressed with the Intermountain West upper ridge and
stronger/farther east with the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley trough.
Therefore, the CMC breaks down the heatwave across the
northwestern U.S. quicker than the model consensus.  There was a
bit of an upward trend in rainfall amounts across the central
Plains compared to the prior forecast given the presence of a slow
moving surface low/front intercepting deep moisture from the
western Gulf of Mexico.  The forecast was primarily derived from a
blend of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z UKMET/6Z GFS along with some previous
WPC continuity, and some use of the GEFS/EC means by early next
week owing to more model differences on individual shortwave
impulses.  The previous forecast discussion is appended below.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean,
12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF, 12 UTC NAEFS/ECENS means, the 01 UTC National
Blend of Models and WPC continuity in an overall pattern with
above average continuity and predictability. Forecast spread and
run-to-run variability has improved compared to the last few days
and a composite seems to mitigate much of the lingering and less
predictable small-mid scale variances. Newer 00 UTC guidance so
far remains in line with the WPC composite. However, recent
Canadian runs are displaced east of most guidance with placement
of the central U.S. trough and western Atlantic ridge, so they
remain discounted.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest this weekend and the heat wave will expand over the West
into next week. Temperatures will soar to 20-30 degrees above
normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great Basin/Rockies.
Numerous daily to some monthly records are likely from the Pacific
Northwest and interior California to the north/central Great Basin
and Northern Rockies, with temperatures peaking over 100F to 110+F
for interior sections of the West. Little to no rainfall is
expected to ease this excessive heat this forecast period, growing
drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a robust upper trough will dig and settle into the
north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and slow
moving front to stretch from the south-central to northeastern
U.S. this period. This will invite deep moisture return and
pooling. Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the
front with an elongated and focused zone from the Southern
Rockies/Plains northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio
Valley and the Northeast. Episodes of cell training and flooding
are likely across some of these areas with overall progression
slowed as broadly sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a
strong western Atlantic ridge to the east. Also, there is also
some signal for tropical moisture to feed into southern Florida to
fuel convection early-mid next week.

...Much above average temperatures expected over the Northwest,
leading into a likely record hot weekend...

...Widespread Heavy Rains, localized Flash Flooding and Severe
Thunderstorms possible Thursday and Friday from the Central
Plains, into the Mid Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes region...

...A Fire Weather Threat from Lightning Thursday and Friday across
northern California, the Great Basin and the Southwest...

...Wet Season weather across Florida over the next two days will
provide relief from dry conditions...

An increasingly amplified mid to upper level pattern across the
northeast Pacific will be leading to a building upper High across
southwest Canada and into the Pacific Northwest.  This will be
setting the stage for the beginning of a potential historic heat
wave for the Northwest this weekend.  While record high
temperature are not expected over the next two days over the
Northwest, the high temperatures will still be 10 to 20 degrees
above average and lead into the weekend when numerous record highs
are likely. Excessive Heat Watches are currently in effect across
all of Washington State, much of Oregon and into far northern
California.

Above average temperatures also likely through much of the Plains
Thursday, with a significant cool down likely for portions of the
Northern and Central High Plains on Friday as a cold front presses
southward across these regions.  High temperatures Thursday are
forecast to be 10 to 15 degrees above average, followed by highs
Friday 10 to 15 degrees below average across these regions.

The frontal boundary providing relief from hot temperatures over
the Northern to Central High Plains on Friday will also be a focus
for widespread heavy rains, localized flash flooding and a severe
thunderstorms threat both Thursday and Friday from the Central
Plains, northeastward into the Middle Mississippi Valley and Great
Lakes region. Much above average levels of moisture along and
ahead of this front and the expected very slow movement of the
front will support the active thunderstorm pattern and potential
for heavy rains, flash flooding and severe weather.

A well defined mid to upper level low off the central California
coast is expected to move only slowly eastward over the next two
days. This system will transport above average levels of moisture
to its east and northeast supporting increased scattered
thunderstorm activity from northern California, eastward into the
Great Basin and portions of the Southwest.  There is not expected
to be much rainfall from these "dry" thunderstorms but lightning
will still be active.  This will pose a threat of lightning
induced wild fires over the next 2 days across these areas.

Across Florida, a wet season weather pattern will be in place over
the next several days. This will bring the potential for heavy
rains across the state, especially the central to southern
portions of the peninsula.  These rains will provide relief to
portions of the peninsula that are currently experiencing
abnormally dry to moderate drought conditions as per the latest
Drought Monitor.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed June 23 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 29 - JUL 03, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical model solutions forecast an amplified circulation
pattern with a trough over the North Pacific, centered over the Aleutians, and
a ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the eastern North Pacific
and western North America. Downstream, a trough is predicted over the
east-central CONUS, and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over
the Northeast. The Canadian ensemble mean predicts more extensive positive
500-hPa height anomalies over the CONUS with less troughing and was given less
weight in the manual blend of 500-hPa height forecasts.

Near to below normal temperatures are favored over much of western and
south-central Mainland Alaska, due to the predicted trough over the Aleutians
and associated potential storm system development and increased cloud cover.
Predicted southwesterly flow favors above normal temperatures for parts of
eastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle. A predicted trough over the
east-central CONUS and near zero 500-hPa height anomalies favor enhanced
probabilities of below normal temperatures for eastern areas of the Southwest,
the Central and Southern Plains, the Central and Lower Mississippi Valley, and
the Southeast. Above normal temperatures are likely over the western CONUS,
the
Northern Plains, and the Northeast, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies
and
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the Aleutians and anomalous southerly flow enhance
probabilities of above normal precipitation over the eastern Aleutians as well
as western and northern Mainland Alaska. Below normal precipitation is favored
for eastern interior areas of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, under
a
predicted ridge. A predicted ridge and anomalous northerly flow increase
probabilities of below normal precipitation from the Pacific Northwest, across
the Central and Northern Plains states into the Upper Mississippi Valley and
western Great Lakes region.  A predicted trough over the east-central CONUS
and
anomalous southerly surface flow around high pressure over the Atlantic favor
above normal precipitation from the Gulf Coast states northeastward across
most
of the eastern CONUS, excluding the Florida Peninsula and Southeast Atlantic
coast, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool. An enhanced
southwestern monsoon and associated above normal precipitation are favored for
much of the Southwest, supported by dynamical model forecasts. There is some
uncertainty in the areal extent of above normal precipitation, as the GEFS
ensemble mean predicts more extensive precipitation across the Southwest
compared to the ECMWF ensemble mean.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by some
differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 01 - 07 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist but somewhat deamplify, as ensemble spread and uncertainty
increase.
In particular the trough over the Aleutians deamplifies significantly during
the week 2 period, relative to the 6-10 day period.

Below normal temperatures are favored for southwestern Mainland Alaska,
associated with a mean trough over the Aleutians and potential development of
storm systems leading to increased cloud cover, while above normal
temperatures
are favored for parts of northeastern Mainland Alaska, under anomalous
southerly flow. Above normal temperatures are also likely for the Alaska
Panhandle, as well as the western CONUS, the Central and Northern Plains, and
much of the Great Lakes and Northeast regions, under positive 500-hPa height
anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favored over most of the remainder of
the CONUS, from eastern areas of the Southwest monsoon region across the
Southern Plains and Central and Lower Mississippi Valley into the Southeast
region, under the predicted trough and near zero 500-hPa height anomalies.

Probabilities of above normal precipitation are enhanced over western Mainland
Alaska due to predicted troughing over the Aleutians. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are increased for eastern interior Mainland Alaska
and the Alaska Panhandle, under a predicted ridge. Below normal precipitation
is likely for the Pacific Northwest, Northern and Central Plains, and western
Great Lakes region, associated with the predicted ridge over the eastern North
Pacific and western North America. Near to above normal precipitation is
favored across the western and central Gulf Coast region and much of the
eastern CONUS, consistent with the ERF consolidation tool and troughing over
the east-central CONUS. An active monsoon and associated above normal
precipitation are favored in week 2 across most of the Southwest, supported by
dynamical model forecasts and the ERF consolidation tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Wed Jun 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

The dry thunderstorm area has been reduced. Based on current
observations and model forecasts, the convection across parts of the
southern/eastern Great Basin will continue to move northward today
and tonight. Cloud cover is anticipated to be present tomorrow
morning, particularly for parts of northern Utah into northwest
Colorado. This should suppress convective development much in parts
of those areas. Thunderstorms in central/eastern Utah into western
Colorado are likely, but most will be wetting with a continued
increase in low/mid-level moisture overnight into tomorrow. The
highest probability for isolated dry thunderstorms will exist in
parts of western Utah into northern Nevada and northern California.

..Wendt.. 06/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CDT Wed Jun 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper low along the West Coast will become cutoff, as the
mid-level flow across the central and eastern CONUS becomes more
zonal. The slow-moving low will advect deep moisture into much of
the western CONUS, potentially supporting widespread thunderstorms
and precipitation. Lightning over dry fuels will become a concern
given the available moisture, but uncertainty on storm coverage
remains high.

...Dry Thunder...
With plentiful mid-level moisture in place ahead of the upper low,
thunderstorms are again expected across much of the Western US
day2/Thursday. Cloud debris and showers from Day1/Wednesday
convection will likely impact destabilization across portions of the
Great Basin early in the day. CAMs remain uncertain on the degree to
which diurnal heating will be reduced, offering two outcomes. Should
cloud cover be limited, scattered to numerous storms appear possible
with an increased risk for lightning over dry fuels. If widespread
cloud cover and showers persist, the potential for destabilization
and subsequent lightning may be seriously degraded. An additional
complicating factor will be the increasing PWAT values above 0.75
inches favoring wetter storms. With the uncertainty in mind, a broad
area of isolated dry thunder probabilities will be maintained with
the understanding that mesoscale details remain difficult to see for
now. Refinement in the area will be necessary, but the potential
threat for lightning over dry fuels across much of the West warrants
the dry thunder delineation.

...Dangerous Heat Wave to build with Daily to Monthly Record
Temperatures across the Northwest/West...
...Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Rockies/Plains to
Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast...

18Z Update:  Similar to yesterday's 12Z guidance, the
deterministic models and the ensemble means are in above average
agreement through Monday, with the exception of the CMC that is
more suppressed with the Intermountain West upper ridge and
stronger/farther east with the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley trough.
Therefore, the CMC breaks down the heatwave across the
northwestern U.S. quicker than the model consensus.  There was a
bit of an upward trend in rainfall amounts across the central
Plains compared to the prior forecast given the presence of a slow
moving surface low/front intercepting deep moisture from the
western Gulf of Mexico.  The forecast was primarily derived from a
blend of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z UKMET/6Z GFS along with some previous
WPC continuity, and some use of the GEFS/EC means by early next
week owing to more model differences on individual shortwave
impulses.  The previous forecast discussion is appended below.
/Hamrick

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean,
12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF, 12 UTC NAEFS/ECENS means, the 01 UTC National
Blend of Models and WPC continuity in an overall pattern with
above average continuity and predictability. Forecast spread and
run-to-run variability has improved compared to the last few days
and a composite seems to mitigate much of the lingering and less
predictable small-mid scale variances. Newer 00 UTC guidance so
far remains in line with the WPC composite. However, recent
Canadian runs are displaced east of most guidance with placement
of the central U.S. trough and western Atlantic ridge, so they
remain discounted.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest this weekend and the heat wave will expand over the West
into next week. Temperatures will soar to 20-30 degrees above
normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great Basin/Rockies.
Numerous daily to some monthly records are likely from the Pacific
Northwest and interior California to the north/central Great Basin
and Northern Rockies, with temperatures peaking over 100F to 110+F
for interior sections of the West. Little to no rainfall is
expected to ease this excessive heat this forecast period, growing
drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a robust upper trough will dig and settle into the
north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and slow
moving front to stretch from the south-central to northeastern
U.S. this period. This will invite deep moisture return and
pooling. Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the
front with an elongated and focused zone from the Southern
Rockies/Plains northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio
Valley and the Northeast. Episodes of cell training and flooding
are likely across some of these areas with overall progression
slowed as broadly sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a
strong western Atlantic ridge to the east. Also, there is also
some signal for tropical moisture to feed into southern Florida to
fuel convection early-mid next week.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
230 AM EDT Thu Jun 24 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Jun 27 2021 - 12Z Thu Jul 01 2021

...Dangerous Heat Wave with daily to monthly/all-time record
temperature threat over the Northwest/West...
...Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Rockies/Plains to
Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean,
12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF/ECENS means and the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models in an overall pattern with above average predictability
days 3-5 (Sunday-Tuesday). Shifted blend focus toward the still
compatible ensemble means by days 6/7 amid gradually increasing
forecast spread. Recent Canadian had been quicker to suppress the
hot Intermountain West upper ridge and stronger/farther east with
the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley trough and heavy rainfall focus.
However, the 00 UTC Canadian has shifted more in line with the
rest of guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest this weekend and the heat wave will expand over the West
into next week. Temperatures will soar to 20-30 degrees above
normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great Basin/Rockies.
Numerous daily to some monthly records are likely from the Pacific
Northwest and interior California to the north/central Great Basin
and Northern Rockies, with temperatures peaking over 100F to 110+F
for interior sections of the West. Little rainfall is expected to
ease this excessive heat this forecast period in a pattern with
growing drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a robust upper trough will dig and settle into the
north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and slow
moving front to stretch from the south-central to northeastern
U.S. this period. This will invite deep moisture return and
pooling. Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the
front with an elongated and focused zone from the Southern
Rockies/Plains northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio
Valley and the Northeast. Episodes of cell training and flooding
are likely across some of these areas with overall progression
slowed as broadly sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a
strong western Atlantic ridge to the east. Also, there is also
some signal for tropical moisture to feed into southern Florida to
fuel convection early-mid next week.

...Dangerous Heat Wave with daily to monthly/all-time record
temperature threat over the Northwest/West...
...Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Rockies/Plains to
Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean,
12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF/ECENS means and the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models in an overall pattern with above average predictability
days 3-5 (Sunday-Tuesday). Shifted blend focus toward the still
compatible ensemble means by days 6/7 amid gradually increasing
forecast spread. Recent Canadian had been quicker to suppress the
hot Intermountain West upper ridge and stronger/farther east with
the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley trough and heavy rainfall focus.
However, the 00 UTC Canadian has shifted more in line with the
rest of guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest this weekend and the heat wave will expand over the West
into next week. Temperatures will soar to 20-30 degrees above
normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great Basin/Rockies.
Numerous daily to some monthly records are likely from the Pacific
Northwest and interior California to the north/central Great Basin
and Northern Rockies, with temperatures peaking over 100F to 110+F
for interior sections of the West. Little rainfall is expected to
ease this excessive heat this forecast period in a pattern with
growing drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a robust upper trough will dig and settle into the
north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and slow
moving front to stretch from the south-central to northeastern
U.S. this period. This will invite deep moisture return and
pooling. Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the
front with an elongated and focused zone from the Southern
Rockies/Plains northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio
Valley and the Northeast. Episodes of cell training and flooding
are likely across some of these areas with overall progression
slowed as broadly sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a
strong western Atlantic ridge to the east. Also, there is also
some signal for tropical moisture to feed into southern Florida to
fuel convection early-mid next week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0142 AM CDT Thu Jun 24 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
The persistent upper low near the West Coast will stall and
retrograde west slightly through the day, as mid-level flow over the
eastern and central CONUS becomes mostly zonal. Deep moisture
advecting into the Southwest and Great Basin will result in
widespread showers and thunderstorms. Isolated dry thunderstorms
will be possible over dry fuels. Elsewhere, little overlap between
warm, dry, and windy surface conditions will limit significant fire
weather potential.

..Dry Thunder...
Widespread cloud cover and showers are expected at the beginning of
the period across much of the Great Basin and Southwest. As lift
from the stalled upper low over the West Coast overspreads the
region, a few storms are expected to form by mid morning. PWAT
values have continued to climb over the last several days, with many
western US 00z RAOBS recording values near 0.75 inches. Widespread
cloud debris and precipitation will likely inhibit diurnal heating
across a large are of the southern Great Basin and Southwest.
Despite the more conditional threat, localized pockets of clearing
and heating should result in sufficient instability for additional
storm development through the afternoon. A wetter storm mode
associated with the increasing moisture content will further
decrease the likelihood of dry strikes through the forecast period.
However, given the expected storm coverage and localized pockets of
better buoyancy, at least isolated lightning coverage over dry fuels
appears plausible. The highest probability for isolated dry
thunderstorms will exist in parts of western Utah, into northern
Nevada, and northern California.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CDT Thu Jun 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper low off the California coast is forecast to weaken and
move southeastward, as a strong ridge develops to the north and
west. Plentiful moisture and weak ascent will linger over the Great
Basin supporting isolated thunderstorm activity over dry fuels.
Near-record heat is forecast to develop along the West Coast as the
ridge builds. The very warm conditions may support enhanced
plume-dominated fire activity across the Pacific Northwest and
portions of California where hot, dry and unstable conditions
develop. However, widespread critical fire weather activity is not
anticipated due to limited synoptic-scale overlap of dry/windy
conditions in the lower 48.

...Eastern New Mexico...
Beneath a stronger belt of mid-level flow, westerly surface winds
across central and eastern New Mexico may reach sustained values
near 15 mph through the afternoon. Surface relative humidity values
between 10 and 20% are expected over much of the region. With
minimal precipitation across this area in the last several days,
fuels remain very dry. Locally elevated/critical fire weather
conditions will be possible.

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley into the Western Ohio
Valley through Saturday morning...

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley through Friday
morning...

...Fire weather concerns are forecast across the Northern Great
Basin and Northern California; heat returns to the Pacific
Northwest on Saturday...

A front moving southward across the Upper Midwest will move to the
Great Lakes and stall overnight Thursday through Saturday.  The
boundary will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms over the
Upper Midwest through Saturday.  The WPC has issued a Moderate
Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms. The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger
rivers through Saturday morning.  The excessive rainfall threat
continues over parts of the area and expands eastward into parts
of the Ohio Valley on Friday into Saturday morning.

Moreover, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi
Valley through Friday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail and a few tornadoes. There is a 10% or greater
probability of wind gust of 65 knots or greater over parts of the
Central Plains into the Middle Mississippi Valley.  Additionally,
there is a 10% or greater probability of two-inch or great hail
over parts of the Central Plains through Friday morning.  The
severe thunderstorm threat decreases slightly on Friday into
Saturday.

Meanwhile, a front that extends from the Southeast westward to the
Central Plains will be quasi-stationary through Friday evening
before the boundary starts to dissipate on Saturday. With ample
moisture pooling along the boundary that helps produce showers and
thunderstorms along and near the front through Friday night over
the Southeast and the Gulf Coast States.

Additionally, a plume of moisture surging into the Southwest and
Southern California on start to waning by Thursday evening.
Impulses of upper-level energy moving around an upper-level high
over the U. S. and Mexican border will trigger showers and
thunderstorms over parts of Southern California and the Southwest
ending on Friday morning.  The showers and thunderstorms will
expand into parts of the Great Basin and the Central/Southern
Rockies through Thursday evening. In the meantime, upper-level
energy will come over the top of the upper-level ridge, over the
Pacific, producing showers and thunderstorms over parts of the
Northern High Plains into the Great Basin and Northern/Central
Rockies.  The showers and thunderstorms will expand into the
Northern/Central Plains on Friday.

Elsewhere, dry thunderstorms with isolated lightning strikes will
be possible over the Northern Great Basin and Northern California,
where dry fuels are present, creating a risk for fire weather. Red
Flag Warnings are currently in effect for portions of the Great
Basin with these conditions in place.  On Saturday, an upper-level
ridge will move over the Northwest, this will aid in producing
high temperatures over the region starting on Saturday.  There are
Excessive Heat Warnings and Excessive Heat Watch over the
Northwest and Northern California. The high temperatures over the
region on Saturday will be in the upper 90s and low-to-mid 100s

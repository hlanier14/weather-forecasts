...A long duration and extreme heat wave is set to grip the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Great Basin...

...Continued rounds of showers and potentially severe
thunderstorms anticipated between the Southern Plains and Great
Lakes, generating a significant risk for flash flooding this
weekend...

Oppressive and unprecedented heat will be felt throughout the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Great Basin today, with
record-breaking temperatures lasting through at least the
beginning of next week. The weather pattern responsible is
highlighted by a strong and highly anomalous upper-level ridge
located over far southwestern Canada. This upper-level ridge is
forecast to very slowly meander eastward along the U.S.-Canada
border. Easterly flow underneath the upper-level high will allow
for coastal regions to experience record-breaking temperatures
over the next few days as well. Starting today, high temperatures
will soar 20 to 30 degrees above average throughout Washington and
Oregon, extending into northern Idaho by Sunday. For the
Northwest, this equates to widespread high temperatures in the
upper 90s and triple digits, with highs into the 110s possible
over the Columbia Basin. Dozens of daily record high temperatures
will undoubtedly be set, with monthly and even all-time records in
jeopardy of falling. In short, heat of this magnitude has very
rarely (if ever) been felt throughout this region, especially this
early into the summer season. Seattle, WA and Portland, OR are
just a few examples of places currently forecast to break all-time
high temperature records during this heat wave. Oppressive heat
will also be found throughout portions of northern California and
western Nevada, where triple digit temperatures are expected.
Excessive Heat Warnings/Watches and Heat Advisories have been
issued for nearly the entire Pacific Northwest and northern Great
Basin, as well as parts of California and Nevada. Nighttime
temperatures will remain quite warm and only dip into the 70s
throughout lower elevations of the Northwest, which could
exacerbate the threat of heat related illnesses. Residents are
urged to avoid extended periods of time outdoors, stay hydrated,
and check on vulnerable family members/neighbors. With severe and
extreme drought conditions found throughout much of the West,
elevated fire concerns exist.

Hazardous weather is also likely to impact parts of the central
United States this weekend, in the form of severe thunderstorms
and flash flooding. A slow-moving cold front is expected to become
stationary at times between the Southern Plains and Great Lakes
through Monday morning. Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected
to focus along this frontal boundary and repeat over similar
areas, which will likely lead to compromised soils and an
increased flash flood threat. A Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of
Excessive Rainfall has been issued for today between northern
Texas and southwest Missouri. Widespread rainfall totals over 1
inch, with local amounts up to 5 inches can be expected here. The
heavy rain threat should slowly dissipate by the end of the
weekend, but scattered downpours and instances of flash flooding
will remain a concern on Sunday from the Southern High Plains to
the Middle Mississippi Valley. Flash Flood Watches currently
remain in effect between Lower Michigan and north-central Texas.
Severe weather is also possible today, particularly throughout the
Southern Plains and central/lower Michigan. The Storm Prediction
Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe
thunderstorms for these regions. Damaging wind gusts, large hail,
and isolated tornadoes are possible.

Elsewhere, below average temperatures are forecast throughout the
central and southern High Plains behind a cold front, while warmer
temperatures and increasing humidity returns to the East Coast. In
fact, above average temperatures and highs into the 90s are
forecast throughout the Northeast by Sunday. Isolated and
slow-moving thunderstorms are also expected to impact areas along
the Gulf Coast this weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CDT Wed Jul 21 2021

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments. The
dry thunder area was expanded westward through parts of eastern
Washington for ongoing thunderstorms. Isolated strikes over dry
fuels will be possible through this afternoon. Locally critical fire
weather conditions will be possible across the northwestern Great
Basin where surface winds enhanced by local terrain reach 20-25 mph.
For additional information please see the previous discussion.

..Lyons.. 07/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0123 AM CDT Wed Jul 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will remain centered over the Rockies as a mid-level
trough moves across the Pacific Northwest during the period. Near 50
kt 500 mb flow will overspread the higher terrain areas of the
Pacific Northwest, encouraging some dry and breezy conditions.
Deep-layer ascent and ample moisture ahead of the mid-level trough
will also promote scattered to occasionally widespread thunderstorms
across the Northern Rockies.

...Pacific Northwest...
Afternoon heating/boundary layer mixing will encourage some downward
momentum transport of the stronger flow aloft across the higher
terrain of the Cascades and northern Sierra, with downslope flow
expected along the lee-side of both ranges. 15-20 mph sustained
westerly flow coinciding with 15-20% RH will be common through the
mid and late afternoon hours. Elevated highlights have been
introduced where favorable dry/breezy surface conditions will most
likely overlap receptive fuels for several hours.

...Northern Rockies...
Afternoon heating and large-scale lift of the deep mid-level
moisture (characterized by 1+ inch precipitable water values) will
aid in the development of scattered to numerous thunderstorms across
the Northern Rockies through the afternoon and early overnight
hours. While the higher precipitable water values suggest that
storms will have a larger ratio of wet strikes, dry strikes are
possible on the periphery of storm cores. In addition,  gusty
erratic winds may emanate from the stronger storm cores, potentially
exacerbating fire behavior associated with holdovers or ongoing
active wildfires. Please see the Day 1 Convective Outlook for more
details on the gusty winds/severe threat.

300 PM EDT July 21 2021

SYNOPSIS: At the beginning of week-2, dynamical models are in good agreemen=
t
depicting mid-level high pressure over the east-central contiguous U.S. Thi=
s
favors a broad area with an increased risk for excessive heat throughout th=
e
period, with elevated heat indices being more of a concern across eastern a=
nd
southern portions of the U.S. For the Alaska region, mid-level low pressure=
 is
forecast across the northern Bering Sea favoring anomalously cooler and wet=
ter
conditions over western Alaska. However, pre-defined hazards criteria are n=
ot
expected to be reached.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern and Central
Plains, and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Thu-Sat, Jul 29-31.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Great Plains, Mississippi
Valley, Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and
Southeast, Thu-Wed, Jul 29-Aug 4.

Flooding possible across portions of the Central and Southern Rockies.

favored to slightly weaken as more troughing builds over eastern Canada and
the
northeastern CONUS. This is particularly evident in the ECMWF and Canadian
ensembles which depict negative height anomalies spreading into the Northea=
st
by day-10. Given the overall ridge placement, a slight risk of excessive he=
at
is posted for parts of the Great Plains and eastward through the mid-Atlant=
ic
Coast (excluding much of the Great Lakes and Northeast) for all of week-2,
where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 deg F (95 deg F
across southern portions of the highlighted region). Increased humidity is
also
a concern across the southern and eastern CONUS, where heat risk guidance
depicts elevated probabilities of heat indices above 105 deg F, and possibl=
y
as
high as 110 deg F over parts of the South. A moderate risk of excessive hea=
t
is
highlighted for parts of the Northern and Central Plains and Upper and Midd=

Mississippi Valley on July 29 to 31, where the GEFS reforecast tool depicts=
 at
least a 40% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile. T=

uncalibrated GEFS depicts triple digit heat over the eastern Plains, althou=
gh
it is cautioned that ECMWF ensemble guidance favors noticeably cooler
conditions, indicating maximum temperatures in the low to mid 90s deg F ove=
r
this region. Despite the weaker signal in the ECMWF, the moderate risk is
designated as a result of decreased soil moisture values which would favor
warmer surface temperatures, and reduced heat thresholds across some of the
northern areas of the Plains and Mississippi Valley. The positive height
anomalies across the region are forecast to weaken after day-10 allowing th=
e
moderate risk to be discontinued.



The southwest monsoon is forecast to diminish during week-2 as a result of =
a
more eastward placement of the mid-level ridge center compared to previous
model guidance. However, the uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF guidance still
indicates the potential for convective precipitation over the Rockies on th=
e
backside of the mean ridge axis early in the period. Forecast amounts are
generally less than a half inch in a 3-day period precluding a related heav=
y
precipitation hazard, but localized flash flooding remains a concern. As a
result, the possible flooding hazard is continued in todays outlook across
parts of the Central and Southern Rockies. Flash flooding can occur even in
areas that do not receive any rain, and be a direct result of runoff from
precipitation upstream. Tropical activity is forecast to increase in the Ea=

...Locally heavy rainfall threat through the weekend in an active
Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon pattern...

...Heat will continue over the northern/central Plains into the
Upper Midwest...

1830 UTC update...

Models and ensembles continue to show very good agreement on the
large scale upper level pattern, with lingering uncertainty in the
details through the medium range period. Only minor changes were
made to the previous WPC forecast based on the newest guidance
runs. Today's update to WPCs surface and upper level charts used a
general model blend days 3-5, with more inclusion of the
ECENS/GEFS means days 6-7. See previous discussion attached below
for details regarding the overall pattern, guidance evaluation,
and the associated weather hazards.

Santorelli

Previous discussion below issued at 0700 UTC...
...Overview...

The large scale upper pattern will remain fairly similar from the
weekend into the middle of next week but there will be some
adjustments along the way.  Initial ridging aloft that covers the
Great Basin/central Rockies and central/southern Plains should
consolidate into a central Plains ridge likely to strengthen by
midweek with guidance developing/expanding a 594 dm contour at
that time.  This pattern will keep well above normal temperatures
over the central/northern Plains and Upper Midwest through the
period.  To the south of the initial western ridge, moisture and a
compact upper low over Arizona and vicinity will extend the threat
of locally heavy monsoonal rainfall through the weekend.  Then the
consolidation of upper ridging over the Plains should push the
moisture/upper energy to the west and north thereafter, bringing a
lighter trend to rainfall over the Southwest.  Uncertainties over
specifics of how a Northeast Pacific trough/upper low may open up
after the weekend will affect the forecast across southern Canada
and the northern tier U.S. after the weekend.  Mean troughing
should persist over the Northeast, with one shortwave departing
early in the weekend followed by one or more features that should
maintain cyclonic flow on average.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The updated forecast based on 12Z/18Z guidance continues to
reflect a consensus model approach early in the period followed by
a trend to a model/ensemble mean combination.  Details are still
in flux for the surface evolution near the southeastern coast.
Recent trends have led to clustering in the southern half of the
prior spread for initial low pressure (closer to the GFS than
ECMWF from earlier runs).  Latest solutions offer the potential
for a defined surface low to reach into the Gulf of Mexico,
whether from motion of the initial low or by redevelopment, in
contrast to the wave staying near the Southeast coast.  This
cycle's manual forecast attempted a conservative trend by way of a
more extensive trough while awaiting better continuity.  Meanwhile
there are only typical run-to-run adjustments for the frontal
evolution from the northern Plains through the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic during the weekend into early next week.
Fast/low amplitude nature of Pacific flow rounding the central
U.S. ridge continues to suggest low predictability for surface
details influenced by this stream.  The signal persists for a wave
to emerge from Montana around the start of the week and then track
into Canada, but the models have not been consistent or agreeable
with the supporting dynamics.  The energy associated with the
northeastern Pacific upper low expected to open up may also come
into play by next Tuesday or Wednesday but again guidance differs
on the strength/timing of the resulting shortwave(s).


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Latest consensus shows the potential for areas of heavy rainfall
within the Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon to extend into the
weekend and still with central Arizona likely to see the highest
totals from this event.  Some areas will be very sensitive to
additional rain given already wet soil from prior rainfall.  Rain
should trend lighter next week as upper level energy departs and
the core of greatest deep moisture/rainfall lifts northwestward
and becomes more diffuse.  A combination of fronts should bring an
organized area of rain and thunderstorms from the Great Lakes into
the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic during the weekend into next week.
Some rainfall could be locally moderate to heavy.  Another episode
of showers/storms could affect the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes next
week depending on uncertain wave/front details.  Portions of the
Florida Peninsula may see enhanced rainfall to the south of a
surface trough/possible embedded low whose details are very
uncertain at this time.

Expect a hot pattern to continue from the northern/central Plains
into the Upper Midwest through the period with temperatures 5-15F
above normal, including at least isolated Plains locations
reaching 100F on one or more days. Additional humidity will make
temperatures feel even hotter, with heat indices reaching 105-110F
at a few locations in the southern portion of this region. Fronts
reaching the northern tier will provide a little variability from
day to day but without any meaningful cooling trend.  Interior
portions of the Northwest will also see fairly hot conditions but
with anomalies tending to stay in the single digits above normal.
Clouds and rainfall over the Southwest and vicinity will keep
highs there up to 10-15F below normal through the weekend.
Temperatures over the Southwest should trend somewhat closer to
normal next week as the best moisture departs to the northwest.
Most of the eastern U.S. should see near to slightly above normal
readings except for some pockets of below normal highs over New
England during the weekend.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed July 21 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 27 - 31 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast an amplified troug=
h
near the Bering Sea. A ridge is predicted over central and eastern Mainland
Alaska with positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Over much of the CONUS an
amplified ridge is forecast with positive 500-hPa height anomalies from the
Pacific Northwest eastward to much of the central CONUS and parts of the
eastern CONUS. Downstream, a trough is predicted over the Northeast with ne=
ar
to below normal 500-hPa heights over the region.

Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over most of northern a=
nd
eastern Mainland Alaska underneath predicted above normal 500-hPa heights,
while below normal temperatures are favored for the Alaska Panhandle,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Above normal temperatures =
are
favored for much of the western CONUS and Great Basin expanding eastward to
much of the central and eastern CONUS due to the persistent ridging over th=
e
region and also consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. A predicte=
d
trough over the West Coast, as well as a weakness in the ridge over parts o=
f
the Southwest, favors enhanced probabilities of near normal temperatures ov=
er
parts of the Southwest.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the Aleutians an=
d
western Mainland Alaska due to a forecast trough near the Bering Sea and
potential storm system development. Below normal precipitation is likely fo=
r
eastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle underneath forecast above normal
500-hPa heights. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over the
Pacific Northwest eastward to much of the central and eastern CONUS due to
forecast ridging or surface high pressure over the region. The position of =
the
predicted 500-hPa ridge and low-level flow is favorable for near to above
normal precipitation for much of the Great Basin.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offse=
t
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 29 - AUG 04, 2021

During the week-2 period, the overall 500-hPa circulation pattern is genera=
lly
similar to the 6-10 day period. The temperature probability forecast during
the
week-2 period is very similar to the 6-10 day period except that below norm=
al
temperatures are likely for parts of northwestern Mainland Alaska and below
normal temperatures are also forecast over the Northeast, consistent with t=
he
operational autoblend forecast tool. The precipitation probability forecast=
 is
also generally similar to the 6-10 day period with the probabilities slight=
ly
reduced. However, enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation were
expanded across eastern Mainland Alaska, consistent with the GEFS reforecas=
t
and operational autoblend tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecas=
t
tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWESTERN MONTANA...

Minor adjustments to the ongoing forecast have been made for the
latest guidance. Isolated dry lightning strikes will remain possible
early in the day across portions of Montana ahead of a cold front.
The dry thunder area has been shrunk to better align with areas
where low precipitation efficiency is expected. Critical fire
weather conditions appear likely behind the cold front where winds
are forecast to increase to 20-30 mph. Please see the previous
discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 07/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Wed Jul 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper ridge axis will shift towards the Plains States as the
Pacific Northwest mid-level trough (from Day 1) pivots around the
crest of the upper ridge and traverses the northern Rockies
tomorrow/Thursday. A surface pressure gradient will develop across
Montana as the mid-level trough and associated surface lee trough
progress eastward through the afternoon, bringing about dry and
breezy conditions supporting wildfire spread. Similarly, dry and
breezy conditions may occur once again in proximity to the northern
Sierra as the mid-level trough glances the area to the north.
Deep-layer ascent ahead of the mid-level trough will lift deep
mid-level moisture, encouraging the development of scattered to
numerous thunderstorms over fuels quite receptive to fire spread.

...Northern Rockies...
By afternoon peak heating/boundary-layer mixing, 20+ mph sustained
westerly surface winds are expected to coincide with 15-20% RH for
at least a few hours across western into central Montana, warranting
Critical highlights tomorrow. In proximity to and to the east of the
forecast dry and breezy surface conditions, scattered to widespread
thunderstorms will also develop during the afternoon. Precipitable
water values exceeding 1 inch in spots may result in a higher ratio
of wet strikes. Appreciable rainfall accumulations over the same
areas from recent previous events may also locally dampen fuels in
spots. Nonetheless, fuels are expected to remain highly receptive to
fire spread on a more widespread basis. Dry strikes on the periphery
of relatively fast moving storm cores should still support some
lightning-ignition efficiency, hence the introduction of an isolated
dry thunderstorm area.

...Northern Sierra...
The mid-level trough is expected to amplify enough while traversing
the northern Rockies to overspread modest mid-level flow over the
northern Sierra tomorrow. Across and to the lee of the higher
terrain, 15 mph sustained westerly winds will overlap with 15-20% RH
through the afternoon. As fuels are expected to be at least modestly
receptive to fire spread, Elevated highlights have been introduced.

...Flood threat increasing across the Southwest as Monsoonal
showers and thunderstorms intensify...

...Midsummer heat continues across the Northern and Central Plains
and spreads into the Midwest...

...Elevated to critical fire weather concerns remain throughout
the northern Rockies and northern Great Basin...


The Summer Monsoon is expected to persist throughout the Southwest
and central Great Basin for the foreseeable future. Daily showers
and thunderstorms are forecast, with the threat for heavy rain and
flash flooding increasing as an upper level disturbance moves over
the region and helps to enhance the Monsoon. Slight Risks (level
2/4) for Excessive Rainfall are in effect for portions of
southwestern Colorado, western New Mexico, and Arizona through the
forecast period. Instances of heavy rain are forecast to increase
in intensity, with rainfall amounts of 1-2 inches possible each
day, and become much more widespread across the area. The flash
flooding risk will be of particular concern for more urban areas
and across burn scars.

Hot weather is forecast to continue across the Northern and
Central Plains over the next few days as an upper-level ridge
remains anchored over the Central Rockies. High temperatures in
the upper 90s to low 100s are forecast for Thursday across eastern
Montana and the western Dakotas. An Excessive Heat Warning remains
in effect through Thursday evening for eastern Montana. On Friday,
the heat will expand to the east over the Upper Midwest with high
temperatures increasing into the upper 90s from the eastern
Dakotas east across Minnesota and into far western Wisconsin.

Slightly to the west, extreme drought, gusty winds, and the
continuing threat of dry lighting could create elevated to
critical fire weather. These conditions stretch from the northern
Sierra Nevada and Great Basin to the Northern Rockies, where Fire
Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings have been issued.
Temperatures look to remain seasonably comfortable across the West
in general, from the Northwest south through the Great Basin and
California. However, the lack of precipitation is the concern for
continued drought and fire weather conditions overall.

Elsewhere, a cold front will continue to push east off the Eastern
Seaboard this evening, helping to clear the smoke that has
lingered over the region. High temperatures Thursday and Friday
should be seasonably mild, with 70s for New England and 80s for
the Mid-Atlantic. Daily showers and thunderstorms are expected for
Texas and the Southeast as a frontal boundary lingers over the
region. Thunderstorms are also expected to increase across the
Northern and Central Plains and the Midwest Thursday into Friday
as moisture increases from the south and a cold front begins to
move into the region from the west.

...Locally heavy rainfall threat through the weekend in an active
Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon pattern...

...Heat will continue over the northern/central Plains into the
Upper Midwest...

1830 UTC update...

Models and ensembles continue to show very good agreement on the
large scale upper level pattern, with lingering uncertainty in the
details through the medium range period. Only minor changes were
made to the previous WPC forecast based on the newest guidance
runs. Today's update to WPCs surface and upper level charts used a
general model blend days 3-5, with more inclusion of the
ECENS/GEFS means days 6-7. See previous discussion attached below
for details regarding the overall pattern, guidance evaluation,
and the associated weather hazards.

Santorelli

Previous discussion below issued at 0700 UTC...
...Overview...

The large scale upper pattern will remain fairly similar from the
weekend into the middle of next week but there will be some
adjustments along the way.  Initial ridging aloft that covers the
Great Basin/central Rockies and central/southern Plains should
consolidate into a central Plains ridge likely to strengthen by
midweek with guidance developing/expanding a 594 dm contour at
that time.  This pattern will keep well above normal temperatures
over the central/northern Plains and Upper Midwest through the
period.  To the south of the initial western ridge, moisture and a
compact upper low over Arizona and vicinity will extend the threat
of locally heavy monsoonal rainfall through the weekend.  Then the
consolidation of upper ridging over the Plains should push the
moisture/upper energy to the west and north thereafter, bringing a
lighter trend to rainfall over the Southwest.  Uncertainties over
specifics of how a Northeast Pacific trough/upper low may open up
after the weekend will affect the forecast across southern Canada
and the northern tier U.S. after the weekend.  Mean troughing
should persist over the Northeast, with one shortwave departing
early in the weekend followed by one or more features that should
maintain cyclonic flow on average.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The updated forecast based on 12Z/18Z guidance continues to
reflect a consensus model approach early in the period followed by
a trend to a model/ensemble mean combination.  Details are still
in flux for the surface evolution near the southeastern coast.
Recent trends have led to clustering in the southern half of the
prior spread for initial low pressure (closer to the GFS than
ECMWF from earlier runs).  Latest solutions offer the potential
for a defined surface low to reach into the Gulf of Mexico,
whether from motion of the initial low or by redevelopment, in
contrast to the wave staying near the Southeast coast.  This
cycle's manual forecast attempted a conservative trend by way of a
more extensive trough while awaiting better continuity.  Meanwhile
there are only typical run-to-run adjustments for the frontal
evolution from the northern Plains through the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic during the weekend into early next week.
Fast/low amplitude nature of Pacific flow rounding the central
U.S. ridge continues to suggest low predictability for surface
details influenced by this stream.  The signal persists for a wave
to emerge from Montana around the start of the week and then track
into Canada, but the models have not been consistent or agreeable
with the supporting dynamics.  The energy associated with the
northeastern Pacific upper low expected to open up may also come
into play by next Tuesday or Wednesday but again guidance differs
on the strength/timing of the resulting shortwave(s).


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Latest consensus shows the potential for areas of heavy rainfall
within the Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon to extend into the
weekend and still with central Arizona likely to see the highest
totals from this event.  Some areas will be very sensitive to
additional rain given already wet soil from prior rainfall.  Rain
should trend lighter next week as upper level energy departs and
the core of greatest deep moisture/rainfall lifts northwestward
and becomes more diffuse.  A combination of fronts should bring an
organized area of rain and thunderstorms from the Great Lakes into
the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic during the weekend into next week.
Some rainfall could be locally moderate to heavy.  Another episode
of showers/storms could affect the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes next
week depending on uncertain wave/front details.  Portions of the
Florida Peninsula may see enhanced rainfall to the south of a
surface trough/possible embedded low whose details are very
uncertain at this time.

Expect a hot pattern to continue from the northern/central Plains
into the Upper Midwest through the period with temperatures 5-15F
above normal, including at least isolated Plains locations
reaching 100F on one or more days. Additional humidity will make
temperatures feel even hotter, with heat indices reaching 105-110F
at a few locations in the southern portion of this region. Fronts
reaching the northern tier will provide a little variability from
day to day but without any meaningful cooling trend.  Interior
portions of the Northwest will also see fairly hot conditions but
with anomalies tending to stay in the single digits above normal.
Clouds and rainfall over the Southwest and vicinity will keep
highs there up to 10-15F below normal through the weekend.
Temperatures over the Southwest should trend somewhat closer to
normal next week as the best moisture departs to the northwest.
Most of the eastern U.S. should see near to slightly above normal
readings except for some pockets of below normal highs over New
England during the weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CDT Thu Jul 22 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWESTERN
MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will crest the upper ridge axis and traverse the
northern Rockies through the period. Surface lee-troughing will
intensify across the northern High Plains, supporting the
intensification of a surface pressure gradient and associated wind
field, with dry and breezy conditions expected across northern Great
Basin to the U.S./Canada border. Deep-layer ascent/moisture ahead of
the mid-level trough will also encourage scattered to widespread
thunderstorm development across the northern Rockies, where very dry
fuels are in place.

...Northern Rockies to northern Great Basin - Dry and Breezy
Conditions...
50+ kt mid-level flow will overspread portions of western Montana
during the afternoon hours. Downward momentum transport of this
mid-level flow, along with a strengthening surface pressure
gradient, will foster 20+ mph sustained westerly surface winds amid
15-20% RH. Critical highlights have been introduced for parts of
western Montana, which should experience the most favorable surface
wind/RH overlap the longest. While surface westerly winds will be a
bit weaker overall across the higher terrain and lee-side slopes
across southern Montana to the northern Sierra, favorable RH will
likely be realized for several hours during the afternoon. Elevated
highlights have been introduced where 15 mph sustained westerly
winds will overlap 15-20% RH for at least a few hours.

...Northern Rockies - Thunderstorms...
Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are expected to develop ahead of
the mid-level trough axis as the boundary layer heats and
destabilizes. While storm motions will be relatively fast, up to 1
inch precipitable water values suggest that wet storms will be
predominant. Nonetheless, dry strikes on the periphery of the
heavier rain cores atop very dry fuels may support a high enough
lightning ignition efficiency to warrant isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights. In addition, a few of the stronger storms may also
produce gusty and erratic winds, some of which approaching severe
criteria (50+ kts at the surface). Please see the latest Day 1
Convective Outlook for more details.

...Locally heavy rainfall threat through Sunday in the
Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon followed by a lighter trend...

...Heat will continue over the northern/central Plains into the
Upper Midwest...


...Overview...

Expect upper ridging to consolidate and strengthen over the
central Rockies/Plains by midweek after initially extending from
California and the Great Basin into the central/southern Plains on
Sunday.  An upper low forecast to be near the western U.S.-Mexico
border as of early Sunday will continue to enhance Southwest
Monsoon rainfall through the end of the weekend.  This feature
should then weaken and progress around the western periphery of
the building Rockies/Plains ridge, leading to a lighter trend for
rainfall over Arizona and vicinity.  Flow around the northern side
of the ridge will feed into a broad Northeast mean trough aloft,
while an initial northeastern Pacific low should eventually open
up but with considerable uncertainty over how/when its energy will
become incorporated within the progressive flow along/north of the
U.S.-Canada border.  This overall pattern should lead to a
meandering surface low/front over the northern Plains--generally
providing only modest variability within a lengthy period of hot
weather--while fronts periodically reach the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic.  Finally, guidance continues to suggest
that a surface trough with one or more embedded lows may extend
from off the Southeast/eastern Florida coast into the Gulf of
Mexico to start the week and then weaken as it lifts
northwestward.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Once again the full array of guidance provides above average
confidence in the large scale pattern but below average confidence
in the details, especially with shortwave specifics around the
northern periphery of the Rockies/Plains upper ridge.  From the
larger-scale perspective the primary issue for this stream is
when/how the upper low initially over the northeastern Pacific
opens up and its energy becomes embedded within the progressive
flow.  Most models from the 12Z/18Z cycles showed some splitting
of the energy while the majority was slower than the GFS runs for
the overall evolution.  This consideration, along with the fact
that the GFS strayed to the weak side of guidance with the
Plains/Rockies ridge late in the period, led to a forecast
approach that started with mostly operational model focus early
and then trended toward the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means and lingering
operational input from the 12Z ECMWF/CMC.  Even with the southern
Canada details looking more ambiguous as a whole after Monday, the
blend still yielded some elements of continuity.  Among new 00Z
runs the GFS is still a bit on the fast side with the Northeast
Pacific upper low but the CMC has trended faster to make the GFS
appear less extreme.  The ECMWF is still fairly slow with the low
and also eventually builds the downstream ridge more into Canada
than consensus/continuity.  Meanwhile the 00Z GFS has adjusted
stronger toward consensus for the Rockies/Plains upper ridge by
the end of the period.  Farther south the small scale of the
feature initially expected off the southeastern coast/Florida will
likely lead to low predictability until the short range time
frame.  The National Hurricane Center's 06Z Tropical Weather
Outlook shows a 30 percent chance of development over the next
five days.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The potential for some locally heavy monsoonal rainfall should
continue over Arizona through Sunday as a compact upper low tracks
along the southern border of the state.  This area will be
sensitive to additional rain given the significant totals already
expected in the short range time frame.  The
strengthening/consolidation of the Rockies-Plains upper ridge next
week should force the weakening upper feature to the west and
spread moisture to the north and west.  Thus the Southwest will
see rainfall trend lighter after Sunday.  Activity that extends
into California, the Great Basin, and northward over the Rockies
should be less intense than with the Arizona event.
Showers/thunderstorms will accompany a front pushing from the
Great Lakes/Plains into the East from Sunday onward.  By
Tuesday-Thursday another front may bring rainfall of varying
intensity to areas from the Upper Midwest through New England.
With considerable uncertainty in the specifics, the weak surface
feature off the southeast Coast and possibly into the eastern Gulf
may enhance rainfall at some locations.  Monitor National
Hurricane Center outlooks for latest information on development
potential.

Within the persistent hot pattern from the northern/central Plains
into the Upper Midwest, expect Monday through Wednesday to feature
the greatest coverage of plus 10-15F or so high temperature
anomalies--with some locations in the Plains reaching at least
100F.  A meandering surface low/front across the the northern tier
will likely provide some day-to-day variability for temperatures
but not a meaningful cooling trend.  The one exception could be
over the northern High Plains on Thursday when highs may decline
to only a few degrees above normal.  There is still uncertainty in
the surface front/temperature details though.  From Sunday into
Monday the northern Great Basin and interior portions of the
Northwest will also see hot conditions with highs possibly
reaching 10F or so above normal.  A few locations could approach
or reach daily record values.  The moisture over the Southwest
will initially support highs up to 10-15F below normal followed by
a moderating trend.  Northwestward progression of this moisture
will bring temperatures down somewhat over the Great Basin and
interior Northwest after Monday.  Most of the eastern U.S. should
see near to somewhat above normal readings.

0214 AM CDT Thu Jul 22 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
The upper trough traversing the Northern Rockies on Day 1 will eject
into the Northern Plains tomorrow/Friday. Surface lee troughing will
intensify across the Plains, resulting in a strengthening surface
pressure gradient over the Northern Rockies. Dry and breezy
conditions will likely develop during the afternoon over much of
Montana and Idaho, supporting wildfire spread. Elevated highlights
have been introduced for areas most likely to see widespread 15+ mph
sustained westerly surface winds coinciding with 15-20% RH for
several hours. Critical highlights were also added to portions of
northeast Montana, where 20+ mph sustained westerly winds will
overlap with 15% RH for at least a few hours.

While portions of the Elevated/Critical areas may see some rainfall
accumulations preceding favorable wildfire-spread conditions
tomorrow, fuels are still likely to be at least near-critically dry.
However, major modifications may need to be made to the current Day
2 fire weather highlights should higher rainfall accumulations than
expected be realized.

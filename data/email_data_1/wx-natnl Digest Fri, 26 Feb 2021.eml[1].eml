Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1036 AM CST Thu Feb 25 2021

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Southwestern North Dakota...
Dry and windy conditions are forecast to develop this afternoon and
evening ahead of a cold front moving across the Northern Rockies.
Surface RH will likely fall to near 30% with winds gusting of 15-20
mph in portions of eastern Montana and the western half of the
Dakotas. Despite meteorological conditions somewhat supportive of
locally elevated fire weather potential, fuels across the region are
unsupportive of a greater threat. Thus, no highlights will be added.

..Lyons.. 02/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0139 AM CST Thu Feb 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper pattern will be in place today, with a mid-level
trough rapidly progressing across the south-central CONUS as a
second trough aloft traverses the Interior West. Moist low-level
conditions and precipitation will accompany the south-central CONUS
trough, limiting wildfire-spread concerns across the southern Plains
eastward. Meanwhile, surface high pressure across the Central
Rockies northward will promote cool conditions, mitigating
wildfire-spread potential. A pressure gradient is expected to be in
place across southern California at the start of the period,
accompanied by strong, dry offshore flow. Dry westerly surface flow
is also expected across portions of southern Arizona into New
Mexico. However, poor fuel receptiveness to wildfire spread across
the southwest CONUS precludes any fire weather highlights.

...Heavy rain threat gradually diminishes across the interior Deep
South early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

An ongoing heavy rain event should extend across the interior Deep
South towards the southern Appalachians as the forecast period
begins on Sunday.  There has been a gradual southward shift in the
heavy rain axis as additional upper level energy is forecast to
eject from the upper level trough dipping into the southwestern
U.S.  On the other hand, models are trending slower with respect
to the eastward motion of the upper low itself.  This could result
in keeping the heavy rain threat a bit longer in the Deep South on
Monday.  Thereafter, there is a general consensus among model
guidance that the bulk of the moisture will gradually move
eastward across the Southeast ahead of the upper trough.  However,
uncertainty remains quite high regarding the subsequent
developments of this system.  A blend of the 00Z ECMWF mean, 06Z
GEFS and the 00Z CMC mean yielded a developing low pressure wave
moving of the Southeast U.S. coast by the middle of next week.

Meanwhile, deterministic models and ensembles continue to struggle
with both the timing and evolution of the next trough approaching
the West Coast from the Gulf of Alaska/North Pacific region as
early as Sunday night.  The GFS and to a lesser extent the GEFS
mean continue to indicate the development of a closed upper level
low that lingers well offshore, while the ECMWF keeps the upper
trough largely over land as it digs down the West Coast early next
week.  The latest (12Z) ECMWF is even more progressive than the
00Z run.  The CMC is somewhere in between.   These differences
have implications for the southern tier states for the latter part
of next week.  This leads to below average forecast confidence
from Day 5 onward for this part of the country.

The WPC medium-range fronts and pressures was derived based on the
consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS for
Days 3 to 4.  More of the EC mean and 06Z GEFS together with a
larger contribution from the 00Z CMC mean were used due to the
above normal forecast uncertainty beginning on Day 5.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The upper level trough across the southern Rockies and then the
southern Plains will allow Gulf moisture to lift northward as
multiple waves of low pressure develop along a slow-moving front.
This setup will favor a few rounds of locally heavy rainfall late
this weekend into early next week from the Arklatex to the
southern Appalachians. The heavy rain threat should gradually
diminish by Tuesday as the bulk of moisture should slide eastward
across and then off the Southeast afterwards.  Meanwhile,
uncertainty is quite high regarding the specific details across
the Southwest to the Plains.  Mountain snows are possible for the
central/southern Rockies as the upper trough moves through.  Some
precipitation could be moving into the central Plains afterwards.

High temperatures will likely be about 5 to 15 degrees above
average across the eastern U.S. on Sunday ahead of the front, and
overnight lows will likely be even more above average across
portions of the Deep South owing to southerly flow from the Gulf
of Mexico and widespread cloud cover.  These readings should
return closer to late February/early March averages as the frontal
boundary settles south of the Gulf Coast by the middle of the
week.  Meanwhile, readings should be slightly above average for
much of the central and northern Plains for much of this forecast
period.

...Heavy rain threat gradually diminishes across the interior Deep
South early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

An ongoing heavy rain event should extend across the interior Deep
South towards the southern Appalachians as the forecast period
begins on Sunday.  There has been a gradual southward shift in the
heavy rain axis as additional upper level energy is forecast to
eject from the upper level trough dipping into the southwestern
U.S.  On the other hand, models are trending slower with respect
to the eastward motion of the upper low itself.  This could result
in keeping the heavy rain threat a bit longer in the Deep South on
Monday.  Thereafter, there is a general consensus among model
guidance that the bulk of the moisture will gradually move
eastward across the Southeast ahead of the upper trough.  However,
uncertainty remains quite high regarding the subsequent
developments of this system.  A blend of the 00Z ECMWF mean, 06Z
GEFS and the 00Z CMC mean yielded a developing low pressure wave
moving of the Southeast U.S. coast by the middle of next week.

Meanwhile, deterministic models and ensembles continue to struggle
with both the timing and evolution of the next trough approaching
the West Coast from the Gulf of Alaska/North Pacific region as
early as Sunday night.  The GFS and to a lesser extent the GEFS
mean continue to indicate the development of a closed upper level
low that lingers well offshore, while the ECMWF keeps the upper
trough largely over land as it digs down the West Coast early next
week.  The latest (12Z) ECMWF is even more progressive than the
00Z run.  The CMC is somewhere in between.   These differences
have implications for the southern tier states for the latter part
of next week.  This leads to below average forecast confidence
from Day 5 onward for this part of the country.

The WPC medium-range fronts and pressures was derived based on the
consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS for
Days 3 to 4.  More of the EC mean and 06Z GEFS together with a
larger contribution from the 00Z CMC mean were used due to the
above normal forecast uncertainty beginning on Day 5.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The upper level trough across the southern Rockies and then the
southern Plains will allow Gulf moisture to lift northward as
multiple waves of low pressure develop along a slow-moving front.
This setup will favor a few rounds of locally heavy rainfall late
this weekend into early next week from the Arklatex to the
southern Appalachians. The heavy rain threat should gradually
diminish by Tuesday as the bulk of moisture should slide eastward
across and then off the Southeast afterwards.  Meanwhile,
uncertainty is quite high regarding the specific details across
the Southwest to the Plains.  Mountain snows are possible for the
central/southern Rockies as the upper trough moves through.  Some
precipitation could be moving into the central Plains afterwards.

High temperatures will likely be about 5 to 15 degrees above
average across the eastern U.S. on Sunday ahead of the front, and
overnight lows will likely be even more above average across
portions of the Deep South owing to southerly flow from the Gulf
of Mexico and widespread cloud cover.  These readings should
return closer to late February/early March averages as the frontal
boundary settles south of the Gulf Coast by the middle of the
week.  Meanwhile, readings should be slightly above average for
much of the central and northern Plains for much of this forecast
period.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 25 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast to extend from Alaska southward
to
near the West Coast during early March, while mid-level high pressure becomes
centered over the central U.S. This pattern favors near to above normal
temperatures throughout the central and eastern U.S. with the most anomalous
cold likely across parts of the West along with Alaska. Mid-level low pressure
may briefly develop along or offshore of the East Coast later next week, which
could result in an intensifying low pressure system across the Northeast.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation (rain and high-elevation snow) for parts of
Oregon, the southern Cascades, northern California, and the Sierra Nevada
Mountains, Fri-Sun, Mar 5-7.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation (rain and/or snow) for New England, Fri-
Sat,
Mar 5-6.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Northeast, Fri-Sat, Mar 5-6.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY FEBRUARY 28 - THURSDAY MARCH 04:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!qmnkLvxvA7jOWnlTObNzRsEFQvThcvnwDPK6Mp8pmyNmlm2kAv_JEpZLhQH-0Xo4Hpzsd8oP$

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 05 - THURSDAY MARCH 11: An amplifying 500-hPa trough is
expected to elevate chances of above normal precipitation along parts of the
West Coast during week-2. A slight risk of heavy precipitation (rain and
high-elevation snow) is posted from Oregon and the southern Cascades southward
to northern California and the Sierra Nevada Mountains where the GEFS
reforecast tool depicts that there is at least a 20 percent chance of 3-day
precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile of the climatological
distribution and near 2 inches (liquid equivalent) from March 5 to 7. In
addition, model guidance has trended wetter along the West Coast during the
past few days.



The ECMWF model remains the most amplified with a 500-hPa trough near the East
Coast later next week with an intensifying coastal low tracking across New
England at the beginning of week-2. Ensemble means are trending towards a
stronger blocking ridge downstream, to the south of Greenland, which would
tend
to favor this model solution. The good consistency of the ECMWF deterministic
model and its ensemble mean, along with support from several 12Z GFS ensemble
members, result in a slight risk of heavy precipitation (rain and/or snow
amounts totaling near 1 inch, liquid equivalent) for New England on March 5
and
6. A slight risk of high winds is also posted for parts of the Northeast for
those two days due to the potential for a strengthening low pressure system.
Elsewhere, the predictability of additional precipitation or wind hazards is
low due to large model spread in a pattern with relatively short wavelengths.



Anomalous cold is forecast to be limited to parts of the western U.S. and
Alaska during early March. Since the anomalous cold across western Mainland
Alaska is likely to peak in magnitude prior to week-2, the slight risk of much
below normal temperatures is discontinued from the previous outlook. The
synoptic pattern across Alaska favors an active storm track across the Bering
Sea and into western and southern portions of Alaska, bringing enhanced
chances
of above normal precipitation, along with episodes of high wind speeds to the
Aleutians and southwestern Mainland coast. However, any impacts are forecast
to
be intermittent, and likely to remain below hazards thresholds.

However, fuel receptiveness to wildfire spread is expected to remain
mediocre across much of the southwest into the central CONUS, with
no fire weather highlights introduced.

An ongoing heavy rain event should extend across the interior Deep
South towards the southern Appalachians as the forecast period
begins on Sunday.  There has been a gradual southward shift in the
heavy rain axis as additional upper level energy is forecast to
eject from the upper level trough dipping into the southwestern
U.S.  On the other hand, models are trending slower with respect
to the eastward motion of the upper low itself.  This could result

Southeast U.S. coast by the middle of next week.

Meanwhile, deterministic models and ensembles continue to struggle
with both the timing and evolution of the next trough approaching
the West Coast from the Gulf of Alaska/North Pacific region as
early as Sunday night.  The GFS and to a lesser extent the GEFS
mean continue to indicate the development of a closed upper level
low that lingers well offshore, while the ECMWF keeps the upper
trough largely over land as it digs down the West Coast early next
week.  The latest (12Z) ECMWF is even more progressive than the
00Z run.  The CMC is somewhere in between.   These differences
have implications for the southern tier states for the latter part
of next week.  Forecast confidence is below average for this part
of the country from Day 5 onward.

The WPC medium-range fronts and pressures were derived based on
the consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS
for Days 3 to 4.  Beginning on Day 5, more of the EC mean and 06Z

central/southern Rockies as the upper trough moves through.  Some
precipitation could be moving into the central Plains toward the
latter part of next week but uncertainty remains much higher than
normal.

High temperatures will likely be about 5 to 15 degrees above
average across the eastern U.S. on Sunday ahead of the front, and
overnight lows will likely be even more above average across
portions of the Deep South owing to southerly flow from the Gulf
of Mexico and widespread cloud cover.  These readings should
return closer to late February/early March averages as the frontal
boundary settles south of the Gulf Coast by the middle of the
week.  Meanwhile, readings should be slightly above average for
much of the central and northern Plains for much of this forecast
period.

...Heavy rain threat gradually diminishes across the interior Deep
South early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

An ongoing heavy rain event should extend across the interior Deep
South towards the southern Appalachians as the forecast period
begins on Sunday.  There has been a gradual southward shift in the
heavy rain axis as additional upper level energy is forecast to
eject from the upper level trough dipping into the southwestern
U.S.  On the other hand, models are trending slower with respect
to the eastward motion of the upper low itself.  This could result
in keeping the heavy rain threat a bit longer in the Deep South on
Monday.  Thereafter, there is a general consensus among model
guidance that the bulk of the moisture will gradually move
eastward across the Southeast ahead of the upper trough.  However,
uncertainty remains quite high regarding the subsequent evolution
of this system.  A blend of the 00Z ECMWF mean, 06Z GEFS and the
00Z CMC mean yielded a developing low pressure wave moving off the
Southeast U.S. coast by the middle of next week.

Meanwhile, deterministic models and ensembles continue to struggle
with both the timing and evolution of the next trough approaching
the West Coast from the Gulf of Alaska/North Pacific region as
early as Sunday night.  The GFS and to a lesser extent the GEFS
mean continue to indicate the development of a closed upper level
low that lingers well offshore, while the ECMWF keeps the upper
trough largely over land as it digs down the West Coast early next
week.  The latest (12Z) ECMWF is even more progressive than the
00Z run.  The CMC is somewhere in between.   These differences
have implications for the southern tier states for the latter part
of next week.  Forecast confidence is below average for this part
of the country from Day 5 onward.

The WPC medium-range fronts and pressures were derived based on
the consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS
for Days 3 to 4.  Beginning on Day 5, more of the EC mean and 06Z
GEFS together with the 00Z CMC mean were used due to the above
normal forecast uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The upper level trough forecast to move across the southern
Rockies and then the southern Plains will allow Gulf moisture to
lift northward as multiple waves of low pressure develop along a
slow-moving front.  This setup will favor rounds of locally heavy
rainfall late this weekend into early next week from the Arklatex
to the southern Appalachians. The heavy rain threat could linger a
bit longer in the Deep South on Monday but should gradually
diminish by Tuesday as the bulk of moisture should slide eastward
into and then off the Southeast afterwards.  Meanwhile,
uncertainty is quite high regarding the specific details across
the Southwest to the Plains.  Mountain snows are possible for the
central/southern Rockies as the upper trough moves through.  Some
precipitation could be moving into the central Plains toward the
latter part of next week but uncertainty remains much higher than
normal.

High temperatures will likely be about 5 to 15 degrees above
average across the eastern U.S. on Sunday ahead of the front, and
overnight lows will likely be even more above average across
portions of the Deep South owing to southerly flow from the Gulf
of Mexico and widespread cloud cover.  These readings should
return closer to late February/early March averages as the frontal
boundary settles south of the Gulf Coast by the middle of the
week.  Meanwhile, readings should be slightly above average for
much of the central and northern Plains for much of this forecast
period.

...Gusty winds and heavy snow to impact portions of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies over the next few days...

...Numerous showers and thunderstorms likely from the Southern
Plains to Southern Appalachians through this weekend...

...Light snow and wintry mix to spread throughout the
Appalachians, Northeast, and New England between Friday evening
and Saturday...

A potent Pacific storm system is currently entering the Northwest
and expected to bring gusty winds and high elevation snow.
Post-frontal snow showers are forecast to linger through Friday
and into the early morning hours on Saturday. Total snowfall
amounts will be measured in feet across the Cascade Mountains of
Washington and Oregon. Heavy snow will also infiltrate inland
areas, including the Blue Mountains of northeast Oregon, as well
as the Northern Rockies from northern Idaho to the Wasatch
Mountains of Utah. Wind gusts over 50 mph for much of the same
region could make visibility difficult at times due to blowing
snow. In the lower elevations, less snow is likely, but wind gusts
could still make travel difficult for high profile vehicles.
Winter Storm Warnings, Winter Weather Advisories, as well as Wind
Advisories have been posted for the area. For portions of the
Northern High Plains in Wyoming and Montana, even stronger wind
gusts may mix down to the surface; therefore High Wind Warnings
have been issued.

Meanwhile, a stalled frontal boundary across the Southern Plains
and Southeast will be the focus for numerous showers and
thunderstorms beginning tonight and lasting through the weekend.
Through Saturday evening, rainfall amounts over 2 inches will be
possible from northeast Texas to the Southern Appalachians.
Isolated instances of flooding will be possible, mainly from the
Lower Mississippi Valley to much of the Tennessee Valley. Thus,
WPC has issued a Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall throughout
the region. Isolated severe thunderstorms will also be a concern
as unseasonably warm and moist air continues to enter from the
Gulf of Mexico. SPC has issued a Marginal Risk for severe
thunderstorms that lasts through early tomorrow morning from the
Southern Plains to Lower Mississippi Valley. The severe threat
then shifts slightly eastward and into the Tennessee Valley on
Friday. Large hail and damaging winds will be the main risks with
these storms.

By Friday evening and into the first half of this weekend, a wave
of showers associated with the aforementioned frontal system and
an approaching wave of low pressure is forecast to enter a colder
airmass in place from the Central Appalachians to northern New
England. A few inches of snow and a glaze of freezing rain will be
possible, but little to no travel impacts are expected. Light rain
is expected for coastal regions and major cities along the I-95
corridor during this time frame.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu February 25 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 03 - 07 2021

Today's model forecasts are in general agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Troughing is forecast over Mainland Alaska extending
southward
across the Gulf of Alaska, while ridging is predicted over most of the CONUS
in
most model solutions. The manual height blend depicts negative 500-hPa height
anomalies over most of Alaska except for parts of the Aleutians. Near to below
normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over the Pacific Coast, and positive
500-hPa height anomalies are predicted across the remainder of the CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are likely over the Pacific coastal states of the
CONUS, related to troughing over the Gulf of Alaska. Above normal temperatures
are likely over much of the central and eastern CONUS, under near to above
normal 500-hPa heights. Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are
enhanced
across Alaska, except for the western Aleutians, under predicted negative
500-hPa height anomalies.

Above normal precipitation is favored over northern and central portions of
the
Pacific Coast due to the potential emergence of shortwaves ahead of a trough
over the Gulf of Alaska. Chances of below normal precipitation are enhanced
for
the remainder of the CONUS under near to above normal 500-hPa heights, except
for parts of the Northeast where above normal precipitation is favored,
consistent with operational Autoblend and ERF Consolidation tools.  Near to
above normal precipitation is likely across Alaska, under enhanced westerly
flow.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 60% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 10%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
only fair agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by
differences among temperature and precipitation forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 05 - 11 2021

The main features of the predicted circulation pattern for the 6-10 day period
persist into the week 2 period in the manual 500-hPa height blend. A trough
and
below normal 500-hPa heights are depicted over the western CONUS.  Ridging and
positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over most of the central and
the
eastern CONUS. A trough is forecast over the Bering Sea, and below normal
500-hPa heights and enhanced westerly flow are expected over much of Mainland
Alaska.

The temperature pattern forecast for the week 2 period is similar to the 6-10
day outlook period. Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures are
forecast for the western CONUS, due to the predicted trough and associated
negative 500-hPa height anomalies. Above normal temperatures are favored over
most of the central and eastern CONUS, as in the 6-10 day period forecast,
under positive 500-hPa height anomalies.  Enhanced probabilities of  below
normal temperatures are indicated for the Alaska Mainland, under negative
500-hPa height anomalies.

Above normal precipitation is favored over parts of California and western
Nevada, ahead of a predicted trough. Near to below normal precipitation is
favored over most of the remainder of the CONUS, except for parts of the Upper
and Middle Mississippi Valley, the Upper Great Lakes, and the Ohio Valley,
where above normal precipitation is likely, consistent with operational
Autoblend and ERF Consolidation tools and supported by most dynamical model
forecasts. Enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation are favored
over most of Alaska in week 2, under persistent westerly mid-level flow.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 10% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and
10%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
only fair agreement among the model circulation, temperature, and
precipitation
forecasts, offset by increasing uncertainty and model spread.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...Heavy rain threat over the South continuing into early next
week and then gradually diminishing...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

From the large scale perspective, guidance shows fairly
progressive northern stream and southern tier flow aloft with an
evolution toward a more amplified late-week regime featuring an
eastern Pacific trough and downstream western North American
ridge/eastern trough.  Within this evolution there is considerable
disagreement over how energy may separate from a Pacific shortwave
either during the short range time frame or early in the medium
range.  This flow separation issue ultimately leads to high
uncertainty/low confidence in system specifics over the eastern
Pacific and then eastward across much of the lower 48.

Guidance through the 12Z/18Z cycles essentially formed two
clusters regarding the dominant question of Pacific flow
separation.  The larger ECMWF-led cluster pulled off some energy
rather early/westward with the remaining shortwave continuing into
the western U.S. (possibly closing an embedded low for a time) and
beyond.  The 12Z CMC eventually strayed toward a more separated
southern solution over the East later in the period while multiple
ECMWF/ECMWF mean runs have indicated eventual surface low
development/consolidation over New England and/or eastern Canada
with contributions from the lower 48 shortwave and Canadian flow
as the overall pattern amplifies.  Parallel GFS (GFSP) runs have
also been falling into this cluster in principle.  On the other
hand similarly persistent GFS/GEFS mean runs have been waiting
until just offshore the West Coast to pull off a significant
portion of the Pacific shortwave energy.  The resulting upper low
moves into the Southwest when the other cluster is starting to
develop a mean ridge over the West, and by late in the week the
GFS/GEFS cluster indicates a mere frontal passage across the
Northeast with minimal signal for any New England/eastern Canada
surface system.  These issues will also have some effect on the
ultimate path/evolution of the compact upper low forecast to
emerge from the southern Rockies early in the week.

Compared to the wide variance of guidance for most of the period,
models and means actually come into good agreement for the
amplifying eastern Pacific upper trough late in the period.  There
are still some typical detail and timing differences that are
fairly minor relative to the average spread/error for forecasts a
week out in time.

Given the relative proportion of guidance and the 18Z GFS trend to
close its eastern Pacific upper low to the east of the 12Z run,
the latest forecast went more in the direction of the ECMWF
cluster.  This included some input from the 18Z GFSP as well as
the old 00Z ECMWF since the 12Z version was somewhat on the faster
edge among solutions for the shortwave crossing the lower 48.

The primary revelation in the new 00Z cycle is the CMC switching
to a variation of the GFS cluster.  Other guidance is holding
serve, with the GFS/GEFS continuing its general evolution in
contrast to the ECMWF/UKMET/GFSP (albeit with some detail
differences from previous runs, as would be expected).


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The upper low tracking out of the southern Rockies and through the
Plains early in the week should interact with a front near the
Gulf Coast, supporting one or more waves along the front and a
northward flow of Gulf moisture.  This evolution will favor
another episode of locally heavy rainfall across parts of the
South during the first part of the week, with lighter
precipitation extending farther north over the southern half of
the Plains and an increasing portion of the East.  There may be
some snow in the northern part of the precipitation shield.  The
rest of the forecast has lower than average confidence for
specifics.  One scenario--currently somewhat more likely--would
have a period of moderate rain/mountain snow over the Northwest
and vicinity at the start of the week with mostly light activity
then spreading into the Interior West/Rockies followed by
precipitation of varying intensity spreading across the East in
association with one or more surface lows/fronts (which may
eventually consolidate).  The other possibility will be for a much
lighter event over the Northwest into the Rockies early in the
week and less moisture extending downstream, while a system off
California moves into the Southwest by midweek or so with moisture
continuing eastward into late week.  Either way some moisture may
reach the West Coast late in the week depending on the exact
timing/strength of the upper trough amplifying over the eastern
Pacific.

The upper low emerging from the southern Rockies early in the week
will keep highs up to 10-20F below normal over the southern High
Plains on Monday followed by a rapid rebound to near normal as the
feature continues onward.  Then cool high pressure building over
the East will lead to highs 5-15F below normal near the East Coast
on Tuesday, again followed by a quick recovery.  The Northern
Plains region will likely be consistently warmer than average next
week with most days featuring some plus 10-20F anomalies.  A
majority of the West should see near to slightly below normal
readings early-mid week followed by a warming trend as upper
ridging builds over the region.  As with precipitation, some
aspects of the temperature forecast over the lower 48 will depend
closely on the uncertain details of individual systems.

Mid-level flow is expected to increase across the southern High
Plains on Saturday with surface lee cyclogenesis expected in
southeast Colorado. Deep mixing, combined with the strengthening
surface pressure gradient, is expected to bring winds of 10 to 25
mph and relative humidity less than 15 percent across much of the
southern High Plains. Fuels in the region are not critically dry at
this time, and therefore, no fire weather hazards have been added.
However, fuel conditions will need to be monitored closely, and if
significant drying occurs before Saturday, at least an elevated
delineation may be needed.

...Heavy mountain snow and gusty winds will impact portions of the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies through Saturday...

...Numerous showers and thunderstorms likely from the Lower/Middle
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys to Southern Appalachians
through the weekend...

...Light snow and wintry mix to spread throughout the
Appalachians, Northeast, and New England between this evening and
Saturday...

In the Northwest, a potent upper-level trough is forecast to drop
southward into the region today, leading to continued snow in
higher elevations as well as the potential for high winds.
Snowfall totals are expected to be 1 to 2 feet in the peaks of the
Cascades and Northern Rockies before snow winds down Saturday. The
Wasatch and Wind River Mountains/Tetons could see snowfall amounts
of 6 to 12 inches. Meanwhile, high winds with gusts over 50 mph
are possible in some areas, leading to blowing snow and reduced
visibility. Winter Storm Warnings/Winter Weather Advisories and
High Wind Warnings/Wind Advisories are in effect for portions of
the Northwest given these threats. With this pattern, cooler than
average temperatures are likely, with highs about 10-20 degrees
below average by Saturday.

Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms are possible over the
next few days across portions of the central and eastern U.S. near
meandering frontal boundaries. In particular, through Saturday
night, rain of 1 to locally 3 inches is likely across portions of
the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley eastward into the Tennessee
and Lower Ohio Valleys and toward the Southern Appalachians.
Localized flooding and flash flooding will become risks,
especially into the weekend as rain could fall onto already wet
ground. Therefore a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall is in
place today into tonight, with a Slight Risk for Saturday.
Additionally, the Storm Prediction Center has outlooked a Marginal
Risk of severe weather centered over the Lower Mississippi Valley
today for potential wind and hail threats.

By this evening and into the first half of this weekend, a wave of
showers associated with the aforementioned frontal system and an
approaching wave of low pressure is forecast to enter a colder
airmass in place from the Central Appalachians to northern New
England. A few inches of snow and a glaze of freezing rain will be
possible, and Winter Weather Advisories are in effect for portions
of the Appalachians. Light rain is expected for coastal regions
and major cities along the I-95 corridor during this time frame.
Temperatures will rise to above normal later Saturday throughout
the central and eastern U.S., so additional precipitation should
fall as rain, with the exception of northern Maine.

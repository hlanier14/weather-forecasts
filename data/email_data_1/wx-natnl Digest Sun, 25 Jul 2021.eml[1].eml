Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1020 AM CDT Sat Jul 24 2021

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

An Elevated risk area is introduced to portions of east-central
North Dakota and northwest Minnesota where dry conditions persist
and increasing winds are expected this afternoon. Recent fuel
reports suggest fine fuel moisture values are largely between 5-10%
and ERC values are generally at or above the 90th percentile across
northern MN and eastern ND. Morning surface observations show
gradual cool/dry air advection across the northern Plains in the
wake of last night's frontal passage. Surface pressure rises across
the western Dakotas will drive sustained 15-20 mph winds. The
combination of weak cold advection, boundary-layer heating, and a
uni-directional wind profile (as sampled by KMVX this morning) will
support frequent gusts up to 25 mph and aid in RH reductions to near
20%. Although these wind/RH conditions may be common through the Red
River Valley and across the northern half of MN, recent rainfall has
likely mitigated fuel receptiveness outside of the Elevated risk
area.

..Moore.. 07/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Sat Jul 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
A ridge will build through the day today with mostly weak flow
across much of the western CONUS. Beneath this ridge, an upper low
will continue to meander westward across the Southwest. This
upper-low will continue to initiate significant monsoonal
thunderstorm activity across much of the Southwest, southern Great
Basin, and Rockies. However, thunderstorm activity will mostly be in
areas with high PWAT and/or wet fuels and thus fire weather concerns
remain low.

...North-central U.S. triple-digit heat may exceed records into
early-mid next week...


1800 UTC Update...

No major changes were needed for this update of the WPC medium
range progs. Models continue to advertise strong upper ridging
holding over the central U.S. while mean troughs become
established across the East Pacific and the Northeast U.S.. A
blend of the deterministic models served as a good starting point
for days 3-5, with some inclusion of the ECENS/GEFS ensemble means
later in the period to help smooth out the harder to resolve
detail differences. See previous discussion attached below for
additional details regarding the pattern, uncertainty, and notable
weather hazards.

Previous Discussion below issued at 0646 UTC...

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Latest guidance continues to advertise a hot ridge dominating much
of the west-central U.S. into next week while multiple shortwaves
push downstream to sustain general troughing across the
Midwest/Northeast, where models continue to struggle with
resolving the various shortwave interactions and arrive at a
common and stable solution. Rain associated with wavy and slow
moving fronts can be expected to spread mainly from the
Midwest/Great Lakes to the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic with
considerable uncertainty in its timing and intensity. Meanwhile,
lead scattered thunderstorms can also be expected to push slowly
south into the Southeast by midweek. In addition, the National
Hurricane Center continues to monitor the potential for tropical
cyclone formation east of northern Florida. The disturbance may
intensify and drift toward the southeast U.S. coast early to
middle of next week along with deepened moisture availability to
fuel local downpours.

Meanwhile, a heatwave is forecast to peak Tuesday for the northern
Plains/Rockies and into the northern Great Basin. High
temperatures for the northern Plains are forecast to exceed 100F
into Tuesday and Wednesday, likely producing some record values.
Gradual moderation is forecast for the north-central U.S. later
next week, but it appears that anomalous heat will once again
intensify across the interior Pacific Northwest.

An upper low drifting offshore into the Pacific and the
strengthening of the west-central U.S. upper ridge into next week
should act to spread moisture to the north and west out from the
Southwest. Expect modest monsoonal activity will extend into
California, the Great Basin, then northward and onward into the
Rockies then Plains.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern evolution at mid-larger scales overall
seems to offer slightly above average predictability Days 3-7.
However, the least certain mass field part of the forecast remains
across the Midwest/Northeast where models continue to struggle
with resolving the various shortwave interactions converging along
a mean trough. A wide variety of solutions regarding the timing
and intensity of the upper trough and surface based low pressure
system developments. Prefer an upper trough amplitude at least on
the more amplified side of the full guidance envelope given the
staying power and amplitude of the building upstream upper ridge.
Of the models, a blend of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF seems to
best provide this. In view of forecast spread, also recommend
inclusion of the 18 UTC GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble means to
the composite along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
158 PM EDT Sat Jul 24 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Jul 27 2021 - 12Z Sat Jul 31 2021

...North-central U.S. triple-digit heat may exceed records into
early-mid next week...


1800 UTC Update...

No major changes were needed for this update of the WPC medium
range progs. Models continue to advertise strong upper ridging
holding over the central U.S. while mean troughs become
established across the East Pacific and the Northeast U.S.. A
blend of the deterministic models served as a good starting point
for days 3-5, with some inclusion of the ECENS/GEFS ensemble means
later in the period to help smooth out the harder to resolve
detail differences. See previous discussion attached below for
additional details regarding the pattern, uncertainty, and notable
weather hazards.

Santorelli


Previous Discussion below issued at 0646 UTC...

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Latest guidance continues to advertise a hot ridge dominating much
of the west-central U.S. into next week while multiple shortwaves
push downstream to sustain general troughing across the
Midwest/Northeast, where models continue to struggle with
resolving the various shortwave interactions and arrive at a
common and stable solution. Rain associated with wavy and slow
moving fronts can be expected to spread mainly from the
Midwest/Great Lakes to the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic with
considerable uncertainty in its timing and intensity. Meanwhile,
lead scattered thunderstorms can also be expected to push slowly
south into the Southeast by midweek. In addition, the National
Hurricane Center continues to monitor the potential for tropical
cyclone formation east of northern Florida. The disturbance may
intensify and drift toward the southeast U.S. coast early to
middle of next week along with deepened moisture availability to
fuel local downpours.

Meanwhile, a heatwave is forecast to peak Tuesday for the northern
Plains/Rockies and into the northern Great Basin. High
temperatures for the northern Plains are forecast to exceed 100F
into Tuesday and Wednesday, likely producing some record values.
Gradual moderation is forecast for the north-central U.S. later
next week, but it appears that anomalous heat will once again
intensify across the interior Pacific Northwest.

An upper low drifting offshore into the Pacific and the
strengthening of the west-central U.S. upper ridge into next week
should act to spread moisture to the north and west out from the
Southwest. Expect modest monsoonal activity will extend into
California, the Great Basin, then northward and onward into the
Rockies then Plains.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern evolution at mid-larger scales overall
seems to offer slightly above average predictability Days 3-7.
However, the least certain mass field part of the forecast remains
across the Midwest/Northeast where models continue to struggle
with resolving the various shortwave interactions converging along
a mean trough. A wide variety of solutions regarding the timing
and intensity of the upper trough and surface based low pressure
system developments. Prefer an upper trough amplitude at least on
the more amplified side of the full guidance envelope given the
staying power and amplitude of the building upstream upper ridge.
Of the models, a blend of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF seems to
best provide this. In view of forecast spread, also recommend
inclusion of the 18 UTC GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble means to
the composite along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models.
Respective 00 UTC models stayed in line.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 PM CDT Sat Jul 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track with low potential for robust or
widespread fire weather concerns. Localized elevated conditions are
possible across parts of the northern Great Basin, central and
eastern Wyoming, and western/central Montana. However, weak winds
aloft and a meager surface pressure pattern will limit the potential
for widespread strong winds.

..Moore.. 07/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Sat Jul 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper level ridge is expected to persist across the western CONUS
on Sunday with mostly weak winds expected across most regions with
dry fuels. Significant monsoon thunderstorm activity should continue
across the Southwest but will once again remain where fuels are wet
and PWAT values are highest. Therefore, the weak winds and lack of
lightning over dry fuels precludes overall fire weather concern on
Sunday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat July 24 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

426 PM EDT Sat Jul 24 2021

Valid 00Z Sun Jul 25 2021 - 00Z Tue Jul 27 2021

...Main monsoon activity to continue over the Desert Southwest
through Monday...

...Severe weather possible today over the Great Lakes...

...Hot and humid weather over the Plains and Southeast today;
Excessive Heat continues over Southeast Montana through Tuesday ...

The active monsoon pattern persists over the Desert Southwest and
Great Basin, with widespread showers and thunderstorms evident on
satellite and RADAR imagery this afternoon ahead of a west moving
upper disturbance. Many locations across the Southwest are
vulnerable to additional heavy rain (particularly burn scar
areas), with many areas having received well above normal
precipitation over the past week. A Moderate Risk of Excessive
Rainfall remains in effect through tomorrow morning over
West-Central Arizona and Southwest New Mexico, where areal
rainfall averages of 1-2+ inches and local amounts exceeding 4
inches are possible. More showers and thunderstorms are likely
through late Sunday-Monday before the activity drops off, as the
main monsoon moisture moves slowly north and the aforementioned
disturbance slides to the west. A Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall accordingly extends from Central Arizona into South
Utah/Nevada beginning tomorrow morning through Monday. Flash Flood
Watches that cover much of Arizona, West New Mexico, and Southwest
Colorado are currently set to expire Sunday night.

Over the Midwest, a cold front analyzed across the Northern Plains
is forecast to extend southeast over the Northern Ohio
Valley/Midwest by tonight. Ahead of the front, thunderstorm
development is just underway, and a Severe Thunderstorm Watch is
in effect over Central Michigan. A Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms today runs over much of Michigan to west of the
Chicago Metro, with primary threats including damaging winds and
isolated tornadoes. On the periphery of the storm activity, hot
and humid conditions are the foremost concern; Heat Advisories dot
the Plains through tomorrow as heat indices of 105-110 are
expected. The urban heat effect will likely worsen conditions, and
the Kansas City Metro remains under an Excessive Heat Warning
until Wednesday evening. A separate Heat Advisory also remains
over the Southeast including portions of Louisiana and Mississippi
through today with heat indices approaching 112. Meanwhile,
Southeast Montana is under an Excessive Heat Watch through
Tuesday, with dangerous triple digit highs approaching 110
possible. In addition to the heat, air quality remains a serious
concern in the region as smoke from wildfires blows downstream;
Air Quality Alerts remain over portions of southern Montana and
western Wyoming.

East of Florida, the National Hurricane Center continues to
monitor the potential for tropical storm formation with an area of
disturbed weather. Conditions are noted to be marginally conducive
for marginal development, but development is possible as the
disturbance moves west toward land. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane
Hunter is en route to investigate the disturbance. Users are
encouraged to monitor the National Hurricane Center for the latest
forecast information with this disturbance.

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Models and ensembles consolidate a closed upper high down over the
central Plains mid-later this week, with ridging spreading back to
the north-central Intermountain West. The best chance for record
high maximum/minimum temperatures may be over the Great Plains
midweek, but record high minimum temperatures will occur across
the Great Basin/Rockies into late week and eventually the West
Coast by the weekend as moisture lifts across the region between
the ridge/closed high and amplifying eastern Pacific troughing.
Expect increasing chances for monsoonal rainfall will extend from
the Southwest/California to the Great Basin and Rockies.

Meanwhile, multiple shortwaves will dig downstream from the ridge
to amplify a mean upper trough over the Midwest/Northeast. Strong
convection and locally heavy downpours may periodically focus with
moisture/instability pooling near wavy and slow moving fronts and
meso-boundaries under favorable upper support. Frontal progression
should shift best focused rainfall chances from the Midwest/Great
Lakes through the northern Mid-Atlantic midweek to from the
Mid-South through the Carolinas by the weekend.

The medium range pattern evolution at mid-larger scales overall
seems to offer slightly above average predictability Days 3-7.
However, the least certain mass field part of the forecast remains
across the Midwest/Northeast where models continue to struggle
with resolving the various shortwave interactions within a mean
trough position. A variety of solutions unfold over time with
regards to the timing and intensity of shortwaves withing the
upper trough and surface low pressure system developments.
However, an overall trend in guidance over the last few days to
develop an unseasonably amplified upper trough seems reasonable
considering the strength of the upstream ridge. Accordingly, the
WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from
composite blend of the latest GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with
the National Blend of Models for days 3/4 (Wed/Thu) before
focusing more on GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means days 5-7 amid growing
forecast spread with flow embedded features.

225 AM EDT Sun Jul 25 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Jul 28 2021 - 12Z Sun Aug 01 2021

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Models and ensembles consolidate a closed upper high down over the
central Plains mid-later this week, with ridging spreading back to
the north-central Intermountain West. The best chance for record
high maximum/minimum temperatures may be over the Great Plains
midweek, but record high minimum temperatures will occur across
the Great Basin/Rockies into late week and eventually the West
Coast by the weekend as moisture lifts across the region between
the ridge/closed high and amplifying eastern Pacific troughing.
Expect increasing chances for monsoonal rainfall will extend from
the Southwest/California to the Great Basin and Rockies.

Meanwhile, multiple shortwaves will dig downstream from the ridge
to amplify a mean upper trough over the Midwest/Northeast. Strong
convection and locally heavy downpours may periodically focus with
moisture/instability pooling near wavy and slow moving fronts and
meso-boundaries under favorable upper support. Frontal progression
should shift best focused rainfall chances from the Midwest/Great
Lakes through the northern Mid-Atlantic midweek to from the
Mid-South through the Carolinas by the weekend.

Underneath, the National Hurricane Center continues to monitor
potential for short range tropical cyclone formation east of
northern Florida. The disturbance may intensify and drift inland
to the Gulf Coast midweek with deepened moisture to fuel local
downpours.

0211 AM CDT Sun Jul 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The western CONUS ridge will continue to amplify on Monday. This
will keep winds light across most of the western CONUS. The
monsoonal moisture plume across the Southwest will start to move up
the California coast on Monday.  As a result, some thunderstorms may
be possible in northern California and south-central Oregon. Have
not added an isolated dry thunderstorm area at this time as storm
coverage still remains uncertain. However, one may be needed,
especially if 12Z CAM guidance shows more than a storm or two in the
area. Fuels are very dry with ERC percentiles near record, so
ignition efficiency may be quite high. Therefore, this dry lightning
potential will be watched closely.

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
Winds will be mostly light across the western CONUS beneath the
upper-level ridge. Some stronger mid-level northwesterly flow will
be present across the northern Great Plains this afternoon. At the
surface, deep mixing is anticipated across northern Minnesota with
may bring some of this stronger flow to the surface. Winds are
forecast around 15 mph during the afternoon hours with relative
humidity around 17 to 22 percent. Fuels are quite dry in this region
with ERC around the 92 to 95th percentile. Therefore, an elevated
delineation appears warranted.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southwest through Monday morning...

...Excessive Heat Warning over parts of Idaho and eastern Oregon...

...Excessive Heat Watch over parts of the Northern High Plains;
Heat Advisory over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley/Southern
Plains...

Monsoonal moisture and upper-level energy will aid in producing
showers and thunderstorms, and some will produce heavy rain over
the Southwest and the Central/Southern Rockies through Tuesday.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable through Monday morning.
However, the excessive rainfall threat is starting to lessen from
Sunday into Tuesday as the monsoonal moisture decreases.

A front extending from the Lower Great Lakes to the Middle
Mississippi Valley then into the Northern High Plains will move
off to the Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic Coast while extending
from the southern Mid-Atlantic across the Ohio Valley into the
Northern Plains by Tuesday.  Showers and thunderstorms will
develop along and ahead of the boundary over Northeast to the Ohio
Valley and the Lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday. The
thunderstorms over the Northeast into the Ohio Valley will be
strong to severe on Sunday. The showers and thunderstorms will
move off Northeast Coast while continuing over the Mid-Atlantic to
parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday.  As the front
continues to move southward, showers and thunderstorms will
develop over parts of the Southeast to the Lower Mississippi
Valley on Monday night into Tuesday.

Meanwhile, there is an Excessive Heat Warning over parts of Idaho
and eastern Oregon, where temperatures rise into the 100s through
Sunday. The 100s will move into Northern Plains and Northern High
Plains on Monday and Tuesday.  Furthermore, Heat Advisories are
currently in effect for portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley
and parts of the Southern Plains, while an Excessive Heat Warning
affects the Kansas City metro area. Additionally, several regions
have Air Quality Alerts due to wildfires over the Northwest into
the Northern Rockies.

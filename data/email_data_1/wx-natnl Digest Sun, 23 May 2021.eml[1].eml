Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1028 AM CDT Sat May 22 2021

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA AND WESTERN NEW
MEXICO INTO FAR SOUTHEAST UTAH AND FAR SOUTHWEST COLORADO...

An Elevated risk is introduced for west-central Florida where
morning observations show sustained winds already reaching 10-15 mph
and relative humidity values falling into the upper 40s and low 50s.
Morning hi-res guidance has come in with a slightly better signal
for widespread winds near 15 mph across the FL peninsula. Coupled
with afternoon RH values in the 35-40% range, this should support
areas of persistent elevated conditions this afternoon.

...Arizona/New Mexico...
The forecast generally remains on track as a surface low slowly
deepens over eastern AZ. Critical conditions remain most likely
across south-east and north-east AZ where the strongest winds are
expected. The eastern and northern extent of the fire weather threat
remains somewhat uncertain due to light precipitation and cloud
cover. Morning fuel analyses show pockets of slightly recovered fine
fuels where wetting rain fell yesterday, indicating that the fire
weather threat may be locally dependent on fuel status. However,
this rain was not widespread enough to mitigate the fire weather
potential for the overall region. See the discussion below for
additional details.

..Moore.. 05/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0107 AM CDT Sat May 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
Slow eastward progression of the upper-level trough in the West will
bring another day of fire weather concerns for parts of the southern
Great Basin into the Southwest today. A Four Corners surface trough
will develop during the day and further enhance winds across the
region. Warm and dry conditions will remain in the eastern CONUS
under the influence of an upper-level ridge.

...Arizona/New Mexico...
The strongest winds are expected to occur in eastern Arizona into
western New Mexico where the mid-level jet will be overhead during
the afternoon. Surface winds of 20-25 mph appear probable with some
areas potentially seeing locally higher speeds. RH of around 15%
will occur at lower elevations. Higher terrain will areas will not
be as dry, though will be similarly windy. Surrounding areas to the
north and east are likely to see elevated fire weather. Critical
conditions are not expected given combinations of lighter winds,
cloud cover, and higher RH.

...Western Florida Peninsula...
With the surface ridge axis moving into the region, winds should
trend lighter than on Friday. However, areas of lowered RH near the
coast are possible. Given very dry fuels, areas of locally elevated
concerns could develop where winds do maintain 10-15 mph into the
afternoon.

...Record heat likely for portions of the Southeast/southern
Mid-Atlantic next week...

...Overview...

An upper low near the Davis Strait will retrograde toward the
Canadian Archipelago next week, which favors a low-amplitude
trough/ridge pattern across the lower 48. Heights will generally
be near to above normal over all of the CONUS by late next week
which will translate to surface temperature as well. Over the
East, record highs well into the 90s to around 100F are likely for
portions of the Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic. A backdoor front
may cool some areas briefly in the otherwise very warm pattern.
Rainfall will be focused over the Plains to the Midwest/Great
Lakes.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest deterministic models continue to show some trouble
forming a consensus on timing of the incoming cold front and upper
trough or weak upper low into the Northwest on Tuesday. The 06z
GFS is better on timing but is a bit north of the consensus with
the vort center, while the CMC is noticeably faster than the rest
of the guidance. Late week into the East, the cold front may dip
into the southern Mid-Atlantic on Friday with perhaps a wave of
low pressure along the front draped back to the Plains. Low
confidence in the details as the models have little consistency
and the ensembles were rather undefined. Maintained a wavy front
astride the Ohio Valley that may lift back into the Northeast as
upper ridging attempts to build just offshore. Favor a ECMWF/UKMET
blend for this system, with smaller contributions from the GFS.
This also helped maintain some definition to the system later in
the period as more of the washed out ensemble means were
introduced to the blend. Upstream, the next system shows plenty of
unresolved details in the Gulf of Alaska which translates later
into the period as a cold front enters the West Thursday into
Friday. Again, the GFS and ECMWF show ok agreement on timing, but
did favor incorporation of the ensemble means by this point into
the blend to help mitigate some of the smaller scale differences.
This approach maintains fairly good agreement with the previous
WPC forecast as well.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall next week will likely be over the
central Plains to the Midwest and Great Lakes along a wavy frontal
boundary. Parts of the interior Northwest/northern Rockies will
see some light rain and high mountain snow with the Tuesday
system. As low pressure tries to form in the Central Plains on
Thursday, an area of organized and moderate to heavy rain could
shift through the north/central Plains into the Midwest though
plenty of uncertainty as it depends on strength of the upper level
feature. The cold front may touch off light to modest showers and
perhaps some thunderstorms elsewhere too. Some rainfall amounts
have the potential to be locally heavy in some
convectively-enhanced areas (generally over the southern/central
Plains) along the frontal boundary. Backdoor cold front in the
East may bring only light showers to some areas on its way south
or back north as a warm front.

Temperatures will be cool in the West to start, warm/hot in the
East, and within several degrees of normal in between. Coldest
anomalies of about 5 to 10 degrees below normal will be centered
from the Great Basin/Northwest to the High Plains/Upper Midwest
Tue-Thur. In the East, ahead of the backdoor cold front (or behind
the warm front as it advances back to the northeast), temperatures
may climb to 10-20F above normal. This will bring 80s/90s into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and 90s to near 100F over the Southeast.
Records highs are likely for some areas and could be widespread
over several states Tue-Wed along the I-75 and I-95 corridors,
respectively. Heat indices may be kept in check by dew points in
the 50s/60s through the week.

...Record heat likely for portions of the Southeast/southern
Mid-Atlantic next week...

...Overview...

An upper low near the Davis Strait will retrograde toward the
Canadian Archipelago next week, which favors a low-amplitude
trough/ridge pattern across the lower 48. Heights will generally
be near to above normal over all of the CONUS by late next week
which will translate to surface temperature as well. Over the
East, record highs well into the 90s to around 100F are likely for
portions of the Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic. A backdoor front
may cool some areas briefly in the otherwise very warm pattern.
Rainfall will be focused over the Plains to the Midwest/Great
Lakes.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest deterministic models continue to show some trouble
forming a consensus on timing of the incoming cold front and upper
trough or weak upper low into the Northwest on Tuesday. The 06z
GFS is better on timing but is a bit north of the consensus with
the vort center, while the CMC is noticeably faster than the rest
of the guidance. Late week into the East, the cold front may dip
into the southern Mid-Atlantic on Friday with perhaps a wave of
low pressure along the front draped back to the Plains. Low
confidence in the details as the models have little consistency
and the ensembles were rather undefined. Maintained a wavy front
astride the Ohio Valley that may lift back into the Northeast as
upper ridging attempts to build just offshore. Favor a ECMWF/UKMET
blend for this system, with smaller contributions from the GFS.
This also helped maintain some definition to the system later in
the period as more of the washed out ensemble means were
introduced to the blend. Upstream, the next system shows plenty of
unresolved details in the Gulf of Alaska which translates later
into the period as a cold front enters the West Thursday into
Friday. Again, the GFS and ECMWF show ok agreement on timing, but
did favor incorporation of the ensemble means by this point into
the blend to help mitigate some of the smaller scale differences.
This approach maintains fairly good agreement with the previous
WPC forecast as well.

...Big temperatures contrasts expected between the western, and
central to eastern U.S...

...Scattered Thunderstorms through the Plains will produce locally
heavy rains, isolated Flash Flooding and the risk of Severe
Weather...

...A Fire Weather threat to continue for portions of the
Southwest...

The mid to upper level flow will remain highly amplified across
the lower 48 over the next two days with a strong closed low
lifting northeast from the Great Basin and through the Northern
Rockies, while an upper level ridge along the Mississippi pushes
east into the Southeast.  In this flow regime, a strong frontal
boundary will separate much below average temperatures across the
Great Basin and Rockies region with much above average
temperatures from the Northern to Central Plains, eastward across
much of the Mississippi Valley and eastern U.S.  Temperatures are
expected to be 10 to 20 degrees below average on the cold side of
this front across the Great Basin and Rockies , while temperatures
will equally above average on the warm side of the front from the
Northern to Central Plains, eastward across much of the
Mississippi Valley and eastern U.S.  Some record high temperatures
are possible Sunday in the urban corridor from Boston to
Washington DC, where highs are forecast in the upper 80s to low
90s.   While temperatures are expected to be below average across
portions of the west, no records are forecast, although late
season snows are possible across portions of the Northern Rockies
on Sunday.

The above average temperature region will also encompass all of
the historical region of the Brood X periodic cicada.  This will
ensure addition warming of the soil and expansion of the regions
of emergence and continued active cicada singing where they have
already surfaced.

Above average levels of moisture expected to continue to stream
northward off the western Gulf of Mexico across much of the Plains
over the next two days along and ahead of the above mentioned
strong front.  This will support widespread scattered
thunderstorms through the Plains with locally heavy rains,
isolated flash flooding and the threat of severe weather.
Contrasting this will be a continued fire weather threat across
portions of the Southwest from southern to eastern Arizona,
western New Mexico and southern Utah where the combination of low
relative humidities and gusty winds will support a fire risk.

Only minor adjustments are needed based on recent ensemble guidance.
Areas of elevated fire weather conditions are possible from
south-central UT to western CO Sunday afternoon, but confidence in
sufficient overlap of favorably dry fuels and persistent elevated
wind/RH conditions is too low at this time for additional
highlights. See the discussion below for more details.

..Moore.. 05/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Sat May 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
The western upper-level trough will being to lift northeastward by
Sunday morning. Stronger surface and mid-level wind fields will
shift north and east along with the trough. Very dry air will remain
across the Southwest. With a modest lee trough and adequate, but
decreasing, mid-level flow aloft, an area of elevated fire weather
may develop in parts of southwestern and central New Mexico. A
fairly typical setup of 15-20 mph winds will overlap with 10-15% RH
during the afternoon. Stronger winds are more likely to occur
farther north and east where the mid-level jet will be more
favorably timed with peak heating. However, these areas already have
less receptive fuels and are expected to see more precipitation on
Saturday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat May 22 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Valid 12Z Wed May 26 2021 - 12Z Sun May 30 2021

...Record heat likely for portions of the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic
Wednesday...

...Overview...

Upper pattern will feature quasi-zonal flow with relative lower
amplitude waves in a trough/ridge orientation over the West/East,
respectively. This will favor well above normal temperatures in
parts of the East/Southeast and cooler than normal temperatures
for parts of the High Plains to the Upper Midwest. In between,
rainfall will be focused around a wavy frontal boundary.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Aside from the 12Z Canadian, the GFS/ECMWF/UKMET offered
reasonable clustering near their ensemble means with the first
half of the forecast. In question has been upstream flow south of
Alaska into the Pacific Northwest, but this uncertainty has
narrowed in recent runs. By next weekend, ensemble spread
increased (as expected) but was within typical limits. The
GFS/GEFS were generally quicker than the ECMWF/ECMWF ensembles and
Canadian ensembles in the West but were not unreasonable given the
flow. However, favored the slower ECMWF/ECMWF and Canadian
ensembles by about 3:1 to the GEFS with a tendency for some
individual systems to lag behind despite the overall progressive
pattern.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall during the period will likely be over
the central Plains to the Midwest and Great Lakes along a wavy
frontal boundary. Parts of the northern Rockies and High Plains
will see some light rain and high mountain snow with the Wednesday
system. As low pressure moves through the Central Plains on
Thursday, an area of organized and moderate to heavy rain could
shift through the northern/central Plains into the Midwest. The
cold front may touch off light to modest showers and perhaps some
thunderstorms in the warm air mass or just north of the frontal
zone. Some rainfall amounts have the potential to be locally heavy
in some convectively-enhanced areas (generally over the
southern/central Plains). Areas in the East may see some light
showers as the front ebbs and flows.

Temperatures will be cool in the High Plains to Upper Midwest
Wed-Fri, warm/hot in the East (Wed) and Southeast (Wed-Fri), and
within several degrees of normal in between. Coldest anomalies of
about 5 to 15 degrees below normal will be centered from eastern
Montana to northern Minnesota Wed-Thu. In the East temperatures
may climb to 10-20F above normal which will bring 80s/90s into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and 90s to near 100F over the Southeast on
Wednesday. Record highs are likely in some areas along the I-95
corridor (Georgia to New Jersey). Heat indices may be kept in
check by dew points in the 50s/60s through the week. Temperatures
will cool back toward more typical late May values for Fri-Sun
(Memorial Day weekend) but along with increased rain chances.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 AM CDT Sun May 23 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
The western upper-level trough will move northeastward today and
eventually emerge onto the central and northern Plains late in the
afternoon. The strongest lee troughing will be ahead of the main
synoptic wave in the northern Plains, though a weaker surface trough
will extend into the Trans-Pecos. Fire weather concerns are expected
to be maximized in parts of southwestern and central New Mexico
where a belt of stronger mid-level flow will exist during the
afternoon. Downward momentum transfer and a surface trough to the
east will promote 15-20 mph winds within a dry airmass (5-15% RH)
bringing elevated fire weather during the afternoon. Locally
critical conditions are possible in central New Mexico. Strong winds
and dry conditions will extend into northeast New Mexico and
southeast Colorado. However, these areas have less receptive fuels
and also observed rainfall on Saturday.

Locally elevated conditions are possible in portions of southeastern
Utah. These conditions are likely to be tied more to terrain-favored
locations given weaker flow aloft and a less favorable surface
pattern than Saturday. Furthermore, precipitation from Saturday will
have impacted some of the dry fuels there.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough over the central/northern Plains will continue
to lift northeastward during the day. Weaker, zonal flow will exist
over much of the Southwestern U.S. A weak lee trough may induce
locally elevated conditions in parts of New Mexico during the
afternoon, but conditions should be spatially limited. Dry
conditions will remain in the remainder of the Southwest and
southern Great Basin. Flow at the surface and aloft will be too weak
for fire weather concerns in these regions.

...Another round of late-season snow moving into the northern
Rockies as above normal temperatures lingers across the northern
Plains to parts of the eastern U.S...

...Scattered Thunderstorms through the Plains will produce locally
heavy rains, isolated Flash Flooding and the risk of Severe
Weather...

The mid to upper level flow will remain highly amplified across
the lower 48 over the next two days with a strong closed low
lifting northeast from the Great Basin and through the Northern
Rockies, while an upper level ridge along the Mississippi pushes
east into the Southeast.  In this flow regime, a low pressure
system is forecast to intensify as it lifts northward through the
Rockies today.  This will bring another round of mountain snow
across the northern Rockies with a soaking cold rain for the lower
elevations, possibly mixing with wet snow into tonight.  The
intensifying low will also push a strong frontal boundary across
the High Plains where thunderstorms could become severe today and
into tonight.  The low pressure system should continue to move
north into the Canadian prairies on Monday but the snow will be
slow to taper off in the northern Rockies as winds become strong
and gusty from the west to northwest.  The strong winds will then
spread eastward across the northern Plains by Tuesday as the low
begins to move eastward.

Farther south across the Plains, the threat of severe
thunderstorms should diminish slightly on Monday as the main
energy associated with the low lifts into southern Canada.
However, the tropical plume of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico
remains open for the next few days as winds continue to circulate
around a large high pressure system over the eastern U.S.  This
will support at least scattered thunderstorms from the western
Gulf Coast up across many of the Plains states into Tuesday.  This
may lead to locally heavy rains, isolated flash flooding and
continued threat of severe weather.

Given this highly amplified weather pattern, temperatures are
expected to be 10 to 20 degrees below average in the West in
contrast with equally above average temperatures from the northern
to central Plains eastward across much of the Mississippi Valley
and eastern U.S.  Some record high temperatures are possible today
in the urban corridor from Boston to Washington DC, where highs
are forecast in the upper 80s to low 90s. Meanwhile, the fire
weather threat across portions of the Four-Corner region should
gradually diminish as the low pressure system moves away.

Interestingly, the above average temperature region will also
encompass all of the historical region of the Brood X periodic
cicada.  This will ensure additional warming of the soil and
expansion of the regions of emergence and continued active cicada
singing where they have already surfaced.

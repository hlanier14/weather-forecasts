Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1046 AM CDT Fri May 21 2021

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN ARIZONA INTO UTAH...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR WEST CENTRAL FLORIDA...

A Critical risk area is introduced for portions of west-central
Florida for this afternoon. Morning surface observations show RH
values already falling into the mid to upper 40s with sustained
winds near 15 mph and frequent gusts between 20-30 mph. Most
guidance suggests these winds will be maintained through the
afternoon hours as RH values fall to near 35%. Although relative
humidity may be borderline for many locations, the combination of
strong winds, very dry fuels, and recent wildfire activity (a 1800
acre fire was reported yesterday in central FL) support the Critical
delineation. Peripheral areas within the Elevated risk may
experience transient critical conditions, but confidence in
widespread RH at or below 35% is lower.

...Northern Arizona into Utah...
Precipitation and cloud cover within a plume of Pacific moisture has
resulted in light rainfall reaching the surface and RH values in the
30-50% range across eastern AZ into the UT/CO region. The Elevated
risk area has been adjusted accordingly to account for these trends,
but the degree of warming/drying that will take place this afternoon
on the eastern and northern extent of the risk area is uncertain.
Most of the Critical risk area will remain within the dry slot and
is still expected to see critical fire weather conditions this
afternoon. Elsewhere, only minor adjustments based on recent
ensemble guidance and observations were needed.

..Moore.. 05/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1240 AM CDT Fri May 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper trough in the West will move slowly eastward today. The
ridge across the east will generally remain in place with some
modest intensification during the day. Fire weather concerns will
again be primarily focused in the parts of the Great Basin and
Southwest.

...Northern Arizona into Utah...
The mid-level jet is forecast to intensify across the region during
the afternoon. Very dry and windy conditions will develop,
particularly within lower elevations. Some locations will have RH
that approaches 5% with the broader region more likely to see
10-15%. Winds of 20-30 are expected. Locally higher winds may also
occur. Potential precipitation and cloud cover will limit concerns
to the east with an approaching cold front limiting concerns to the
west.

...California Central Valley...
A modest northerly pressure gradient will combine with strong
along-valley flow aloft to elevated fire weather concerns during the
afternoon. RH of 15-20% will overlap with 15-20 mph winds. Dry
fuels/very high ERCs will support fire spread.

...Southern/eastern New Mexico into southeast Colorado...
Strong surface winds are expected to develop west of the lee trough.
Winds will reach 15-20 mph across much of southern/central New
Mexico. Higher wind speeds (20-30 mph) are possible farther north
into Colorado given the proximity to the mid-level jet and surface
low. Fuels will be driest with southern extent, but critical
meteorological conditions over more modestly receptive fuels to the
north will still elevate concerns.

...Western Florida Peninsula...
Under the influence of an upper ridge, much of Florida has seen
little rainfall over the past week. ERCs in much of the Peninsula
have risen above the 90th percentile with the west-central coast
above the 97th percentile. Recent large fire activity further
suggests available fuels. During the day, the ridge aloft will
intensify across the Southeast and lead to enhanced easterly winds
across the Peninsula. 10-15 mph winds appear probable with the
potential for higher wind gusts. RH will is expected to drop to
25-35% along and near the coast during the afternoon. Fire weather
concerns will be elevated to near critical.

...Record heat likely for portions of the Southeast/southern
Mid-Atlantic next week...

1800 UTC Update...

Not much has changed with the latest model runs from the previous
shift. The medium range period (Monday-Friday) continues to
feature a trough holding in the West, while the Eastern U.S. bakes
underneath of an amplified ridge. For many from the Southeast into
the Mid-Atlantic, this will be the first major heat wave of the
season. Models are in good agreement with the overall pattern for
roughly the first half of the week, but continue to show
uncertainty in the embedded flow details of broad Western U.S.
troughing. This cycle of the WPC forecast leaned heavily on the
deterministic runs (ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET) through day 4,
transitioning to majority ensembles by day 7, with some modest
inclusion of the ECMWF/GFS for added system definition. This
maintains excellent continuity with the previous forecast so only
minor adjustments were needed. See previous discussion attached
below for more details on the pattern and the associated weather
hazards.

...Overview...

Upper lows in the Bering Sea and near the Davis Strait favor a
trough/ridge pattern across the lower 48 next week. This will
maintain a cool and showery (even snowy) regime over the interior
West behind a frontal system moving ashore early in the week. Over
the East, ridging will promote hot and dry conditions over the
Southeast with record highs well into the 90s to around 100F. A
backdoor front may cool some areas of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic
in the otherwise very warm pattern. Rainfall will be focused over
the Plains and northern tier until a cold front pushes
southeastward late in the week.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the deterministic models formed a
reasonable blended solution despite their differences in timing
into the West early in the week. The GFS runs have been generally
quicker but within the ensemble spread, and this was balanced by
the slower ECMWF/Canadian. To the east, quicker trend in all the
guidance with low pressure through southern Canada (and warm
fronts just over the border), but less change near the inflection
point between the backdoor cold front into NC Mon-Tue. By later in
the week, relied on 50/50 model/ensemble blend, as the West will
likely see smaller wavelength features dive through/into the broad
trough, but predictability is low. In the East, still expect high
pressure out of Canada to help push the cold front southeastward
into the Carolinas by late next Thu into next Fri, lingering the
boundary across the Plains.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall next week will likely be over the
central Plains to the Midwest as well as the interior
Northwest/northern Rockies. Incoming front into the Pacific
Northwest and the slowly-moving cold front out of the northern
Plains will touch off light to modest showers and perhaps some
thunderstorms east of the Rockies. Some snow is possible over the
highest elevations, with snow levels lowering a bit underneath the
upper trough. Amounts have the potential to be locally heavy in
some convectively-enhanced areas (over the Plains) along the
frontal boundary. Backdoor cold front in the East may bring only
light showers to some areas. By later in the week, approaching
cold front could support more organized showers and perhaps a
storm.

Temperatures will be cool in the West, warm/hot in the East, and
within several degrees of normal in between. Coldest anomalies in
the West may be early in the week  where readings of 5-15F below
normal will moderate a bit to about 5 degrees below normal by the
end of the week. In the East, ahead of the backdoor cold front (or
behind the warm front as it advances back to the northeast),
temperatures may climb to 10-20F above normal. This will bring
80s/90s into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and 90s to near 100F over
the Southeast. Records highs are likely for some areas and could
be widespread over several states Mon-Wed. Heat indices may be
kept in check by dew points in the 50s/60s through the week.

N_dVTSxMg0I$

FOR SATURDAY MAY 29 - FRIDAY JUNE 04: Compared to yesterday's guidance, bet=
ter
agreement exists between the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF 500-hPa height anomaly
forecasts over the CONUS. During the early portion of the period, both mode=
ls
feature anomalous mid-level ridging over the East Pacific and over the east=
ern
CONUS, with troughing in-between these two positive height centers aloft
across
the Rockies and into the Northern Plains. This troughing is more pronounced
further south in the ECMWF than the GEFS ensembles with 582-dam mean height=
s
reaching as far as Baja California on day 10 (May 31). Since earlier this
week,
the mean week-2 mid-level positive height centers appear to be slightly mor=
e
amplified over the CONUS in the dynamical models, which increases confidenc=
e
for anomalously warm temperatures across the western and eastern CONUS duri=
ng
week-2. Similarly, the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favor more amplified trough=
ing
centered over the Aleutians, which combined with anomalous ridging over the
East Pacific, is expected to promote enhanced onshore flow and possibly hea=
vy
precipitation over the southern Alaskan Mainland and Panhandle.



Heading into the start of the period, mean surface low pressure is featured=
 in
the 0z and 6z GEFS across the Plains, where guidance continues to depict
southerly flow advecting Gulf moisture into the central CONUS to increase t=
he
potential for heavy precipitation over the Plains and the Mississippi Valle=
y.
In spite of this favorable pattern, there is disagreement among today's mod=
el
runs in regards to the location of the highest mean precipitation totals, a=
nd
there is also reduced support in the reforecast tools compared to yesterday=
's
guidance early in the period. While the GEFS reforecast tool shows little t=
o
no
signal for heavy precipitation potential, the ECMWF reforecast tool continu=
es
to maintain at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding
the
85th percentile and 1 inch focused over the Central and Southern Plains
through
the middle portion of week-2. In consideration of the persistently wet patt=
ern
and the ongoing risk of flooding and river inundation over the south-centra=
l
CONUS, this region likely remains susceptible to any enhancement in rainfal=
l
and the slight risk area for heavy precipitation is maintained for May 29 t=
o
Jun 1. The spatial extent of this hazard area is reduced to align more with
the
ECMWF reforecast tool relative to yesterday's outlook. In addition, the
National Hurricane Center (NHC) is currently monitoring a potential tropica=
l
cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico which may bring heavy rainfall to many alread=
y
saturated parts of southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana. Thus, a
possible flooding hazard also remains issued over these areas as the observ=
ed
minor to moderate river flooding may persist into week-2.



Tied to the aforementioned anomalous ridging aloft over the eastern CONUS,
some
the strongest signals for anomalously warm temperatures are depicted across
the
southeastern CONUS early in the period. Here, the ECMWF reforecast tool
indicates at least a 40% chance for maximum daytime temperatures exceeding =
the
85th percentile and 95 degrees F over parts of Florida, Georgia and South
Carolina. Although unseasonably hot for late May, dewpoint temperatures are
likely to remain below 70 degrees F which should keep heat index values bel=
ow
hazard thresholds to allay excessive heat concerns and no corresponding
hazards
are posted. However, it is worth noting that in the absence of enhanced
precipitation observed, the above-normal temperatures are likely to worsen =
D0
and D1 drought conditions currently being felt over the eastern Carolinas.
Farther west, increasing signals for anomalous warmth are also favored in t=
he
ensemble guidance over northern California and the Pacific Northwest by the
middle portion of week-2. There is good agreement between the GEFS and ECMW=
F
reforecast tools depicting elevated probabilities for maximum daily
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile, however these temperatures are =
not
expected to exceed hazardous thresholds and no hazards are posted in the
outlook. The continued amplification of the mid-level ridging favored in th=
e
models over the region does bear monitoring for upcoming hazard outlooks.



Over Alaska, there is good agreement among the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
favoring anomalous troughing over the Aleutians to promote enhanced onshore
flow and above-normal precipitation across the southern portion of the stat=
e.
Compared to yesterday, reforecast tools feature a larger coverage of
probabilities for 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile
over the southern Mainland and the Panhandle, but these amounts remain
unlikely
to exceed hazardous thresholds, and no corresponding hazards are issued.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 PM CDT Fri May 21 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA AND WESTERN NEW
MEXICO...

Rain moving through the region today has resulted in a few areas of
0.1"+ accumulations from eastern AZ into northwest NM per MRMS
estimates. While this could mitigate fuel readiness to some degree
for a handful of locations (notably the Mogollon rim in central AZ
where the heaviest precipitation has fallen), most areas are
forecast to only receive light additional precipitation over the
next 24 hours. Any minor improvements to fuel moisture today/tonight
(outside of the heavier precipitation areas) will most likely be
negated by warm, dry, and windy conditions through the day tomorrow
and should be supportive of critical fire weather conditions. See
the discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 05/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0207 AM CDT Fri May 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
The western upper-level trough will continue to make eastward
progress on Saturday. Strong mid-level winds will remain across
parts of the Great Basin and Southwest. A surface trough in the Four
Corners will bring another day of critical fire weather to parts of
Arizona and New Mexico.

...Eastern Arizona and western New Mexico...
The mid-level jet will remain overhead during the day. An
intensifying surface pressure gradient will combine with strong
mid-level winds mixing to the surface to produce 20-25 mph winds in
the AZ/NM border vicinity. RH will be lowest in the valleys, with
most areas seeing around 10-15%. Critical fire weather conditions
are expected in these areas. Within the higher terrain, confidence
in critical fire weather will be lower given potential precipitation
on Friday and higher RH values on Saturday. Away from the mid-level
jet core, elevated conditions will be possible into eastern Utah and
western Colorado. Lighter winds (15-20 mph) will overlap with 15-20%
RH to produce elevated fire weather conditions.

...Western Florida Peninsula...
A somewhat similar atmospheric pattern to Friday will exist on
Saturday. Easterly winds and relatively dry conditions are expected
during the afternoon. While some locally elevated conditions are
possible near the coast, the surface ridge moving overhead is
expected to weaken the gradient enough such that wind speeds will be
too light for highlights.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri May 21 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 27 - 31 2021

Today's model solutions agree on the general features of the predicted 500-=
hPa
pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day
period. However, there is increasing uncertainty and divergence in the mode=
l
forecasts, as the pattern transitions. Most dynamical model solutions forec=
ast
a trough over the North Pacific near the Aleutians and ridging over eastern
areas of the North Pacific, extending through eastern Mainland Alaska in th=
e
GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means. Downstream, a trough is forecast
over
the western CONUS, and enhanced ridging is predicted over the south-central
and
eastern CONUS. The high resolution 0Z ECMWF model run depicts a transition =
to
troughing over the eastern North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska and downstream
ridging across the entire CONUS. The Canadian ensemble mean was given less
weight today in the manual blend, as it is an outlier, predicting a highly
amplified ridge over the eastern North Pacific and a greater amplitude trou=
gh
and ridge pattern over the CONUS.

The manual blend of models forecasts near normal heights over much of the
western CONUS, associated with the predicted trough. Below normal heights a=
re
predicted over the Aleutians and much of Mainland Alaska, as ridging over t=
he
North Pacific flattens and troughing over the Aleutians extends eastward,
relative to yesterdays forecasts. Above normal heights are also predicted f=
rom
the Southern Plains extending across most of the eastern CONUS, under the
predicted ridging.

Near to above normal temperatures are predicted for the eastern Aleutians, =
as
well as western and northern Alaska associated with enhanced southerly flow=
.
Onshore flow and cloud cover lead to increased chances of below normal
temperatures for parts of the south coast of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle. Troughing favors near to below normal temperatures for much of t=
he
western third of the CONUS, while above normal temperatures are favored for
parts of Northern California and Nevada, under the influence of the Pacific
ridge. A broad ridge predicted over the south-central and eastern CONUS fav=
ors
above normal temperatures for these regions, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the western Aleutians and Bering Sea and associated
onshore flow leads to increased chances of above normal precipitation for
southwestern Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Anomalous northerly flow lead=
s
to
increased probabilities of below normal precipitation for northern and cent=
ral
areas of the western CONUS. Below normal precipitation is also favored for =
the
Southwest CONUS and High Plains, supported by the precipitation consolidati=
on
tool. Increased probabilities of above normal precipitation are indicated f=
rom
eastern areas of the Great Plains across the Central and Upper Mississippi
Valley into the Midwest, under southerly flow ahead of mean troughing.
Enhanced
ridging increases probabilities of below normal precipitation over parts of
the
Southeast, while near normal is favored for the Mid-Atlantic and the
Northeast,
where precipitation tools are uncertain.

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 10% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
generally good agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by
differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 29 - JUN 04, 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is forecast by the GEFS a=
nd
ECMWF ensemble means to shift eastward relative to the 6-10 day period. The
Canadian ensemble continues to be an outlier in the week 2 period, and was
weighted less in the forecast. Troughing over the Aleutians shifts eastward
relative to the 6-10 day period, while above normal heights extend into the
western CONUS from the eastern North Pacific. A weakening 500-hPa trough is
forecast over the western CONUS by the GEFS ensemble mean, while the ECMWF
ensemble mean places troughing further to the east. Ridging is forecast ove=
r
most of the eastern CONUS, in most model solutions, with positive 500-hPa
height anomalies.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across much of
northern
Mainland Alaska and parts of the Aleutians, associated with enhanced mid-le=
vel
southerly flow ahead of a predicted trough. Below normal temperatures are
favored for parts of the south coast of Mainland Alaska and the northern
Alaska
Panhandle, associated with cloud cover due to onshore flow. While differenc=
es
between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble mean circulation forecasts leads to
uncertainty among temperature tools, above normal temperatures are favored
across almost the entire CONUS, as indicated in the temperature consolidati=
on
tool, with the exception of South Texas. Below normal temperatures are favo=
red
over parts of South Texas, as supported by dynamical model temperature
forecasts, related to onshore surface flow. Above normal heights over the
western CONUS increase the probability of above normal temperature for this
region. Probabilities of above normal temperatures exceed 50 percent for mo=
st
of the eastern CONUS associated with ridging and consistent with the
temperature consolidation.

Above normal precipitation is favored for southern and central Mainland Ala=
ska
and the Alaska Panhandle, due to onshore flow. Near to below normal
precipitation is likely over much of the western CONUS, under positive 500-=
hPa
height anomalies extending eastward from the predicted ridge over the Pacif=
ic.
Chances of above normal precipitation are slightly enhanced over parts of t=
he
Central Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes region, and much =
of
the eastern CONUS, excluding the Gulf Coast, related to potential storm
systems
ahead of troughing and anomalous southerly flow, consistent with the
precipitation consolidation tool. Below normal precipitation is favored for
parts of the central and eastern Gulf Coast under predicted ridging, as
indicated by most dynamical model forecasts.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
fair agreement among models on the overall circulation pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty, weak anomalies, and differences among the temperatu=
re
and precipitation forecast tools.

...Record heat likely for portions of the Southeast/southern
Mid-Atlantic next week...

1800 UTC Update...

Not much has changed with the latest model runs from the previous
shift. The medium range period (Monday-Friday) continues to
feature a trough holding in the West, while the Eastern U.S. bakes
underneath of an amplified ridge. For many from the Southeast into
the Mid-Atlantic, this will be the first major heat wave of the
season. Models are in good agreement with the overall pattern for
roughly the first half of the week, but continue to show
uncertainty in the embedded flow details of broad Western U.S.
troughing. This cycle of the WPC forecast leaned heavily on the
deterministic runs (ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET) through day 4,
transitioning to majority ensembles by day 7, with some modest
inclusion of the ECMWF/GFS for added system definition. This
maintains excellent continuity with the previous forecast so only
minor adjustments were needed. See previous discussion attached
below for more details on the pattern and the associated weather
hazards.

Santorelli


Previous discussion issued at 0627 UTC...

...Overview...

Upper lows in the Bering Sea and near the Davis Strait favor a
trough/ridge pattern across the lower 48 next week. This will
maintain a cool and showery (even snowy) regime over the interior
West behind a frontal system moving ashore early in the week. Over
the East, ridging will promote hot and dry conditions over the
Southeast with record highs well into the 90s to around 100F. A
backdoor front may cool some areas of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic
in the otherwise very warm pattern. Rainfall will be focused over
the Plains and northern tier until a cold front pushes
southeastward late in the week.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the deterministic models formed a
reasonable blended solution despite their differences in timing
into the West early in the week. The GFS runs have been generally
quicker but within the ensemble spread, and this was balanced by
the slower ECMWF/Canadian. To the east, quicker trend in all the
guidance with low pressure through southern Canada (and warm
fronts just over the border), but less change near the inflection
point between the backdoor cold front into NC Mon-Tue. By later in
the week, relied on 50/50 model/ensemble blend, as the West will
likely see smaller wavelength features dive through/into the broad
trough, but predictability is low. In the East, still expect high
pressure out of Canada to help push the cold front southeastward
into the Carolinas by late next Thu into next Fri, lingering the
boundary across the Plains.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall next week will likely be over the
central Plains to the Midwest as well as the interior
Northwest/northern Rockies. Incoming front into the Pacific
Northwest and the slowly-moving cold front out of the northern
Plains will touch off light to modest showers and perhaps some
thunderstorms east of the Rockies. Some snow is possible over the
highest elevations, with snow levels lowering a bit underneath the
upper trough. Amounts have the potential to be locally heavy in
some convectively-enhanced areas (over the Plains) along the
frontal boundary. Backdoor cold front in the East may bring only
light showers to some areas. By later in the week, approaching
cold front could support more organized showers and perhaps a
storm.

Temperatures will be cool in the West, warm/hot in the East, and
within several degrees of normal in between. Coldest anomalies in
the West may be early in the week  where readings of 5-15F below
normal will moderate a bit to about 5 degrees below normal by the
end of the week. In the East, ahead of the backdoor cold front (or
behind the warm front as it advances back to the northeast),
temperatures may climb to 10-20F above normal. This will bring
80s/90s into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and 90s to near 100F over
the Southeast. Records highs are likely for some areas and could
be widespread over several states Mon-Wed. Heat indices may be
kept in check by dew points in the 50s/60s through the week.

...Additional heavy rain associated with a low pressure system
over the western Gulf of Mexico could impact eastern Texas tonight
into Saturday...

...Thunderstorms could become severe ahead of a cold front through
the High Plains for the next few days...

...Late-season snow will linger across higher elevations of the
West from the Sierra Nevada to the Northern Rockies into the
weekend...

...Critical Risks of fire danger remain in place for portions of
the Four Corners states...

Winds circulating around a large high pressure system centered
over the northeastern U.S. will continue to direct a stream of
tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico toward the western Gulf
states. Furthermore, a low pressure center in the Gulf of Mexico
has formed in the western Gulf, which is forecast to track toward
the Texas Gulf Coast tonight. The National Hurricane Center is
monitoring this area for the potential for tropical cyclone
formation. This combination of factors could lead to additional
heavy rain particularly across southeastern Texas through tonight,
and a Slight Risk of flash flooding is in place there. Portions of
Texas and Louisiana have seen multiple days of heavy rain
recently, so flooding could be exacerbated by additional rainfall.
Some showers and thunderstorms could continue through Saturday in
the Southern Plains.

Meanwhile, the upper-level pattern is expected to stagnate over
the next couple of days, with a deep upper-level low across the
western U.S. that should eventually move northeastward a bit by
Sunday, and generally large-scale upper ridging over the eastern
U.S. Areas of the High Plains should have a persistent threat for
scattered thunderstorms ahead of a slow-moving surface front ahead
of the upper low. Some severe storms are expected, and the Storm
Prediction Center has Slight Risks of severe weather delineated
through the weekend for portions of the High Plains. Showers and
thunderstorms are also possible for the north-central U.S. and
over the Northeast through the weekend along meandering fronts.

Underneath the upper low, temperatures are expected to remain
below normal for much of the western U.S. through the weekend.
High temperatures are forecast to be generally 15 to 25 degrees
below average for the Intermountain West, and parts of Montana
could stay 25 to 30 degrees below average, with record lows
possible as well there. These cold temperatures will support wet
snow for higher elevations of the West. The heaviest snow is
ending across the Northern Rockies and Winter Storm Warnings have
expired, but some additional snow is still expected in higher
elevations of the Sierra Nevada into the Intermountain West and
Northern Rockies through the weekend as a low pressure system is
forecast to intensify over Wyoming on Sunday.

Farther south, gusty winds across the interior West together with
dry conditions will continue to elevate the risk of wildfires.
Critical fire risk is forecast for the Four Corners states through
the weekend, while Elevated Risks are in place through this
evening in the Southern High Plains and portions of California.
Meanwhile, warmer than average temperatures are forecast to
continue for the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic over the next several days under the upper
ridge, with highs rising well into the 80s and even into the 90s.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0107 AM CDT Sat May 22 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA AND WESTERN NEW
MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
Slow eastward progression of the upper-level trough in the West will
bring another day of fire weather concerns for parts of the southern
Great Basin into the Southwest today. A Four Corners surface trough
will develop during the day and further enhance winds across the
region. Warm and dry conditions will remain in the eastern CONUS
under the influence of an upper-level ridge.

...Arizona/New Mexico...
The strongest winds are expected to occur in eastern Arizona into
western New Mexico where the mid-level jet will be overhead during
the afternoon. Surface winds of 20-25 mph appear probable with some
areas potentially seeing locally higher speeds. RH of around 15%
will occur at lower elevations. Higher terrain will areas will not
be as dry, though will be similarly windy. Surrounding areas to the
north and east are likely to see elevated fire weather. Critical
conditions are not expected given combinations of lighter winds,
cloud cover, and higher RH.

...Western Florida Peninsula...
With the surface ridge axis moving into the region, winds should
trend lighter than on Friday. However, areas of lowered RH near the
coast are possible. Given very dry fuels, areas of locally elevated
concerns could develop where winds do maintain 10-15 mph into the
afternoon.

...Record heat likely for portions of the Southeast/southern
Mid-Atlantic next week...

...Overview...

An upper low near the Davis Strait will retrograde toward the
Canadian Archipelago next week, which favors a low-amplitude
trough/ridge pattern across the lower 48. Heights will generally
be near to above normal over all of the CONUS by late next week
which will translate to surface temperature as well. Over the
East, record highs well into the 90s to around 100F are likely for
portions of the Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic. A backdoor front
may cool some areas briefly in the otherwise very warm pattern.
Rainfall will be focused over the Plains to the Midwest/Great
Lakes.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the deterministic models still had
trouble forming a consensus on timing the incoming cold front and
upper trough or weak upper low into the Northwest Tuesday. The GFS
runs remained a bit quicker but a blended/consensus starting point
was favored given a bit quicker trend. Upstream over the Gulf of
Alaska, much larger differences emerged in the 12Z ensembles
regarding the handling of a couple features from the North Pacific
and off the mainland, leading to large differences between the
ECMWF ensembles and the GEFS/Canadian. However, there was some
overlap between some GEFS members and the ECMWF idea with the
deterministic models in principle, leading to favor the ECMWF
ensembles over the GEFS into mid week. By later in the week, ECMWF
ensembles seemed to suffer from a smearing of 50 members with
differences in timing smaller-scale features into the West,
leading to a broad trough of low amplitude. In the East, cold
front may dip into the southern Mid-Atlantic on Friday with
perhaps a wave of low pressure along the front draped back to the
Plains. Low confidence in the details as the models have little
consistency and the ensembles were rather undefined. Maintained a
wavy front astride the Ohio Valley that may lift back into the
Northeast as upper ridging attempts to build just offshore.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall next week will likely be over the
central Plains to the Midwest and Great Lakes along a wavy frontal
boundary. Parts of the interior Northwest/northern Rockies will
see some light rain and high mountain snow with the Tuesday
system. This front may touch off light to modest showers and
perhaps some thunderstorms east of the Rockies as it
weakens/dissipates. Some rainfall amounts have the potential to be
locally heavy in some convectively-enhanced areas (generally over
the Plains) along the frontal boundary. Backdoor cold front in the
East may bring only light showers to some areas on its way south
or back north as a warm front.

Temperatures will be cool in the West to start, warm/hot in the
East, and within several degrees of normal in between. Coldest
anomalies of about 5 to 10 degrees below normal will be centered
from the Great Basin/Northwest to the High Plains Tue-Wed. In the
East, ahead of the backdoor cold front (or behind the warm front
as it advances back to the northeast), temperatures may climb to
10-20F above normal. This will bring 80s/90s into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and 90s to near 100F over the Southeast.
Records highs are likely for some areas and could be widespread
over several states Tue-Wed along the I-75 and I-95 corridors,
respectively. Heat indices may be kept in check by dew points in
the 50s/60s through the week.

0204 AM CDT Sat May 22 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
The western upper-level trough will being to lift northeastward by
Sunday morning. Stronger surface and mid-level wind fields will
shift north and east along with the trough. Very dry air will remain
across the Southwest. With a modest lee trough and adequate, but
decreasing, mid-level flow aloft, an area of elevated fire weather
may develop in parts of southwestern and central New Mexico. A
fairly typical setup of 15-20 mph winds will overlap with 10-15% RH
during the afternoon. Stronger winds are more likely to occur
farther north and east where the mid-level jet will be more
favorably timed with peak heating. However, these areas already have
less receptive fuels and are expected to see more precipitation on
Saturday.

...Heavy rain and some gusty winds are expected across eastern
Texas today after a low pressure center makes landfall across
central Texas coast this morning...

...Thunderstorms could become severe ahead of a cold front through
the High Plains for the next few days...

...Late-season mountain snow is expected to pick up once again
across western Montana on Sunday...

...Critical Risks of fire danger remain in place for portions of
the Four Corners region...

Winds circulating around a large high pressure system centered
over the eastern U.S. will continue to direct a stream of tropical
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico toward the western Gulf states.
Meanwhile, a low pressure center that formed yesterday in the
western Gulf of Mexico is now making landfall on the central Texas
coast. The chance for the circulation to develop into a tropical
cyclone is diminishing. However, the interaction of the
circulation with land could trigger bouts of thunderstorms
containing heavy downpours as it tracks further inland today.  The
low pressure area is expected to weaken and dissipate by tonight
but the tropical moisture will continue to stream into eastern
Texas for the remainder of the weekend.  Additional showers and
thunderstorms can be expected to form anytime under this unstable
air mass.

Meanwhile, a low pressure system is forecast to develop and
intensify as it tracks generally northward across the Rockies
through the weekend.  A strong cold front associated with the
system is expected to trigger thunderstorms across the High Plains
during the weekend.  Some of these storms could become severe
especially during the late afternoon into early in the evening.
are expected, and the Storm Prediction Center has Slight Risks of
severe weather delineated through the weekend for portions of the
High Plains.  Behind the cold front, deep upper-level trough/low
settling into the western U.S. is forecast to bring temperatures
below normal for much of the western U.S. through the weekend.
High temperatures are forecast to be generally 15 to 25 degrees
below average for the Intermountain West, and parts of Montana
could stay 25 to 30 degrees below average, with record lows
possible as well there. These cold temperatures will support wet
snow for higher elevations of the West. The heaviest snow is
ending across the Northern Rockies and Winter Storm Warnings have
expired, but some additional snow is still expected in higher
elevations of the Sierra Nevada into the Intermountain West and
Northern Rockies through the weekend as a low pressure system is
forecast to intensify over Wyoming on Sunday.

Showers and thunderstorms are also possible for the north-central
U.S. and over the Northeast through the weekend along meandering
fronts.

Farther south, gusty winds across the interior West together with
dry conditions will continue to elevate the risk of wildfires.
Critical fire risk is forecast for the Four Corners states through
the weekend, while Elevated Risks are in place through this
evening in the Southern High Plains and portions of California.
Meanwhile, warmer than average temperatures are forecast to
continue for the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic over the next several days under the upper
ridge, with highs rising well into the 80s and even into the 90s.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1133 AM CDT Sun Jul 25 2021

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

Plume of monsoonal moisture is evident on this morning soundings
with precipitable water values exceeding 1.2 inches extending
northward to Vandenburg Air Force Base, California (VBG). Meanwhile,
precipitable water values at Reno, Nevada (REV) were near 0.6
inches. Moisture should continue to surge northward today with
increasing chances for isolated thunderstorms along/near the
Sierras.

...Northern Sierras...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible by late afternoon into the early
evening across the northern Sierras as a plume of mid-level moisture
and associated elevated instability moves over the area. While
thunderstorm coverage/probability is forecast to be low --
especially with increasing northward extent -- any thunderstorms
that form would have the potential to produce lightning ignitions
given the exceptionally dry fuels over the area (ERCs > 95th
percentile). Additionally, gusty/erratic winds are also possible
near any thunderstorm, which would be problematic to ongoing fire
suppression efforts in the area. Lastly, increasing instability in
the mid-levels during the late afternoon and early evening may
promote locally enhanced (at times extreme) fire behavior near
ongoing large fires (e.g., Dixie Fire, Tamarack Fire, etc.).

...Far Northern California into Southern Oregon...
Latest high-resolution ensemble guidance is suggesting a possibility
of isolated showers and perhaps a few thunderstorms developing late
tonight. While probability of thunderstorms may be near 2-5%, ERCs
across this entire area exceed the 98th percentile, which suggest
lightning ignitions are possible with any activity.

...Northern Minnesota...
The forecast remains on track across this area with only minor
changes needed based on the latest forecast guidance. Elevated to
locally critical conditions are expected for several hours this
afternoon with exceptionally dry fuels across the area.

Please see previous discussion below for more information on today's
fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 07/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0211 AM CDT Sun Jul 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
Winds will be mostly light across the western CONUS beneath the
upper-level ridge. Some stronger mid-level northwesterly flow will
be present across the northern Great Plains this afternoon. At the
surface, deep mixing is anticipated across northern Minnesota with
may bring some of this stronger flow to the surface. Winds are
forecast around 15 mph during the afternoon hours with relative
humidity around 17 to 22 percent. Fuels are quite dry in this region
with ERC around the 92 to 95th percentile. Therefore, an elevated
delineation appears warranted.

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Models and ensembles consolidate a closed upper high down over the
central Plains mid-later this week, with ridging spreading back to
the north-central Intermountain West. The best chance for record
high maximum/minimum temperatures may be over the Great Plains
midweek, but record high minimum temperatures will occur across
the Great Basin/Rockies into late week and eventually the West
Coast by the weekend. Anomalous heat gripping the northern
Plains/Great Basin should finally break and moderate as the core
of the upper high sinks southward and eastern Pacific energy tries
to enter British Columbia. As moisture lifts across the region
between the ridge/closed high and amplifying eastern Pacific
troughing, expect increasing chances for monsoonal rainfall to
extend from the Southwest/California to the Great Basin and
Rockies. Dependent on frontal boundary placement and smaller scale
surface lows, focused moisture may also round the top of the ridge
from parts of the northern Plains into the Midwest/Tennessee
Valley next weekend.

Meanwhile, multiple shortwaves will dig downstream from the ridge
to amplify a mean upper trough over the Midwest/Northeast. Strong
convection and locally heavy downpours may periodically focus with
moisture/instability pooling near wavy and slow moving fronts and
meso-boundaries under favorable upper support. Frontal progression
should shift best focused rainfall chances from the Midwest/Great
Lakes through the northern Mid-Atlantic midweek to the Mid-South
through the Carolinas by the weekend.

Underneath, the National Hurricane Center continues to monitor
potential for short range tropical cyclone formation east of
northern Florida. The disturbance may intensify and drift inland
to the Gulf Coast midweek with deepened moisture to fuel local
downpours.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern evolution at mid-larger scales overall
seems to offer slightly above average predictability Days 3-7.
However, the least certain mass field part of the forecast remains
across the Midwest/Northeast where models continue to struggle
with resolving the various shortwave interactions within a mean
trough position. A variety of solutions unfold over time with
regards to the timing and intensity of shortwaves within the upper
trough and surface low pressure system developments. However, an
overall trend in guidance over the last few days to develop an
unseasonably amplified upper trough seems reasonable considering
the strength of the upstream ridge. Accordingly, the WPC medium

Extended Forecast Discussion

153 PM EDT Sun Jul 25 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Jul 28 2021 - 12Z Sun Aug 01 2021

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Models and ensembles consolidate a closed upper high down over the
central Plains mid-later this week, with ridging spreading back to
the north-central Intermountain West. The best chance for record
high maximum/minimum temperatures may be over the Great Plains
midweek, but record high minimum temperatures will occur across
the Great Basin/Rockies into late week and eventually the West
Coast by the weekend. Anomalous heat gripping the northern
Plains/Great Basin should finally break and moderate as the core
of the upper high sinks southward and eastern Pacific energy tries
to enter British Columbia. As moisture lifts across the region
between the ridge/closed high and amplifying eastern Pacific
troughing, expect increasing chances for monsoonal rainfall to
extend from the Southwest/California to the Great Basin and
Rockies. Dependent on frontal boundary placement and smaller scale
surface lows, focused moisture may also round the top of the ridge
from parts of the northern Plains into the Midwest/Tennessee
Valley next weekend.

Meanwhile, multiple shortwaves will dig downstream from the ridge
to amplify a mean upper trough over the Midwest/Northeast. Strong
convection and locally heavy downpours may periodically focus with
moisture/instability pooling near wavy and slow moving fronts and
meso-boundaries under favorable upper support. Frontal progression
should shift best focused rainfall chances from the Midwest/Great
Lakes through the northern Mid-Atlantic midweek to the Mid-South
through the Carolinas by the weekend.

Underneath, the National Hurricane Center continues to monitor
potential for short range tropical cyclone formation east of
northern Florida. The disturbance may intensify and drift inland
to the Gulf Coast midweek with deepened moisture to fuel local
downpours.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern evolution at mid-larger scales overall
seems to offer slightly above average predictability Days 3-7.
However, the least certain mass field part of the forecast remains
across the Midwest/Northeast where models continue to struggle
with resolving the various shortwave interactions within a mean
trough position. A variety of solutions unfold over time with
regards to the timing and intensity of shortwaves within the upper
trough and surface low pressure system developments. However, an
overall trend in guidance over the last few days to develop an
unseasonably amplified upper trough seems reasonable considering
the strength of the upstream ridge. Accordingly, the WPC medium
range product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend
of the latest GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian (plus the National Blend of
Models) for days 3-5 (Wed/Thu/Fri) before trending more towards
ECENS/GEFS ensemble means next weekend amid growing forecast
spread with flow embedded features.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 PM CDT Sun Jul 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Northern California into Oregon...
Isolated to widely scattered showers with perhaps some embedded
thunderstorms are possible for a few hours tomorrow morning into the
midday. While storm coverage/probability is likely to be less than
5% during this time, ERCs exceeding the 98th percentile suggest
lightning ignitions would be possible with any activity.
Thunderstorms may redevelop later in the afternoon and also into the
overnight as mid-level moisture increases further, though
thunderstorm coverage remains uncertain. While guidance suggests
precipitable water values increasing to near 1 inch during this
time, lightning ignitions will be possible -- especially along the
periphery of heavier storm cores -- as ERC values exceed the 98th
percentile across the entire area.

...Northern Sierras...
Isolated thunderstorms are forecast to develop over the higher
terrain during the afternoon with weak instability over the area.
While moisture will be increasing through the day, with storms
becoming increasingly wetter, fuels are exceptionally dry across the
region which will keep ignition efficiency quite high -- especially
along the perhiphery cores of any heavier rainfall.

...Coastal Ranges of Central California...
There is a very low chance of a shower or thunderstorm developing
across the coastal ranges of central California late tomorrow night.
While fuels across this area are very dry and will support lightning
ignitions, thunderstorm potential remains too low at this time to
include a dry thunderstorm area.

...Northern Idaho into southwest Montana...
A few of the latest high-resolution forecasts indicate the
possibility of a few showers/thunderstorms developing during the
late afternoon and evening tomorrow. At the moment thunderstorm
coverage remains very uncertain, though a dry thunderstorm area may
be needed in the future if probabilities increase since fuels remain
extremely dry over the area (ERCs exceeding the 95th percentile).

..Elliott.. 07/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0211 AM CDT Sun Jul 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
The western CONUS ridge will continue to amplify on Monday. This
will keep winds light across most of the western CONUS. The
monsoonal moisture plume across the Southwest will start to move up
the California coast on Monday.  As a result, some thunderstorms may
be possible in northern California and south-central Oregon. Have
not added an isolated dry thunderstorm area at this time as storm
coverage still remains uncertain. However, one may be needed,
especially if 12Z CAM guidance shows more than a storm or two in the
area. Fuels are very dry with ERC percentiles near record, so
ignition efficiency may be quite high. Therefore, this dry lightning
potential will be watched closely.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun July 25 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...Main monsoon activity expected to abate by tomorrow...

...Excessively hot weather persists over Eastern Montana;
sweltering heat lingers over the Southern Plains and Southeast...

...Scattered summer thunderstorms likely along and east of the
Mississippi River...


After a very active stretch of the Southwest Monsoon (one of the
most active monsoon periods over the last several years), dry
conditions are finally in sight for much of Arizona by tomorrow as
a slow moving disturbance meanders off the California coast.
Although the recent heavy rainfall has undoubtedly helped abate
the Extreme to Exceptional drought in the region, additional
showers and thunderstorms today atop areal rainfall averages of 2
to 5 inches since Thursday will support additional flash flood
chances through tomorrow. Certain areas such as burn scars remain
particularly sensitive to any heavy rain that falls. A Slight Risk
of excessive rain is in effect over Central/Northwest Arizona
today, and several Flash Flood/Flood Warnings dot the areas around
the Phoenix and Tuscon metropolitan areas. Monday morning, the
westward movement of the upper disturbance will bring shower
chances over the California Desert and areas in the Great Basin,
which should provide some much needed relief to the widespread
drought in the region. The persistence of Pacific moisture will
keep shower/thunderstorm chances in the Great Basin through much
of next week. Moreover, clouds and thunderstorms should keep
temperatures well below average for this time of year, with
forecast high temperatures 10-15 degrees below average in some
spots in the Southwest/Great Basin where rain develops. It's a
different story on the periphery of the monsoon activity over the
interior Northwest; Excessive Heat Warnings and Air Quality Alerts
cover portions of southern Washington and Idaho through tomorrow.
The heat is also expected East of the Rockies; all of East Montana
is under an Excessive Heat Warning until Tuesday. Sweltering heat
is also expected over portions of the Central Plains into the
Southeast as a humid airmass ramps up heat indices to 105-110.
Accordingly, Heat Advisories are currently in effect for portions
of the Lower Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southern Plains,
while an Excessive Heat Warning affects the Kansas City metro
area.

The same humid airmass responsible for the uncomfortable heat will
also provide the fuel for scattered thunderstorm development over
the next few days. A front swinging across the Plains into the
Northeast will spark scattered thunderstorm development each day
this over the Midwest and eventually Southeast. Another front
tomorrow brings a shot of severe weather to Minnesota and
Wisconsin, where a Slight Risk of severe weather is in effect
tomorrow. Severe hail and damaging wind appear to be the main
threats, but an isolated tornado is possible per the Storm
Prediction Center. Off the East Coast of Florida, the National
Hurricane Center continues to monitor an area of disturbed weather
for potential development. Reports indicate the disturbance
remains disorganized, but marginally conductive environmental
conditions for development are noted ahead of the disturbance.
Users are encouraged to monitor the NHC to receive the latest
forecast information on this system. Some heavy rain is possible
ahead of the disturbance today, as a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall remains over South Florida until tomorrow morning.

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Guidance has been increasingly consistent over the last few days
and overall agrees to gradually weaken and shift a closed upper
high southward over the central U.S. late week into next, with
ridging spreading back across the Rockies to the north-central
Intermountain West. As impulses and moisture lift across the West
between the ridge/closed high and emerging eastern Pacific
troughing, expect widespread chances for monsoonal rainfall with
isolated local runoff issues will spread from the
Southwest/California to across the Great Basin and Rockies where
some record warm minimum temperature records may be observed.

Meanwhile, multiple shortwaves will dig downstream from the ridge
to amplify a mean upper trough over the Midwest/Northeast. Strong
convection and locally heavy downpours may periodically focus with
moisture/instability pooling near wavy and slow moving fronts
under favorable upper support. Wavy frontal progression,
convective outflow and reinforcing frontal surges are expected to
shift best focused rainfall chances later this week from the
Midwest to Northeast down to the Southeast. Dependent on frontal
boundary placement/reinforcement and smaller scale surface lows
upstream, focused moisture will meanwhile also round the top of
the central U.S. ridge to fuel periods of renewed convection/local
downpours from the northern Plains to the Midwest/Tennessee Valley.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern evolution at mid-larger scales offers
above average predictability Days 3-7. An overall trend in
guidance over the last few days to develop an unseasonably
amplified eastern U.S. upper trough over time remains reasonable
considering the initial strength of the upstream ridge. The WPC
medium range product suite was primarily derived from a composite
blend of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models Thursday into Saturday before switching to a still
compatible composite blend of the ECENS/GEFS ensemble means and
GFS/ECMWF heading into early next week. Latest 00 UTC guidance
generally remains in line with our earlier guidance and blend. WPC
product continuity was well maintained in this plan.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 AM CDT Mon Jul 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
Moisture will increase across the Northwest and northern Rockies on
Tuesday. A few weak mid-level shortwave troughs are forecast to move
northward from California and across eastern Oregon and Idaho. These
may provide ample lift for isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms throughout the day. PWAT values are forecast to be as
high as 1.25 inches in some areas which may limit the ignition
threat somewhat. However, fuels are near record dry across most of
this area and thus will be very susceptible to any lightning. In
addition, forecast soundings show LCLs around 4km with a mostly dry
sub-cloud layer which should evaporate some of the falling rainfall
and may lead to gusty and erratic surface winds.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 AM CDT Mon Jul 26 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
Monsoon moisture has started to advect northward along the
California coast with PWAT of 1.31 inches at VBG and 1.07 inches at
OAK. This moisture will continue to rotate around the upper-level
anticyclone through the day today. Some elevated convection may be
possible across northern California and southern Oregon early in the
day with some isolated lightning possible. The greater threat will
likely be during the afternoon and evening hours during peak
heating. Forecast soundings show limited instability (200 to 400
J/kg) which may keep storms weak/isolated. In addition, storms may
be on the wetter side given slow storm motions and PWAT values
approaching 1 inch. However, fuels are extremely dry in the area
with widespread 98th percentile to near record dry fuels. Therefore,
even if storms are more wet, there will likely still be an ignition
threat outside cores and where forest canopy is dense.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
southern Mid-Atlantic into the Southern Appalachians and over
parts of the Great Basin and Southern California through Tuesday
morning...

... There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Upper Midwest through Tuesday morning...

...Excessive Heat Warning over parts of Idaho and eastern Oregon
and the Northern High Plains; Heat Advisory over parts of the
Lower Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains...

Monsoonal moisture is on the decrease over the Southwest and
moving into Southern California. As upper-level energy migrates
over the region aiding in producing showers and thunderstorms, and
some will produce heavy rain over the Great Basin and Southern
California through Tuesday. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable through Tuesday morning. However, the excessive
rainfall threat will continue to lessen from Monday into Tuesday
as the monsoonal moisture decreases. Furthermore, scattered
showers and thunderstorms will continue over the Southwest,
Central/Southern Rockies, and Great Basin on Tuesday and Wednesday.

A front extending from the Northeast Coast to the southern
Mid-Atlantic across the Ohio Valley into the Northern Plains will
slowly dissipate and move off the Mid-Atlantic Coast by Tuesday
evening. Nonetheless, very moist air will pool along the boundary
producing showers and thunderstorms, some with heavy rain, along
and near the front over Mid-Atlantic into the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys and the Central/Southern Appalachians on Monday.
Therefore, The WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams are the most vulnerable through Tuesday morning.
 The excessive rainfall threat will lessen on Tuesday into
Wednesday, yet showers and thunderstorms will continue over the
Southeast to Southern Plains.

Meanwhile, a front over the Northern High Plains will move
eastward to the Upper Midwest and merge with a front moving
southward from Central Canada. The boundary will continue to move
east across the Great Lakes into the Northeast by Tuesday morning
while sinking into the Mid-Atlantic by Wednesday. The system will
produce showers and thunderstorms over the Upper Midwest on
Monday.  The showers and thunderstorms will move across the Great
Lakes into the Northeast on Tuesday into Wednesday.  The dynamics
associated with these thunderstorms will be strong enough to
produce severe weather on Monday.  Therefore, the SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Upper
Midwest through Tuesday morning.  The hazards associated with
these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  The severe thunderstorm
threat will continue over parts of the area on Tuesday into
Wednesday.

Over the Northwest, there is an Excessive Heat Warning over parts
of Idaho, eastern Oregon, and the Northern High Plains, where
temperatures rise into the 100s through Monday. The 100s will move
into Northern Plains, Northern High Plains, and the Midwest on
Tuesday and Wednesday.  Furthermore, Heat Advisories are currently
in effect for portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley and parts
of the Southern Plains. Moreover, an Excessive Heat Warning
affects the Kansas City metro area. Additionally, several regions
have Air Quality Alerts due to wildfires over the Northwest into
the Northern Rockies.

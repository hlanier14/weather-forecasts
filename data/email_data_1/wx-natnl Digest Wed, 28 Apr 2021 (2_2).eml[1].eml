Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Wed Apr 28 2021 - 12Z Fri Apr 30 2021

...There is a Moderate risk of Excessive Rainfall over parts of
the Southern Plains...

...There is a Slight risk of Severe Thunderstorms over parts of
the Southern Plains and the Lower Great Lakes through Thursday
morning...

...There is a chance for record-breaking hi minimum temperatures
over the East and below-average temperatures over the Southern
Rockies/Southwest into the Central High Plains...

A slow-moving front extending from the northern Mid-Atlantic
westward to Michigan, then southwest to the Central/Southern
Plains will inch eastward off the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Coast by
Friday.  The southern part of the boundary will extend from the
Southeast to the Central/Western Gulf Coast on Friday. Showers and
thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the front from the
Middle Mississippi Valley eastward to parts of the Northeast.  The
SPC has issued a Slight risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Lower Great Lakes through Thursday morning. The main hazards with
the severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Additionally, showers and thunderstorms will develop along and
ahead of the front over parts of the Central/Southern Plains.  The
SPC has issued a Slight risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southern Plains through Thursday morning.  The main hazards
with the severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  There is a
10% or greater probability of two-inch hail over parts of
south-central Texas.

The thunderstorms will produce heavy rain from parts of the Ohio
Valley to the Southern Plains.  The WPC has issued a Moderate risk
of excessive rainfall over parts of the Southern Plains through
Thursday morning.  The heavy rain associated with the
thunderstorms will produce numerous areas of flash flooding over
this region.  Many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger
rivers.  The severe weather threat will lessen somewhat on
Thursday as showers and thunderstorms continue along and ahead of
the boundary.  The showers and thunderstorms will continue to
develop along and ahead of the front through Friday morning.  In
the warm sector, south of the front, there is a chance for
record-breaking hi minimum temperatures over the East on Wednesday
into Thursday.

Meanwhile, under the upper-level low over the Four Corners Region,
rain and higher elevation snow will develop over parts of the
Central/Southern Rockies and the Southwest on Wednesday, ending on
Thursday morning.  Additionally, under the upper low, temperatures
will be 10 to 15 degrees below average on Wednesday.

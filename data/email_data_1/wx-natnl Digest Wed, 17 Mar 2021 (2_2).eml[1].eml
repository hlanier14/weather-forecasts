Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
237 AM EDT Wed Mar 17 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Mar 20 2021 - 12Z Wed Mar 24 2021

...Overview...

Semi-progressive pattern will feature upper ridging moving through
southern and eastern Canada Saturday-Monday with successive
troughs through the West. Over the Southeast and off the coast, a
weakness aloft may spur an area of low pressure along a frontal
boundary but should slowly move away from the nearby waters. Main
precipitation threat will be out of the Rockies and into the
Plains to the Mississippi Valley.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Aside from the 12Z Canadian, which handled the exiting eastern
trough quite differently than the rest of the guidance, a blended
solution of the 12Z/18Z GFS and ECMWF/UKMET offered a reasonable
starting point this weekend with both the system off the Southeast
and the incoming lead western trough. By next Mon-Wed, ECMWF was
slower to move the lead trough out of the Four Corners region than
the GFS while the ensembles were mostly in the middle and were the
preferred route as no clear trends have been evident the past few
cycles. As the system emerges onto the Plains early next week,
ensemble means continued to cluster well as the deterministic runs
showed a bit more spread (especially the 18Z parallel GFS which
was rather quick to the east). Increased ensemble weight couple
with the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF maintained good continuity, albeit
perhaps a bit slower than 24 hrs ago, as the system lifts toward
the Great Lakes next Wednesday.

Also at that time, second western trough is forecast to dig down
into the Southwest with good agreement overall and only slight
timing differences for this lead time (GEFS a bit quicker but well
within tolerance). Aforementioned blend for the central system
worked well in the Southwest/Four Corners region, roughly 50/50
ensemble/deterministic.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

System offshore Florida may wrap back some showers along the coast
but likely keep the heavier rainfall over the Gulf Stream this
weekend before slowly pulling away. High pressure to the north
will keep temperatures chilly to start but then warm up quite
smartly as southerly flow brings in milder temperatures to the
Great Lakes and then Northeast. Temperatures in the High
Plains/Upper Midwest could approach record highs ahead of the cold
front.

As the lead trough exits the Rockies, return flow out of the Gulf
will steadily increase available moisture to the central states
ahead of the front. This should first occur near the best dynamics
(central Plains) Sunday then expand on Monday as inflow and
moisture increase from the Gulf (lower MS Valley northward).
Second/reinforcing upper trough (and weak surface reflection) will
dig through the West Mon-Tue bringing some light valley rain and
mountain snow to northern California, parts of the Great Basin,
and the central Rockies. This could act to slow the front over
eastern Texas as the northern part of the system heads into the
Great Lakes, perhaps enhancing rainfall into the lower MS Valley.

...A rapidly intensifying low pressure system is expected to bring
widespread thunderstorms across the Deep South with dangerous
severe weather likely today...

...Threat of excessive rainfall will expand into the
mid-Mississippi Valley today...

...Critical fire weather threat along the Rio Grande River Valley
today...

A low pressure system is currently rapidly intensifying over the
mid-section of the country.  Under this active and volatile
weather pattern, an outbreak of strong to severe thunderstorms is
forecast to rapidly expand across the Deep South today.  The area
that will be under the highest threat for dangerous severe weather
will be from the lower Mississippi Valley eastward later today
into this evening ahead of a dynamic cold front.  In addition,
heavy rain associated with thunderstorm clusters is expected to
expand in coverage across the mid-Mississippi Valley today as the
intensifying low pressure system approaches from the west.  Some
of the heavy rain and severe thunderstorms should reach the
interior Southeast tonight.  The entire storm system will move at
a relative quick pace through the central and eastern U.S. during
the next couple of days.  The threat of severe weather will then
shift into the Southeast on Thursday as heavy rain spreads across
the central Appalachians into the northern Mid-Atlantic and the
southern New England coast by Thursday night.  Meanwhile, a cold
air mass associated with high pressure system could change the
heavy rain into a period of snow across the central Appalachians
to southern England early on Friday as the entire storm systems
will be moving out into the Atlantic.  In the mean time, some snow
is expected to accumulate across the central High Plains to the
Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles this morning into early this
afternoon on the back side of the intensifying storm where
Blizzard Warnings remain in effect.

In the Southern Plains, critical fire weather threat is shifting
into the Rio Grande River Valley today. Elsewhere, the Pacific
Northwest and the northern half of California can expect
precipitation chances to increase by Thursday morning as an
upper-level low and frontal system move slowly toward the region.

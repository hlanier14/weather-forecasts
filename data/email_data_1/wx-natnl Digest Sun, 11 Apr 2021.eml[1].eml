Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 AM CDT Sat Apr 10 2021

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR WESTERN NEW MEXICO AND FAR EASTERN
ARIZONA...

Only minor changes have been made to the current forecast. The
Critical area was moved west and trimmed on the eastern side to
better account for critical meteorological conditions across the
higher terrain of the Southwest. Locally elevated fire weather
conditions will be possible across portions of the northern/central
High Plains. The sporadic nature of strong winds/RH will preclude
the addition of an elevated area at this time.

..Lyons.. 04/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1252 AM CDT Sat Apr 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface cyclone will continue to
move across the eastern CONUS, with ample low-level moisture and
widespread precipitation limiting major wildfire spread concerns
across much of the Mississippi Valley towards the Appalachians.
Another mid-level trough will deepen across the northern Rockies,
promoting dry downslope flow across much of the northern into the
central High Plains. Strong west-northwesterly mid-level flow will
also overspread a dry boundary layer across the southwest U.S,
promoting surface conditions favorable for wildfire spread. Lastly,
dry, occasionally breezy conditions are expected around afternoon
peak heating across portions of the Florida Peninsula, before
isolated to potentially scattered thunderstorms arrive.

...Portions of the Southwest U.S...
By afternoon, adequate diurnal heating will promote RH values
dropping to the 10-20% range across much of central and eastern
Arizona into central New Mexico and Far West Texas. Efficient
downward momentum transport of the mid-level flow is expected to
support widespread 15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds.
Guidance consensus depicts the best overlap of critically low RH and
sustained 20+ mph westerly surface winds across western New Mexico,
where a Critical area has been delineated. Critical conditions are
most likely across lower-terrain areas, where fuels are most
receptive of wildfire spread.

...Florida Peninsula...
By afternoon peak heating, RH is expected to drop into the 25-35%
range across central and eastern portions of the Florida Peninsula.
At the same time, surface lee troughing is expected to encourage a
strong enough surface mass response for a relatively stronger
surface wind field to develop. During this period, and before
thunderstorms develop or move into the area, there is a multi-hour
window of opportunity where 15+ mph sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds may coincide with the aforementioned RH to foster
favorable wildfire-spread conditions. An Elevated area has been
maintained to address this concern given that fuels remain receptive
to fire spread.

...Northern High Plains...
With the approach of an upper trough, downslope flow is expected to
promote 15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds coinciding with
15-25% RH during the afternoon hours. At least locally Elevated
conditions are likely from the Laramie Mountains to the
Montana/North Dakota/Canada border, potentially expanding as far
east as the western Dakotas into the Nebraska Panhandle. At the
moment, the primary mitigating factor for adding an Elevated area is
the lack of stronger surface winds on a more widespread basis.
However, given the receptiveness of fuels (especially in eastern
Montana into western North Dakota), an Elevated area may be added in
the Day 1 update should guidance show any increasing trends for wind
speeds.

...Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat and additional
rains for the central Gulf Coast...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period begins Tuesday with broad troughing
stretching across the northern tier of the country with two main
upper low features: one across the Upper Great Lakes, and another
dropping into the Northwest. After Tuesday, the Great Lakes low
should slide slowly eastward (influenced by a deep closed low
meandering/retrograding from the Canadian Maritimes) while the
Western U.S. low settles over the Great Basin for much of the week
within an otherwise blocky pattern. In general, the latest suite
of guidance shows fairly good agreement on the large scale
pattern, but forecast spread is growing on the details.

For the Great Lakes upper low, most of the guidance shows it
shifting eastward and weakening with time and may be trending a
bit faster than previous model runs. The future of this is also
dependent on another deep upper low/lows slowly retrograding
uncertainly from offshore the Canadian Maritimes towards New
England before finally lifting north and away from the coast.
After day 3-4, the details get very uncertain as the GFS/CMC are
the quickest to eject the Great Lakes low eastward, while the
ECMWF keeps some energy back across the Great Lakes. The ensemble
means lie somewhere in the middle and are probably a good starting
point at this time.

Out West, the deterministic guidance shows better agreement that
energy drops in from the Northwest and settles into the Great
Basin region as a closed low for much of the week. By day 6-7,
there is some uncertainty as to how quickly upper ridging to the
north weakens which would help push the low eastward. The
ECMWF/CMC hang on to a closed Western U.S. low into next weekend,
while the GFS would suggest the trough pushes eastward into the
Plains. Again, prefer a preference towards the better clustered
ensemble means for days 6-7 which would suggest the energy hangs
back a little longer than the GFS shows.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
majority blend of the deterministic GFS/ECMWF/CMC for days 3-4,
quickly transitioning to mostly ensemble means thereafter.
Maintained some smaller contributions from the ECMWF/CMC late
period just for some added definition and details to the otherwise
washed out means. The maintains good WPC continuity from the
previous shift as well.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The combination of an amplified upper trough/closed low over the
West and cold Canadian High Pressure (with temp anomalies 10-20
degrees below normal) will set the stage for a potentially heavy
upslope snow event over the Central Rockies/parts of the High
Plains. Some deformation and terrain enhanced precipitation is
also possible over the Great Basin underneath of the upper low
itself. Dependent on system progression later in the week, a
moderate rain focus may shift into the Central Plains as well, but
there is lingering uncertainty at these longer time frames.

Meanwhile, a wavy frontal boundary will settle near the Gulf of
Mexico which should focus periods of moderate to possibly heavy
rainfall across much of the South and back into parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains. Amounts don't look
particularly high, although some of this region (especially parts
of the Central Gulf Coast states) have seen much above normal
rainfall over the past few weeks so any additional rain may
increase flooding concerns. Farther north, showers may also linger
across parts of the Northeast mid week as upper level energy
slides through.

...Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat and additional
rains for the central Gulf Coast...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period begins Tuesday with broad troughing
stretching across the northern tier of the country with two main
upper low features: one across the Upper Great Lakes, and another
dropping into the Northwest. After Tuesday, the Great Lakes low
should slide slowly eastward (influenced by a deep closed low
meandering/retrograding from the Canadian Maritimes) while the
Western U.S. low settles over the Great Basin for much of the week
within an otherwise blocky pattern. In general, the latest suite
of guidance shows fairly good agreement on the large scale
pattern, but forecast spread is growing on the details.

For the Great Lakes upper low, most of the guidance shows it
shifting eastward and weakening with time and may be trending a
bit faster than previous model runs. The future of this is also
dependent on another deep upper low/lows slowly retrograding
uncertainly from offshore the Canadian Maritimes towards New
England before finally lifting north and away from the coast.
After day 3-4, the details get very uncertain as the GFS/CMC are
the quickest to eject the Great Lakes low eastward, while the
ECMWF keeps some energy back across the Great Lakes. The ensemble
means lie somewhere in the middle and are probably a good starting
point at this time.

Out West, the deterministic guidance shows better agreement that
energy drops in from the Northwest and settles into the Great
Basin region as a closed low for much of the week. By day 6-7,
there is some uncertainty as to how quickly upper ridging to the
north weakens which would help push the low eastward. The
ECMWF/CMC hang on to a closed Western U.S. low into next weekend,
while the GFS would suggest the trough pushes eastward into the
Plains. Again, prefer a preference towards the better clustered
ensemble means for days 6-7 which would suggest the energy hangs
back a little longer than the GFS shows.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
majority blend of the deterministic GFS/ECMWF/CMC for days 3-4,
quickly transitioning to mostly ensemble means thereafter.
Maintained some smaller contributions from the ECMWF/CMC late
period just for some added definition and details to the otherwise
washed out means. The maintains good WPC continuity from the
previous shift as well.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The combination of an amplified upper trough/closed low over the
West and cold Canadian High Pressure (with temp anomalies 10-20
degrees below normal) will set the stage for a potentially heavy
upslope snow event over the Central Rockies/parts of the High
Plains. Some deformation and terrain enhanced precipitation is
also possible over the Great Basin underneath of the upper low
itself. Dependent on system progression later in the week, a
moderate rain focus may shift into the Central Plains as well, but
there is lingering uncertainty at these longer time frames.

Meanwhile, a wavy frontal boundary will settle near the Gulf of
Mexico which should focus periods of moderate to possibly heavy
rainfall across much of the South and back into parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains. Amounts don't look
particularly high, although some of this region (especially parts
of the Central Gulf Coast states) have seen much above normal
rainfall over the past few weeks so any additional rain may
increase flooding concerns. Farther north, showers may also linger
across parts of the Northeast mid week as upper level energy

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat April 10 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Sat Apr 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

No major changes have been assessed to the current outlook.
Considerable uncertainty remains across the central High Plains in
the wake of a cold front. Regional model soundings show limited
confidence in frontal placement and the potential for cloud cover
across the area which may limit warming/drying immediately behind
the front across western Nebraska/Kansas. Highlights will be
withheld for now, but locally elevated conditions may still occur
for a few hours atop moderately receptive fuels.

..Lyons.. 04/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1254 AM CDT Sat Apr 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
A progressive mid-level trough will move eastward across the
northern CONUS and merge with an upper-level cutoff low across
portions of the Ohio Valley tomorrow. At the surface, high pressure
will build across the northern Rockies as a cold front surges across
the central Plains. Meanwhile, modest mid-level flow will overspread
a dry boundary layer across portions of the southwest U.S. into the
southern High Plains, with some dry and breezy conditions expected
during the afternoon hours.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Widespread 10-20% RH is expected across much of the southwest into
the southern High Plains during the afternoon as the boundary layer
mixes. Fuels across much of this region (especially in the lower
terrain) remains receptive to fire spread despite green-up, given
the ongoing extreme to exceptional drought. However, stronger
mid-level flow is expected to be departing the Southwest as diurnal
heating increases. As such, sustained westerly surface winds are
expected to remain within the 15-20 mph range, with an Elevated area
introduced. Locally Critical conditions may occur in
terrain-favoring areas, and Critical highlights may be introduced in
future outlooks should guidance consensus trend windier, especially
across eastern New Mexico, where fuels appear most receptive to fire
spread.

...Central Plains...
Dry and breezy conditions are expected immediately behind the cold
front across eastern Colorado into western/central Nebraska and
northern Kansas tomorrow afternoon. Fuels across the region are at
least modestly receptive to fire spread. However, guidance members
vary widely regarding minimum RH and the exact placement/timing of
the cold front, introducing considerable amounts of uncertainty this
forecast. Fire weather highlights have been withheld this outlook.
However, highlights may be added in future updates if surface
post-frontal conditions trend drier, and when cold frontal positions
can be better ascertained.

...Stormy and unsettled weather pattern continues over much of the
East for the rest of the weekend; severe weather possible from
Georgia to Florida into Sunday...

...Accumulating wet snow expected across the far northern Plains
on Monday following mixed rain and snow on Sunday...

...Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather remain in place for
the Southwest and southern High Plains...

A low pressure system moving toward the Great Lakes will bring
widespread unsettled weather across the eastern U.S. for the rest
of the weekend as a cold upper-level trough pushes across the
Northwest into the northern Plains.  Severe weather and heavy
downpours will be most likely across southern Georgia into
northern Florida through tonight well ahead of a cold front moving
into the Deep South.  Meanwhile, a swath of rain will move across
much of the Midwest into Sunday as the center of the low pressure
system passes to the southeast.  Rain and embedded strong
thunderstorms are also in the forecast from the Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley spreading into the Appalachians and the Mid-Atlantic
tonight, then into the western and southern New England ahead of a
warm front.  Rain intensity should taper off over the Great Lakes
later on Sunday as the system gradually weakens.  However, a good
chance and strong to severe thunderstorms is forecast for northern
Florida on Sunday as the cold front approaches.  Meanwhile, rain
and embedded thunderstorms along the East Coast will gradually
move out to sea later on Sunday as the cold front moves off the
coast.

In the Northwest, a cold upper-level will continue to bring below
normal temperatures through the region as it helps the development
of a new low pressure system across the northern Plains during the
next couple of days.  Scattered mountain snows across the Pacific
Northwest are expected to move into the northern Rockies and the
northern High Plains by this evening.  Most snowfall accumulations
should remain below 6 inches, with the exceptions being in the
highest elevations of the Cascades and Northern Rockies where
higher amounts are possible.  By Sunday, mixed rain and snow is
expected to reach North Dakota as cold air wraps around the
developing system.  The system will attempt to merge with the
weakening low pressure system over the Great Lakes to promote wet
snow across North Dakota where up to 8 inches is possible near the
Canadian border.

Regarding other weather hazards around the country, fire weather
conditions remain at Elevated to Critical levels in parts of the
southern High Plains and southern Rockies today. There is also an
Elevated risk for fire weather in central Florida. Another day of
Elevated fire weather is on tap for the southern High Plains and
southern Rockies on Sunday with locally Critical conditions
expected.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 AM CDT Sun Apr 11 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level cutoff low and associated surface lee trough will
continue to slowly move east across the eastern CONUS, promoting
moist conditions ahead of a cold front, and limiting wildfire-spread
potential to a degree. Across the western into the central U.S.,
relatively zonal upper flow will prevail, though an embedded
mid-level impulse is expected to rapidly eject into the central
Plains, with a southward-surging cold front expected. Deep-layer
westerly flow will promote dry and breezy conditions across the
southwest U.S. into the southern High Plains, with briefly dry and
breezy conditions also accompanying the post-cold-frontal
environment across the central High Plains.

...Southwest U.S. into the southern High Plains...
While mid-level wind speeds are expected to be modest, ample diurnal
heating is expected to encourage strong enough downward momentum
transport and downslope flow to promote widespread 15-20 mph
sustained westerly surface winds across portions of the Four Corners
region into the southern High Plains. An Elevated area has been
maintained where fuels are most receptive to fire spread, and where
RH is expected to drop below 15% for several hours during the
afternoon. A few of the more terrain-favoring locations may also
experience brief, locally Critical conditions around afternoon peak
heating.

...Central High Plains...
The cold front is expected to surge southeast across portions of
eastern Colorado into central Nebraska during the afternoon hours.
While guidance still varies regarding how low minimum RH will get,
guidance consensus suggests that RH may remain at or below 20%
immediately behind the cold front for up to 3 hours, when 15-25 mph
northwesterly surface winds are expected. Given a moderate to severe
drought across the area, fuels should be at least marginally
receptive to some fire spread despite green-up and some recent light
precipitation accumulations, prompting the introduction of an
Elevated area.

...North-Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat Midweek...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of best clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS
mean, 12 UTC CMC, 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models (NBM) for days 3-4 (Wednesday/Thursday).
Discounted the 12 UTC ECMWF that seemed too progressive/weak
through midweek out from the Northeast considering closed system
nature and upper ridging building over-top in Canada. The 00 UTC
ECMWF has now strongly trended toward a more amplified/less
progressive solution, as has 00 UTC guidance overall. Out West,
models show better agreement with trough energy settling into the
Great Basin past midweek, but become more varied with focus and
energy ejection days days 5-7. Prefer the ensemble means that more
bodily lingers energies. Accordingly, used the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble
means and the NBM days 5-7 (Fri/next weekend) amid growing model
forecast spread. This all acts to maintain good WPC continuity.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A combination of an amplified upper trough/closed low held over
the West and lead cold Canadian High Pressure (with temp anomalies
~10-20 degrees below normal) sets the stage for a potentially
heavy upslope snow event over the North-Central Rockies/High
Plains through midweek. Some deformation and terrain enhanced
precipitation is also possible over the Great Basin. Dependent on
system progression, a moderate rain focus may shift into the
Plains later in the week.

Meanwhile, a wavy frontal boundary will settle/linger this week
into the northern Gulf of Mexico and focus periods of moderate to
heavy rains over the Florida/Gulf Coast/Lower Mississippi
Valley/Southern Plains. Amounts don't look very high, but the
Central Gulf Coast states have had much above normal rainfall
recently, so there may be flooding concerns.

Farther north, showers/modest rainfall will linger across the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast mid-late week as upper level energy
slides through. Guidance is overall trending upward on system
organization and the extra focus also then suggests better
potential for later week moderate coastal low genesis and
unsettled maritime/coastal flow.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CDT Sun Apr 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will slowly advance across the north-central
CONUS as a second trough aloft begins to deepen along the West
Coast. Surface high pressure and associated cooler, drier air will
spill across portions of the Intermountain West and Plains states
while a surface low and associated warmer conditions are expected to
persist across the southwest U.S.

...Parts of the Southwest U.S...
Despite weak flow aloft, a dry boundary layer is expected to
encourage widespread 10-20% RH across portions of the Lower Colorado
River Basin into the Four Corners region during the afternoon.
Latest guidance consensus suggests that enough downward momentum
transport of the modest flow aloft will support 15 mph sustained
southwesterly winds atop fuels receptive to fire spread, warranting
the introduction of an Elevated area.

...Central High Plains...
As surface high pressure persists across the northern and central
CONUS, 15-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds are expected
tomorrow afternoon across portions of Colorado into Nebraska.
However, guidance varies substantially in terms of minimum RH,
precluding the introduction of an Elevated area at this time, though
Elevated highlights may be introduced in future outlooks if guidance
trends drier.

...Wet and stormy from the Great Lakes to the East Coast today;
scattered showers to stick around the Great Lakes and Northeast on
Monday...

...Dome of Canadian high pressure to direct below normal
temperatures from the Northwest and northern Rockies today into
the Nation's Heartland to open the week...

...Elevated fire weather risk remains in place for parts of the
Southwest; Wind Advisories in the northern High Plains today...

An occluded low pressure system entering the Great Lakes will
continue to spawn areas of showers and thunderstorms from the
Upper Mississippi Valley to the East Coast today. The best chances
for potentially severe thunderstorms reside within the storm
system's warm sector over the Mid-Atlantic and ahead of its
associated cold front in Florida. In fact, a Slight Risk for
severe weather is in place for much of the Florida Peninsula.
Abnormally cool temperatures reside beneath a cold and potent
upper low also tracking into the Great Lakes later today. High
temps ranging between the low-mid 50s are expected from the
Wisconsin on south and east into the Ohio Valley. The storm system
will gradually weaken Sunday night and into Monday but is in no
rush to leave the northeastern quarter of the Lower 48. This keeps
spotty showers and mostly cloudy conditions in place throughout
the Great Lakes and Northeast into the start of the week. The good
news is the cold front races into the northwest Atlantic on Monday
and a weak area of high pressure moves in across the Southeast,
making for a drier and quieter start to the work-week.

Farther west, an area of low pressure ushers in a seasonally cool
temperature regime to the Northwest and northern Rockies. Some
spots in the Pacific Northwest may even see record cold low temps
this morning. In wake of the storm's cold frontal passage, a dome
of Canadian high pressure spilling down from western provinces
will support the push of abnormally colder temperatures southward
the first half of the upcoming week. Places like the southern High
Plains go from a more summer-like regime on Sunday to feeling more
like March come Monday. Cooler temperatures are forecast to
overtake the Mississippi Valley by Tuesday. Along with the colder
temperatures, areas of mountain snow across the northern and
central Rockies are likely to transpire both today and Monday. A
meandering upper low over the North-Central U.S. could lead to
several inches of accumulating snowfall in parts of North Dakota
and northern Minnesota late Sunday and into Monday.

Regarding other weather hazards around the country, fire weather
conditions remain at elevated levels in parts of the Southwest and
the central High Plains today. Fire weather conditions improve in
the central High Plain on Monday, but persist in parts of New
Mexico and Arizona. Plus, abnormally chilly conditions have led to
some Frost Advisories being issued for parts of the central Plains
and along the coast of northern California and southwest Oregon.
Lastly, there are a handful of High Wind Warnings in place for
western South Dakota and Wyoming this morning. Wind Advisories
have also been posted for parts of the western Dakotas and eastern
Montana through this evening as wind gusts could reach as high as
55 mph at times.

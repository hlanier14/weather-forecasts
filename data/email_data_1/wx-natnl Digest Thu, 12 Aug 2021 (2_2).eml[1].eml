...Tropical Storm Fred Heavy Rain Threat from Florida this weekend
to the Southeast/Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic early-mid next week...


...Pattern Overview...

Models and ensembles show amplified troughing moving into the
Northwest on Sunday shifting slowly eastward early next week.
Meanwhile, an upper level trough will move through the Northeast
Sunday-Monday, with heights beginning to rise again across much of
the East by later in the medium range period. Tropical Storm Fred
will likely affect Florida this weekend bringing heavy rainfall,
and then also into parts of the Southeast, southern to central
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic early-mid next week as tropical
moisture feeds inland and interacts with a stalled leading frontal
zone draped to the north of Fred and terrain.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The NHC tracks Tropical Storm Fred over the far eastern Gulf of
Mexico as the medium range period begins on Sunday before lifting
inland into the Southeast and up the Appalachians early next week
as a gradually weakening but very wet system both along/east of
the track and in advance with deep moisture feed into a draped
front. Fred offers a maritime and inland heavy rainfall/runoff
threat. There remains some considerable spread regarding Fred's
track through the eastern Gulf and into the Southeast. Please
refer to NHC guidance regarding the details and official forecast
track.

Elsewhere, there's fairly good agreement to suffice a
deterministic blend for days 3-4 including the latest runs of the
ECMWF, GFS, and CMC. The second half of the period there remains
some uncertainty around the amplified Western U.S. troughing. The
GFS is more amplified and brings a closed low into the northern
Rockies, while the ECMWF and CMC are a little weaker and both lift
the closed low feature well into central Canada. Given the late
period timing, opted to lean more on the ECENS/GEFS ensemble means
which were more agreeable. Axis wise, there's decent agreement,
but it's the detail and dynamics differences which make the QPF
forecast across the northern Rockies/northern High Plains very
uncertain. A blend towards the ensemble means also supports the
growing forecast spread surrounding Fred after it makes landfall
likely near the Florida Panhandle.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave over the Northwest during the short range
should finally break by the medium range period. Sunday
temperatures should still be above normal, but not nearly as
extreme as previous days. By Monday, troughing looks to quickly
move into the region so temperatures should actually rebound below
normal across the Northwest. Some portions of the Northern Rockies
could be 10-15+ degrees below normal next Tuesday into Wednesday.
Above to much above normal temperatures will shift eastward Sunday
and Monday into parts of the Northern Plains as well.

Heavy rainfall and gusty winds across Florida associated with
Tropical Storm Fred will be ongoing on Sunday, especially along
the western Florida Gulf coast. Tropical moisture will likely
spread northward even ahead of any landfall by Fred into the
Southeast, Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, interacting with a
leading stalled frontal boundary and favorable terrain. Exact
locations of heaviest rainfall depends on the eventual track of
Fred and may still take another few days to resolve.

Elsewhere, as an upper ridge axis in the Western U.S. shifts east
with advent of upper troughing over the Northwest, monsoon
activity over the Desert Southwest should increase and spread
northward, again bringing a localized flash flood risk. Moisture
should stream northward ahead of the incoming trough into the
Northwest, with a potential moderate to heavy rain threat emerging
over parts of the northern Rockies/high Plains on Tuesday, with
organized and enhanced rainfall then focusing along the cold front
as it shifts into the Northern Plains Tuesday into Wednesday.

...Tropical Storm Fred Heavy Rain Threat from Florida this weekend
to the Southeast/Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic early-mid next week...


...Pattern Overview...

Models and ensembles show amplified troughing moving into the
Northwest on Sunday shifting slowly eastward early next week.
Meanwhile, an upper level trough will move through the Northeast
Sunday-Monday, with heights beginning to rise again across much of
the East by later in the medium range period. Tropical Storm Fred
will likely affect Florida this weekend bringing heavy rainfall,
and then also into parts of the Southeast, southern to central
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic early-mid next week as tropical
moisture feeds inland and interacts with a stalled leading frontal
zone draped to the north of Fred and terrain.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The NHC tracks Tropical Storm Fred over the far eastern Gulf of
Mexico as the medium range period begins on Sunday before lifting
inland into the Southeast and up the Appalachians early next week
as a gradually weakening but very wet system both along/east of
the track and in advance with deep moisture feed into a draped
front. Fred offers a maritime and inland heavy rainfall/runoff
threat. There remains some considerable spread regarding Fred's
track through the eastern Gulf and into the Southeast. Please
refer to NHC guidance regarding the details and official forecast
track.

Elsewhere, there's fairly good agreement to suffice a
deterministic blend for days 3-4 including the latest runs of the
ECMWF, GFS, and CMC. The second half of the period there remains
some uncertainty around the amplified Western U.S. troughing. The
GFS is more amplified and brings a closed low into the northern
Rockies, while the ECMWF and CMC are a little weaker and both lift
the closed low feature well into central Canada. Given the late
period timing, opted to lean more on the ECENS/GEFS ensemble means
which were more agreeable. Axis wise, there's decent agreement,
but it's the detail and dynamics differences which make the QPF
forecast across the northern Rockies/northern High Plains very

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Thu Aug 12 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, broad cyclonic flow will continue across the
northern US as a shortwave trough across southern Canada
intensifies. To the south, weak ridging will build in the Southwest
as an upper low meanders off the West Coast. At the surface, monsoon
moisture will move northward, setting the stage for thunderstorms
across California and the Northwest. Elsewhere, little overlap of
strong winds and low RH will limit the potential for critical fire
weather conditions.

...Northern California and Northwest dry thunder...
As lift from the weak upper low off the West Coast lingers over the
region, monsoon moisture will be advected northward into southern
Oregon. Diurnal heating across the higher terrain should support the
development of isolated thunderstorms by early afternoon. Model
soundings show PWAT values between 0.6 and 0.8 inches, atop steep
low-level lapse rates. This will favor a dry storm mode despite slow
storm motions below 10 kts. Isolated dry thunderstorms are likely
across northern California and southern Oregon where fuels are very
receptive to lightning ignitions. Confidence in storm development
decreases with southward extent, but a few dry strikes appear
possible over receptive fuels.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CDT Thu Aug 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Monsoon flow will continue into Day2/Friday as ridging intensifies
over the Great Basin and Southwest. Onshore flow across the West
Coast, driven by a weak upper low, will aid in dry thunderstorm
development across the Pacific Northwest. Otherwise, fire weather
concerns will be minimal given the poor overlap of strong winds and
low relative humidity in the lower 48.

...Northwest Dry Thunder...
As mid-level ridging builds across the Great Basin, low-level
moisture advection and weak onshore flow will add to the moist
monsoon airmass in place. PWAT values are forecast to increase to
near 1 inch by early afternoon, supporting widely scattered
thunderstorm development. Model soundings continue to show
relatively dry surface conditions favorable for dry strikes despite
increasing PWAT values and slow storm speeds. Given the presence of
extremely dry fuels, isolated dry thunder probabilities will be
maintained.

...Stifling heat wave continues in the Northeast, Mid-South, and
Pacific Northwest...

...Daily rounds of strong-to-severe storms from the Mississippi
Valley and Great Lakes to the Northeast, monsoon showers and
storms could lead to areas of flash flooding in the Southwest...

...Poor air quality due to wildfire smoke continues in the western
and central U.S., Tropical Depression Fred to reach the Florida
Straits by the start of the weekend...

The remainder of the work-week continues to look oppressively hot
in the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest. Today features
numerous Heat Advisories and some Excessive Heat Warnings from the
central Plains to the Northeast. Heat indices in these areas will
range between 100-110 degrees with some locations as high as 115
degrees. The Pacific Northwest will also bake as high temperatures
soar into the triple digits, leading to the issuance of many
Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories. The Pacific Northwest
and Northeast can expect daily record highs to be broken both
Thursday and Friday while even more locations have a better chance
to observe daily record warm minimum temperatures. A passing cold
front ushers in more seasonal conditions to the Midwest on Friday,
but the Northeast will have to wait until Saturday for slightly
cooler conditions to arrive.

The aforementioned cold front will inch its way south and east
over the next couple days across the eastern half of the Lower 48.
The front's slow movement results in daily episodes of widespread
showers and thunderstorms from the central Plains to the
Northeast. The best chance for organized severe weather lies just
ahead of the front, specifically part of the Midwest and the
Northeast today where Slight Risks have been issued by the Storm
Prediction Center. Some severe storms could also develop in the
Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic. By Friday, the severe threat moves
into the Mid-South while the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic remain in
a favorable environment for severe storms. Excessive rainfall
rates are also possible in heavier cells, making it possible for
areas of flash flooding to transpire. The Gulf Coast can expect
scattered showers and thunderstorms each afternoon and evening
with locally heavy rainfall totals.

In the West, monsoon showers and thunderstorms will be a daily
occurrence in the Desert Southwest, helping to keep temperatures
at seasonally cooler levels. That said, some areas of flash
flooding are possible due to a pocket of abundant atmospheric
moisture centered over the region. In addition, wildfires and
their coalesced area of smoke remains a problem for many residents
in the West, most notably in the central Rockies and High Plains
where Air Quality alerts remain in place. Farther north, the
coolest temperatures in the mainland U.S. will be found in the
Northern Plains thanks to a pair of passing cold fronts. Last but
certainly not least, eyes are turning to the tropics as Tropical
Depression Fred is forecast to approach South Florida from Cuba
Friday night. Forecast to reach the Florida Keys as a tropical
storm, some squalls associated with the outer rainbands of Fred
could begin to impact southern Florida on Friday. These squalls
out ahead of Fred would likely contain heavy downpours and
increasingly gusty winds. Please visit the National Hurricane
Center homepage for the latest forecast information on Tropical
Depression Fred.

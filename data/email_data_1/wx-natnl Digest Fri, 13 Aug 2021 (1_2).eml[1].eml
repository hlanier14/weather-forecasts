Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Thu Aug 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

The current forecast remains on track.

... Northern Nevada ...

A hot, dry, unstable boundary layer, coupled with precipitable-water
values around half an inch, may yield a thunderstorm or two across
this area. However, low confidence in thunderstorm initiation and
coverage, combined with slow storm speeds for any thunderstorm that
does develop, precludes the addition of an isolated dry thunderstorm
area. Despite the lack of delineation, a couple of lightning strikes
may be possible this afternoon.

..Marsh.. 08/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Thu Aug 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, broad cyclonic flow will continue across the
northern US as a shortwave trough across southern Canada
intensifies. To the south, weak ridging will build in the Southwest
as an upper low meanders off the West Coast. At the surface, monsoon
moisture will move northward, setting the stage for thunderstorms
across California and the Northwest. Elsewhere, little overlap of
strong winds and low RH will limit the potential for critical fire
weather conditions.

...Northern California and Northwest dry thunder...
As lift from the weak upper low off the West Coast lingers over the
region, monsoon moisture will be advected northward into southern
Oregon. Diurnal heating across the higher terrain should support the
development of isolated thunderstorms by early afternoon. Model
soundings show PWAT values between 0.6 and 0.8 inches, atop steep
low-level lapse rates. This will favor a dry storm mode despite slow
storm motions below 10 kts. Isolated dry thunderstorms are likely
across northern California and southern Oregon where fuels are very
receptive to lightning ignitions. Confidence in storm development
decreases with southward extent, but a few dry strikes appear
possible over receptive fuels.

...A frontal system will spread precipitation and gusty winds to
central and eastern parts of the U.S. today...

...Unsettled weather continues over the Northwest...

A surface low pressure system is forecast to move northeastward
across the Upper Great Lakes today and tonight, sweeping a cold
front quickly across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys toward the
Eastern Seaboard. A quick round of rain and thunderstorms is
possible along and ahead of the front, and a few storms could be
strong to severe across portions of the Mid-Atlantic region, where
the Storm Prediction Center has outlooked a Marginal Risk. Some
precipitation should be in the form of snow across the Great Lakes
region to the interior Northeast, and light to moderate lake
enhanced snow could linger there through Tuesday. In addition to
the precipitation, gusty winds are expected. Wind Advisories are
widespread across much of the eastern half of the U.S., with some
High Wind Warnings embedded especially downwind of the Great
Lakes. Temperatures ahead of the front should be 5 to 10 degrees
above normal today in much of the East, cooling to a few degrees
below normal Monday behind the front.

In the Northwest, a frontal system is forecast to slowly move into
the region before dissipating tonight. Additional precipitation is
possible, with snow in the Cascades, Northern Rockies, and Wind
River Mountains/Tetons. Winter Weather Advisories remain in effect
for those areas. Rain totals in lower elevations will likely be
highest in far northwestern California and far southwestern Oregon
today, and Flood Watches are in effect there. Then Monday into
Tuesday, precipitation should mainly focus in Washington as the
moisture plume moves northward ahead of another front approaching
from the Pacific. A building upper-level ridge in the West should
lead to warmer than normal temperatures across California, the
Southwest, and the Great Basin on Monday.

Meanwhile, dry weather will continue in the central CONUS. Gusty
winds could be a threat in the Central High Plains in particular,
where High Wind Warnings remain in effect. Elevated fire weather
conditions may also continue in central and southern portions of
the High Plains today, as well as parts of southern California.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 12 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast to prevail over the western U.=
S.
during much of week-2. The westerly flow, associated with this mid-level lo=
w
pressure, is likely to result in a drier pattern for the Southwest. As stro=
ng
mid-level high pressure becomes centered over the higher latitudes of easte=
rn
North America, above-normal temperatures are forecast to return to the Corn
Belt, Great Lakes, and Northeast later next week after several days of
relatively cooler temperatures. An increased chance for additional tropical
cyclone development exists across the Atlantic basin into the latter half o=
f
August.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain for the Great Plains and Middle and Upper
Mississippi
Valley, Fri-Sun, Aug 20-22.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Northeast, Fri-Mon, Aug 20-2=
3.

FOR FRIDAY AUGUST 20 - THURSDAY AUGUST 26: Downstream of a persistent 500-h=
Pa
trough axis, multiple shortwave troughs are forecast to cross the central
CONUS
during the early part of week-2. Thunderstorms with locally heavy rain (nea=
r
an
inch or more per 24 hours) are expected to accompany these individual
shortwave
troughs. A slight risk of heavy rain is expanded south to include more of t=
he
Great Plains and Mississippi Valley, based on the amplified trough upstream
and
uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble precipitation guidance. The most likely time fo=
r
heavy rainfall is early in week-2 with chances diminishing later in the
outlook
period. Flash flooding could occur with any heavy rainfall in a short perio=
d
of
time. Drought conditions have recently intensified across the Northern Grea=
t
Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, and this wetter pattern during early
week-2 may at least temporarily end or slow the worsening drought. Accordin=
g
to
the U.S. Drought Monitor valid on Aug 10, nearly three-quarters of North
Dakota
is designated with extreme (D3) to exceptional (D4) drought.



The ensemble means depict anomalous 500-hPa ridging at the higher latitudes=
 of
eastern North America. The GEFS remains the strongest with this ridge and
features 500-hPa height departures of +60 to +120 meters across New England
early in week-2. This ridging aloft is expected to result in maximum
temperatures warming into the upper 80s (degrees F), while dewpoints rise w=
ell
into the 60s. These warming temperatures and more humid conditions by the
early
part of week-2 support a slight risk of excessive heat across New England
where
heat index values could be near or above 95F from Aug 20-23.



Tropical Depression Fred is currently located near northeast Cuba and is
forecast to track northwest and potentially strengthen when it enters the
eastern Gulf of Mexico. Heavy rain associated with the remnant low of Fred =
is
expected to end over the eastern U.S. by the beginning of week-2, Aug 20.
Please refer to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for the latest updates =
and
forecasts on Fred. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) continues to provide=
 a
favorable large-scale environment for additional tropical cyclone (TC)
development across the Atlantic basin. A tropical wave is currently over th=
e
Main Development Region of the tropical Atlantic, and as of 2pm EDT on Aug =
12,
the NHC states that this system has a 70 percent chance of becoming a TC
within
the next five days. Regardless of development, this tropical wave could bri=
ng
heavy rain and flooding to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this
weekend. Later in week-2, this potential TC could track towards the Southea=
st
or Gulf Coast but it is too early to know what impacts, if any, it would ha=
ve
on any specific area.



A 500-hPa trough is forecast to persist to the north of Alaska which promot=
es
near to above normal precipitation across the northern half of Mainland
Alaska.
Farther to the south, an increase in 500-hPa heights leading into week-2 is
expected to result in a drier pattern for southern Mainland Alaska, the
Aleutians, and Alaska Panhandle.

...Excessive heat moderates in the interior West as Tropical Storm
Fred is forecast to track near the west coast of Florida this
weekend and into the Southeast early-mid next week...

...Pattern Overview...

The strong upper ridge anchored in the western U.S. will likely
give way to an upper trough moving into the Pacific Northwest and
western Canada early next week.  Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Fred is
forecast to track north-northwest just off the west coast of
Florida this weekend, and then into the Southeast early to the
middle of next week ahead of a weak upper trough dipping into the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley.  Heavy rain can be expected to spread
north across the Southeast and into the Appalachians but with
uncertainty as to how far north the rain could reach toward the
end of the week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles show good agreement on bringing an upper
troughing eastward into the Pacific Northwest early next week.
There is a slight tendency for the models to push the trough
faster across the northern Plains midweek, bringing a period of
rain/thunderstorms followed by much cooler temperatures into the
region.   Meanwhile, models have been relatively consistent in
tracking Tropical Storm Fred up the eastern Gulf of Mexico
near/off the west coast Florida this weekend into Monday.
Thereafter, the ECMWF has been favoring a fast northward track up
the interior sections of the East Coast while other models take
Fred farther north at a slower pace ahead of a relatively weak
upper trough dipping into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley.  However,
the latest (12Z) guidance have decidedly shifted the landfall
location farther west and takes the remnants of Fred across the
Deep South.  It remains to be seen whether this model trend will
continue or not.

The WPC medium-range package was based on a blend of the 00Z
ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS, and some contributions from the 00Z
CMC/CMC mean.  Less QPF from the GFS/GEFS was incorporated into
the blend to account for the assumed northward track into the East
Coast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave over the Northwest during the short range
should finally break by the medium range period. Sunday
temperatures should still be above normal, but not nearly as
extreme as previous days. By Monday, troughing looks to quickly
move into the region so temperatures should actually rebound below
normal across the Northwest. Some portions of the Northern Rockies
could be 10-15+ degrees below normal next Tuesday into Wednesday.
Above to much above normal temperatures will shift eastward Sunday
and Monday into parts of the Northern Plains as well.

Heavy rainfall and gusty winds across Florida associated with
Tropical Storm Fred will be ongoing on Sunday, especially along
the western Florida Gulf coast. Tropical moisture will likely
spread northward even ahead of any landfall by Fred into the
Southeast, Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, interacting with a
leading stalled frontal boundary and favorable terrain. Exact
locations of heaviest rainfall depends on the eventual track of
Fred and may still take another few days to resolve.

Elsewhere, as an upper ridge axis in the Western U.S. shifts east
with advent of upper troughing over the Northwest, monsoon
activity over the Desert Southwest should increase and spread
northward, again bringing a localized flash flood risk. Moisture
should stream northward ahead of the incoming trough into the
Northwest, with a potential moderate to heavy rain threat emerging
over parts of the northern Rockies/high Plains on Tuesday, with
organized and enhanced rainfall then focusing along the cold front
as it shifts into the Northern Plains Tuesday into Wednesday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu August 12 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 18 - 22 2021

Model solutions are in very good agreement with respect to the 500-hPa
circulation pattern over North America during the 6-10 day period. A strong
mid-level ridge, predicted over the Northeast Pacific, leads to positive
500-hPa height anomalies across parts of southern Alaska. A trough is
predicted
further west over the western Aleutians. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies =
are
predicted over the northern Alaska Mainland. The strong mid-level ridge ove=
r
the Northeast Pacific leads to positive 500-hPa height anomalies along the
Pacific coast of the CONUS. A trough is predicted over the interior West,
along
with near to below average 500-hPa heights. A strong ridge is predicted ove=
r
eastern Canada along with positive mid-level height anomalies across parts =
of
the Midwest and Northeast. Near to below normal 500-hPa heights across much=
 of
the Southern Tier from the interior West to parts of the Southeast are
associated with a mean frontal boundary and increased convective activity.

Below-normal temperatures are favored across much of Mainland Alaska, ahead=
 of
a mid-level trough over the Bering Strait and under near to below average
500-hPa heights. Above-normal temperatures are favored over parts of the
Pacific Northwest, along the eastern periphery of the Northeast Pacific
mid-level ridge. Below-normal temperatures are favored for the Northern
Rockies, under the predicted mid-level trough. Increased moisture advection
and
cloud cover enhance odds for below-normal temperatures across the Southwest=
.
Strong positive 500-hPa height anomalies enhance odds for above-normal
temperatures from much of the Midwest across the Great Lakes and extending
into
the Northeast, with the highest probability over 80% over Maine. Above norm=
al
temperatures are favored across parts of the Southern Plains and Southeast
region, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Above-normal precipitation is favored for north-central Mainland Alaska, ah=
ead
of a mean mid-level trough over the Bering Sea. Below-normal precipitation =
is
likely for the Aleutians and southwestern Mainland Alaska underneath foreca=
st
above normal 500-hPa heights. Near to below normal precipitation is likely =
for
parts of the western CONUS ahead of the predicted ridge. A predicted trough
over the interior West increases probabilities of above-normal precipitatio=
n
from the Intermountain West region to most of the Great Plains. Increased o=
dds
of above-normal precipitation are also favored across the Southern Plains d=
ue
to an active Southwest Monsoon circulation. Strong positive mid-level heigh=
t
anomalies over eastern Canada favor below-normal precipitation across parts=
 of
the Great Lakes and Northeast. Over the Southeast and parts of the Central
Mississippi Valley, frontal boundary activity and a tropical system predict=
ed
to move across the eastern Gulf Coast at the start of the 6-10 day period
increase odds for above-normal precipitation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean

ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
very good model agreement on the predicted mean 500-hPa height pattern over
the
CONUS, offset by differences among model temperature and precipitation
forecasts, and uncertainty associated with the potential for tropical activ=
ity
in the Southeast.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 20 - 26 2021

Models continue to be in good agreement on the predicted circulation patter=
n
over North America during the week 2 period, with some de-amplification of
large-scale anomalies relative to the 6-10 day period. The trough over the
Bering Sea and western Aleutians de-amplifies significantly during the week=
 2
period, while positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the
Aleutians and central and southern Alaska, under increased influence of the
Northeast Pacific ridge. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted ov=
er
northern Mainland Alaska. Predicted mid-level troughing is over the western
CONUS. Similar to the 6-10 day period, a strong mean mid-level ridge over
southeastern Canada leads to positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending
across
the Midwest and Northeast. Near-normal mid-level heights over the Southern
Plains and Southeast are associated with increased convective activity alon=
g a
mean frontal boundary.

Increased onshore flow favors below-normal temperatures across much of
Mainland
Alaska. Above normal temperatures are likely for the western Aleutians
underneath above normal 500 hPa heights. Above normal temperatures are favo=
red
for the Pacific Northwest southeastward to across parts of the Great Basin =
to
the Central Plains, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. The
predicted trough over the West leads to likely near to below-normal
temperatures across the Northern High Plains. Enhanced probabilities for
below-normal temperatures in the Southwest are supported by increased soil
moisture due to the active southwest monsoon prior to the period. Enhanced
probabilities of above-normal temperatures are favored from parts of the
Northern and Central Plains eastward to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, und=
er
positive mid-level height anomalies. Above normal temperatures are predicte=
d
over the Southern Plains and Southeast consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool.

Increased onshore flow over central and northern Mainland Alaska increases =
the
chances of above-normal precipitation. Below-normal precipitation is predic=
ted
for southern Alaska, under the increased influence of the Northeast Pacific
ridge. Troughing over the western CONUS reduces monsoon precipitation leadi=
ng
to a forecast of below-normal precipitation. Mid-level troughing over the
western CONUS increases southerly flow to the east, increasing chances of
above-normal precipitation over parts of the Great Plains. A mean frontal
boundary and potential tropical activity lead to enhanced probabilities of
above-normal precipitation across much of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.
Below-normal precipitation is more likely over the Northeast under positive
mid-level height anomalies. Below normal precipitation is also favored over
parts of southern Texas, supported by the ERF Consolidation tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=

of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=

agreement in the circulation pattern over the forecast domain, offset by
increased uncertainty in the phase and amplitude of large-scale anomalies, =
and
some differences among the model temperature and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Excessive heat moderates in the interior West as Tropical Storm
Fred is forecast to track near the west coast of Florida this
weekend and into the Southeast early-mid next week...

...Pattern Overview...

The strong upper ridge anchored in the western U.S. will likely
give way to an upper trough moving into the Pacific Northwest and
western Canada early next week.  Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Fred is
forecast to track north-northwest just off the west coast of
Florida this weekend, and then into the Southeast early to the
middle of next week ahead of a weak upper trough dipping into the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley.  Heavy rain can be expected to spread
north across the Southeast and into the Appalachians but with
uncertainty as to how far north the rain could reach toward the
end of the week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles show good agreement on bringing an upper
troughing eastward into the Pacific Northwest early next week.
There is a slight tendency for the models to push the trough
faster across the northern Plains midweek, bringing a period of
rain/thunderstorms followed by much cooler temperatures into the
region.   Meanwhile, models have been relatively consistent in
tracking Tropical Storm Fred up the eastern Gulf of Mexico
near/off the west coast Florida this weekend into Monday.
Thereafter, the ECMWF has been favoring a fast northward track up
the interior sections of the East Coast while other models take
Fred farther north at a slower pace ahead of a relatively weak
upper trough dipping into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley.  However,
the latest (12Z) guidance have decidedly shifted the landfall
location farther west and takes the remnants of Fred across the
Deep South.  It remains to be seen whether this model trend will
continue or not.

The WPC medium-range package was based on a blend of the 00Z
ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS, and some contributions from the 00Z
CMC/CMC mean with more weights from the ensemble means for Days 6
and 7.  The GFS/GEFS have been on the light side regarding QPFs
across the interior eastern U.S. due to a slower and much weaker
portrayal of the remnants of Fred.  Therefore, less QPF from the
GFS/GEFS was incorporated into the blend for Days 5 to 6 to
account for the assumed northward track into the interior East
Coast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave over the Northwest during the short range
should finally break by the medium range period. Sunday
temperatures should still be above normal, but not nearly as
extreme as previous days. By Monday, troughing looks to quickly
move into the region so temperatures should actually rebound below
normal across the Northwest. Some portions of the Northern Rockies
could be 10-15+ degrees below normal next Tuesday into Wednesday.
Above to much above normal temperatures will shift eastward Sunday
and Monday into parts of the Northern Plains as well.

Heavy rainfall and gusty winds across Florida associated with
Tropical Storm Fred will be ongoing on Sunday, especially along
the western Florida Gulf coast. Tropical moisture will likely
spread northward even ahead of any landfall by Fred into the
Southeast, Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, interacting with a
leading stalled frontal boundary and favorable terrain. Exact
locations of heaviest rainfall depends on the eventual track of
Fred and may still take another few days to resolve.

Elsewhere, as an upper ridge axis in the Western U.S. shifts east
with advent of upper troughing over the Northwest, monsoon
activity over the Desert Southwest should increase and spread
northward, again bringing a localized flash flood risk. Moisture
should stream northward ahead of the incoming trough into the
Northwest, with a potential moderate to heavy rain threat emerging
over parts of the northern Rockies/high Plains on Tuesday, with
organized and enhanced rainfall then focusing along the cold front
as it shifts into the Northern Plains Tuesday into Wednesday.

...Excessive heat moderates in the interior West as Tropical Storm
Fred is forecast to track near the west coast of Florida this
weekend and into the Southeast early-mid next week...

...Pattern Overview...

The strong upper ridge anchored in the western U.S. will likely
give way to an upper trough moving into the Pacific Northwest and
western Canada early next week.  Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Fred is
forecast to track north-northwest just off the west coast of
Florida this weekend, and then into the Southeast early to the
middle of next week ahead of a weak upper trough dipping into the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley.  Heavy rain can be expected to spread
north across the Southeast and into the Appalachians but with
uncertainty as to how far north the rain could reach toward the
end of the week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles show good agreement on bringing an upper
troughing eastward into the Pacific Northwest early next week.
There is a slight tendency for the models to push the trough
faster across the northern Plains midweek, bringing a period of
rain/thunderstorms followed by much cooler temperatures into the
region.   Meanwhile, models have been relatively consistent in
tracking Tropical Storm Fred up the eastern Gulf of Mexico
near/off the west coast Florida this weekend into Monday.
Thereafter, the ECMWF has been favoring a fast northward track up
the interior sections of the East Coast while other models take
Fred farther north at a slower pace ahead of a relatively weak
upper trough dipping into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley.  However,
the latest (12Z) guidance have decidedly shifted the landfall
location farther west and takes the remnants of Fred across the
Deep South.  It remains to be seen whether this model trend will
continue or not.

The WPC medium-range package was based on a blend of the 00Z
ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS, and some contributions from the 00Z
CMC/CMC mean with more weights from the ensemble means for Days 6
and 7.  The GFS/GEFS have been on the light side regarding QPFs
across the interior eastern U.S. due to a slower and much weaker
portrayal of the remnants of Fred.  Therefore, less QPF from the
GFS/GEFS was incorporated into the blend for Days 5 to 6 to
account for the assumed northward track into the interior East
Coast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave over the Northwest during the short range
should finally break by the medium range period. Sunday
temperatures should still be above normal, but not nearly as
extreme as previous days. By Monday, troughing looks to quickly
move into the region so temperatures should actually rebound below
normal across the Northwest. Some portions of the Northern Rockies
could be 10-15+ degrees below normal next Tuesday into Wednesday.
Above to much above normal temperatures will shift eastward Sunday
and Monday into parts of the Northern Plains as well.

Heavy rainfall and gusty winds across Florida associated with
Tropical Storm Fred will be ongoing on Sunday, especially along
the western Florida Gulf coast. Tropical moisture will likely
spread northward even ahead of any landfall by Fred into the
Southeast, Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, interacting with a
leading stalled frontal boundary and favorable terrain. Exact
locations of heaviest rainfall depends on the eventual track of
Fred and may still take another few days to resolve.

Elsewhere, as an upper ridge axis in the Western U.S. shifts east
with advent of upper troughing over the Northwest, monsoon
activity over the Desert Southwest should increase and spread
northward, again bringing a localized flash flood risk. Moisture
should stream northward ahead of the incoming trough into the
Northwest, with a potential moderate to heavy rain threat emerging
over parts of the northern Rockies/high Plains on Tuesday, with
organized and enhanced rainfall then focusing along the cold front
as it shifts into the Northern Plains Tuesday into Wednesday.

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

In general the ongoing forecast remains on track.

The only change has been to expand the isolated dry thunderstorm
area to include northern Nevada. Here, mid-level instability should
be slightly better than on Thursday leading to increasing confidence
that at least a 10% coverage of thunderstorms is likely. Given the
hot, dry boundary layer anticipated across the area, dry
thunderstorms will be possible.

..Marsh.. 08/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Thu Aug 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
Monsoon flow will continue into Day2/Friday as ridging intensifies
over the Great Basin and Southwest. Onshore flow across the West
Coast, driven by a weak upper low, will aid in dry thunderstorm
development across the Pacific Northwest. Otherwise, fire weather
concerns will be minimal given the poor overlap of strong winds and
low relative humidity in the lower 48.

...Northwest Dry Thunder...
As mid-level ridging builds across the Great Basin, low-level
moisture advection and weak onshore flow will add to the moist
monsoon airmass in place. PWAT values are forecast to increase to
near 1 inch by early afternoon, supporting widely scattered
thunderstorm development. Model soundings continue to show
relatively dry surface conditions favorable for dry strikes despite
increasing PWAT values and slow storm speeds. Given the presence of
extremely dry fuels, isolated dry thunder probabilities will be
maintained.

...Stifling heat wave continues in the Northeast, Mid-South, and
Pacific Northwest...

...Daily rounds of strong-to-severe storms from the Mississippi
Valley and Great Lakes to the Northeast, monsoon showers and
storms could lead to areas of flash flooding in the Southwest...

...Poor air quality due to wildfire smoke remains in the western
and central U.S.;Tropical Depression Fred to reach the Florida
Straits by the start of the weekend...

Oppressively hot weather will continue through the work-week in
the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest, as numerous Heat
Advisories and Excessive Heat Warnings stretch over portions of
these regions. In the East, heat indices could soar to 100 degrees
over the majority of the region, with some locations including
Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia approaching 105-110
degrees. Moreover, little relief from the heat is anticipated
tonight across the East as very warm low temperatures hover in the
mid-upper 70's to low 80's. Very hot and humid conditions also
persist over the Central U.S. through at least today, before an
approaching cold front ushers in more seasonal conditions on
Friday, although the Northeast will have to wait until Saturday
for cooler conditions to arrive. The Pacific Northwest will also
bake as high temperatures soar into the triple digits, which will
threaten daily numerous record highs tomorrow, including the
Portland and Seattle metropolitan areas. By Saturday, the bulk of
the hottest temperatures will shift east of the Cascades, where
several daily records could be threatened once again.

The aforementioned cold front will inch its way south and east
over the next couple days across the eastern half of the Lower 48.
The front's relatively slow movement results in daily episodes of
widespread showers and thunderstorms from the central Plains to
the Northeast. The best chance for organized severe weather lies
just ahead of the front, specifically part of the Midwest and the
Northeast today. An Enhanced Risk of severe weather is in effect
over portions of eastern Ohio into Central Pennsylvania today, for
an enhanced severe wind threat. Thunderstorm development is
already underway across the region, and a Severe Thunderstorm
Watch extends across the Northeast with the impending storms. A
Slight risk also resides over the Missouri Valley today, also for
a wind threat. Excessive rainfall rates are also possible given
the unstable airmass in place ahead of the front, making it
possible for areas of flash flooding to transpire. A Slight Risk
of Excessive Rainfall partially overlaps the severe weather area
today in Missouri/Illinois, where the most intense rain rates are
expected. Elsewhere, the Gulf Coast can expect scattered showers
and thunderstorms each afternoon and evening with locally heavy
rainfall totals.

In the Southwest, showers and thunderstorms will be a daily
occurrence, helping to maintain temperatures at seasonally cooler
levels. That said, some areas of flash flooding are possible due
to a pocket of abundant atmospheric moisture centered over the
region. Accordingly, a Slight Risk of Excessive Rain is
highlighted over the portions of the Southwest every day through
Sunday. In addition, wildfires and their coalesced area of smoke
remains a problem for many residents in the West, most notably in
the central Rockies and High Plains where Air Quality alerts
remain in place. Farther north, the coolest temperatures in the
mainland U.S. will be found in the Northern Plains thanks to cool
air behind a pair of passing cold fronts. Last but certainly not
least, eyes are turning to the tropics as Tropical Depression Fred
is forecast to approach South Florida from Cuba Friday night.
Forecast to reach the Florida Keys as a tropical storm, some
squalls associated with the outer rainbands of Fred could begin to
impact southern Florida on Friday. These squalls out ahead of Fred
would likely contain heavy downpours, where a Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall from Saturday-Sunday is in effect. Please visit
the National Hurricane Center homepage for the latest forecast
information on Tropical Depression Fred.

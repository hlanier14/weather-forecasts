Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 AM CDT Sun Aug 22 2021

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

Expanded the elevated area slightly northeast into central South
Dakota where ERCs are near the 95th percentile and winds of 15 to 20
mph are expected with relative humidity around 15 to 20 percent.
Otherwise, the forecast remains on track with no changes necessary.

..Bentley.. 08/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CDT Sun Aug 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel shortwave trough currently over the northern
Intermountain West this morning is forecast to move
east-northeastward across the northern Rockies/Plains throughout the
day.  Behind the shortwave trough, enhanced westerly flow aloft will
linger over the northern/central High Plains.  At the surface, a low
pressure system over eastern Montana will deepen throughout the day
as it moves northeastward into southern Manitoba.  An associated
cold front will shift eastward across the northern/central Plains,
leaving downslope westerly winds in its wake.

...Portions of southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, and
the Nebraska Panhandle...
Westerly post-frontal winds should result in rapid drying and
warming throughout the day across the region in a favored
downslope-flow regime.  Additionally, enhanced westerly flow aloft
will be mixed down to the surface as the boundary layer deepens
through the afternoon.  As a result, sustained westerly surface
winds will likely exceed 20 mph in the afternoon with gusts commonly
exceeding 30 mph. While RH values may not fall below critical
values, they will be low enough (15-20%) to elevate fire weather
concerns, especially for locations that have received little rain
over the past few days.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain potential late week into the weekend...


...Overview...

Guidance maintains a fairly typical late-summer pattern next week
and into the weekend.  The prevailing jet stream across southern
Canada into the northern U.S. will support a couple
rainfall-focusing waves/frontal systems, with the Upper Midwest
region likely to see the heaviest activity.  Meanwhile, a broad
upper ridge over the South and parts of the East will maintain hot
and humid conditions.  The most oppressive heat/humidity
combination is likely to continue into midweek or so over the
Mississippi Valley and vicinity.  Toward the end of next week,
recent model guidance has lowered the chance of another heat wave
to build along the West Coast as the deterministic guidance
indicates the possibility of an upper trough digging down across
the Pacific Northwest.  Along the East Coast, slow retrogression
of a western Atlantic ridge may ultimately reinforce ridging.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Most models and the ensemble means have been identifying two
primary features within the southern Canada/northern U.S. flow but
with some detail differences and run-to-run variability.  The 00Z
and 06Z GFS backed off on the degree of frontal wave development
across the northern Plains midweek in disagreement with both the
ECMWF and CMC.  The 12Z GFS switched back to a solution more in
line with the ECMWF, CMC, and WPC continuity, however.  Therefore,
more of the 06Z GEFS instead of the 06Z GFS was incorporated into
the WPC blend to handle this system.  There is a noticeable
discrepancy between the QPF axis from the ECMWF and GFS as well.
A blend leaning more toward the EC mean was used.

Toward the end of next week, recent deterministic guidance
indicates a higher probability for an upper trough to dig down
across the Pacific Northwest, most notably in the 00Z ECMWF
solution.  Recent runs from the GFS have followed suit with a
similar scenario by abandoning the idea of extending an upper
ridge into the western U.S.  The ensemble means generally show a
weaker version of this scenario.

In the tropical realm, attention will turn to the northwestern
Caribbean through the western Gulf of Mexico where guidance is
suggesting at least a wave if not a defined tropical system.  CMC
runs had been on the strong and northern side of the spread though
the new 00Z run has trended southward, a sensible adjustment given
the prevalence of upper ridging to the north.  The manual forecast
next weekend shows tropical wave positions in the Gulf in
coordination with the National Hurricane Center.

Therefore, a composite blend of the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and a smaller proportion from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used
to compose the WPC medium range package.  This yielded a solution
quite compatible with the previous WPC forecast package.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Surface waves and associated fronts will cross the northern U.S.
and southern Canada, producing episodes of showers and
thunderstorms that could be locally heavy.  Guidance continues to
highlight the best potential for heavy rainfall over the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Midwest from late this week into the
weekend.  This region will see an early frontal passage, followed
by the front stalling to the south (Mid-Mississippi Valley) and
then lifting back north as a warm front ahead of another system
whose trailing cold front will move into the area during next
weekend.  Parts of this region have been dry recently so some of
the rain may initially be beneficial.  However a multi-day period
of significant rainfall could end up being problematic over some
areas.  Central and southern parts of the East may see areas of
diurnally-favored convection within a humid and warm to hot
airmass.  Upper level energy from a combination of the tail end of
the initial East Coast trough and what tracks underneath the
western Atlantic ridge may enhance convection over parts of the
South and/or southern Mid-Atlantic.  Specific details of this
energy have low predictability.  Rainfall may increase along the
central/western Gulf Coast next Sunday as a possible wave reaches
the western Gulf of Mexico.

Very warm to hot temperatures from the central-southern Plains
through much of the East as of Wednesday (plus 10F or so anomalies
for highs from the Mid Mississippi Valley into Northeast) should
gradually moderate with time, especially with highs trending to
within a few degrees of normal by next Sunday.  The highest heat
index values should be on Wednesday over the Mid/Lower Mississippi
Valley and along the Gulf Coast where max values may locally reach
110F or so.  Morning lows will be more persistently above normal
with areas from the Midwest into Great Lakes/Ohio Valley tending
to see readings stay close to or a little above 10F above normal
through the period.  Some daily records for warm lows may be
challenged even away from areas with the highest anomalies.  A
cold front and trailing high pressure will bring the Northeast a
break from the warmth late week into the weekend.  Based on recent
guidance consensus, expansion of the upper ridge across southern
parts of the West would support increasing coverage of highs 5-10F
above normal over southern parts of the West and then across much
of California later in the week, followed by up to plus 10-15F
highs reaching western Oregon next weekend.  More western
troughing aloft in the new 00Z GFS/ECMWF would significantly
curtail this warming trend though.  The Northern Plains region
will be consistently cool during the period.  Some 10-15F below
normal highs are possible from Wednesday into Saturday.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain potential late week into the weekend...


...Overview...

Guidance maintains a fairly typical late-summer pattern next week
and into the weekend.  The prevailing jet stream across southern
Canada into the northern U.S. will support a couple
rainfall-focusing waves/frontal systems, with the Upper Midwest
region likely to see the heaviest activity.  Meanwhile, a broad
upper ridge over the South and parts of the East will maintain hot
and humid conditions.  The most oppressive heat/humidity
combination is likely to continue into midweek or so over the
Mississippi Valley and vicinity.  Toward the end of next week,
recent model guidance has lowered the chance of another heat wave
to build along the West Coast as the deterministic guidance
indicates the possibility of an upper trough digging down across
the Pacific Northwest.  Along the East Coast, slow retrogression
of a western Atlantic ridge may ultimately reinforce ridging.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Most models and the ensemble means have been identifying two
primary features within the southern Canada/northern U.S. flow but
with some detail differences and run-to-run variability.  The 00Z
and 06Z GFS backed off on the degree of frontal wave development
across the northern Plains midweek in disagreement with both the
ECMWF and CMC.  The 12Z GFS switched back to a solution more in
line with the ECMWF, CMC, and WPC continuity, however.  Therefore,
more of the 06Z GEFS instead of the 06Z GFS was incorporated into
the WPC blend to handle this system.  There is a noticeable
discrepancy between the QPF axis from the ECMWF and GFS as well.
A blend leaning more toward the EC mean was used.

Toward the end of next week, recent deterministic guidance
indicates a higher probability for an upper trough to dig down
across the Pacific Northwest, most notably in the 00Z ECMWF
solution.  Recent runs from the GFS have followed suit with a
similar scenario by abandoning the idea of extending an upper
ridge into the western U.S.  The ensemble means generally show a
weaker version of this scenario.

In the tropical realm, attention will turn to the northwestern
Caribbean through the western Gulf of Mexico where guidance is
suggesting at least a wave if not a defined tropical system.  CMC
runs had been on the strong and northern side of the spread though
the new 00Z run has trended southward, a sensible adjustment given
the prevalence of upper ridging to the north.  The manual forecast
next weekend shows tropical wave positions in the Gulf in
coordination with the National Hurricane Center.

Therefore, a composite blend of the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and a smaller proportion from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used
to compose the WPC medium range package.  This yielded a solution
quite compatible with the previous WPC forecast package.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Surface waves and associated fronts will cross the northern U.S.
and southern Canada, producing episodes of showers and
thunderstorms that could be locally heavy.  Guidance continues to
highlight the best potential for heavy rainfall over the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Midwest from late this week into the
weekend.  This region will see an early frontal passage, followed
by the front stalling to the south (Mid-Mississippi Valley) and
then lifting back north as a warm front ahead of another system
whose trailing cold front will move into the area during next
weekend.  Parts of this region have been dry recently so some of
the rain may initially be beneficial.  However a multi-day period
of significant rainfall could end up being problematic over some
areas.  Central and southern parts of the East may see areas of
diurnally-favored convection within a humid and warm to hot
airmass.  Upper level energy from a combination of the tail end of
the initial East Coast trough and what tracks underneath the
western Atlantic ridge may enhance convection over parts of the
South and/or southern Mid-Atlantic.  Specific details of this
energy have low predictability.  Rainfall may increase along the
central/western Gulf Coast next Sunday as a possible wave reaches
the western Gulf of Mexico.

Very warm to hot temperatures from the central-southern Plains

gradually moderate with time, especially with highs trending to

troughing aloft in the new 00Z GFS/ECMWF would significantly
curtail this warming trend though.  The Northern Plains region
will be consistently cool during the period.  Some 10-15F below
normal highs are possible from Wednesday into Saturday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun August 22 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CDT Sun Aug 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
Another shortwave trough is forecast to move eastward from the
Pacific Northwest across Montana on Monday.  An enhanced belt of
west-southwesterly flow aloft associated with this trough will move
across the northern Intermountain West/Rockies.  At the surface, low
pressure will develop over southeastern Montana by Monday afternoon.

...Central/Northeastern Wyoming...
Warm and dry conditions will lead to very deep, well-mixed boundary
layers across the region by the afternoon.  With enhanced
west-southwesterly flow aloft glancing the region, vertical mixing
should promote sustained afternoon winds approaching 20 mph with
gusts around 30 mph.  When coupled with afternoon RH values falling
below 15%, elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions will
be possible, especially considering the dry fuels across the area
(ERC values generally exceeding the 90th percentile).

Tropical Storm Henri, currently over parts of New England, is
forecast to slowly weaken over the region before exiting the
country, moving into the Canadian Maritimes on Tuesday evening.
Check with the NHC=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs latest bulletin for the most up-to-da=
te
track and intensity of Henri.  Henri will produce heavy rain over
parts of New England through Tuesday. Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall for the heavy rain
over the region lasting into Tuesday morning. The heavy rain will
create numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams
may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers from through
Tuesday morning.

Meanwhile, tropical moisture, an old boundary, and upper-level
energy will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms over the
Southeast into parts of the Central Gulf Coast through to Monday
morning.  The showers and thunderstorms will produce heavy rain
over the area. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through
Monday morning.  The excessive rainfall threat will wane over the
region by Monday morning.

A front over the Northern/Central Plains into parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley will move eastward into the Upper Mississippi
Valley before dissipating on Monday, as another front moves out of
the Northern Rockies/Great Basin.  The system will produce showers
and thunderstorms across the Upper Midwest through overnight
Sunday. Some of the thunderstorms may become severe.  Therefore,
the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Northern/Central Plains and the Middle Mississippi
Valley through Monday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  The severe thunderstorm threat
will lessen slightly on Monday into Tuesday.

Elsewhere, Red Flag Warnings and an Elevated fire weather risk are
forecast over parts of the Northern High Plains/Northern Rockies
Monday morning. Air Quality Alerts are also in effect throughout
Central California, parts of the Pacific Northwest, and Northern
High Plains/Northern Rockies due to thick wildfire smoke.
Meanwhile, Temperatures across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
portions of the Southern Plains will gradually turn hotter on
Monday into Tuesday as an upper-level ridge builds over the
southern tier. Oppressive heat will already be found across the
Lower Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southern Plains on
Sunday evening, as heat and humidity push heat indices up to
around 110F. As a result, Heat Advisories have been issued for
eastern Oklahoma, northeast Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and
Louisiana.  Furthermore, the area will have the possibility of
record high minimum temperatures through Wednesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CDT Mon Aug 23 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough evident in water vapor imagery this morning over
the Pacific Northwest is forecast to move across the northern
Intermountain West and Rockies today.  An associated belt of
enhanced midlevel west-southwesterly flow (>50 knots) will move
across Montana this afternoon and evening.  In response at the
surface, low pressure will deepen over southeastern Montana through
the day.

...Central/Northeastern Wyoming...
As diurnal heating occurs in the presence of dry airmass, deep and
well-mixed boundary layers will yield critical RH values (<15%).  In
addition, these deep boundary layers will promote downward vertical
mixing of enhanced flow aloft and contribute to sustained afternoon
surface wind speeds approaching 20 mph.  As a result, elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions are likely given the dry
fuels across the region.

...Eastern Wyoming and Adjacent Portions of Southeastern Montana,
Western South Dakota, and Western Nebraska Panhandle...
Modest midlevel moisture in the presence of deep inverted-v profiles
across the region should support enough instability for at least
isolated thunderstorm development.  Given the expected high cloud
bases and dry sub-cloud layer, little precipitation is expected to
reach the ground from these storms, supporting isolated dry
thunderstorm potential.  Furthermore, relatively fast storm motions
and low PW values (around 0.5") should also support the potential
for isolated dry thunderstorms.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
As one potent shortwave trough moves across the northern Plains on
Tuesday, another midlevel trough will approach the West Coast. As a
result, southwesterly flow aloft across the West is forecast to be
rather modest.  At the surface, low pressure is forecast to develop
over the Great Basin, but the pressure gradient will remain weak
across the West.  As a result of these factors, the probability of
sustained surface wind speeds exceeding 20 mph is relatively low for
areas with dry fuels.  The lack of strong winds should limit fire
weather concerns on Tuesday, despite widespread critical RH values
across interior portions of the West.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain potential late week into the weekend...


...Overview...

Latest models and ensembles continue to agree fairly well on the
large scale upper pattern.  Northeastern Pacific flow should
extend into the Northwest U.S./southwestern Canada and then
east-northeast around the north side of a broad mean ridge that
covers areas from the Atlantic through the eastern and southern
parts of the lower 48.  Shortwaves within the westerlies will
support at least a couple waves/frontal systems whose associated
rainfall is most likely to be heaviest over the Upper Midwest.
Precise details of these shortwaves have been problematic over
recent days so there is still some uncertainty over specifics.
Areas to the south of the fronts will tend to be humid and very
warm to hot with some diurnally favored showers and thunderstorms.
 Possible tropical development over the northwestern Caribbean and
southwestern Gulf of Mexico may bring some enhanced moisture to
the western half of the Gulf Coast region by Sunday-Monday.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

By late in the week there are still some differences on the exact
relative strength of the shortwave that crosses the Northeast and
a western Atlantic ridge that slowly retrogrades toward the
southern Mid-Atlantic or nearby, leading to some differences for
the position of the front that drops into the Mid-Atlantic.
Recent guidance behavior suggests an intermediate solution will
provide the best option at this time.

Shortwave details upstream continue to be troublesome with varying
degrees of spread among models/ensembles and some trends
oscillating from day to day.  Consensus is starting to hint that
initial shortwave energy over the Northwest on Thursday will eject
and be followed by additional energy reaching the Northwest
Friday-Saturday.  Yesterday's 00Z GFS/ECMWF provided a significant
continuity change with their slow/amplified depiction of this
second shortwave but since then they have generally trended
somewhat faster to eject it due to another system approaching
western North America around the start of next week (which
actually has decent clustering for a days 6-7 forecast).  The new
00Z GFS did nudge its second shortwave a bit slower but otherwise
faster model trends since 24 hours ago and modestly slower means
yield decent relative agreement in the big-picture sense.  The 12Z
UKMET began to compare less favorably to other guidance toward the
end of its run and now the 00Z run is even more at odds with
consensus from the Pacific into western North America by Saturday.

The forecast over the western Gulf during the latter half of the
period is fairly close to yesterday's solution coordinated with
the National Hurricane Center aside from the latest consensus
exhibiting a slightly faster trend.  This trend was incorporated
about halfway compared to the previous issuance.

Preferences followed an operational model blend early and then
transitioned to a model/mean mix including the 18Z GFS/GEFS mean
and 12Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean/CMC.  This led to reasonable continuity
in principle while reflecting some adjustments as reflected in the
majority of latest guidance and downplaying details that have the
lowest confidence.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A large majority of guidance still highlights the Upper Midwest
and vicinity for heavy rain potential from late this week into the
weekend, with multiple episodes of rain/storms and possible
training that could produce significant rainfall totals.  The
first focus for activity will be a stalled Plains/Mid Mississippi
Valley front lifting northeast as a warm front.  Then a trailing
cold front may exhibit some waviness and be slow to move for a
while depending on shortwave details aloft.  Rainfall should
become somewhat lighter and less focused by around Sunday or
Monday.  Parts of this region have been dry recently so some of
the rain may initially be beneficial.  However the multi-day
totals that some guidance is showing would likely become
problematic over some areas.  Central and southern parts of the
East should see areas of diurnally-favored convection within a
humid and warm to hot airmass.  A front settling into the
Mid-Atlantic during Friday-Sunday may provide some added focus for
rainfall, while upper level impulses could enhance convection over
parts of the South and/or southern Mid-Atlantic.  Expect rainfall
to increase along the western half of the Gulf Coast Sunday-Monday
as possible tropical development reaches the southwestern Gulf of
Mexico.  Daily convection over the southern Rockies and Arizona
may gradually increase in coverage and intensity over the course
of the period.

As of Thursday an axis of warmest temperature anomalies will
extend from the central Plains through the Northeast with highs up
to 10F or so above normal and somewhat more coverage of morning
lows 10-15F above normal.  Thereafter the Plains portion of this
area will gradually erode while the Northeast will trend cooler
with a Friday frontal passage, leaving the Midwest into the Great
Lakes/central Appalachians as the most persistently warm area into
the weekend.  The best potential for record warm lows (even away
from the highest anomalies) will be Thursday-Friday but there may
be some continuing through the weekend.  Meanwhile highs of 5-10F
or so above normal should migrate from the Southwest into
California and western Oregon.  Temperature forecasts here have
become uncertain due to guidance indecision over whether an
east-west upper ridge could extend across the region versus the
southern periphery of a Northwest trough having greater influence.
 The northern Rockies/Plains will be rather cool during the period
with some locations seeing highs 10-15F below normal for one or
more days between Thursday and Sunday.  Readings should moderate
some by Monday.

...Tropical Depression Henri to linger across New England today
and continue producing heavy rain that could result in numerous
flash flood events...

...Dangerous heat forecast across the Lower Mississippi Valley,
with hot and humid weather expanding across much of the central
and eastern United States as well...

...Scattered showers and a few severe thunderstorms possible
across the northern and central Plains into the Midwest over the
next couple of days...

After making landfall along the coast of Rhode Island yesterday,
the center of Tropical Depression Henri has now pushed inland over
the Northeast and continues to produce instances of moderate to
heavy rainfall. Henri is expected to continue weakening today,
while very slowly drifting back toward the east over southern New
England. The main hazard associated with Henri today will be the
threat of flash, urban, and river flooding. Additional rainfall
amounts of 1 to 3 inches may fall over regions that have already
seen several inches of rain in the last 24 hours, leading to added
flooding concerns. WPC has issued a Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of
excessive rainfall between southeast New York and Rhode Island,
including Long Island. Flash Flood Watches are also in effect.
Henri and all associated hazards are expected to exit the region
on Tuesday.

High heat and humidity are expected to swelter much of the central
and eastern U.S. through midweek as a large and relatively strong
ridge of high pressure is anticipated to build across the
south-central section of the country. As a result, dangerously hot
weather is possible over the Lower Mississippi Valley. Excessive
Heat Warnings have been issued for the ArkLaMiss region, where
heat indices could approach the 110-115F range. Heat Advisories
extend into eastern Oklahoma and Kansas, as well as the Middle
Mississippi Valley. Above average temperatures are forecast nearly
everywhere east of the Rockies (outside North Dakota and the
northern High Plains) as highs reach into the upper-80s and 90s
for most locations early this week. Only a few daily high
temperatures records are at risk of breaking, but numerous warm
minimum temperature records could fall thanks to high humidity
keeping overnight temperatures very warm. These warm nighttime
temperatures can be particularly dangerous for those without
access to proper air conditioning.

Otherwise, an area of low pressure and associated frontal
boundaries are forecast to swing across the Northern Plains and
Upper Great Lakes between today and Wednesday morning. Scattered
showers and a few severe thunderstorms are possible throughout the
northern/central Plains and Midwest, with much of the activity on
Tuesday located over the Upper Midwest. Farther west, Red Flag
Warnings and Fire Weather Watches extend from northwest Colorado
across much of Wyoming and into western South Dakota due to the
combination of gusty winds and low relative humidity.

...Arctic air lingers over the Plains and the Midwest...

...Significant late week upslope/mountain snow possible in the
northern and central Rockies...

...A couple of winter weather events possible for the Mid-Atlantic
to Northeast late week and weekend...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment with
Weather Highlights...

A large portion of the northern and central U.S. will remain under
the grip of an arctic air mass through much of the medium-range
period.  Global models continue to indicate that a polar vortex
centered in the Canadian prairies will remain the dominant
synoptic system.  The ECMWF and to some degree the CMC, agree that
the vortex will begin to weaken and slide eastward across the
Great Lakes by this weekend.  On the other hand, the GFS tends to
grab the upper-level energy coming across the Pacific Northwest
and pull it around the south side of the polar vortex, resulting
in frontal wave development in the eastern U.S. during the
weekend.  The ECMWF/CMC solution is preferred given better
ensemble mean support as well as better agreement with WPC
continuity.  This setup favors a continuation of frigid conditions
over the northern Plains and upper Midwest as a couple of wintry
weather events are possible late this week and later in the
weekend from the Mid-Atlantic to Northeast.  The specifics are far
from certain at this point.

Over the northern and central Rockies into the Intermountain
region, models continue to signal for increasing amounts of
upslope/mountain snow under a tight pressure gradient behind the
arctic front late this week into the weekend.  Meanwhile, three
Pacific systems are forecast to move into the West Coast during
the medium range, bringing periods of mountain snows and coastal
rains across the Pacific Northwest and down into northern
California with reasonable model spread.

Along a wavy/stationary boundary in the Gulf, models are in good
agreement for a period of enhanced rainfall to overspread the Gulf
Coast States with likely inland focuses for the interior
Southeast.  By the weekend into early next week, there is decent
model consensus for an upper-level shortwave to dip across the
Southwest and then move out into the southern Plains to bring a
swath of wintry weather across the southern Rockies and the
south-central U.S.

Temperature wise, the frigid air will continue over the Northern
Plains, Northern Rockies, and Upper Midwest for much of the period
where anomalies of 30-45F are forecast across the middle of the
country. This is expected to slowly overspread, but moderate
somewhat, across much of the country by the end of the forecast
period.  Best chance for record low temperatures will be up and
down the Mississippi Valley as well as the central and southern
Plains on Sunday.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 18Z GFS/GEFS, together with a
smaller contribution from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean and the 01Z NBM.
Mostly ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7 given the
increasing model uncertainties.

...Bitter arctic air to remain entrenched across the north-central
U.S. for the upcoming week while slowing expanding southward...

...Light to moderate snow likely across the Northeast and New
England today...

...Significant ice storm possible Wednesday into Thursday from the
Mid Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley...

A cold and active weather pattern is expected to persist
throughout the next several days across the country, with only a
few lucky locations across the Southeast and Southwest remaining
warm and dry. Setting the stage for another frigid February day is
a brutally cold arctic high pressure system located across the
north-central United States. Wind Chills as low as -40 to -50
degrees can be found across far northern portions of the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest. High temperatures will struggle to make
it above zero from Montana to Minnesota through the next few days,
with lows in the negative teens and negative twenties. Due to the
dangerous combination of very cold temperatures and light wind,
Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories stretch across 12 different
states from the Northern/Central Plains to the Midwest.
Temperatures well below average also reach southward to the
Southern Plains and eastward to the Upper Ohio Valley. By Thursday
this cold airmass is expected to ooze south across more of the
south-central U.S., as well as the Pacific Northwest.

With cold air in place, two separate waves of wintry precipiation
are set to impact areas from the Southern Plains to New England
through Thursday. Starting with today, an area of low pressure is
forecast to develop over the Ohio Valley this morning and move
toward the New England coastline by tonight. Light-to-moderate
snow will be found to the north of the low and affect regions
across the Interior Northeast and New England. Upwards of 3 to 6
inches of snow could be found here and lead to isolated travel
disruptions. Winter Weather Advisories and Winter Storm Warnings
have been issued. Meanwhile, along an associated stationary front,
light freezing rain may cause slippery conditions from central
Oklahoma to western Kentucky today.

By Wednesday, precipitation is expected to break out to the north
of the same frontal boundary and possibly produce more noteworthy
freezing rain issues. Shallow cold air at the surface being pumped
in from the arctic airmass over the north-central U.S. will help
set the stage for a potentially significant ice storm from the
Southern Plains to the Mid-Mississippi and Ohio valleys. Freezing
rain should develop early Wednesday across northern Arkansas and
quickly spread east-northeast to the Ohio Valley by Wednesday
afternoon. Widespread ice accretion greater than one tenth of an
inch will be found across the region by Thursday morning, with
over a quarter inch possible in northeast Arkansas. By later in
the day Thursday, local amounts exceeding a half inch of freezing
rain will be possible between northern Arkansas and western West
Virginia. Power outages and scattered tree damage is likely.
Slightly to the north, areas of light snow will be found across
the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic throughout Wednesday and
Thursday. Heavier snowfall amounts will be possible across
sections of Maryland and northern Virginia starting Wednesday
night, which may lead to hazardous travel conditions.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Mar 18 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR APRIL 2021

The April 2021 monthly temperature and precipitation outlooks are based
primarily on dynamical model forecast guidance in the context of persistent La
Nina conditions that are expected to transition to ENSO neutral conditions
later in spring. However, La Nina conditions are expected to persist into
April
and play a role in climate conditions over the forecast domain. In addition,
some areas of the forecast domain consider current land surface soil moisture
and nearby ocean surface temperatures.



The MJO was considered but played a lesser role in the outlook, as there is
substantial uncertainty whether the MJO signal currently over Africa will
persist and propagate eastward during April and lead to significant
subtropical
impacts. This uncertainty is due in part to expected interaction of any
eastward propagating MJO convective signal with suppressed convection over the
west-central equatorial Pacific, related to La Nina. Also, statistically
significant impacts on higher latitudes from the MJO are smaller in spring,
compared to winter months.



The April 2021 temperature outlook favors above-normal monthly mean
temperatures for nearly all of the CONUS, with the exception of the Pacific
Northwest, eastward into parts of the northern Intermountain West, and
southward along much of the immediate coastline of California. This outlook is
supported largely by dynamical model forecast guidance, from the models of the
NMME and IMME, which are in very good agreement over much of the CONUS.
Decadal
temperature trends contribute to higher probabilities for above-normal
temperatures across the southern tier of the CONUS and into the Northeast
region. A soil moisture deficit across much of the western CONUS may
contribute
to increased probabilities of above-normal temperatures in some regions of the
West, particularly the Southwest, where model guidance leads to probabilities
exceeding 60 percent in some areas of southeastern New Mexico and western
Texas. A much larger area of probabilities for above-normal temperatures
exceeding 50 percent over the West is supported by the consensus forecast of
the NMME. Typical temperatures observed during April under La Nina conditions
were considered, and support increased chances of below-normal temperatures
over parts of the Pacific Northwest. Dynamical model guidance, as well as
persistent impacts of La Nina, favor increased probabilities for below-normal
temperatures across southern Mainland Alaska into the Alaska Panhandle, while
decadal temperature trends are the primary forcing leading to likely
above-normal temperatures across northwestern coastal areas of Mainland Alaska
and the North Slope.



For precipitation, consistent dynamical model forecast guidance from models of
the NMME and typical La Nina impacts in spring favor below-normal
precipitation
stretching from California and southern Oregon eastward across the Central and
Southern Rockies into the Central and Southern Plains, the Lower Mississippi
Valley, and much of the Southeast region. Increased precipitation variability
and decreased predictability in dynamical model forecasts leads to a lower
probability for below-normal precipitation for some areas of the Southern
Plains. Equal Chances (EC) of above, near and below-normal precipitation are
indicated for remaining areas of the CONUS, including drier areas of the
Southwest. Inconsistency between the typical above-normal precipitation signal
due to La Nina and dynamical model forecasts of below-normal precipitation for
parts of the eastern Central Plains leads to a forecast of EC for this area in
the April outlook.



The consensus of dynamical model forecast guidance favors above-normal monthly
total precipitation amounts for parts of the southern Alaska Panhandle,
supported by typical impacts of La Nina conditions. La Nina conditions support
above-normal precipitation for western Mainland Alaska, as does the consensus
of dynamical model guidance. EC is forecast for remaining areas of Alaska,
where climate signals are weak and dynamical model forecasts are inconsistent.

FORECASTER: Dan Collins

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1981 and 2010, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

An updated monthly outlook... for Apr will be issued on Wed March 31 2021

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1981-2010 base period.

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Mar 18 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

La Nina conditions remain in place across the equatorial Pacific Ocean as
indicated by both oceanic and atmospheric conditions. A transition to
ENSO-neutral is favored during the late spring until autumn when La Nina once
again becomes slightly more favored than ENSO-neutral at that time. In
addition
to the forecast ENSO evolution described above, current anomalous soil
moisture
and snow cover along with numerical and statistical model output inform the
seasonal temperature and precipitation outlooks.



The April-May-June (AMJ) 2021 temperature outlook favors above-normal seasonal
mean temperatures for nearly all the contiguous U.S. and for portions of
western and northern Alaska. Below-normal temperatures are most likely for a
region from southeast Alaska to the extreme Pacific Northwest. Moreover,
above-normal temperatures are most likely for the entire forecast domain as we
move into and through the summer months.



The AMJ 2021 precipitation outlook favors above-normal seasonal total
precipitation amounts for portions of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,
mid-Atlantic and Northeast as well as the west coast of Alaska. Below-normal
precipitation is most likely for a region from the West coast across the
Rockies to the southern Great Plains. The highlighted area of below-normal
precipitation is forecast to slowly shift north and east during the summer
months while above-normal precipitation is favored to expand southward along
the eastern seaboard over the same period. Elevated odds for above-normal
precipitation is introduced for parts of the Southwest during the monsoon
season.



Equal chances (EC) are indicated for areas where seasonal mean temperatures
and
seasonal total precipitation amounts are expected to be similar to
climatological probabilities.

BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS
Note:  For Graphical Displays of the Forecast Tools Discussed Below See:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/90day/tools/briefing__;!!DZ3fjg!oOholVGCp0vx0xyLdR_qdJKLR7D2GLnM45CZQZUj_TxOuiiYhGHpDBiTbkb4nHZ7GXqMJqPM$

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

La Nina conditions remain present in the equatorial Pacific Ocean as shown
with
both oceanic and atmospheric indicators. Equatorial sea surface temperatures
(SSTs), however, have continued to become less negative with some spotty areas
of small positive SST departures from climatology. The most recent weekly
value
of the Nino3.4 SST index is -0.3 degrees C. It is important to note, however,
that the trend in less negative SSTs is likely being modulated by a recent and
ongoing MJO event which has resulted in variations in low-level winds,
cloudiness, solar radiation and precipitation. Below the surface, a shallow
layer (to a depth of 100 meters) of negative ocean temperature anomalies is in
place from 165 E to 100 W. A substantial area of positive subsurface oceanic
heat content is located in the west-central Pacific Ocean ranging over a depth
from 100 - 300 meters.



Suppressed convection persists across the equatorial Pacific surrounding the
Date Line, while enhanced convection continues across much of Indonesia and
the
Philippines. Even with a recent reduction in the Trade winds associated with
the MJO, the recent monthly average of 850-hPa winds continue to show enhanced
trade winds compared to climatology. Cyclonic circulations at 200-hPa
symmetric
about the equator to first order also are evident in the recent monthly mean.
The assessment of these ocean and atmospheric indicators show the coupled
ocean-atmospheric system remains consistent with La Nina conditions.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

Forecasts of the Nino3.4 SST index from the NMME show considerable spread of
ensemble members across the modeling center forecasts and within each modeling
center ensemble. Most guidance continues to favor a continued decrease of
negative SST anomalies to ENSO-neutral territory during spring 2021. Some
variation begins during the summer months with some guidance favoring once
again a decrease in Nino3.4 SST hinting at a potential return to La Nina
conditions by autumn 2021. Some statistical components of the CPC Nino3.4 SST
consolidated forecast favor a different trajectory - toward ENSO-neutral or El
Nino territory by late spring 2021 for the CA and CCA forecasts respectively.

PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Although equatorial Pacific SSTs continue to become less negative and are
forecast to continue doing so through spring 2021, potential typical La Nina
impacts are considered in preparing the AMJ and MJJ 2021 seasonal outlooks.
ENSO composites, regressions anchored to Nino3.4 SST and forecast tools
"bridged" utilizing Nino3.4 SST are used to inform the outlook in these
seasons.



Current anomalous soil moisture and snow cover are considered and contributed
to the outlook in some locations during some seasons. Dynamical model
forecasts
from the NMME and Copernicus (C3S) multi-model ensemble systems and the CA
based on soil moisture anomalies are utilized heavily as was the objective,
historical skill weighted consolidation - guidance that objectively combines
both dynamical and statistical forecast tools. Due to a number of back-to-back
La Nina events in the historical record since the 1950s, a re-emergence of La
Nina by the autumn is considered. At later leads, long term trends in
temperature and precipitation are utilized heavily to inform the seasonal
outlooks.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - AMJ 2021 TO AMJ 2022

TEMPERATURE

The AMJ 2021 temperature outlook favors above-normal seasonal mean
temperatures
for nearly all the contiguous U.S. and for portions of western and northern
Alaska. The greatest odds for above-normal temperatures is located from the
Four Corners region in the Southwest to southern Texas due to the confluence
of
factors including overwhelmingly consistent dynamical model guidance, low soil
moisture conditions, long-term positive temperature trends and other
statistical forecast tools. Modestly elevated odds for above-normal
temperatures extend eastward across the Southeast as well - supported by model
guidance and strong trends. More uncertainty and disagreement in forecast
tools
and lower historical forecast skill in forecast guidance decrease
probabilities
for above-normal temperatures in the north central CONUS. Consistent with
lingering La Nina influence as indicated by ENSO composites, regressions and
"bridging" tools there are elevated chances for below-normal temperatures from
the extreme Pacific northwest to the south coast of Alaska. Negative trends in
sea ice coverage and thickness and positive SST trends favor above-normal
temperatures for parts of the west coast of Alaska and the north Slope.



Consistent signatures across the range of model guidance and statistical
forecast tools including those derived from land surface conditions favor
continued elevated odds for above-normal temperatures for most of the forecast
domain through the SON 2021 season with the greatest chances depicted for the
western U.S. and along the eastern seaboard with slightly lower odds for the
north central CONUS.



Thereafter, beginning in OND 2021 and continuing through FMA 2022, there is a
gradual increase in the EC designation as odds for La Nina re-development and
so potential impacts increase for much of the northern tier of the CONUS from
the Pacific Northwest to the western Great Lakes, and later southeast Alaska.
The inclusion of areas of favored below-normal temperatures may need to be
considered in these areas over the next couple of seasonal outlook release
packages if odds of La Nina increase, but also, and perhaps just as important,
if odds for El Nino remain very low during the late autumn and early winter
2021 as they are now.

PRECIPITATION

The AMJ 2021 precipitation outlook favors above-normal seasonal total
precipitation amounts for portions of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,
mid-Atlantic and Northeast primarily based on lingering La Nina influence,
positive precipitation trends, other statistical forecast tools and to a
lesser
degree some model forecasts from the NMME and C3S ensemble systems. There is
considerably stronger agreement, however, for a region of favored below-normal
precipitation from the central West coast across the Rockies to the southern
Plains. La Nina considerations, dynamical model guidance and the CAS forecast
tool support this forecast.



The highlighted area of below-normal precipitation is forecast to slowly shift
north and east during the summer months - consistent with dynamical model
guidance. Above-normal precipitation is favored to expand southward along the
eastern seaboard through the summer months into the early autumn consistent
with positive precipitation trends and a slight tilt favoring La Nina during
the second half of the Atlantic hurricane season.



Below-normal soil moisture and snowpack in the Southwest and southern Rockies
may allow for more efficient heating of the land mass and so potentially an
enhanced monsoon circulation earlier all factors being equal. Along these
lines, elevated odds for above-normal precipitation is favored for parts of
the
southwest from JJA through ASO 2021. Some dynamical model guidance also
support
this forecast.



La Nina conditions (first 2 leads) and dynamical model guidance support
above-normal precipitation for the west coast of Alaska from AMJ - ASO 2021.
The outlooks from OND 2021 through AMJ 2022 are primarily supported and based
on long term precipitation trends.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Thu Mar 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-low will move to the southeast through the day across the
Ohio River Valley while mid-level ridging develops across the
central and western US. At the surface, a cold front will move east
of the Appalachians with numerous showers and thunderstorms expected
across the East Coast. Widespread fire weather conditions are not
expected, but locally elevated conditions are possible across
eastern Florida.

...Eastern Florida...
Ahead of the approaching cold front, gusty southwesterly winds of
10-15 mph are expected. With warm surface temperatures and RH near
40%, locally elevated to critical conditions will be possible given
receptive fuels. The lack of drier surface conditions owing to
precipitation potential later in the day will limit the risk of
greater fire weather conditions.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 18 2021

SYNOPSIS: A surface cyclone is forecast to cross the Plains toward the Great
Lakes early in the forecast period. Fairly quiet conditions are anticipated
behind this system, tied to mid-level high pressure forecast off the West
Coast. This setup favors a storm track and any heavy precipitation chances
being shifted northward into Canada, while the overall circulation is not
favorable for temperature hazards during Spring. The mid-level high pressure
over the Pacific may build northward into southern Alaska during Week-2,
helping to shift the storm track there to be predominantly out of the Bering
Sea.

HAZARDS

No hazards are depicted in today's outlook as odds are not anticipated to
reach
pre-defined criteria during the forecast period at this time.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MARCH 21 - THURSDAY MARCH 25:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!su84_q76-2pXx5TOUoh_umvKmI4upW_WRSyExg3GPN-xCLudeoZjG3lxZx0hTDHuvoNrRchY$

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 26 - THURSDAY APRIL 01: Model guidance shows lee cyclogenesis
occurring near the outset of the forecast period over the High Plains. The
ECMWF is further north with the initiation of the low and features a
progressive track that puts the low over the Great Lakes by the 27th. The GFS
initiates the low further south over the Central High Plains with a track
toward the Great Lakes, although roughly 24 hrs slower than the ECWMF
forecast.
Neither solution appears particularly concerning from a hazards perspective,
with limited deepening of the surface low to drive any high winds and the
northern track being displaced well away from any Gulf moisture.



Upstream of this system, anomalous ridging continues to loom over the
northeastern Pacific. This feature is likely to displace the primary storm
track northward toward Canada, and keep the CONUS on the dry side throughout
Week-2 with surface high pressure parked off the West Coast. The ECMWF
continues to show some downslope wind signals across Northern and Central
California during Week-2 tied to east-northeasterly flow to the east of the
surface low. The GEFS has backed off this outcome today, instead featuring
more
northerly flow that is manifest in cooler temperatures being forecast across
California and the absence of any localized warming immediately adjacent to
the
higher terrain of the region. Given these discrepancies, confidence remains
insufficient to introduce any high wind hazard for increased fire weather
concerns. No temperature hazards are anticipated nationwide given the
lackluster forecast 500-hPa height departures coupled with the gradual warming
of climatological temperatures during the transition season.



Models continue to trend toward a more amplified ridge over the northeastern
Pacific, helping to likely moderate temperatures across Alaska during Week-2.
As heights rise over the Gulf of Alaska this is likely to shift the primary
storm track to be predominantly out of the Bering Sea and into mainland
Alaska.
Despite this wet pattern, nothing approaching hazardous criteria appears
obvious in model guidance. Nevertheless, the increased snow-water building up
across mainland Alaska throughout Week-2 could have implications for worsening
the eventual break up of river ice during April.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
256 PM EDT Thu Mar 18 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 21 2021 - 12Z Thu Mar 25 2021

...Overview...

The weather pattern will become more active once again as a large
scale mean trough becomes established over the Plains/west-central
U.S. over the course of next week.  Ahead of this trough, portions
of the Plains and Mississippi Valley (and possibly a little
eastward) should see increasing potential for significant rainfall
while Pacific features dropping into the mean trough will bring
episodes of rain and mountain snow from the Northwest into the
Rockies.  Meanwhile an upper trough and possible embedded low will
support a western Atlantic system, with continued uncertainty for
its exact track and how much precipitation it may bring to areas
along the East Coast.  Guidance is still fairly agreeable with the
evolving pattern but there are significant differences at least on
a regional scale.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The system off the East Coast continues to be troublesome in terms
of model spread, with predictability on the mid-lower side of the
spectrum as the upper support essentially becomes embedded within
a developing large-scale ridge.  The one point of relative
agreement is that the system should drift closer to the East Coast
than depicted in recent GFS runs, favoring a compromise among the
still diverse array of other solutions.  The 12Z UKMET provides a
new northern extreme with a track just off Cape Cod by early
Wednesday while remaining consensus keeps it closer to 35N
latitude or so by that time.

Models/ensembles continue to show initial western U.S. trough
energy separating with what remains over the CONUS consolidating
into a vigorous shortwave that ejects through the Rockies and
northern Plains/Upper Midwest Monday-Wednesday.  However there are
noticeable disagreements for timing and strength.  Overall a
guidance average provides good continuity for resolving these
differences.  GFS runs have been particularly deep with the upper
level and surface reflections of this system compared to most
other guidance but the general strength/shape of the upper feature
also favor being stronger than the weak side of the envelope for
the surface low.

The combination of the GFS depth of this system and the model's
more open/progressive depiction of upstream energy dropping into
the West early-mid week (a change from yesterday's continuity)
ultimately lead to faster progression of height falls on the
leading side of the mean trough aloft.  Remaining guidance,
including the latest parallel GFS runs, offer continued support
for an upper low near or a little south or southwest of the Four
Corners as of early Wednesday, possibly opening up into a High
Plains trough by early Thursday.

The next Pacific feature forecast to start reinforcing the mean
trough by days 6-7 Wednesday-Thursday compares quite well in the
guidance relative to typical spread for that time frame.

The combination of above considerations led to starting with an
operational 00Z/06Z model blend with somewhat less GFS input than
average for the first half of the period, followed by a transition
to a model/mean blend that placed about two-thirds emphasis on the
CMC/ECMWF/ECMWF mean relative to the GFS and GEFS mean.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The developing mean trough aloft with periodic reinforcement will
tend to favor below normal temperatures over much of the West into
the Rockies.  Best potential for one or more days of highs 10-15F
or so below normal will be over the eastern Great Basin and
central/southern Rockies.  The reinforcing shortwaves will bring
multiple episodes of rain and mountain snow to areas from the
Pacific Northwest eastward/southeastward through the West into the
Rockies.  Most of this activity should be of light to moderate
intensity but some localized heavier areas will be possible.

Consolidating upper dynamics ejecting from the West should promote
a central Plains through Upper Midwest system early-mid week.
This system may produce a focused area of enhanced snowfall over
or near the Colorado Rockies with some snow possibly extending
into the central High Plains and then northeastward on the cold
side of the surface low track.  Farther south, improving Gulf
inflow ahead of the trailing cold front should promote areas of
heavy rainfall from the central Plains/Midwest into the Lower
Mississippi Valley with lighter rainfall extending northeastward.
The system could produce brisk winds depending on its exact
strength.  The next shortwave digging into the West by midweek
should hold the frontal boundary over the southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley for a time, with continued flow of moisture
from the Gulf promoting a threat of heavy rainfall over the Lower
Mississippi Valley and vicinity into Thursday.  Areas along the
East Coast may see a period of rainfall and strong winds with the
western Atlantic system.  However confidence is low for magnitude
and duration given current guidance spread, as possibilities for
some locations range between dry conditions and fairly heavy
rainfall.

Expect the warmest temperature anomalies to progress eastward from
a northern Plains/Upper Midwest through southern High Plains
orientation Sunday, reaching the eastern states by mid-late week.
The northern third of the central/eastern U.S. will be most likely
to see highs of 10-20F above normal on one or more days.
Anomalies for morning lows should be somewhat higher with broader
southward coverage of readings 10F or more above normal, along
with some northern locations seeing some plus 20-25F anomalies.
Sunday lows over parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota could be near
daily record warm values if they hold for the calendar day.  The
upper trough initially along the East Coast will support a cool
Sunday over the extreme Southeast.

through the period as an upper trough intensifies along the coast of
southern California. To the east, a cold front will move offshore
with a departing upper-level trough bringing cooler and wetter
conditions to much of the South and Mid Atlantic. Weak winds and
cooler temperatures across much of the country suggest widespread
elevated/critical fire weather conditions are not expected across
the CONUS through the period.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu March 18 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 24 - 28 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa flow
pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day
period. Dynamical models forecast a 500-hPa trough over the Bering Sea with
associated below normal heights extending across northern Alaska. A separate
trough or closed upper low  is forecast in the southern stream north of Hawaii
and amplified ridging is predicted farther to the east over the Northern
Pacific. Downstream, a trough is forecast over the central CONUS and a ridge
is
favored over the eastern CONUS. The manual height blend depicts negative
height
anomalies over the central CONUS, and northern Mainland Alaska. Positive
height
anomalies are forecast over the eastern and western CONUS, and the remainder
of
Alaska.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across Northern
California associated with above normal heights. Troughing predicted over the
central CONUS favors below normal temperatures across the Rockies to the Great
Plains. Above normal temperatures are favored for the eastern one third of the
CONUS underneath predicted above normal heights. Forecast rising heights over
southern Alaska during the 6-10 day period increase the odds of near and above
normal temperatures, with probabilities of below normal temperatures
diminishing over most of the state compared to yesterdays forecast.

Strong westerly mid-level flow continues to favor above normal precipitation
for Alaska.
Enhanced ridging over the Northern Pacific is expected to suppress Pacific
flow
across the western CONUS, leading to elevated chances of below normal
precipitation. Farther to east, increased odds of above normal precipitation
are indicated  across parts of the Rockies and Southern Plains, underneath the
predicted mean trough. Above normal precipitation is also favored ahead of
this
trough across the eastern CONUS. Exceptions are for parts of the Northern and
Central Plains and the extreme southern Florida Peninsula, where below normal
precipitation is favored, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset by increasing uncertainty in
regards to the temperature forecast over the CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 26 - APR 01, 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is forecast to shift
eastward and deamplify compared to the 6-10 day period. A 500-hPa trough is
forecast across the central CONUS with associated below normal heights
predicted for the northern central CONUS. Above normal heights are forecast
over much of the Southern Plains, Southeast, and Eastern Seaboard due to an
eastward progressing ridge. Upstream, ridging is forecast near the Pacific
Northwest with associated above normal heights.  Across Alaska, the ensemble
means depict above normal heights with a low amplitude 500-hPa flow across
southern Alaska, while near to  below normal heights are likely over northern
Alaska.

Forecast ridging leads to increased chances of near to above normal
temperatures across Alaska, except parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska and
the Alaska Panhandle. Troughing favors below normal temperatures across the
northern Rockies to the Southern Plains. Near to above normal temperatures are
more likely for the remainder of the CONUS due to mean ridges over the
Northern
Pacific and the eastern CONUS.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across much of Alaska
due to predicted enhanced westerly mid-level flow. Suppressed Pacific flow
across the western CONUS elevates chances of below normal precipitation.
Downstream of an amplified 500-hPa trough, above normal precipitation is
slightly favored for much of the eastern CONUS.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern offset by
increasing
uncertainty in regards to the temperature forecast over the CONUS and Alaska.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

...Severe weather threat remains this evening across the
Southeast, southern Mid-Atlantic, and eastern Ohio Valley...

...Moderate rain across the northern Mid-Atlantic and southern New
England switches to light snow showers by Friday morning...

...Unsettled weather enters the West...

A dynamic low pressure system that brought widespread severe
weather yesterday across the Deep South continues to track
eastward throughout the eastern U.S. this afternoon. The threat of
severe weather is currently located from northern Florida to the
eastern Ohio Valley. This includes much of the lower Mid-Atlantic
as well. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk
of severe thunderstorms across the eastern Carolinas. Damaging
wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes are all possible.
Farther north, isolated severe storms could also impact portions
of the eastern Ohio Valley through this evening.  The center of
the low pressure system will continue to track relatively quickly
through the Mid-Atlantic region tonight. A swath of moderate rain
is forecast to continue from the Ohio Valley toward southern New
England. Meanwhile, a cold high pressure system located in
southern Ontario, Canada will build across the Great Lakes on
Friday. As the cold air filters in from the north, rain is
forecast to change over to light snow late tonight across southern
New England with increasingly blustery northerly winds. Parts of
the Mid-Atlantic could see rain changing to a period of light snow
Friday morning as well, but little to no impacts are expected. The
entire system, and most of its impacts, should exit into the
Atlantic by Friday afternoon. However, gusty winds will remain
along the Southeast coastline through Saturday.

Meanwhile, moisture ahead of the next low pressure system has
entered the West Coast this afternoon. More unsettled weather will
impact the western U.S. for the next couple of days as relatively
modest amounts of snow falls across the Cascades and the Sierra
Nevada. Winter Weather Advisories and Winter Storm Warnings have
been issued across the northern/central Sierra Nevada, where over
a foot of snow is possible. As the frontal system gradually pushes
east, a mix of rain and snow will be found across the Great Basin
and northern Rockies as we head into the weekend.

Temperatures will cool to below average across the eastern half of
the country over the next few days as the aforementioned cold
front swings south. Meanwhile, the Northern/Central Plains and
Midwest will experience a gradual warm-up heading into the weekend
as a warm front lifts through the region.

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 21 2021 - 12Z Thu Mar 25 2021

...Overview...

The weather pattern will become more active once again as a large
scale mean trough becomes established over the Plains/west-central
U.S. over the course of next week.  Ahead of this trough, portions
of the Plains and Mississippi Valley (and possibly a little
eastward) should see increasing potential for significant rainfall
while Pacific features dropping into the mean trough will bring
episodes of rain and mountain snow from the Northwest into the
Rockies.  Meanwhile an upper trough and possible embedded low will
support a western Atlantic system, with continued uncertainty for
its exact track and how much precipitation it may bring to areas
along the East Coast.  Guidance is still fairly agreeable with the
evolving pattern but there are significant differences at least on
a regional scale.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The system off the East Coast continues to be troublesome in terms
of model spread, with predictability on the mid-lower side of the
spectrum as the upper support essentially becomes embedded within
a developing large-scale ridge.  The one point of relative
agreement is that the system should drift closer to the East Coast
than depicted in recent GFS runs, favoring a compromise among the
still diverse array of other solutions.  The 12Z UKMET provides a
new northern extreme with a track just off Cape Cod by early
Wednesday while remaining consensus keeps it closer to 35N
latitude or so by that time.

Models/ensembles continue to show initial western U.S. trough
energy separating with what remains over the CONUS consolidating
into a vigorous shortwave that ejects through the Rockies and
northern Plains/Upper Midwest Monday-Wednesday.  However there are
noticeable disagreements for timing and strength.  Overall a
guidance average provides good continuity for resolving these
differences.  GFS runs have been particularly deep with the upper
level and surface reflections of this system compared to most
other guidance but the general strength/shape of the upper feature
also favor being stronger than the weak side of the envelope for
the surface low.

The combination of the GFS depth of this system and the model's
more open/progressive depiction of upstream energy dropping into
the West early-mid week (a change from yesterday's continuity)
ultimately lead to faster progression of height falls on the
leading side of the mean trough aloft.  Remaining guidance,
including the latest parallel GFS runs, offer continued support
for an upper low near or a little south or southwest of the Four
Corners as of early Wednesday, possibly opening up into a High
Plains trough by early Thursday.

The next Pacific feature forecast to start reinforcing the mean
trough by days 6-7 Wednesday-Thursday compares quite well in the
guidance relative to typical spread for that time frame.

The combination of above considerations led to starting with an
operational 00Z/06Z model blend with somewhat less GFS input than
average for the first half of the period, followed by a transition
to a model/mean blend that placed about two-thirds emphasis on the
CMC/ECMWF/ECMWF mean relative to the GFS and GEFS mean.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The developing mean trough aloft with periodic reinforcement will
tend to favor below normal temperatures over much of the West into
the Rockies.  Best potential for one or more days of highs 10-15F
or so below normal will be over the eastern Great Basin and
central/southern Rockies.  The reinforcing shortwaves will bring
multiple episodes of rain and mountain snow to areas from the
Pacific Northwest eastward/southeastward through the West into the
Rockies.  Most of this activity should be of light to moderate
intensity but some localized heavier areas will be possible.

Consolidating upper dynamics ejecting from the West should promote
a central Plains through Upper Midwest system early-mid week.
This system may produce a focused area of enhanced snowfall over
or near the Colorado Rockies with some snow possibly extending
into the central High Plains and then northeastward on the cold
side of the surface low track.  Farther south, improving Gulf
inflow ahead of the trailing cold front should promote areas of
heavy rainfall from the central Plains/Midwest into the Lower
Mississippi Valley with lighter rainfall extending northeastward.
The system could produce brisk winds depending on its exact
strength.  The next shortwave digging into the West by midweek
should hold the frontal boundary over the southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley for a time, with continued flow of moisture
from the Gulf promoting a threat of heavy rainfall over the Lower
Mississippi Valley and vicinity into Thursday.  Areas along the
East Coast may see a period of rainfall and strong winds with the
western Atlantic system.  However confidence is low for magnitude
and duration given current guidance spread, as possibilities for
some locations range between dry conditions and fairly heavy
rainfall.

Expect the warmest temperature anomalies to progress eastward from
a northern Plains/Upper Midwest through southern High Plains
orientation Sunday, reaching the eastern states by mid-late week.
The northern third of the central/eastern U.S. will be most likely
to see highs of 10-20F above normal on one or more days.
Anomalies for morning lows should be somewhat higher with broader
southward coverage of readings 10F or more above normal, along
with some northern locations seeing some plus 20-25F anomalies.
Sunday lows over parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota could be near
daily record warm values if they hold for the calendar day.  The
upper trough initially along the East Coast will support a cool
Sunday over the extreme Southeast.

Corners as of early Wednesday, possibly opening up into a High
Plains trough by early Thursday.

The next Pacific feature forecast to start reinforcing the mean
trough by days 6-7 Wednesday-Thursday compares quite well in the
guidance relative to typical spread for that time frame.

The combination of above considerations led to starting with an
operational 00Z/06Z model blend with somewhat less GFS input than
average for the first half of the period, followed by a transition
to a model/mean blend that placed about two-thirds emphasis on the
CMC/ECMWF/ECMWF mean relative to the GFS and GEFS mean.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The developing mean trough aloft with periodic reinforcement will
tend to favor below normal temperatures over much of the West into
the Rockies.  Best potential for one or more days of highs 10-15F
or so below normal will be over the eastern Great Basin and
central/southern Rockies.  The reinforcing shortwaves will bring
multiple episodes of rain and mountain snow to areas from the
Pacific Northwest eastward/southeastward through the West into the
Rockies.  Most of this activity should be of light to moderate
intensity but some localized heavier areas will be possible.

Consolidating upper dynamics ejecting from the West should promote
a central Plains through Upper Midwest system early-mid week.
This system may produce a focused area of enhanced snowfall over
or near the Colorado Rockies with some snow possibly extending
into the central High Plains and then northeastward on the cold
side of the surface low track.  Farther south, improving Gulf
inflow ahead of the trailing cold front should promote areas of
heavy rainfall from the central Plains/Midwest into the Lower
Mississippi Valley with lighter rainfall extending northeastward.
The system could produce brisk winds depending on its exact
strength.  The next shortwave digging into the West by midweek
should hold the frontal boundary over the southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley for a time, with continued flow of moisture
from the Gulf promoting a threat of heavy rainfall over the Lower
Mississippi Valley and vicinity into Thursday.  Areas along the
East Coast may see a period of rainfall and strong winds with the
western Atlantic system.  However confidence is low for magnitude
and duration given current guidance spread, as possibilities for
some locations range between dry conditions and fairly heavy
rainfall.

Expect the warmest temperature anomalies to progress eastward from
a northern Plains/Upper Midwest through southern High Plains
orientation Sunday, reaching the eastern states by mid-late week.
The northern third of the central/eastern U.S. will be most likely
to see highs of 10-20F above normal on one or more days.
Anomalies for morning lows should be somewhat higher with broader
southward coverage of readings 10F or more above normal, along
with some northern locations seeing some plus 20-25F anomalies.
Sunday lows over parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota could be near
daily record warm values if they hold for the calendar day.  The
upper trough initially along the East Coast will support a cool
Sunday over the extreme Southeast.

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper ridging will develop between a couple of longer-wave
systems - one along the East Coast and another along the West Coast.
 Meanwhile at the surface, high pressure will dominate across much
of the CONUS, with relatively light surface winds expected
especially in dry areas of the Southwest.  A few locally elevated
fire-weather conditions are possible across northern Minnesota this
afternoon where 20-25% RH values will combined with a few areas of
15 mph surface winds. Larger-scale critical fire weather will remain
minimal today, however.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1154 PM CDT Thu Mar 18 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
Somewhat faster flow aloft will extend along an axis from the Desert
Southwest to the north-central U.S. on D2/Sat as a longwave trough
makes steady eastward progress into the Intermountain West.  This
wave will induce lee surface troughing along the High Plains, which
will act to increase surface flow in areas of New Mexico and
Colorado.  Most fire-weather concerns will be tied to the increase
in surface flow amid dry (and locally drought-stricken) areas.

...Portions of New Mexico and Colorado...
The aforementioned flow pattern will assist in spreading areas of
15-25 mph surface flow (with higher gusts) across much of the region
during peak heating hours.  The flow will occur within a continued
dry airmass, with near-critical RH values expected across the region
at times (around 12-20%).  At this time, an elevated delineation has
been drawn across much of New Mexico and portions of southeastern
Colorado.  Fuels in localized areas of Colorado will need to cure in
the wake of recent snowfall, which may temper the threat in
localized areas.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
238 AM EDT Fri Mar 19 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Mar 22 2021 - 12Z Fri Mar 26 2021

...Overview...

The weather pattern will become more active during the medium
range period as a large scale mean trough becomes established over
the Plains/west-central U.S. through much of next week.  Ahead of
this trough, portions of the Plains and Mississippi Valley (and
possibly a little eastward) should see increasing potential for
significant rainfall while Pacific features dropping into the mean
trough will bring episodes of rain and mountain snow from the
Northwest into the Rockies. Meanwhile, an upper trough and
possible embedded low will support a western Atlantic system, with
continued uncertainty for its exact track and how much
precipitation it may bring to areas along the East Coast. Guidance
is still fairly agreeable with the evolving pattern but there are
remaining differences in the details.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The system off the East Coast continues to be troublesome in terms
of model spread, with predictability on the mid-lower side of the
spectrum as the upper support essentially becomes embedded within
a developing large-scale ridge. The GFS continues to be the
fastest/farthest east model. The latest run of the UKMET still
shows a northern outlier solution, just off Cape Cod by early
Wednesday. The ECMWF/CMC are in a more middle ground position.

A vigorous short wave ejects out of the Rockies on Monday, lifting
into the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes by Wednesday while another
follows on its heels (maybe a bit farther south) Wednesday-Friday.
Both systems exhibit notable timing/intensity differences, with
the GFS consistently faster than the other models (GFSp is fast
too, but still slower than the operational GFS). A third system
enters the Pacific Northwest next Thursday, with a possible closed
low over the Southwest by Friday. However, there is significant
model spread with how deep this system gets by then, so confidence
is low.

For early period, WPC used a blend of the deterministic models
with more weighting towards the ECMWF. Due to increasing
uncertainty late in the week, the blend incorporated more of the
ensemble means (ECENS and NAEFS) Thursday-Friday. This overall
solution worked well across the board, and also fit with previous
shift continuity as well.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The developing mean trough aloft with periodic reinforcement will
tend to favor below normal temperatures over much of the West into
the Rockies, moderating somewhat by the end of the week. The
reinforcing shortwaves will bring multiple episodes of rain and
mountain snow to areas from the Pacific Northwest
eastward/southeastward through the West into the Rockies.  Most of
this activity should be of light to moderate intensity but some
localized heavier areas will be possible.

Consolidating upper dynamics ejecting from the West should promote
a central Plains through Upper Midwest system early-mid week. This
system may produce a focused area of enhanced snowfall over or
near the Colorado Rockies with some snow possibly extending into
the central High Plains and then northeastward on the cold side of
the surface low track. Farther south, improving Gulf inflow ahead
of the trailing cold front should promote areas of heavy rainfall
from the central Plains/Midwest into the Lower Mississippi Valley
with lighter rainfall extending northeastward.  The system could
produce brisk winds depending on its exact strength. The next
shortwave digging into the West by midweek should hold the frontal
boundary over the southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley for a
time, with continued flow of moisture from the Gulf promoting a
threat of heavy rainfall over the Lower Mississippi Valley and
vicinity into Thursday. Areas along the East Coast may see a
period of rainfall and strong winds with the western Atlantic
system. However confidence is low for magnitude and duration given
current guidance spread, as possibilities for some locations range
between dry conditions and fairly heavy rainfall.

Expect the warmest temperature anomalies to progress eastward from
the Northern Plains/Upper Midwest on Monday, reaching the eastern
states by mid-late week. The northern third of the central/eastern
U.S. will be most likely to see highs of 10-20F above normal on
one or more days. Anomalies for morning lows should be somewhat
higher with broader southward coverage of readings 10F or more
above normal, along with some northern locations seeing some plus
20-25F anomalies. Sunday lows over parts of the Dakotas and
Minnesota could be near daily record warm values if they hold for
the calendar day.

...Cold air rushes into the eastern U.S. behind a low pressure
system exiting the Mid-Atlantic coast...

...Unsettled weather moves across the western U.S. for the next
couple of days...

The dynamic low pressure system that brought widespread severe
weather across the Deep South to parts of the East Coast is in the
process of exiting into the Atlantic.  The threat of severe
weather along the East Coast has ended.  Light to moderate rain
currently over the Mid-Atlantic will steadily move eastward today
and should slide off the coast by around sunset.  Isolated
locations in the northern Mid-Atlantic could see some wet snow
flakes as cold air rushes in behind the exiting storm under
blustery northerly winds.  A large cold high pressure system will
build quickly into the Great Lakes today and then dominate much of
the eastern half of the U.S. into the weekend.  Fine and colder
than normal conditions will extend down into much of the East
Coast as well as through the Deep South.  The mid-section of the
country will enjoy a period of quiet weather after back-to-back
strong storm systems impacted the region recently.  Some light
rain will appear to linger along the Southeast coastline together
with gusty northeasterly winds through the weekend as a low
pressure wave could develop off the east coast of Florida.

Meanwhile, unsettled weather along the West Coast will push
farther inland through the weekend.  Generally a foot of snow is
forecast for the southern Sierra Nevada and Cascades.  As the
associated Pacific front pushes farther inland, a mix of rain and
snow will be found across the Great Basin on Saturday before
tapering off on Sunday.  The northern Rockies will see
accumulating snows on Saturday followed by light accumulations for
the central Rockies on Sunday.

The northern tier states will experience a gradual warm-up during
the weekend ahead of the Pacific front.  Meanwhile, after a
reprieve today, the fire weather threat may increase across the
southern Rockies/High Plains during the weekend.

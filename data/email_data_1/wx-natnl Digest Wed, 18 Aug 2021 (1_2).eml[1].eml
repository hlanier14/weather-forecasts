Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1111 AM CDT Tue Aug 17 2021

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN INTO CENTRAL
NEVADA...

Much of the previous forecast remains on track (please see the
previous forecast below for more details). The Critical delineation
in Nevada has been expanded northwestward, as the latest guidance
consensus shows more widespread 20+ mph sustained winds overlapping
with 15% RH along/behind the cold front later this
afternoon/evening. Guidance consensus has also trended drier across
the northern Plains, with Elevated highlights expanded eastward when
considering the widespread 15+ mph sustained southerly surface winds
expected, along with dry fuels. Gusty and erratic winds may also
accompany the initially, potentially dry thunderstorms across
portions of the northern Rockies (especially southern Montana) this
afternoon and evening. A few of the stronger gusts may approach
severe limits, with a Marginal risk of severe storms in place.
Please see the Day 1 Convective Outlook for more information on the
severe thunderstorm threat.

..Squitieri.. 08/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Tue Aug 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
Enhanced mid-level flow will begin to overspread much of the Pacific
Northwest and Great Basin early today ahead of a strong shortwave
troughing moving onshore. Ascent from the trough will deepen a
surface cyclone across western Montana while a cold front moves
through the Northwest and northern California. Strong winds and low
relative humidity will support widespread elevated to critical fire
weather conditions from California, through the Great Basin, Rockies
and onto the High Plains.

...Northern and central Nevada...
As the shortwave trough steadily deepens and moves southeast, a belt
of strong westerly flow will develop across portions of the northern
Great Basin. Diurnal heating and deep mechanical mixing from the
increasing flow aloft will support a very dry boundary layer with
widespread surface RH below 10%. Westerly surface winds of 25-30 mph
and locally higher gusts will likely develop in conjunction with the
dry surface conditions. Atop areas of near record-dry fuels, the
favorable combination of dry and windy conditions is forecast to
support widespread critical fire weather.

A cold front associated with the strengthening lee low will move
south into northern Nevada around sunset. Strong wind gusts may
accompany frontal passage along with a significant wind shift to the
north. A few strong gusts may linger into the overnight hours behind
the front as pressure gradients weaken, but increasing humidity
recoveries, weaker winds and cooler temperatures should limit the
threat after dark.

...Rockies and High Plains...
As the surface low begins to deepen in response to the approaching
trough early today, west-east pressure gradients will strengthen
across the Rockies behind a lee trough. Westerly surface flow will
begin to increase through the afternoon, driving dry downslope flow
across much of Idaho, Wyoming and western Montana. To the east of
the lee trough, dry and warm southeasterly flow over the High Plains
will likely develop. Widespread humidity below 25% is expected with
surface winds of 15-25 mph. Fuels remain mostly dry, suggesting
widespread elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are
likely.

Along the cold front across southwestern Montana and central Idaho,
lingering mid-level moisture from recent monsoon activity and
large-scale lift from the approaching trough will support isolated
to widely scattered thunderstorm development by early afternoon.
Model soundings show weak buoyancy developing atop a well-mixed
boundary layer with large dewpoint depressions. The fast storm
speeds and poor precipitation efficiency will likely favor dry
thunderstorms. With receptive fuels and adequate instability/forcing
for lighting, isolated dry strikes appear probable.

...Northern California...
As the shortwave trough moves onshore, the associated cold front
will intensify as it moves out of the Northwest into northern
California. Northerly surface winds of 15-25 mph will likely develop
ahead of and along the front as it slowly moves south late in the
afternoon and early evening. At the same time, mid-level flow along
the backside of the trough will rapidly increase as 500 mb winds of
50 to 60 kts overspread northern California. Model soundings and
high-resolution model guidance show a brief window of strong surface
winds and humidity of 15-20% overlapping across the northern
Sacramento Valley. Uncertainty on the exact temporal and spatial
extent of this overlap remains uncertain. However, elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions appear possible from later
afternoon to early evening ahead of and along the cold front.

After dark, northerly surface winds will likely intensify as the
upper-level jet continues to move south. Despite the increase in
wind speeds, poor phasing of the trough and front with the diurnal
cycle will result in higher surface humidity values. While
elevated/critical criteria conditions appear unlikely overnight, the
strong surface winds and very dry fuels may impact several large
ongoing fires through the overnight hours.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 17 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is anticipated across the southern half o=
f
the lower 48 at the beginning of the period, with a fairly weak pattern acr=
oss
the northern tier. Mid-level low pressure is predicted to form across the
eastern lower 48 by the middle of the period, with mid-level high pressure
remaining across the western contiguous U.S. This pattern supports increase=
d
risk of excessive heat across parts of the southeastern quadrant of the
country
at the beginning of week-2, and across portions of the Central Valley of
California and Desert Southwest from the beginning to middle of the period.
Near to above normal mid-level heights are anticipated for the majority of
Alaska. The forecast pattern for Alaska is not expected to support widespre=
ad
hazards.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat across the Lower Mississippi Valley, Southeas=
t,
and eastern portions of the Southern Plains, Wed-Thu, Aug 25-26.

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of the Central Valley of Califor=
nia
and Desert Southwest, Wed-Sat, Aug 25-28.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY AUGUST 20 - TUESDAY AUGUST 24:

2xygdnnIUVU$

FOR WEDNESDAY AUGUST 25 - TUESDAY AUGUST 31: There continues to be relative=
ly
good agreement amongst the 0Z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensemble means
favoring
mid-level ridging across the southern half of the CONUS at the beginning of
the
period. A transition to mid-level troughing is predicted across the eastern
CONUS by the middle of the period, with ridging persisting across the weste=
rn
CONUS throughout week-2. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean favors this trough
developing earlier than the 0Z GEFS and Canadian, by day 9 (Aug 26). The 0Z
GEFS and Canadian favors a more gradual formation of the trough by day 10 (=
Aug
27), favoring a weaker trough than the 0Z ECMWF. These model differences ar=
e
reflected in the reforecast tools, with the GEFS reforecast tool indicating
more widespread risk of temperatures reaching hazardous thresholds on day 9=
,
compared to the ECMWF reforecast tool. A slight risk of excessive heat is
posted for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Southeast, and eastern
portions of the Southern Plains, Aug 25 to 26, where both the GEFS and ECMW=
F
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile, with temperatures possibly greater than 100 =
Deg
F across the Southern Plains, and exceeding 95 Deg F across the Middle and
Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast. Multiple models also show dewpoints
exceeding 70 Deg F across this region, which could support higher heat inde=
x
values. Overnight minimum temperatures may exceed 80 Deg F in the highlight=
ed
heat risk area.



Across the West, there is relatively good agreement between the GEFS and EC=
MWF
reforecast tools indicating an elevated potential for excessive heat across
parts of California and the southwestern CONUS from the beginning to middle=
 of
the period. Therefore, a slight risk of excessive heat is maintained for pa=
rts
the Central Valley of California and Desert Southwest, Aug 25 to 28, where
both
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile and 100 Deg F. Both reforecast tools hint at =
the
potential for parts of the Northern Great Basin to have maximum temperature=
s
exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 Deg F. However, since these risk areas
are
relatively localized in the tools at this time, this area is not included i=
n
the excessive heat risk. The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) indica=
tes
a moderate risk of fire potential across parts of California. Anticipated
triple digit temperatures combined with predominately dry conditions favore=
d
during week-2, is likely to elevate the risk for wildfires across parts of
California, especially the Central Valley area, as well as exacerbate ongoi=
ng
moderate (D1) to extreme drought (D4) conditions being felt throughout this
part of the country.



Multiple model ensemble means favor the mid-level ridge centered further so=
uth
across the Four Corners region during week-2, which would limit the amount =
of
moisture into the region. Recent runs of the deterministic GFS show potenti=
al
for a tropical cyclone forming in the East Pacific tracking closer to the
mouth
of the Gulf of California which could enhance moisture flow into the Four
Corners region. The deterministic 0Z ECMWF, however, continues to favor a
weaker tropical disturbance tracking further south, which would be less
favorable for enhancing moisture into the southwestern CONUS. The ECMWF
reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation tota=
ls
exceeding the 85th percentile and half an inch across eastern New Mexico at
the
beginning of the period, whereas the GEFS does not show any areas in the
region
reaching this criteria. Due to these differences in the reforecast tools, n=
o
related precipitation or flooding hazards are highlighted over the Southwes=
t,
however any thunderstorms that do develop may lead to localized flash
flooding.



Near to below normal temperatures are favored across the state, as well as
above normal precipitation for central and northern Mainland. The predicted
pattern is not anticipated to support widespread risk of hazards.

300 PM EDT Tue Aug 17 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Aug 20 2021 - 12Z Tue Aug 24 2021

...Weather Pattern Overview...

An amplified upper trough/low lifting out of the northern Rockies
should bring much cooler conditions eastward into the northern
Plains following some late week enhanced rainfall across the upper
Midwest to the northern Plains.  Another upper trough dipping into
the Pacific Northwest should bring another round of rain/storms
across the northern Plains into the upper Midwest this weekend
into early next week.  A broad upper-level ridge re-establishing
across the Deep South will likely steer tropical cyclone Grace on
a westerly track across the southern portion of the Gulf of
Mexico.  Post-tropical cyclone Fred should be departing coastal
New England on Friday.  Meanwhile, recent model guidance has
raised the possibility for tropical storm Henri to track closer to
the East Coast of the U.S. and New England this weekend into early
next week than previous forecasts.

...Model Analysis and preferences...

Much of the model discrepancy continues to be focused across the
Pacific Northwest into the northern Plains through the
medium-range period where multiple shortwaves are forecast to
interact with a mean trough.  The 00Z CMC/CMC mean lifts the
amplified trough/low at a much slower pace than the ECMWF and GFS
in the short-term period.  This rendered the 00Z CMC solution
incompatible with the ECMWF and the GFS early in the medium-range
period so that the CMC were eliminated from the model blend.  In
contrast, the 00Z ECMWF and the 06Z GFS were in good agreement
with each other.  However, the 06Z GFS begins to develop a frontal
wave much more quickly over the northern Plains late this weekend
than its ensemble mean.  The 00Z ECMWF also showed this tendency
but with less discrepancy than the 06Z GFS/GEFS solutions.  The EC
mean and the GEFS mean were in good agreement with one another
through the medium-range.

Therefore, the WPC fronts/pressures forecast was derived from a
blend of 00Z ECMWF/ECENS with the 06Z GFS/GEFS.  A larger
proportion of the 06Z GEFS were incorporated starting on Day 5,
trending toward mostly a blend of the 00Z EC mean and 06Z GEFS by
Day 7.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

Improving weather conditions are expected for the East Coast to
close out the work week after the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred
is forecast to exit New England on Friday.  Some showers and
storms are expected to remain over portions of the Mid-Atlantic
and the interior eastern U.S. ahead of a lingering weak upper
trough.  Activities should diminish quite a bit by Monday as the
trough weakens further.  But a cold front moving through the
Northeast on Tuesday could sustain the rain across New England.

Meanwhile, moderate to heavy rainfall is likely across portions of
North Dakota and Minnesota ahead of the developing low pressure
system to end the work week.  Potential exists for some heavy rain
together with strong to severe thunderstorms across the upper
Midwest on Friday.  Another corridor of enhanced showers and
storms may materialize across portions of the Mid-South to the
Tennessee Valley this weekend owing to a weak front lifting across
the region.

In the temperature department, expect rather warm conditions
across the upper Midwest and northern New England while some high
elevation snow for Wyoming and Montana is within the realm of
possibility.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue August 17 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 23 - 27 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
Bering Sea, extending to Mainland Alaska with below-normal 500-hPa heights.=
 A
ridge is predicted over the eastern North Pacific, with above-normal height=
s
over the Alaska Panhandle and the coast of western North America. A trough =
is
predicted over the Northern Rockies and Plains, associated with below-norma=
l
heights. A subtropical ridge is predicted over the southern tier of the CON=
US
with near-normal 500-hPa heights over much of the South and East.
Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated across Alaska, influenc=
ed
by nearby forecast troughing. Above normal temperatures are favored for par=
ts
of the western CONUS, Southern Rockies, Central and Southern Plains, and th=
e
eastern CONUS due to predicted 500-hPa ridging and above normal heights. A
predicted trough over the Northern Rockies and Plains favors enhanced
probabilities of below normal temperatures there.
Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over much of Mainland
Alaska due to forecast westerly surface flow and storm system development.
Below normal precipitation chances are increased over the Aleutians,
associated
with above normal heights. The positively tilted trough forecast in the
Northern Rockies and Plains supports an increasing likelihood of above norm=
al
precipitation for the upper Mississippi Valley and Western Great Lakes with=
 an
active storm track. Near and below normal precipitation probabilities are
enhanced over the rest of the CONUS, consistent with the ERF consolidation
forecast tool.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=
set
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 25 - 31 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is similar to the
6-10 day period, but generally forecast to shift eastward and deamplify. Th=
e
troughing shifts eastward over the Gulf of Alaska and a ridge is forecast o=
ver
the Northern Rockies and Plains with a trough moving into the northeastern
CONUS. Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are over most of the CONUS.

500-hPa troughing forecast over Alaska favors below normal temperatures for
the
state. Near to above normal temperatures are favored across most of the CON=
US,
consistent with the consolidation tool. Enhanced probabilities of below-nor=
mal
temperatures are favored over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley and Gre=
at
Lakes, associated with the trouging eastward progress and potential
cloudiness.

Troughing over the Bering Sea and Mainland Alaska increases the chances of
above-normal precipitation over central and northern Mainland Alaska.
Below-normal precipitation is predicted for the Aleutians underneath the ab=
ove
normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal precipitation is likely for much of th=
e
northwestern CONUS, extending to the Rockies, Northern Plains, Great Lakes =
and
parts of the Southern Plains, consistent with the consolidation tool. A mea=
n
frontal boundary and potential tropical moisture lead to enhanced
probabilities
of above-normal precipitation across the Central Plains to much of the east=
ern
CONUS. Below-normal precipitation is more likely over southern parts of the
Florida Peninsula, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=
set
by increasing uncertainty and differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools.


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 PM CDT Tue Aug 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

The previous forecast remains on track for widespread Elevated
surface conditions across northern California, and for locally
Elevated conditions across the northern Plains. Please see the
previous forecast below for more details.

In addition, locally Elevated conditions may precede the southward
sagging cold front across central into southern Nevada
tomorrow/Wednesday. However, the brevity of the expected dry/breezy
surface conditions precludes Elevated highlights at this time. In
addition, scant buoyancy atop a post-cold-frontal airmass across
central ID may support a brief thunderstorm or two. Given a
relatively dry boundary layer, a dry strike or two cannot be ruled
out, but the sparse coverage suggests isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights are not currently needed.

..Squitieri.. 08/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CDT Tue Aug 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow pattern will continue day2/Wednesday, as
the upper trough moves to the east and begins to weaken slightly.
The surface cold front across northern California and the Great
Basin will continue southward, while surface low pressure in the lee
of the Rockies moves eastward onto the High Plains. Lingering strong
winds and dry conditions across California may support elevated fire
weather conditions through the afternoon.

...Northern California...
As the trough continues east, mid-level winds will begin to wane in
the early morning hours across the northern Sacramento Valley. Gusty
surface winds around 15-20 mph may linger through day as they veer
to the northeast, and are enhanced by the development of thermally
induced surface pressure trough. Warm temperatures will also support
widespread relative humidity below 20%. With dry fuels and ongoing
fires, elevated fire weather conditions appear likely through the
day before winds weaken and humidity recoveries improve overnight.

...Dakotas...
Ahead of the surface low and lee trough across the northern Plains,
gusty southerly winds of 15-20 mph are forecast to develop during
the afternoon. Surface humidity values across much of the region
will remain above 30% as the southerly flow transports Gulf moisture
northward. However, a few spots across western South Dakota may see
localized humidity below 25% near peak heating. This should support
a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions given mostly
dry fuels.

...HIGH Risk of flash flooding in place today/tonight over Western
North Carolina as Fred moves northward and spreads very heavy
rainfall; potential for landslides in the Southern Appalachians...

...Heavy rainfall and scattered flash floods are also possible
across much of the eastern U.S....

...Cool and wet conditions are likely for the Intermountain West
behind a potent cold front, with warm temperatures and Elevated to
Critical fire weather conditions ahead of it...

...Monsoonal moisture will cause additional showers and
thunderstorms as well as the threat of flash flooding for the
Southwest into Utah through midweek...

This afternoon, Tropical Depression Fred continues a
north-northeastward track through the Southeast, and is
approaching the spine of the Appalachian Mountains close to the
Georgia-North/South Carolina border. A slew of hazardous weather
accompanies Fred, including extremely heavy rainfall and severe
weather. A High Risk of excessive rainfall remains in effect over
western North Carolina since the initial issuance this morning, as
widespread rain accumulations of 4 to 8 inches (with isolated
storm totals of 10 inches) are expected over the Southern
Appalachians through today. This area is particularly sensitive to
heavy rainfall due to the varying terrain and inundated ground
from recent heavy rains in the region. Severe, widespread flash
flooding is anticipated, and numerous Flash Flood Warnings cover
the region as bands of training thunderstorms overtake the area.
In addition to flash floods, the heavy rain will bring an
increased risk of landslides in the mountains of North Carolina
and the Blue Ridge Escarpment. Severe weather also remains a
distinct possibility over parts of Georgia, the western Carolinas,
and southwestern Virginia where an Enhanced Risk of severe weather
is highlighted by SPC, primarily for the threat of several
tornadoes. Trailing bands of rain with Fred could also occur over
northern Florida and into South Carolina today. Meanwhile,
tropical moisture streaming northward across much of the East
feeding into a weak frontal system ahead of a weak upper-trough
will lead to widespread rain and thunderstorms across the
Central/Northern Appalachians and parts of the Mid-Atlantic into
New York over the next couple of days. Through Friday, 2 to 4
inches of rain with isolated totals of 6 inches are expected over
the Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic as remnants of Fred move
north-northeast. Ahead of the anticipated scattered flash floods
later this week, Flash Flood Watches are already in effect over
the aforementioned areas in the Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and
Northeast.

In the West, a potent cold front pushed by an upper-level low will
move through the Intermountain West over the next couple of days,
significantly cooling temperatures there. High temperatures are
forecast to drop to 20 to 30 degrees below normal in the Northern
Rockies by Wednesday, with highs in the 50s. However, temperatures
should remain hot ahead of the front, with a couple more days of
100+ temperatures expected for the Northern Plains. Areas such as
the Central Great Basin should see warmer than normal temperatures
today followed by below normal highs by Wednesday as the cold
front approaches. Ahead of the front, Elevated to Critical fire
weather conditions are a threat again today, along with the
potential for additional fire ignitions from dry thunderstorms.
Red Flag Warnings are in place from portions of California through
the Central Great Basin into the Northern High Plains as dry and
windy conditions align with the movement of the strong front.
Related to the fire activity, poor air quality continues over the
northern Great Basin, Rockies, and Central California, where Air
Quality Alerts cover the region.

Rain showers are also likely with this system in the West along
and behind the cold front, while monsoonal moisture pools ahead of
the boundary in the Southwest around Utah. The approaching front
will interact with the monsoonal moisture to support a severe
weather threat over Central Utah, where SPC has highlighted a
Slight Risk for isolated severe wind gusts. Moreover, rainfall
totals over an inch with locally higher rainfall amounts may
produce isolated instances flash flooding across portions of the
Four Corners states northward into the Northern Rockies, and
eastward to Texas over the next couple of days. Embedded Slight
Risks of excessive rainfall are highlighted over portions of Utah,
southern Arizona, and Central Texas through Wednesday where the
flash flood threat is more focused.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
456 PM EDT Tue Aug 17 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Aug 20 2021 - 12Z Tue Aug 24 2021

...Weather Pattern Overview...

An amplified upper trough/low lifting out of the northern Rockies
should bring much cooler conditions eastward into the northern
Plains following some late week enhanced rainfall across the upper
Midwest to the northern Plains.  Another upper trough dipping into
the Pacific Northwest should bring another round of rain/storms
across the northern Plains into the upper Midwest this weekend
into early next week.  A broad upper-level ridge re-establishing
across the Deep South will likely steer tropical cyclone Grace on
a westerly track across the southern portion of the Gulf of
Mexico.  Post-tropical cyclone Fred should be departing coastal
New England on Friday.  Meanwhile, recent model guidance has
raised the possibility for tropical storm Henri to track closer to
the East Coast of the U.S. and New England this weekend into early
next week than previous forecasts.

...Model Analysis and preferences...

Much of the model discrepancy continues to be focused across the
Pacific Northwest into the northern Plains through the
medium-range period where multiple shortwaves are forecast to
interact with a mean trough.  The 00Z CMC/CMC mean lifts the
amplified trough/low at a much slower pace than the ECMWF and GFS
in the short-term period.  This rendered the 00Z CMC solution
incompatible with the ECMWF and the GFS early in the medium-range
period so that the CMC were eliminated from the model blend.  In
contrast, the 00Z ECMWF and the 06Z GFS were in good agreement
with each other.  However, the 06Z GFS began to develop a frontal
wave much more quickly over the northern Plains late this weekend
than its ensemble mean.  The 00Z ECMWF also showed this tendency
but with less discrepancy than the 06Z GFS/GEFS solutions.  The EC
mean and the GEFS mean were in good agreement with one another
through the medium-range.

Therefore, the WPC fronts/pressures forecast was derived from a
blend of 00Z ECMWF/ECENS with the 06Z GFS/GEFS.  A larger
proportion of the 06Z GEFS was incorporated starting on Day 5,
trending toward mostly a blend of the 00Z EC mean and 06Z GEFS by
Day 7.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

Improving weather conditions are expected for the East Coast to
close out the work week after the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred
is forecast to exit New England on Friday.  Some showers and
storms are expected to remain over portions of the Mid-Atlantic
and the interior eastern U.S. ahead of a lingering weak upper
trough.  Activities should diminish quite a bit by Monday as the
trough weakens further.  But a cold front moving through the
Northeast on Tuesday could sustain the rain across New England.

Meanwhile, moderate to heavy rainfall is likely across portions of
North Dakota and Minnesota ahead of the developing low pressure
system to end the work week.  Potential exists for some heavy rain
together with strong to severe thunderstorms across the upper
Midwest on Friday.  The next upper trough dipping into the Pacific
Northwest should bring another round of rain/storms across the
northern Plains into the upper Midwest this weekend into early
next week.  Meanwhile, another corridor of enhanced showers and
storms may materialize across portions of the Mid-South to the
Tennessee Valley this weekend owing to a weak front lifting across
the region.

In the temperature department, expect rather warm conditions
across the upper Midwest and northern New England while some high
elevation snow for Wyoming and Montana is within the realm of
possibility.  Meanwhile, the upper high that is forecast to extend
across the Deep South will help raise temperatures across the
region.  It appears that the lower to mid-Mississippi Valley will
be most susceptible to excessive heat as high temperatures are
forecast to reach into the upper 90s on Sunday and then near the
century mark by early next week along with high humidity.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CDT Wed Aug 18 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper low across the Great Basin and western US will move slowly
to the east as strong northerly flow advanced into northern
California. A cold front at the surface will move east generating
showers and thunderstorms over the Rockies, while keeping dry and
windy conditions likely in northern California.

...Northern California...
Behind the upper low, 40 to 50 kt northerly mid-level flow will
linger across northern portions of the Sacramento Valley before
weakening as the low shifts east tonight. At the surface, a cold
front associated with the trough should advance slowly southward
through the day. A combination of momentum transfer from the
stronger mid-level flow, and a thermally induced surface pressure
trough will likely support sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph
through the afternoon. Warm diurnal temperatures will also support
minimum surface RH around 15-20%. With dry and windy conditions
expected within an area of active fires and very dry fuels elevated
to locally critical conditions appear probable.

...Eastern Nevada...
Along the sagging cold front across eastern Nevada and western Utah,
showers and thunderstorms are forecast to develop by mid morning. A
few lightning strikes may occur within dry fuels over the area.
However, relatively high low-level moisture content will limit the
potential for dry strikes. Strong wind gusts along the front may
also support a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions
where fuels remain dry.

0151 AM CDT Wed Aug 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, the upper low over the Great Basin will advance
eastward and become negatively tilted as stronger westerly flow
overspread the Rockies. Increasing height falls ahead of the trough
and stronger flow aloft will support lee cyclogenesis through the
forecast period. In response, low-level southerly flow is forecast
to increase, bringing deep moisture northward across the High
Plains. With abundant lift and deep moisture in place, widespread
showers and thunderstorms are expected across the eastern Rockies
and High Plains. Locally elevated fire weather conditions may occur
along the western edge of the deeper moisture where gusty surface
winds off the higher terrain overlap with dry fuels. However, the
expected coverage of precipitation suggests organized fire weather
concerns will be negligible.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
257 AM EDT Wed Aug 18 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Aug 21 2021 - 12Z Wed Aug 25 2021

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A well defined upper level trough should be in place across the
Pacific Northwest and the Upper Midwest to begin the forecast
period Saturday, and an upper level ridge situated over the
Northeast U.S. and also along the Gulf Coast.  This Gulf Coast
ridge will keep Grace tracking westward and remaining well south
of the Texas/Mexico border.


...Model Analysis and preferences...

Much of the model discrepancy continues to be focused across the
Pacific Northwest and extending eastward to the northern Plains
through the medium-range period, where multiple shortwaves are
forecast to interact with a synoptic scale trough.  The 18Z GFS
remained more progressive than the model consensus with these
shortwave passages, however the 12Z GFS aligned better and it was
incorporated into the forecast in lieu of the 18Z run.  With the
next trough/upper low arriving by Sunday night/Monday across the
Pacific Northwest, the 00Z GFS accelerates across southern Canada
by Tuesday, whereas the ensemble means and the ECMWF/CMC suggest a
slower progression.  In terms of Tropical Storm Henri, the 00Z
guidance has continued to adjust westward with the track, bringing
the storm closer to eastern New England by early next week,
particularly with the UKMET and GFS, so this is something that
will need to be monitored very closely in the upcoming days.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was derived from a blend of the
12Z ECMWF/ECENS/CMC/GFS was used as a baseline, and then a greater
portion of the ensemble means for Tuesday and Wednesday.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

Moderate to heavy rainfall is likely across portions of northern
Minnesota and the northern Great Lakes on Saturday ahead of the
developing low pressure system, with the majority of the rain
happening before this forecast period.  The next upper trough
dipping into the Pacific Northwest should bring another round of
rain/storms across the northern Plains into the Upper Midwest this
weekend into early next week.  Meanwhile, another corridor of
enhanced showers and storms may materialize across portions of the
Mid-South to the Tennessee Valley this weekend.  Depending on the
eventual track of Henri, some rain and wind may be possible for
portions of New England early in the week.

In the temperature department, expect rather warm conditions
across the upper Midwest and northern New England while some high
elevation snow for Wyoming and Montana is within the realm of
possibility.  Meanwhile, the upper high that is forecast to extend
across the Deep South and Gulf Coast region will likely result in
temperatures running a few degrees above average.  Pleasantly cool
conditions are expected from the northern Plains to the Upper
Midwest with the trough in place.

...Fred will bring a Moderate Risk of flash flooding as well as a
Slight Risk of severe weather to parts of the East today...

...Much cooler and wetter conditions are forecast for the West
over the next couple of days...

Tropical Storm Fred is forecast to transition to a post-tropical
cyclone today as it moves northward across the Central
Appalachians. Tropical moisture associated with the system will
continue making its way into the eastern U.S., causing continued
rain and thunderstorms. Today into tonight, the heaviest rainfall
and the greatest chance of flash flooding (a Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall) are expected over portions of northern
Pennsylvania and southern New York. Meanwhile a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall expands southward across much of the
Mid-Atlantic region and then across portions of the eastern
Carolinas that have received quite a bit of rainfall recently.
Thus scattered to numerous flash floods are likely for these
portions of the Eastern Seaboard, and Flash Flood Watches are in
effect. Another threat today associated with Fred will be severe
weather. There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms across
parts of the Mid-Atlantic today, with some tornadoes possible as
well as gusty winds.

In the West, a potent cold front pushed by an upper-level low will
continue slowly moving through the Northern High Plains back into
the Central Great Basin through tonight, likely pushing past the
Central Rockies later on Thursday. The energy provided by this
system as monsoonal moisture streams into the West will lead to
showers and thunderstorms across much of the interior regions.
Marginal to Slight Risks of excessive rainfall are in place across
parts of the Four Corners states and into Wyoming today, and a
Marginal Risk could stretch into the Northern Plains by Wednesday.
There is also potential for severe weather in the Central High
Plains on Thursday for wind and hail threats. Given the strong
cold front, much below normal temperatures especially in terms of
highs are expected, particularly today in Montana, where highs
could be as much as 30 degrees below average. Milder than normal
temperatures also stretch into the Great Basin and toward the
Southwest today, with the Central Rockies seeing cooler
temperatures on Thursday as the cold front pushes eastward.
Unfortunately, poor air quality persists in portions of the West
despite the cooldown.

In the center of the country, hot temperatures in the 90s and
nearing 100F in some areas are again expected for the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest ahead of the cold front. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms are forecast across the Southern Plains
into the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, and Marginal
Risks of excessive rainfall in place. Below normal high
temperatures generally in the 80s to low 90s can be expected
there.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Mon Jul 05 2021

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

Ongoing forecast appears on track. A mix of wet and dry
thunderstorms are possible across eastern Idaho, southwest Montana,
and western Wyoming. A few dry thunderstorms may also be possible
near the Canadian border from northern Washington to north-central
Montana. However, the majority of storm activity will likely stay in
Canada and thus, no dry thunderstorm area has been added in this
region.

..Bentley.. 07/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0108 AM CDT Mon Jul 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale upper-level ridge will remain anchored over the West,
with somewhat marginally enhanced westerly mid-level flow confined
to portions of the Pacific Northwest and the northern Rockies.
Within this zonal flow regime, a mid-level short-wave trough will
move out of the northern Rockies and into the northern Great Plains
throughout the day, while another mid-level short-wave trough will
approach the Pacific Northwest.

Meanwhile, low-level subtropical moisture beneath the ridge will
remain present over much of the central/northern Rockies. Diabatic
heating/mixing processes should lead to the development of isolated
thunderstorms across this region by early afternoon. The combination
of PWAT values at or below 0.75 inches and receptive fuels to
support dry lightning ignitions (despite some recent wetting rains)
appears most conducive over portions of eastern Idaho, far
southwestern Montana, far western Wyoming, and far northern Utah.
Thus, an area delineating isolated dry lightning potential has been
added for this region.

Otherwise, widespread wind/RH concerns remain low for the balance of
the CONUS.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 05 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast across the West at the beginning
of week-2, although weaker compared to the end of week-1. This high pressure
is
anticipated to shift eastward to the North-Central CONUS as mid-level low
pressure forms along parts of the West Coast by the middle of the period. This
pattern is expected to continue elevated chances for excessive heat across the
West at the beginning of week-2, shifting to the North-Central CONUS by the
middle of the period. Weak mid-level high pressure is anticipated to dominate
most of Alaska during week-2, which is less favorable for hazards.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for parts of California along with the Central
Great Basin and Southwest, Tue-Wed, Jul 13-14.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Rockies, Great Basin,
Southwest,
California, and Pacific Northwest, Tue-Thu, Jul 13-15.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the northern and central Rockies
and
northern to central Great Plains, Thu-Mon, Jul 15-19.

Slight risk of high winds across coastal parts of Northern California, Tue-
Thu,
Jul 13-15.

Possible flooding for portions of Arizona and New Mexico.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY JULY 08 - MONDAY JULY 12:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vsXIB_Pp0peWIIk2pt-OfhPq6pBmnVKUiV9x7TOl0A9eRIQp0_GQjN4Iaavs-9yAWA5VEhIp$

FOR TUESDAY JULY 13 - MONDAY JULY 19: Mid-level ridging is anticipated to
continue from the end of week-1 into the beginning of week-2, although weaker.
Ridging is forecast to shift eastward to the North-Central CONUS by the middle
of the period. This pattern is reflected in the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools, with the excessive heat signal eastward shift from the West to
North-Central CONUS during week-2. A slight risk of excessive heat is posted
for parts of the Central Great Basin and Southwest, July 13 to 15, and across
parts of the Rockies and Great Plains, July 15 to 19. Highlighted excessive
heat risk areas may experience maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile and 95 Deg F (90 Deg F in higher elevation areas and 100 Deg F
across the southwestern CONUS). The GEFS reforecast tool indicates at least a
40% chance of exceeding the heat criteria across parts of the southwestern
CONUS at the beginning of the period, while the ECMWF reforecast tool shows a
smaller region isolated to mainly Arizona and eastern California only on day 8
(July 13). An area of moderate risk of excessive heat is designated for parts
of California along with the Central Great Basin and Southwest, July 13 to 14,
mainly based on the GEFS reforecast tool guidance.



The 0Z GEFS ensemble mean favors this ridge extending further east to across
the eastern CONUS by the middle of the period, whereas the 0Z ECMWF develops a
mid-level trough near the Ohio Valley that shifts eastward. These differences
are seen in the reforecast tools, with the GEFS reforecast tool showing at
least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and
90
Deg F across parts of the Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Mid-Atlantic from
the middle to end of the period, whereas the ECMWF does not. These areas are
not included in a risk for excessive heat due to the significant model
differences. Triple digit temperatures are possible across some parts of the
higher elevations across the West, where combined with below normal
precipitation predominately favored during week-2, is likely to exacerbate
ongoing moderate (D1) to extreme drought (D4) conditions being felt throughout
this part of the country. Heat-driven impacts expected also include locally
elevated fire weather conditions as well as direct health risks for human and
animal populations across the highlighted regions.



Tropical storm Elsa is currently located near Cuba as of 11am EDT and is
expected to move off the East Coast in the next 5 days, so no impacts from the
storm are anticipated for the U.S. by week-2. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean
indicates possible formation of mid-level shortwave troughing across the
Midwest at the beginning of the period shifting to the East throughout the
period. The 0Z GEFS mean also hints at the formation of this trough but
transitions to ridging by the middle of the period. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble
solution would be more favorable for surface low formation and frontal
activity
across the Midwest and northeastern CONUS compared to the GEFS. This is
reflected in the ECMWF reforecast tool, which shows at least a 20% chance of
3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch across
the Midwest July 13 to 15, whereas the GEFS has totals near 0.75 inches. Due
to
significant model differences, an associated precipitation hazard is not
designated at this time.



Surface high pressure is forecast to build across the northeastern Pacific,
into parts of the Pacific Northwest, while surface low pressure may form
across
California and the Central Great Basin during week-2. The greatest likelihood
for the orientation of these features to support a tight pressure gradient
across northwestern California is at the beginning of the period. A slight
risk
of high winds is maintained across coastal portions of Northern California,
July 13 to 15, where both the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance
of sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph.



The 0Z GEFS ensemble mean shows thermal low pressure possibly forming over
Baja
California during week-2, which could support enhanced moisture flow from the
Gulf of California into parts of the Southwest, whereas the 0Z ECMWF favors
low
formation generally further north near the Four Corners and Great Basin which
would be less favorable for enhanced southerly moist flow. The GEFS reforecast
tool indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the
85th percentile and 0.5 inches across parts of eastern Arizona and western New
Mexico during the middle of the period, whereas ECMWF does not have totals
reaching these thresholds. The uncalibrated ECMWF does show some elevated
potential for 3-day totals exceeding half an inch across this region at the
beginning of the period. Despite these model differences, the possible flood
risk area is maintained in today's outlook.



Alaska is predicted to be dominated by weak mid-level ridging throughout the
period, which is less favorable for widespread hazards. Therefore no hazards
are posted for Alaska at this time. This pattern would favor near to below
normal precipitation for much of the state, excluding northern Alaska.

237 PM EDT Mon Jul 05 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Jul 08 2021 - 12Z Mon Jul 12 2021

...Elsa is forecast to cross the eastern Carolinas on Thursday and
may result in heavy rainfall near the Carolina Coast and
potentially southeastern New England Friday...

...Repeating heavy rain may persist over southern Texas into the
weekend as low pressure lingers over northern Mexico...


...Overview...

The western CONUS ridge/eastern mean trough pattern will amplify
this weekend as a shortwave trough from the Pacific rounds the
ridge before stalling over the Upper Mississippi Valley Saturday.
The upper ridge over the Great Basin/Desert Southwest will
strengthen in the wake of the ridge-riding trough and intensify
the ongoing heat wave across The West. An initial shortwave trough
pushing east from the Great Lakes to eastern Canada/New England by
Friday will drag a weak cold front over the northeastern CONUS
through Friday before it lifts back as a warm front ahead of the
ridge-riding shortwave trough over the weekend. Tropical Storm (or
Depression at that point) Elsa is forecast to push off the
Carolinas on Thursday and lift northeastward toward the 40/70
benchmark while an upper trough/low stalls over northern Mexico.
These areas may see locally heavy rainfall during the period.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The most recent guidance has come into much better agreement with
the ridge-riding shortwave trough that stalls near the Upper
Midwest and with the timing and strength of Elsa. The 06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF formed a reasonably-clustered pairing with their
ensemble means and each other to serve as a good starting point
through the period. The 15Z NHC points were used for Elsa for the
morning update. Multi-day ensemble trend has been slower with the
trough/upper low settling into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
which was captured by the GFS/ECMWF well. This blended solution
was utilized for the sensible weather elements as well, mostly via
the 12Z/13Z National Blend of Models.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough that stalls over northern Mexico through next
week will support a repeating rain threat over that region
continuing for Thursday and perhaps well into the weekend, though
the threat for extreme totals continues to diminish. However a
persistent low-level flow of Gulf moisture will feed into this
slow-moving disturbance, maintaining a flooding threat. Heavy rain
will accompany Elsa as it tracks through the eastern Carolinas
Thursday. Please continue to monitor products from the National
Hurricane Center for the latest Elsa forecast track information.
With a track very near southeastern New England on Friday, coupled
with an approaching cold front, heavier rain may also fall over
Cape Cod and perhaps other areas of southeastern New England. That
cold front may also bring an area of modest to perhaps heavier
rain to upstate New York and the Adirondacks/North Country. The
ridge-riding trough forecast to reach the Upper Midwest by
Saturday will have access to Gulf-sourced moisture and should
result in modest to perhaps significant rainfall for the northern
Plains through the Corn Belt to the western Great Lakes as the
system becomes blocked/stalls.

The heat wave over a significant portion of the West will continue
at least into next week as the Great Basin/Southwest upper ridge
restrengthens in the wake of the ridge-riding trough. The Coast
Ranges, Great Basin, and northern Rockies/Columbian Basin may all
see highs 10-15F above normal each day with locally higher
readings possible. Several daily high temperature records are
under threat across primarily the Great Basin each day with a
slight western shift to California this weekend as the ridge axis
drifts west. The only slight break over the Pacific Northwest
looks to be Thursday when a weak frontal passage nudges highs down
to near or slightly below 10F above normal. Meanwhile the
strengthening and westward expansion of the upper ridge should
promote a hotter trend with time over interior locations of
California where temperatures will climb into the 100s and 110s.
The southern High Plains/Texas will likely see highs 5-12F below
average for most of the week due to cloudiness and rain from the
persistent upper level disturbance drifting over that region. The
Midwest and Great Lakes will see below normal highs due to
rainfall on Thursday and the over the weekend with the next
system. The latter system's cold front may also bring a cooling
trend into the central Plains by the weekend.

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

Added an IsoDryT area for portions of the northern Oregon and
Washington Cascades. Most 12Z CAM guidance indicates convection in
this region beginning after 06Z. Forecast soundings do show LCLs
quite high which could limit charge separation, but similar patterns
in the past have been prolific lightning producers. An isolated dry
thunderstorm area seems warranted despite the uncertainty due to the
potential for scattered lightning, and very dry fuels (especially on
the east slopes of the Cascades) combined with dry and breezy
conditions which are expected to follow on Wednesday.

..Bentley.. 07/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0109 AM CDT Mon Jul 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge positioned over the West will remain
quasi-stationary throughout the period, resulting in light/variable
flow over much of this region. A mid-level short-wave trough will
enter portions of the Pacific Northwest. Mid-level flow along the
southern periphery of this trough, combined with diurnally driven
mixing processed, may result in locally enhanced sustained surface
winds of 10-15 mph over portions of northern California and vicinity
by late afternoon amid a residual dry airmass and RH values
approaching the teens. Thus, locally elevated fire-weather
conditions may be possible for this region. Otherwise, fire-weather
concerns remain low for the balance of the CONUS.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon July 05 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 11 - 15 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical model solutions forecast weak positive 500-hPa
height anomalies across much of the region, with weak negative 500-hPa height
anomalies confined to the central CONUS over the Southern and Central Plains.
Dynamical models predict ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies over
the
western and northeastern CONUS. Ensemble means from the GEFS, ECMWF and
Candadian models show relatively weaker positive height anomalies and
troughing
over the Gulf of Alaska, where high resolution runs of the GFS and ECMWF
operational models forecast a low pressure system and negative 500-hPa height
anomalies. Relative high pressure and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over western Mainland Alaska, particularly by the ECMWF and GEFS
ensemble means.

Above normal temperatures are favored for parts of southwestern Mainland
Alaska
under positive 500-hPa height anomalies, and for eastern areas of the North
Slope, consistent with dynamical model temperature tools. Below normal
temperatures are favored for parts of northwestern Mainland Alaska, under
anomalous northerly flow, and for parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska and
the
northern Alaska Panhandle, under a closed low.  Near normal temperatures are
favored across remaining areas of Alaska with weak signals in temperature
tools
and large spread among model solutions.

High probabilities for above normal temperatures are forecast across much of
the West, under a predicted ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies, with
probabilities exceeding 80 percent in some areas. Above normal temperatures
are
likely across the Northern Plains and for the northeastern CONUS, under
positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Weak negative 500-hPa height anomalies and
troughing lead to likely below normal temperatures for parts of the southern
central CONUS into the Central and Lower Mississippi Valley. Above normal
temperatures are favored for parts of the Florida Peninsula, supported by
dynamical model forecasts.

Below normal precipitation is favored for the eastern Aleutians and across
southern Mainland Alaska, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Above
normal
precipitation is favored for the North Slope, as predicted by dynamical
models.
Below normal precipitation is likely for the northwestern CONUS into the
Northern Plains, under a predicted ridge. Above normal precipitation is
favored
for parts of the Southwest, as predicted by the precipitation consolidation.
The 0Z GEFS reforecast based precipitation forecast has a larger area of above
normal precipitation across much of the Southwest than the ECMWF reforecast
precipitation tool and was given greater weight in the forecast, due to recent
model performance for this region. Above normal precipitation is likely from
the Southern Plains northeastward across the Central Mississippi Valley into
the Midwest and part of the Northeast, under southerly surface moisture flow
and supported by the precipitation consolidation. Below normal precipitation
is
favored for the eastern Gulf Coast and southern Atlantic Coast, as predicted
by
the precipitation consolidation.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by some
differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 13 - 19 2021

During the week 2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist with some deamplification and eastward progression of the large
scale features, as ensemble spread and uncertainty increase. Troughing extends
southward along the Pacific Coast of North America in most dynamical model
solutions, under weak positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Ridging over the
western CONUS shifts slightly eastward from the 6-10 day period to the week 2
period, while a positive 500-hPa height anomaly center persists over the
Northeast into week 2. Slightly negative 500-hPa height anomalies continue
over
the southern central CONUS in week 2 forecasts.

Above normal temperatures continue to be favored for southwestern Mainland
Alaska under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are
slightly favored for a small area of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the
northern Alaska Panhandle, under predicted troughing, and for parts of
northwestern Mainland Alaska, under anomalous northerly flow. Probabilities
for
above normal temperatures continue to be enhanced for most of the West, under
a
predicted ridge, while probabilities for above normal temperatures are
increased across the Northern Plains and western Great Lakes region as the
ridge shifts eastward in week 2. Above normal temperatures are likely for the
Northeast in week 2, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Weak negative
500-hPa height anomalies and troughing lead to likely below normal
temperatures
for parts of the southern central CONUS, as supported by dynamical model
forecasts and the temperature consolidation.

Below normal precipitation continues to be favored for the eastern Aleutians
and across southern Mainland Alaska, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies.
Above normal precipitation is slightly favored across the North Slope in week
2, supported by dynamical model forecasts. Below normal precipitation
continues
to be likely for the northwestern CONUS into the Northern Plains, under a
predicted ridge. Near to above normal precipitation is favored for parts of
the
Southwest, supported mostly by the 0Z GEFS reforecast based precipitation
tool.
Above normal precipitation continues to be slightly favored from parts of the
Southern Plains northeastward across the Central Mississippi Valley into the
Midwest and western areas of the Northeast, under southerly surface moisture
flow and weaker troughing in dynamical model forecasts. Below normal
precipitation is favored for the eastern Gulf Coast and southern Atlantic
Coast, as predicted by the precipitation consolidation.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall impacts are expected for
portions of Florida as Elsa moves through the eastern Gulf...

...Excessive heat to continue across the Northwest with a much
cooler airmass expected after Monday for the Northern Plains...

...Locally heavy rain possible across the Gulf Coast into Texas,
with monsoon moisture affecting the Southwest...

Tropical Storm Elsa is forecast to move north of western Cuba
today and track north through the eastern Gulf of Mexico on
Tuesday before making landfall along the Big Bend Coast of Florida
on Wednesday.  On Wednesday, Elsa is expected to take a turn to
the northeast, approaching coastal Georgia by late in the day.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the Florida
Keys and along the Florida west coast tonight through Tuesday
night, where a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect.  A Tropical
Storm Watch and a Storm Surge Watch are in effect for portions of
the west coast of Florida and the Florida Big Bend.  As Elsa
approaches the Florida Keys, the Florida Peninsula, and coastal
Georgia through Wednesday, heavy rainfall may result in flooding.
There is a risk of tropical storm conditions and storm surge
impacts along the Georgia coast on Wednesday.

Temperatures will remain above normal across much of the western
U.S. through midweek.  With temperatures climbing well into the
90s and low 100s in some locations, Heat Advisories and Excessive
Heat Warnings are in place from far northern California and
southern Oregon to southern Idaho.

A slow-moving front tracking across the northern Plains and
Midwest will be the focus for showers and thunderstorms over the
next few days. Some of these storms may produce moderate to heavy
rainfall in addition to severe weather. The Storm Prediction
Center has a small Slight Risk for severe thunderstorms across
portions of the northern High Plains and the Black Hills region on
Monday.  After one more warmer than average day on Monday, this
frontal boundary will usher in a much cooler airmass Tuesday into
Wednesday from the northern Plains to the Upper Great Lakes where
daytime highs on Tuesday could be 10 to 20 degrees below normal.

The Storm Prediction Center has also highlighted a portion of the
Northeast with a Slight Risk, where severe weather is possible on
Tuesday.  Storms developing ahead of the front that is approaching
from the west may become severe, capable of producing damaging
winds.

In the South, a dissipating frontal boundary will remain,
supporting rain and storms from the southern Plains to the
Southeast. Moderate to locally heavy rain is possible.

In the Southwest, the monsoon pattern will persist for another
day, fueling additional rounds of thunderstorms across portions of
eastern Arizona and New Mexico on Monday and Tuesday.  Ample
moisture spreading north will extend the threat for daily showers
and thunderstorm into the central Rockies and High Plains.  Storms
across these regions may be capable of producing locally heavy
rainfall amounts, raising flash flooding concerns.

...Elsa is forecast to cross the eastern Carolinas on Thursday and
may result in heavy rainfall near the Carolina Coast and
potentially southeastern New England Friday...

...Repeating heavy rain may persist over southern Texas into the
weekend as low pressure lingers over northern Mexico...


...Overview...

The western CONUS ridge/eastern mean trough pattern will amplify
this weekend as a shortwave trough from the Pacific rounds the
ridge before stalling over the Upper Mississippi Valley Saturday.
The upper ridge over the Great Basin/Desert Southwest will
strengthen in the wake of the ridge-riding trough and intensify
the ongoing heat wave across The West. An initial shortwave trough
pushing east from the Great Lakes to eastern Canada/New England by
Friday will drag a weak cold front over the northeastern CONUS
through Friday before it lifts back as a warm front ahead of the
ridge-riding shortwave trough over the weekend. Tropical Storm (or
Depression at that point) Elsa is forecast to push off the
Carolinas on Thursday and lift northeastward toward the 40/70
benchmark while an upper trough/low stalls over northern Mexico.
These areas may see locally heavy rainfall during the period.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The most recent guidance has come into much better agreement with
the ridge-riding shortwave trough that stalls near the Upper
Midwest and with the timing and strength of Elsa. The 06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF formed a reasonably-clustered pairing with their
ensemble means and each other to serve as a good starting point
through the period. The 15Z NHC points were used for Elsa for the
morning update. Multi-day ensemble trend has been slower with the
trough/upper low settling into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
which was captured by the GFS/ECMWF well. This blended solution
was utilized for the sensible weather elements as well, mostly via
the 12Z/13Z National Blend of Models.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough that stalls over northern Mexico through next
week will support a repeating rain threat over that region
continuing for Thursday and perhaps well into the weekend, though
the threat for extreme totals continues to diminish. However a
persistent low-level flow of Gulf moisture will feed into this
slow-moving disturbance, maintaining a flooding threat. Heavy rain
will accompany Elsa as it tracks through the eastern Carolinas
Thursday. Please continue to monitor products from the National
Hurricane Center for the latest Elsa forecast track information.
With a track very near southeastern New England on Friday, coupled
with an approaching cold front, heavier rain may also fall over
Cape Cod and perhaps other areas of southeastern New England. That
cold front may also bring an area of modest to perhaps heavier
rain to upstate New York and the Adirondacks/North Country. The
ridge-riding trough forecast to reach the Upper Midwest by
Saturday will have access to Gulf-sourced moisture and should
result in modest to perhaps significant rainfall for the northern
Plains through the Corn Belt to the western Great Lakes as the
system becomes blocked/stalls.

The heat wave over a significant portion of the West will continue
at least into next week as the Great Basin/Southwest upper ridge
restrengthens in the wake of the ridge-riding trough. The Coast
Ranges, Great Basin, and northern Rockies/Columbian Basin may all
see highs 10-15F above normal each day with locally higher
readings possible. Several daily high temperature records are
under threat across primarily the Great Basin each day with a
slight western shift to California this weekend as the ridge axis
drifts west. The only slight break over the Pacific Northwest
looks to be Thursday when a weak frontal passage nudges highs down
to near or slightly below 10F above normal. Meanwhile the
strengthening and westward expansion of the upper ridge should
promote a hotter trend with time over interior locations of
California where temperatures will climb into the 100s and 110s.
The southern High Plains/Texas will likely see highs 5-12F below
average for most of the week due to cloudiness and rain from the
persistent upper level disturbance drifting over that region. The
Midwest and Great Lakes will see below normal highs due to
rainfall on Thursday and the over the weekend with the next
system. The latter system's cold front may also bring a cooling
trend into the central Plains by the weekend.

...There is a heavy rain threat this weekend over the Midwest
which had a recent period of heavy rain...

...Overview...

The western CONUS ridge/eastern mean trough pattern will amplify
this weekend as a shortwave trough from the Pacific rounds the
ridge before stalling over the Upper Mississippi Valley Saturday
potentially through Monday. The upper ridge over the Great
Basin/Desert Southwest will strengthen in the wake of the
ridge-riding trough and intensify the ongoing heat wave across The
West. The initial shortwave trough over the interior Northeast,
which will direct Elsa remnants off the Northeastern Seaboard on
Friday, will push a weak cold front through the Northeast with the
tailing front over the Midwest lifting back as a warm front ahead
of the ridge-riding shortwave trough over the weekend. An upper
level trough lingers over northern Mexico, but most of the
associated rain should be contained south of the Rio Grande.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

There is good agreement in the most recent guidance with the
ridge-riding shortwave trough that stalls over the Upper Midwest
this weekend, with the departure of Elsa off the Northeastern
Seaboard Friday, and with the upper trough/low lingering just
southwest of Texas this weekend into next week. The main
difference in guidance now is a second ridge riding shortwave
trough pushing east into southern BC around a Gulf of Alaska low
Saturday night or Sunday. The 18Z GFS is the slowest solution with
this feature Saturday evening, though the 00Z GFS has sped up
again and is now similar to the 12Z UKMET for timing which is a
little ways behind the 12Z CMC/ECMWF which are to the BC/Alberta
border by 12Z Sunday. The heavy rain threat associated with an
upper low/trough southwest of Texas looks to mainly end by Friday
with the threat pushing south of the Rio Grande. The 12Z CMC is a
bit farther north with the feature and is now an outlier solution
with a heavy rain threat continuing through the weekend for far
southern Texas. Therefore, a general deterministic model blend was
used through Day 5 (with less CMC by Day 4) with increasing use of
the GEFS/ECENS means for Days 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The cold front moving through the Northeast Friday should bring an
area of modest to perhaps heavier rain to upstate New York and the
Adirondacks/North Country before pushing off the coast (with
effects from Elsa remnants remaining off the Northeastern
Seaboard). The ridge-riding trough forecast to reach the Upper
Midwest by Saturday will have access to Gulf-sourced moisture and
should result in significant rainfall for the northern Plains
through the Corn Belt to the western Great Lakes as the system
becomes blocked/stalls. The axis of heaviest rain may set up near
northern Missouri/north-central Illinois into northern Indiana
which had a rather wet second half of June and is still
experienced main-stem river flooding.

The heat wave over a significant portion of The West will shift
slightly west this weekend in the wake of the ridge-riding trough.
The Coast Ranges, Central Valley of California, Great Basin, and
northern Rockies/Columbian Basin should all see highs 10-15F above
normal each day with locally higher readings possible. Meanwhile
the strengthening and westward expansion of the upper ridge will
promote a hotter trend over interior locations of California where
temperatures will climb into the 100s and 110s. Several daily high
temperature records are under threat each day primarily over the
western Great Basin through interior California. The southern High
Plains/Texas will likely see highs 5-12F below average for most of
the week due to cloudiness and light to moderate rain. The Midwest
and Great Lakes will see below normal highs over the weekend due
to rainfall.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0116 AM CDT Tue Jul 06 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is noted in early-morning water vapor imagery
off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, and is expected to slowly
move onshore over the next 24-36 hours. Lift associated with this
wave will introduce isolated thunderstorm chances to the Pacific
Northwest, and an increase in low-level winds will support a
regional fire weather concern for parts of northern CA/southern OR.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, recent rainfall and/or additional rain
chances today will mitigate any other robust fire weather concerns.

...Pacific Northwest...
00z regional soundings as well as recent GOES precipitable water
estimates suggests that PWAT values between 0.5-0.6 inches are
already in place across much of the Pacific Northwest. Furthermore,
steep mid-level lapse rates are noted for a few locations, and
additional cooling aloft with the approach of the upper-level wave
will help support around 100-250 J/kg MUCAPE by late this afternoon
and into the overnight hours. Lift and attendant thunderstorm
chances are expected to gradually increase from central/eastern OR
late today and spread north/northeastward through the overnight
hours. Recent hi-res guidance has struggled to show a strong
convective signal for today/tonight, possibly due to the minimal
instability expected, and this is yielding low confidence in storm
coverage. However, the synoptic forcing for ascent and antecedent
mid-level moisture suggest at least an isolated chance for dry
thunderstorms. Given very dry fuels across the region this potential
warranted an expansion of the risk area.

...Northern California and southern Oregon...
Afternoon relative humidity values are forecast to once again fall
into the single digits to low teens amid deep boundary-layer mixing.
Although sustained winds will generally remain around 15 mph,
increasing boundary-layer flow will support frequent gusts between
20-25 mph. Fuels across this region remain dry per recent fuel
analyses and ongoing fire activity. As such, elevated conditions are
expected, and brief/localized critical conditions are possible.

...Southern California Coast...
Northerly winds at around 850 mb are expected to gradually increase
during the overnight hours. This may augment downslope winds for
portions of coastal southern California where warm temperatures
during the day will help cure fuels. Overnight RH recoveries are
expected to be modest, and locations that experience downslope
warming/drying may see periods of elevated fire weather conditions
tonight through early Wednesday morning.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CDT Tue Jul 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level wave currently approaching the Pacific Northwest is
forecast to translate across the northern Rockies through the day
Wednesday. This will bring stronger mid-level flow and isolated to
scattered thunderstorm chances across the northern Great Basin,
northern Rockies, and parts of the Pacific Northwest. With dry fuels
already in place, this will introduce fire weather concerns to the
region.

...Columbia Basin...
Mid-level winds are forecast to turn more westerly in the wake of a
weak cold frontal passage by mid to late afternoon. Additionally, a
deepening trough to the east of the Basin will tighten the
background surface pressure gradient. As a result, sustained
downslope winds between 15-20 mph are expected with frequent gusts
up to 25 mph likely. Winds may be stronger closer to terrain
features with some guidance suggesting gusts upwards of 30 mph are
possible. Despite the weak cold intrusion, diurnal warming will
support RH reductions down to 15-20%, supporting elevated fire
weather conditions.

...Northern Great Basin...
The synoptic features driving the elevated fire weather threat
across the Pacific Northwest will also drive fire weather concerns
for the northern Great Basin. Increasing mid-level flow within a
deeply mixed boundary layer will support a broad swath of 15-20 mph
winds - especially through the Snake River Valley of
southern/southeast ID where terrain influences will increase the
probability of sustained winds above 15 mph. Given dry conditions
and forecast RH values between 10-15%, elevated conditions appear
likely from northwest NV into southern ID.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated thunderstorms may be ongoing at the start of the period
early Wednesday morning from northeast OR into eastern WA.
Thunderstorm coverage will likely increase through the day as lift
associated with the upper-level trough overspreads higher quality
moisture to the east. Recent hi-res ensemble guidance shows a
wetting rainfall signal across western MT, suggesting that a
transition zone from primarily isolated dry thunderstorms to
scattered wet thunderstorms may exist across the WA/ID/MT region.
Forecast soundings from this area feature 0.6-0.8 inch PWAT values
supporting 250-500 J/kg MUCAPE rooted above dry, well-mixed boundary
layers - suggesting a mixture of dry and wet thunderstorms and
supporting the idea of a possible transition zone. Considering the
dry fuels already in place, the dry thunderstorm risk area is
maintained, though some refinements are possible as the
precipitation forecast becomes clearer.

...Tropical Storm force winds, dangerous storm surge, and heavy
rainfall likely across Florida as Elsa moves through the region on
Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions extending into the
Southeast on Wednesday...

...Excessive heat to continue across the Northwest with a much
cooler airmass expected for the Northern Plains and Upper Great
Lakes...

...Severe weather and locally heavy to excessive rain possible for
parts of the Upper Midwest and into the Northeast...

...Heavy rainfall also possible across parts of South Texas
Tuesday and Wednesday...

Tropical Storm Elsa is forecast to track through the eastern Gulf
of Mexico on Tuesday before making landfall along the Big Bend
Coast of Florida on Wednesday. Tropical storm force wind, heavy
rainfall, and life-threatening storm surge is possible along the
west coast of Florida into Wednesday where both Tropical Storm
Warnings and Storm Surge Warnings are in effect. On Wednesday,
Elsa is expected to move through coastal Georgia and the Carolinas
where again tropical storm conditions are possible into Thursday.
Heavy rainfall associated with Elsa may result in flash, urban,
and minor river flooding. SPC also highlights much of the Florida
Peninsula in a slight risk for a risk of tornadoes. Please refer
to the National Hurricane Center for the latest information on
Elsa.

Temperatures across the Northwest again are expected to be well
above normal on Tuesday, with daytime temps climbing well into the
90s and low 100s in some locations and record highs possible.
Temperatures should moderate somewhat Wednesday into Thursday,
though still remaining above normal. Parts of the Pacific
Northwest may actually trend near or below normal as a cold front
begins moving through the region.

A slow moving front moving through the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes,
and eventually the Northeast will be the focus for showers and
thunderstorms over the next few days, with some of these storms
having the potential for heavy rainfall and severe weather. This
cold front will usher in a much cooler airmass for Tuesday and
Wednesday with high temperatures across the Northenrn Plains and
Upper Great Lakes 10 to 20+ degrees below normal.

Elsewhere, a dissipating frontal boundary draped through the
Southeast will continue to support rain and storms from the
southern Plains to the Southeast with moderate to locally heavy
rainfall possible. The best chance for heavy rainfall is across
parts of South Texas underneath of a  lingering upper level
disturbance. WPC shows a slight risk for excessive rainfall/flash
flooding for this area both Tuesday and Wednesday. In the
Southwest, the monsoonal pattern will persist for another day,
fueling additional rounds of mainly diurnally driven thunderstorms
across parts of eastern Arizona and New Mexico on Tuesday with
ample moisture also spreading north into the central Rockies and
High Plains.

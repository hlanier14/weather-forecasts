Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1102 AM CDT Thu Mar 25 2021

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. Clear skies across the
south-central U.S. should continue to foster boundary-layer mixing
and subsequent dry/breezy conditions across portions of far southern
Texas and southern Arizona/New Mexico/Far West Texas. Guidance
however, does trend more moist in the Arizona/New Mexico area,
suggesting that RH will struggle to reach Elevated criteria.
Nonetheless, given very dry fuels and anticipated 20+ mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds, the Elevated area has been
maintained. While the cold front has already passed through far
southern Texas, ample boundary-layer heating/mixing should result in
Elevated criteria surface winds/RH overlapping for at least a few
hours this afternoon.

..Squitieri.. 03/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CDT Thu Mar 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
A vigorous, negative-tilt shortwave will traverse the southern
Plains early in the forecast period before reaching the
mid-Mississippi Valley and eventually Michigan late.  Meanwhile,
another longer-wave trough will become established across the
Southwest.  The overall pattern will maintain a belt of enhanced
flow aloft from the southern Rockies across Texas and on to the Ohio
Valley.  At the surface, cyclogenesis will occur from Arkansas into
Indiana, spreading a relatively dry airmass across portions of deep
south Texas while maintaining dry air across portions of the
southern Rockies.  Another lee trough will organize in the New
Mexico Plains as well during the day.

...Deep South Texas...
Models are less pronounced with lowering surface RH values during
the period of peak wind gusts (15Z-21Z).  Nevertheless, areas of
15-30% RH are likely to develop over the course of the afternoon as
surface temperatures rise into the 80s F.  15-25 mph northwesterly
surface flow will persist through early afternoon before tapering
off, as the deepening low over the middle of the country departs the
region.  Fuels are quite dry, however, and ERCs are relatively high
for this time of year, supporting an elevated fire-weather threat.

...Southeastern Arizona through far west Texas...
Vertical mixing processes beneath strong flow aloft and lee
troughing along the New Mexico Plains will encourage areas of 20-30
mph surface winds in the area through much of the forecast period.
This flow will occur within an airmass characterized by 15-25% RH
values and among areas of dry fuels in part due to drought.  RH
values will be a bit too high to justify critical highlights,
however.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 25 2021

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, strong surface high pressure in the wake of a large
cold front is expected to bring anomalous cold potentially impacting
vulnerable
vegetation over parts of the southeastern U.S. Mid-level and surface low
pressure development and possible high winds are favored across portions of
western contiguous U.S later in the outlook period. Mid-level low pressure
forecast over Alaska favors below-normal temperatures and above-normal
precipitation across much of the state during the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures over portions of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and the Southeast,
Fri-Sun, Apr 2-4.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Southwest, Great Basin, Rockies,
and the Central and Northern Plains, Sun-Thu, Apr 4-8.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MARCH 28 - THURSDAY APRIL 01:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!p0Laj7NJho3WqwGu4AH9J7A9NZEIX75E967NtbWJtkgbgahkgxTiwKfu032eFzEFyvjmF9db$

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 02 - THURSDAY APRIL 08: Both the GEFS and ECMWF model
ensembles continue to advertise anomalous 500-hPa mean troughing traversing
the
eastern U.S. which is anticipated to bring a shot of anomalous cold
temperatures during early week-2. Similar to yesterday, the 0z ECMWF maintains
a more amplified mean solution than the GEFS regarding this feature, with
negative height departures extending as far south as the Lower Mississippi
Valley and Southeast. As this troughing exits the eastern seaboard, there
remains good model agreement with the development of anomalous mid-level
ridging overspreading much of the CONUS, allowing for a moderation of
temperatures by day 10 (Apr 4). By this time, however, both models favor the
development of anomalous troughing upstream across the northwestern CONUS.
Both
the GEFS and ECMWF are more progressive with this feature compared to
yesterday's guidance, favoring an arrival of the troughing earlier in the
outlook period, with the GEFS depicting a more amplified and southward mean
solution compared to the ECMWF. In light of these trends, there is an
increased
potential for weather related hazards across the western CONUS by the middle
of
week-2.



As a large frontal system is predicted to move across the eastern U.S. during
late week-1, there remains good agreement in the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
favoring a broad area of strong surface high pressure settling across the
southeastern CONUS by the start of the period.  Relative to yesterday, a key
difference in the latest ensembles concerns the strength of anomalous cold air
in the wake of the front, which now favor larger negative 850-hPa temperature
departures extending into parts of the Southern Plains, Lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and the Southeast. The colder mean
solutions are reflected in the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools which indicate
elevated chances for minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile
across these regions. While subfreezing minimum temperatures appear more
likely
further north, there is at least a 20% chance for minimum temperatures falling
below 32 degrees F mainly across the Tennessee Valley and Southern
Appalachians, increasing concerns for frost and freeze impacts to vulnerable
emerging spring vegetation in the region. Thus, a slight risk for much below
temperatures is posted for Apr 2 to 4. Drier than normal conditions are also
forecast across much of the central and eastern U.S. early in the period,
although return flow continues to support Gulf moisture advection and
increased
precipitation into portions of Texas.



Across the western CONUS, the aforementioned anomalous troughing aloft is
anticipated to bring anomalous cold temperatures to portions of the Pacific
Northwest and California by the middle of the week-2. The GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools depict increasing probabilities for minimum temperatures
falling below the 15th percentile over the West Coast, however there is little
to no signal in the reforecast tools for subfreezing temperatures across the
lower elevations in the region, and no temperature related hazards are posted
at this time. As the mid-level trough axis is predicted to shift further
inland, surface low pressure is favored to develop in the GEFS ensembles over
the Southwest and High Plains. Strengthening surface pressure gradients are
possible, and reforecast tools show support for sustained winds exceeding the
85th percentile and 25mph over portions of the Southwest, Great Basin, Rockies
and the High Plains by the middle of the period. Thus, a slight risk of high
winds is posted for Apr 4 to 8.



Across the Alaska region, cyclone activity in the Bering Strait and Gulf of
Alaska is favored to bring anomalous cold and enhanced precipitation to many
parts of the state. While temperature and precipitation impacts are expected
to
remain below hazard thresholds, there are growing concerns that the cold and
wet pattern could increase snow water across the Mainland, leading to an
increased risk of flooding during eventual river ice break-up later in April.

252 PM EDT Thu Mar 25 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 28 2021 - 12Z Thu Apr 01 2021

...Overview...

Guidance overall agrees in showing an amplified but generally
progressive upper level pattern during the medium range period,
bolstering forecast confidence and WPC forecast continuity. This
should be especially evident with two main northern stream
systems. The first, a vigorous shortwave trough, will send another
deep surface low through the Great Lakes and Northeast Sunday and
Monday, with a trailing cold front exiting the East Coast. This
sets the stage for continued unsettled weather from the Southern
Plains to the Northeast, with some snowfall possible across the
northern tier of the Northeast to end the weekend. Meanwhile, the
next system enters the Western U.S. on Sunday, driving a well
developed system and cold front eastward coast to coast through
the remainder of the extended range. Meanwhile, a separated
southern stream flow may initially be slower to progress out
through the southern Rockies/Plains Sun/Mon before shearing with
continued uncertainty over the east-central U.S..


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to show very good agreement on the
overall synoptic pattern through the medium range, with typical
questions in the details. A cutoff upper low over the Southwest
Sunday continues to show some uncertainty regarding timing and
ejection eastward early next week/interactions with approaching
Western U.S. troughing. The GFS continues to struggle run to run
with handling of this energy, so a less progressive non-GFS
consensus was preferred for this system. This solution seems
better supported by ensembles and initial separated flow nature.
The 12 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and GEFS ensemble mean remain less
progressive compared to the GFS with this system. Elsewhere, the
deterministic models show good agreement. The WPC medium range
product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend of the
00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian days 3-5 (Sun-Tue). Used a composite
of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian/ECENS mean and the
13 UTC National Blend of Models for days 7/8 (next Wed/Thu). This
maintains good WPC product continuity and is consistent with the
bulk of newer 12 UTC guidance.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

It remains the case that widespread showers and thunderstorms are
likely ahead of the cold front on Sunday from the Southeast into
the Mid-Atlantic, with moderate to locally heavy rainfall possible
in spots. Given heavy rainfall also expected over the
Southeast/Tennessee Valley during the short range, this may
enhance a possible flooding threat for some areas. Expect some
showers farther west into Texas as well along the trailing frontal
boundary. The associated deepening surface low into the Northeast
Sunday-Monday should result in accumulating snowfall across
portions of northern New England, as well as gusty winds across
much of the Northeast.

The next system into the West will bring another round of rain and
mountain snow to the region early next week. As the cold front
enters the Central U.S. by Monday/Tuesday, it should tap into Gulf
of Mexico moisture to produce showers and storms ahead of it
initially across Texas and expanding northeastward into the
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys by the middle of next week. Locally
heavy rainfall is possible, but the details on this are dependent
on intensity and timing of the Southwest U.S. closed low and
interactions with the Western-Central U.S. trough.

East Coast states begin above average on Sunday, through trend
back towards normal Monday/Tuesday following the passage of the
cold front. Above normal temperatures will also steadily progress
eastward from the West to the Plains and the Midwest/parts of the
East by middle of next week underneath of upper level ridging. The
greatest anomalies are expected across the Northern Plains where
daytime highs 15-25 degrees above normal are possible Sunday and
Monday. The upper level trough into the Pacific Northwest will
bring temperatures back down towards normal or below normal in the
same regions by early to mid next week.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR SOUTHEAST NEW
MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...

The northern bounds of the Elevated delineation have been trimmed
southward to portions of the southern Texas Panhandle, as areas
farther north have received appreciable precipitation accumulations
over the past day. While solidly Elevated to potentially critical
winds/RH may be observed as far north as the Texas/Oklahoma
Panhandle border area tomorrow afternoon, fuels are expected to be
poorly receptive to wildfire spread. Farther southwest along the New
Mexico/Far West Texas border, Critical fire weather conditions are
still expected, where 20 mph sustained west-southwesterly winds will
coincide with 15% RH by afternoon peak heating.

Otherwise, dry conditions (30-40% RH) are expected tomorrow
afternoon across the Florida Peninsula, which has been devoid of
appreciable precipitation accumulations for the past few weeks.
Nonetheless, weak surface winds preclude an Elevated delineation.

..Squitieri.. 03/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1250 AM CDT Thu Mar 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
Although the southwestern U.S. mid/upper trough will meander and
begin to cut off from the northern branch of flow across the
northern Rockies, a belt of 50-60 kt flow aloft will persist across
the southern and central Plains throughout the forecast period.
This jet will encourage cyclogenesis in the general area of
southeastern Colorado/western Kansas and vicinity while maintaining
a dry airmass across portions of the southern Rockies and adjacent
High Plains.  Elevated to critical fire weather will develop
especially where fuels are dry.

...Southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and the western third
of Texas...
The aforementioned synoptic features will combine to foster areas of
20-30 mph westerly surface winds with higher gusts across a broad
part of the region during peak heating hours.  Additionally, drier
near-surface air will result in an axis of sub-15% RH values during
peak heating from the TransPecos to the eastern Texas Panhandle.
15-25% RH values will exist northwest of these areas from
southwestern to northeastern New Mexico.  These conditions would
ordinarily support broad critical areas, although recent rainfall
across the Texas Panhandle and South Plains regions have stunted
fuel dryness substantially in these areas and ERCs are low.  As a
result, the critical delineation is confined to the general axis
from El Paso, Texas to Hobbs, New Mexico where dry fuels are most
likely to coincide with critical atmospheric conditions.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu March 25 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 31 - APR 04, 2021

Todays model solutions are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern forecast across North America and adjacent ocean
areas during the 6-10 day period. Shortwave troughing is predicted to move
through the eastern CONUS. Otherwise, broad ridging is favored to develop over
the CONUS. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF ensemble mean
slightly greater than the GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to recent
model
skill. The resultant manual blend features negative 500-hPa height anomalies
across parts of the Northeast, and positive height anomalies elsewhere across
the CONUS. Anomalous ridging is forecast across much of the central and
eastern
Pacific, with a series of shortwave troughs predicted to track to the north of
this feature across Alaska. This intermittent troughing favors near to below
normal heights for most of the Mainland. Above normal heights are forecast
over
the Aleutians and parts of southwestern Mainland Alaska.

Prior to the start of the period, shortwave troughing is forecast to be moving
off the East Coast, resulting in relatively cooler temperatures over the East.
However, due to the transient nature of the pattern, this cool down is
predicted to be brief with above normal temperatures returning by the middle
of
the period. For the period overall, a slight tilt toward above normal
temperature probabilities are favored across parts of the Great Lakes and the
Northeast. Probabilities for above normal temperatures are higher across
southern Florida, the Northern and Central Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley,
and for much of the western CONUS, consistent with the consolidation forecast
tool. Below normal temperature probabilities are increased across much of
Alaska, given the potential for shortwave troughing to lower heights across
the
state, as well as decreased solar heating across the southern part of Alaska
and the Panhandle. These elevated below normal temperature probabilities also
extend into parts of Washington. Above normal 500-hPa heights increase chances
of above normal temperatures over western Aleutians.

Due to limited synoptic forcing, near to below normal precipitation is favored
across most of the CONUS except for the Northeast, southern Florida, and
southern Texas, where above normal precipitation is forecast, supported by the
operational autoblend tool. The highest probabilities of below normal
precipitation are highlighted over the Central Great Basin, underneath the
greatest influence from ridging. Troughing over Alaska and increased
westerlies
result in above normal precipitation chances across most of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement, offset by some differences among temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 02 - 08 2021

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement on the
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
Anomalous ridging with above normal 500-hPa heights is forecast across the
central and eastern CONUS, while a trough with below normal 500-hPa heights is
predicted over the West Coast. Negative height anomalies are forecast over
much
of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle underneath troughing. Positive height
anomalies remain forecast for the Aleutians.

A predicted trough with below normal 500-hPa heights increases chances of
below
normal temperatures over the West Coast. Near to above normal temperatures are
favored across the rest of the CONUS except for southern Texas where above
normal precipitation is forecast, consistent with the consolidation forecast
tool. Increased troughing across Alaska and associated north to northwesterly
mid-level flow favor increased probabilities of below normal temperatures
across the state, while above normal temperature probabilities are forecast
over the western Aleutians, under above normal 500-hPa heights.

Near to below normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced across most of
the CONUS, under the broad ridging forecast over the central and eastern
CONUS.
The exception is over parts of southern Texas where moist, southeasterly
surface flow out of the Gulf of Mexico favors enhanced precipitation chances.
Troughing over Alaska and a series of surface lows forecast to track in the
vicinity of the state result in elevated above normal precipitation chances.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement, offset by some differences among temperature and
precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

...Overview...

Guidance overall agrees in showing an amplified but generally
progressive upper level pattern during the medium range period,
bolstering forecast confidence and WPC forecast continuity. This
should be especially evident with two main northern stream
systems. The first, a vigorous shortwave trough, will send another
deep surface low through the Great Lakes and Northeast Sunday and
Monday, with a trailing cold front exiting the East Coast. This
sets the stage for continued unsettled weather from the Southern
Plains to the Northeast, with some snowfall possible across the
northern tier of the Northeast to end the weekend. Meanwhile, the
next system enters the Western U.S. on Sunday, driving a well
developed system and cold front eastward coast to coast through
the remainder of the extended range. Meanwhile, a separated
southern stream flow may initially be slower to progress out
through the southern Rockies/Plains Sun/Mon before shearing with
continued uncertainty over the east-central U.S..


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to show very good agreement on the
overall synoptic pattern through the medium range, with typical
questions in the details. A cutoff upper low over the Southwest
Sunday continues to show some uncertainty regarding timing and
ejection eastward early next week/interactions with approaching
Western U.S. troughing. The GFS continues to struggle run to run
with handling of this energy, so a less progressive non-GFS
consensus was preferred for this system. This solution seems
better supported by ensembles and initial separated flow nature.
The 12 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and GEFS ensemble mean remain less
progressive compared to the GFS with this system. Elsewhere, the
deterministic models show good agreement. The WPC medium range
product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend of the
00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian days 3-5 (Sun-Tue). Used a composite
of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian/ECENS mean and the
13 UTC National Blend of Models for days 7/8 (next Wed/Thu). This
maintains good WPC product continuity and is consistent with the
bulk of newer 12 UTC guidance.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

It remains the case that widespread showers and thunderstorms are
likely ahead of the cold front on Sunday from the Southeast into
the Mid-Atlantic, with moderate to locally heavy rainfall possible
in spots. Given heavy rainfall also expected over the
Southeast/Tennessee Valley during the short range, this may
enhance a possible flooding threat for some areas. Expect some
showers farther west into Texas as well along the trailing frontal
boundary. The associated deepening surface low into the Northeast
Sunday-Monday should result in accumulating snowfall across
portions of northern New England, as well as gusty winds across
much of the Northeast.

The next system into the West will bring another round of rain and
mountain snow to the region early next week. As the cold front
enters the Central U.S. by Monday/Tuesday, it should tap into Gulf
of Mexico moisture to produce showers and storms ahead of it
initially across Texas and expanding northeastward into the
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys by the middle of next week. Locally
heavy rainfall is possible, but the details on this are dependent
on intensity and timing of the Southwest U.S. closed low and
interactions with the Western-Central U.S. trough.

East Coast states begin above average on Sunday, through trend
back towards normal Monday/Tuesday following the passage of the
cold front. Above normal temperatures will also steadily progress
eastward from the West to the Plains and the Midwest/parts of the
East by middle of next week underneath of upper level ridging. The
greatest anomalies are expected across the Northern Plains where
daytime highs 15-25 degrees above normal are possible Sunday and
Monday. The upper level trough into the Pacific Northwest will
bring temperatures back down towards normal or below normal in the
same regions by early to mid next week.

...A dangerous severe weather outbreak is ongoing across the
Mid-South along with the threat of excessive rainfall into the
Tennessee Valley and the Midwest, followed by high winds across
the Ohio Valley...

...Unsettled weather and cool temperatures throughout much of the
West as gusty winds and blowing dust subside in the Desert
Southwest tonight...

...Record warmth expected along the East Coast on Friday...

A rapidly intensifying low pressure system moving across the
mid-section of the country toward the Great Lakes will continue to
provide the ingredients for a severe weather outbreak into tonight
across the Mid-South, where the Storm Prediction Center highlights
a large area with a moderate to high probability of severe
weather.  Powerful thunderstorms, aided by a subtle warm front,
are forecast to continue blossoming across the South and then
tracking into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys tonight.  These
intense thunderstorms may contain a myriad of hazards that include
violent long-track tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large hail.
 In addition to the severe threats, hydrologic hazards are also a
serious concern from northern Alabama and Mississippi to the
Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians.  Torrential rainfall
rates in these areas that also contain overly saturated soil is a
recipe for flash flooding.  Residents in these areas should have a
plan of action if severe weather threaten their respective
locations.  In addition, the low pressure system will become
rather intense as it tracks across the lower Great Lakes tonight,
bringing the threat of high winds from the lower Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley to the northern Mid-Atlantic tonight into Friday
morning, where Wind Advisories and High Wind Warnings have been
issued for the possibility of downed trees and power lines.

The center of the low pressure system will move steadily across
northern New England on Friday with a soaking rain and embedded
thunderstorms.  The trailing cold front will move across the East
Coast Friday morning with a marginal risk of severe weather that
extends into the Southeast.

In the West, another upper level disturbance digging into the
Southwest will continue to set off scattered showers and areas of
mountain snow from the Northwest spreading into the Four Corners
and the central Rockies on Friday.  This upper trough is also
playing a role in triggering blowing dust in parts of the Desert
Southwest into this evening.  Snowfall totals through Friday
evening are forecast to be heaviest in the San Juan Mountains
where over a foot of snow is expected.

By Saturday, the entire system in the West will exit into the
Plains where Gulf moisture will once again make a return and
trigger another episode of severe weather and heavy rain across
the Mid-South.  A swath of rain together with mixed wintry
precipitation is expected to spread across the northern Plains to
the upper Great Lakes ahead of a wave of low pressure.

Temperature-wise, most of the western third of the CONUS remains
seasonably cool today with a gradual warm-up arriving along the
West Coast Friday and Saturday. On the flip side, the East Coast
will feel more like late spring with highs in the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast.  Numerous daily record warm min temps are on tap from
Florida to Maine on Friday with highs over 90 degrees possible
across the Sunshine State.

0123 AM CDT Fri Mar 26 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EXTREME SOUTHEAST NM
INTO FAR WEST TX...

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to move across the Southwest today,
resulting in weak surface low development over southeast CO this
afternoon. Relatively strong low/midlevel southwesterly flow will
develop in advance of the upper trough, resulting in an increase in
the fire weather threat over portions of southeast AZ, southern NM
and west TX.

...Southeast AZ...Southern NM...West TX...
Elevated to potentially critical meteorological conditions will
develop this afternoon, as sustained surface winds increase to 15-25
mph in conjunction with minimum RH values of 10-20%. These
conditions may develop as far north as portions of the TX Panhandle
and TX South Plains, but generally unfavorable fuel conditions
should limit the threat in those areas. Further south from southeast
NM into far west TX, somewhat more favorable fuels in conjunction
with the expected wind/RH will support a critical fire weather
threat, with elevated conditions potentially extending as far west
as southeast AZ.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0123 AM CDT Fri Mar 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to move from the Southwest into the
Southern Plains on Saturday. A weak surface low is forecast to move
across TX as an attendant cold front moves through portions of the
southern Rockies and High Plains.

...Southeast NM into West TX...
Relatively strong westerly winds are expected to develop Saturday
afternoon from southeast NM into west TX, in advance of the cold
frontal passage. Sustained winds of 15-20 mph (locally higher) in
conjunction with minimum RH values of 10-20% will result in a threat
of elevated fire weather conditions. Some uncertainty remains
regarding the timing of the cold front, which will impact the
location and duration of any critical potential.

...Overall Weather Pattern...

The overall mid-upper level pattern across the continental U.S. is
expected to be rather amplified next week.  The departing
trough/cold front off the East Coast Monday will allow for an
upper ridge to briefly build with an embedded southern stream
disturbance tracking across the southeastern U.S. through
Wednesday.  Meanwhile, the next major storm system will be in
place over the Rockies and Intermountain West to begin the week,
and this storm system will steadily across the central and eastern
U.S., reaching the East Coast around Thursday.  A large surface
high should settle in across the Plains and Midwest for the end of
the week.


...Model Guidance and Predictability...

The deterministic model guidance indicates above average agreement
on the main synoptic scale features, particularly across the
northern half of the U.S., through Wednesday evening.  The 00Z CMC
becomes slower with the next storm system approaching the Pacific
Northwest for the end of the week, and it's farther west with the
downstream upper ridge axis across western Canada.  The 00Z UKMET
is faster with the arrival of the western U.S. trough across the
High Plains by midweek and ahead of the model consensus, and
similar to its 12Z run.

A southern stream shortwave over the southern Plains Monday
continues to show some uncertainty regarding timing, and potential
interaction with the larger scale trough to the west, as it
crosses the southeastern U.S.  The GFS is weaker overall than the
other deterministic guidance and currently not the favored
solution for this region.  The WPC medium range product suite was
primarily derived from a composite blend of the 12Z ECMWF/CMC/some
GFS/UKMET for the Monday through Wednesday time period, and then
less of the CMC for Thursday and Friday owing to the slower
solution across the West.  This maintains good WPC product
continuity from the previous forecast cycle.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

The strong East Coast storm system will be exiting the Northeast
Monday morning, with strong and gusty winds and colder weather in
its wake, and some snow showers for northern New England.  The
next system crosses the Intermountain West with a strong surface
low trekking across southern Canada for the beginning of the week.
 This will bring another round of rain and mountain snow to the
central and northern Rockies through Tuesday.  As the cold front
reaches the Central U.S. by Monday/Tuesday, it should advect
enough Gulf moisture northward to produce showers and storms from
Texas to the Deep South, and locally heavy rainfall is possible
across the Appalachians by mid-week, although models differ on the
axis of heaviest rainfall.  Strong winds are also expected across
the northern Plains and Upper Midwest through Tuesday owing to the
strong pressure gradient that will be in place.

Temperatures are expected to be well above average ahead of the
cold front advancing across the Plains, especially on Monday when
highs could be pushing 70 degrees as far north as the Canadian
border.  An abrupt return to reality ensues by the middle of the
week as a much colder airmass advects into the region behind the
front, with readings about 5-15 degrees below average.  The good
news is the cold weather should be relatively brief as highs
return to above average levels by Friday ahead of the next storm
system, whereas readings are considerably colder for the East
Coast states by then as a Canadian surface highs builds into the
region.

...Overall Weather Pattern...

The overall mid-upper level pattern across the continental U.S. is
expected to be rather amplified next week.  The departing
trough/cold front off the East Coast Monday will allow for an
upper ridge to briefly build with an embedded southern stream
disturbance tracking across the southeastern U.S. through
Wednesday.  Meanwhile, the next major storm system will be in
place over the Rockies and Intermountain West to begin the week,
and this storm system will steadily across the central and eastern
U.S., reaching the East Coast around Thursday.  A large surface

...Exiting storm system to bring gusty winds to the Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast today...

...Heavy rain and the threat of severe thunderstorms to enter the
Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valley regions on Saturday...

...Record warmth expected along the East Coast, with below average
temperatures forecast across much of the Rockies and Southwest...

A strengthening low pressure system is forecast to dash across the
Lower Great Lakes this afternoon and pass over northern New
England tonight. The main impacts will be associated with gusty
winds from the Ohio Valley through the Central Appalachians,
Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. Wind gusts up to 60 mph in these
regions will have the potential to blown down trees and power
lines. Travel may also become difficult at times for high profile
vehicles. High Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories have been issued.
Flooding is also a concern across northern Vermont and northeast
New York, as the combination of moderate rain and snowmelt enters
swollen rivers in the region. Flood Watches are currently in
effect.

Farther west, the next system to track across the Lower 48 is
forecast to bring light mountain snow to the central and southern
Rockies today. Snowfall totals will exceed 6 inches across the
high terrain of Colorado. As the upper-level trough swings east on
Saturday, an abundant amount of moisture will surge north from the
Gulf of Mexico and into the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee
valleys. This will aid in producing widespread showers and
thunderstorms across the region through early Sunday morning.
Total rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches are forecast from southern
Arkansas to Kentucky. Many of these locations have seen above
normal rainfall over the last month; therefore, additional
rainfall could exacerbate flooding concerns. WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for Saturday and includes much
of the aforementioned areas. The threat of severe thunderstorms is
also a concern given the rich atmospheric moisture in place and
approaching cold front. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an
Enhanced Risk of severe weather on Saturday that includes eastern
Arkansas, west Tennessee, and far northern Mississippi. Damaging
wind gusts, large hail, and tornadoes will all be possible with
these storms.

The final Friday of the month will feature record warmth along the
East Coast as high temperatures soar into the 70s and 80s, with a
few locations in Florida reaching the low 90s today and Saturday.
Record daily high temperatures could be set in many spots from
Massachusetts to central Florida. Temperatures will take a dip on
Saturday, but still remain above average throughout much of the
eastern half of the country. The only region to experience below
normal temperatures over the next few days will be the Southwest,
Intermountain West, and Rockies.

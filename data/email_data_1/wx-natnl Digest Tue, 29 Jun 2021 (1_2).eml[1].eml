Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1150 AM CDT Mon Jun 28 2021

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

The isolated dry thunderstorm delineation across the Interior West
has been split into two areas to address two primary regimes of
diurnally driven dry-strike potential this afternoon. First,
isolated dry thunderstorms are possible in proximity to the
central/southern Sierra as upslope flow will initiate isolated,
high-based thunderstorms along the northwest edge of a mid-level
moisture plume. Likewise, strong diurnal heating/boundary-layer
mixing will support isolated thunderstorm development across the
Lower Colorado River Valley. Storms along the northwest periphery of
this regime are expected to have the greatest dry strike potential.
In between both regimes, the latest high-resolution model guidance
suggests that a brief thunderstorm may promote a lightning flash or
two into the evening/overnight hours, but coverage is expected to
remain sparse enough to preclude isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights across parts of the lower Great Basin today.

Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track across portions of
the Pacific Northwest. Please see the previous forecast below for
more details.

..Squitieri.. 06/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0214 AM CDT Mon Jun 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
A very strong mid-level anticyclone will persist across southwest
Canada on Monday, prolonging the historic heatwave across the
Pacific Northwest. Farther east, broad troughing will persist across
the central United States, between the mid-level high across
southwest Canada and another mid-level high across the Mid-Atlantic
region.

At the surface, a strong pressure gradient across the Pacific
Northwest will support enhanced easterly winds, and flow around a
high across the Mid-Atlantic will maintain rich low-level moisture
across much of the central United States.

... Pacific Northwest ...

The strong mid-level anticyclone will maintain a background
environment conducive to maintaining hot and dry conditions across
much of the Pacific Northwest on Monday. Here, diurnally driven
vertical mixing within a warm lower-troposphere will allow surface
temperatures to warm in excess of 110 F across many areas.
Additionally,strong gusty winds will develop during the day as the
thermally induced surface-pressure gradient strengthens during the
day. These hot, dry, and windy conditions will support elevated fire
weather concerns. Additionally, strong vertical mixing will support
plume-dominated fire potential as well across much of the region.

... Four Corners Region west to the Sierra Mountains ...

Increasing mid-level moisture will combine with strong diurnal
heating to support isolated to scattered thunderstorm development
during the afternoon. Given precipitable water values between 0.5
and 0.75 inches, a mixed mode of wet and dry thunderstorms will be
possible. However, warm temperatures, dry low-levels, and long-term
drought conditions will keep most fuels receptive to
lightning-induced fire starts.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 28 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure favors the continuation of
anomalously warm temperatures and excessive heat concerns across the wester=
n
and north-central contiguous U.S. during week-2. Surface low pressure
development and possible stalled frontal activity increases the potential f=
or
heavy precipitation from the Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley during the
period. Enhanced monsoonal moisture and precipitation may result in localiz=
ed
flooding over parts of Desert Southwest. Over Alaska, mid-level low pressur=
e
is
likely to bring below normal temperatures across much of the state.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Intermountain
region, Rockies, Northern Plains and the Upper Mississippi Valley, Tue-Sat,
Jul
6-10.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western CONUS, and the
north-central CONUS, Tue-Mon, Jul 6-12.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Southern and Central
Plains, Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, the Great Lakes, and the
Appalachians, Tue-Sat, Jul 6-10.

Flooding possible across southeastern Arizona and southern New Mexico.

FOR TUESDAY JULY 06 - MONDAY JULY 12: During week-1, dynamical models conti=
nue
to favor amplified 500-hPa ridging over the northwestern CONUS to maintain
excessive heat concerns where triple digit maximum temperatures remain like=
ly
over parts of the Pacific Northwest, Northern Intermountain West, and North=
ern
Plains regions by the end of June and into early July. By the beginning of =
the
outlook period, the last several runs of the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depic=
t
the gradual deamplification of this ridge aloft, with weaker, but broad
positive mid-level height departures overspreading the northern tier of the
CONUS on day 8 (Jul 6). This weakening appears to be tied to the developmen=
t
of
anomalous troughing over the Gulf of Alaska, where the GEFS favors a more
southerly trough axis than the ECMWF to promote cooler temperatures over th=
e
northwestern CONUS. However, there are indications in both the GEFS and ECM=
WF
ensembles that the troughing upstream will be short-lived, which would allo=
w
for the redevelopment of anomalous mid-level ridging and the return of
above-normal temperatures and excessive heat potential across the western
CONUS
during the early to middle portion of the outlook period.



Despite the aforementioned weakening of the mid-level ridging, both the GEF=
S
and ECMWF reforecast tools maintain a broad region covering much of the
western
and north-central CONUS with at least a 20% chance maximum temperatures exc=
eed
the 85th percentile and 90 degrees F. Thus, a slight risk of excessive heat
remains issued for the entirety of week-2. Higher probabilities (>40%) are
featured over the portions of the Rockies and Northern Intermountain West, =
as
well as over the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley. The higher
elevation areas further west are more pronounced in the reforecast guidance
towards the middle of the period, which is likely associated with the
restrengthening ridge aloft favored by the models during this time. In line
with this evolution, the National Blend of Models forecast also highlights
stations in southern Idaho with near record breaking daily highs approachin=
g
100 degrees by day 9 (Jul 7). Thus, a moderate risk of excessive heat is
issued
extending from Southern Idaho eastward to the Dakotas and Minnesota from Ju=
l 6
to 10.  The continuation of excessive heat into July is anticipated to prom=
ote
the emergence of flash drought, and worsen ongoing moderate (D1) to extreme
(D4) conditions being felt throughout much of the West and north-central
CONUS.
Heat-driven impacts expected also include locally elevated fire weather
conditions as well as direct health risks for human and animal populations
across the highlighted regions. As heat remains the top weather-related kil=
ler
in the U.S., please consider reviewing the National Weather Service's heat
safety page at:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/saftey/heat__;!!DZ3fjg!=
orsuv7YG2XAV05V1ojJIVZ3Mg-khpziwdb7SCvalZ1lj09af2F8q39sXa4RICe5KX7WY3hvr$ .



A weakness in the mid-level height pattern over the southern CONUS is likel=
y
to
lead to above-normal and possible heavy precipitation extending from the
Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley. Surface low development and stalled
frontal
activity are possible with ensemble guidance  favoring return flow from the
Gulf to advect ample moisture into the Plains and Mississippi Valley. Despi=
te
this favorable setup, there are disparities in the reforecast guidance, as
GEFS
is rather tenuous with the heavy precipitation signal whereas the ECMWF sho=
ws
a
broad region with at least a 20% chance 3-day rainfall accumulations exceed
the
85th percentile and an inch through the middle portion of the period.  With
pockets of elevated probabilities approaching 40% in the raw ECMWF ensemble
for
rainfall accumulations exceeding an inch across parts of the Plains,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, a slight risk of heavy precipitati=
on
remains issued for the region from Jul 6 to 10.



Farther west, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles are in agreement favoring
mid-level ridging (594 dam) centered over the Four Corners region conducive
for
the enhancement of monsoonal moisture across Mexico and the Desert Southwes=
t
during week-2. Agreement also exists in the reforecast tools indicating at
least a 20% chance 3-day rainfall accumulations exceed the 85th percentile
during the period. Although totals are not expected to exceed hazard
thresholds, the risk of convective episodes may result in localized flash
flooding across parts of Arizona and New Mexico. While the enhanced rainfal=
l
is
expected to benefit the ongoing drought in the region, locally heavy rainfa=
ll
over very dry soils elevates the potential for enhanced runoff across the
higher elevations into the valleys, and a flooding possible hazard remains
issued in the region.



Across the tropics, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring a
tropical disturbance currently located in the Main Development Region (MDR)
with a 40% chance of formation during the next 5 days. Both the GEFS and EC=
MWF
ensembles show some organization of this potential system, but weaken the w=
ave
as it enters the Caribbean later in week-1. Part of this weakening may be
associated with the projected suppressed phase of the Madden Julian
Oscillation
(MJO) over the western Hemisphere during week-2. While guidance remains
unsupportive of further development and the associated enhancement of
precipitation, this disturbance will continue to be monitored and addressed=
 in
upcoming outlooks should it continue to track closer to the CONUS.



Over Alaska, anomalous mid-level troughing favored over the Gulf of Alaska =
is
likely to bring below-normal temperatures and above-normal precipitation
throughout much of the state. The largest signals for heavy precipitation
reside along the Panhandle associated with enhanced onshore flow, however
these
totals are not expected to exceed hazard thresholds and no corresponding
hazards are issued. The anomalously cool and wet conditions during early Ju=
ly
are also likely to quell ongoing wildfire activity.

Valid 12Z Thu Jul 01 2021 - 12Z Mon Jul 05 2021

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest becomes less intense and
continues through the 4th of July weekend...

...Heavy rain is a threat along a front shifting from the
Tennessee Valley to Northeast southward to near the Gulf Coast by
the weekend...

...Overview...

The upper high/ridge causing record-breaking heat in the short
range period is forecast to shift eastward into the Northern
Plains through the weekend while weakening somewhat, as an upper
trough moves into British Columbia and across southern Canada.
Meanwhile, an upper-level trough/low is expected to meander over
the Great Lakes region and push a front slowly southward across
portions of the central and eastern U.S., causing possibly heavy
rain.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble solutions are reasonably agreeable regarding
the amplified upper-level pattern described above, but some
differences remain in question. With the positively tilted trough
in the East, the timing/movement are in question at least partly
due to the related issue of whether or not an upper low closes
off. In terms of the deterministic guidance, the 00Z ECMWF came in
with a low closing off only briefly on Friday in southeastern
Canada, after its previous runs as well as other guidance created
and kept a closed low through at least the weekend. The trough
also progresses a bit more quickly in the ECMWF for this reason,
while the 00Z UKMET is a bit faster compared to other solutions as
well. On the other hand, 00Z and 06Z GFS runs retrograde its
closed upper low westward over the Middle Mississippi/Ohio Valleys
during the weekend. The 00Z CMC appeared to be a good compromise
between the faster and slower solutions, and was able to be used
through most of the period along with the agreeable ensemble
means. Ensemble spread shows that the position/timing of the
trough and thus the front pushing slowly ahead of it remain
uncertain, but felt this was a good approach for now for the
latter part of the period, after a mainly deterministic model
blend for the beginning of the period. The general idea of upper
ridging across western parts of the U.S., with the exceptions of
the aforementioned shortwave moving across southern Canada and
additional troughing impacting the Pacific Northwest early next
week, were indicated by the majority of model guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest is expected to
be less intense by midweek as the highly anomalous upper ridge is
forecast to weaken slightly and shift eastward. Nevertheless, high
temperatures across the interior sections of the Northwest will
remain 15 to 25 degrees above normal through the holiday weekend,
and warm overnight lows should increase the heat stress to these
areas. Some possible rain showers around the Northern Rockies will
do little to break the growing drought in these areas.

Downstream, the positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the Southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. for the latter half of the week. Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms, significantly increasing rainfall and runoff potential
along and ahead of the front with an elongated and focused zone
from the Southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across the
Mid-South, Ohio Valley, and the Northeast. Episodes of cell
training and flooding are likely across some of these areas, and
the heavy rainfall axis should slowly drop southward toward the
Gulf Coast by early next week.

A heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic during the
short range period should be broken by Friday as the upper
trough/low centered over the Great Lakes directs moisture into
much of the East Coast ahead of a frontal boundary. It appears
that the East Coast will enter a period of damp/wet weather just
in time for the July 4th holiday weekend with cool daytime
temperatures and warm and humid nights. Cool days and warm nights
are expected for the Deep South as well where the heavy rain
threat continues into early next week. In contrast, dry and hot
weather will return across the Northern Plains and should continue
into early next week under the weakened but still anomalous upper
ridge.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon June 28 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 04 - 08 2021

A transitional 500-hPa geopotential height pattern is favored across North
America during the 6-10 day period, with troughing forecast to shift across
Alaska and a deamplification of the pattern downstream over the western CON=
US.
By day-10, the 0z GEFS and Canadian ensemble solutions depict more ridging
developing across the North-Central CONUS compared to the 0z ECMWF ensemble=
.
The GEFS and Canadian solutions are given more weight than usual given the
ongoing severe to exceptional drought over parts of the Northern Plains, wh=
ich
favors enhanced surface heating and associated higher mid-level heights.
Todays manual height blend favors positive height anomalies across much of =
the
western CONUS, and through the northern tier of the central and eastern CON=
US.
Near normal heights are forecast across the Central and Southern Plains,
extending through much of the Middle and Lower Mississippi, Ohio, and
Tennessee
Valleys, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast. Negative height anomalies are predict=
ed
over most of Mainland Alaska, with positive height anomalies remaining favo=
red
across portions of the Aleutians and the Panhandle.

The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools are in good agreement regarding the
temperature forecast over the CONUS and Alaska. Increased probabilities of
above normal temperatures are indicated for much of the western CONUS and
extending across the northern half of the Great Plains, Upper Mississippi
Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast. Moderate drought has expanded across
portions of the Great Lakes and Northeast, which will ultimately favor warm=
er
temperatures due to stronger surface heating. For the period as a whole,
increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast for parts of th=
e
Southern Great Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valle=
y,
and the Southeast, due to increased cloud cover and precipitation resulting
from return flow out of the Gulf of Mexico, in addition to elevated soil
moisture over these areas. The exception is over the southern Florida
Peninsula
where above normal temperature probabilities are elevated outside of the
return
flow. Troughing forecast to move across Alaska favors increased probabiliti=
es
of near to below normal temperatures across most of the state, consistent w=
ith
the consolidation forecast tool.

Enhanced ridging and positive height anomalies support increased chances of
below normal precipitation across the western CONUS, the Northern and Centr=
al
Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley. Surface high pressure forecast over t=
he
Atlantic favors anomalous southerly return flow over the east-central CONUS=
,
resulting in elevated chances of above normal precipitation, especially acr=
oss
the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley. The probabilities are hig=
her
in the ECMWF reforecast tool compared to the GEFS, since the GEFS is foreca=
st
to make a faster transition to overall ridging over the central CONUS, whic=
h
would favor drier conditions. Mid-level flow is forecast to be weaker along
the
Eastern Seaboard favoring increased chances of below normal precipitation f=
rom
coastal areas of the Northeast, southward through the Mid-Atlantic and the
Florida Peninsula. A monsoonal moisture surge still favors slightly enhance=
d
above normal precipitation probabilities across parts of southeastern Arizo=
na
and New Mexico, although todays guidance, the GEFS in particular, is
substantially less robust with the precipitation chances compared to
yesterday,
leading to a reduction in probabilities. Troughing forecast to move over
Alaska
supports an active storm track across the state, leading to increased chanc=
es
of above normal precipitation for the state

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement, offset by some differences in the mid-level height
pattern evolution over the central CONUS, and the precipitation forecast
across
southern areas.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 06 - 12 2021

The mid-level pattern is forecast to continue to favor ridging across the
north-central CONUS, with an eastward expansion of positive 500-hPa anomali=
es
across southern Canada and the northeastern CONUS. This signal is consisten=
t
with last Fridays week 3-4 outlook, and aligns with the expectation that
enhanced drought over northern sections of the CONUS favors an expansion of
the
ridge. The manual height blend depicts positive 500-hPa height anomalies
across
the northern half the CONUS, and closer to normal mid-level heights across =
the
southern tier and the Gulf of Mexico coast, where enhanced moisture flow is
still likely to persist. Troughing remains forecast across Alaska, favoring
negative height anomalies across much of the state, although weaker in
magnitude compared to the 6-10 day period.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures remain elevated over the western
CONUS and extending into the Northern and Central Great Plains. There is a
notable eastward expansion of the higher probabilities of above normal
temperatures across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic in association with the
eastward expansion of the ridge, which is supported by both the GEFS and EC=
MWF
reforecast tools. Southerly moisture flow, and associated increased cloud
cover
and precipitation, is likely to persist into week-2 across parts of the sou=
th,
which would continue to favor below normal temperatures over the Southern
Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and the Southeast
(excluding the Florida Peninsula where above normal temperature probabiliti=
es
remain elevated), although probabilities are weaker compared to the 6-10 da=
y
period. Below normal temperature probabilities remain enhanced over Alaska,=
 in
association with weak troughing over the state.

The precipitation forecast for week-2 is generally similar to the 6-10 day
outlook, with continued elevated chances of below normal precipitation acro=
ss
much of the western half of the CONUS. Continued southerly moisture flow
favors
increased chances of above normal precipitation from the Southern Plains
northeastward through the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, the Gre=
at
Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, supported by both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools. Uncertainty remains across portions of Arizona and New
Mexico
as the GEFS depicts a much weaker monsoon signal compared to the ECMWF. A
slight tilt toward higher above normal precipitation probabilities is depic=
ted
over southeastern Arizona and southern New Mexico, with near to below norma=
l
probabilities increased further north. The Florida Peninsula is forecast to=
 be
well enough displaced from the return flow, tilting the odds toward below
normal precipitation. Near to above normal precipitation probabilities rema=
in
elevated over most of Alaska, resulting from troughing and a continued stor=
m
track across the state.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement, offset by some differences in the temperature and
precipitation forecast across the Southwest CONUS.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest becomes less intense and
continues through the 4th of July weekend...

...Heavy rain is a threat along a front shifting from the
south-central U.S. to the Northeast southward to near the Gulf
Coast by the weekend...

...Overview...

The upper high/ridge causing record-breaking heat in the short
range period is forecast to shift eastward into the Northern
Plains through the weekend while weakening somewhat, as an upper
trough moves into British Columbia and across southern Canada.
Meanwhile, an upper-level trough/low is expected to meander over
the Great Lakes region and push a front slowly southward across
portions of the central and eastern U.S., causing possibly heavy
rain.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble solutions are reasonably agreeable regarding
the amplified upper-level pattern described above, but some
differences remain in question. With the positively tilted trough
in the East, the timing/movement are in question at least partly
due to the related issue of whether or not an upper low closes
off. In terms of the deterministic guidance, the 00Z ECMWF came in
with a low closing off only briefly on Friday in southeastern
Canada, after its previous runs as well as other guidance created
and kept a closed low through at least the weekend. The trough
also progresses a bit more quickly in the ECMWF for this reason,
while the 00Z UKMET is a bit faster compared to other solutions as
well. On the other hand, 00Z and 06Z GFS runs retrograde its
closed upper low westward over the Middle Mississippi/Ohio Valleys
during the weekend. The 00Z CMC appeared to be a good compromise
between the faster and slower solutions, and was able to be used
through most of the period along with the agreeable ensemble
means. Ensemble spread shows that the position/timing of the
trough and thus the front pushing slowly ahead of it remain
uncertain, but felt this was a good approach for now for the
latter part of the period, after a mainly deterministic model
blend for the beginning of the period. The general idea of upper
ridging across western parts of the U.S., with the exceptions of
the aforementioned shortwave moving across southern Canada and
additional troughing impacting the Pacific Northwest early next
week, were indicated by the majority of model guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest is expected to
be less intense by midweek as the highly anomalous upper ridge is
forecast to weaken slightly and shift eastward. Nevertheless, high
temperatures across the interior sections of the Northwest will
remain 15 to 25 degrees above normal through the holiday weekend,
and warm overnight lows should increase the heat stress to these
areas. Some possible rain showers around the Northern Rockies will
do little to break the growing drought in these areas.

Downstream, the positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the Southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. for the latter half of the week. Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms, significantly increasing rainfall and runoff potential
along and ahead of the front with an elongated and focused zone
from the Southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across the
Mid-South, Ohio Valley, and the Northeast. Episodes of cell
training and flooding are likely across some of these areas, and
the heavy rainfall axis should slowly drop southward toward the
Gulf Coast by early next week.

A heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic during the
short range period should be broken by Friday as the upper
trough/low centered over the Great Lakes directs moisture into
much of the East Coast ahead of a frontal boundary. It appears
that the East Coast will enter a period of damp/wet weather just
in time for the July 4th holiday weekend with cool daytime
temperatures and warm and humid nights. Cool days and warm nights
are expected for the Deep South as well where the heavy rain
threat continues into early next week. In contrast, dry and hot
weather will return across the Northern Plains and should continue
into early next week under the weakened but still anomalous upper
ridge.

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest becomes less intense and
continues through the 4th of July weekend...

...Heavy rain is a threat along a front shifting from the
south-central U.S. to the Northeast southward to near the Gulf
Coast by the weekend...

...Overview...

The upper high/ridge causing record-breaking heat in the short
range period is forecast to shift eastward into the Northern
Plains through the weekend while weakening somewhat, as an upper
trough moves into British Columbia and across southern Canada.
Meanwhile, an upper-level trough/low is expected to meander over
the Great Lakes region and push a front slowly southward across
portions of the central and eastern U.S., causing possibly heavy
rain.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble solutions are reasonably agreeable regarding
the amplified upper-level pattern described above, but some
differences remain in question. With the positively tilted trough
in the East, the timing/movement are in question at least partly
due to the related issue of whether or not an upper low closes
off. In terms of the deterministic guidance, the 00Z ECMWF came in
with a low closing off only briefly on Friday in southeastern
Canada, after its previous runs as well as other guidance created
and kept a closed low through at least the weekend. The trough
also progresses a bit more quickly in the ECMWF for this reason,
while the 00Z UKMET is a bit faster compared to other solutions as
well. On the other hand, 00Z and 06Z GFS runs retrograde its
closed upper low westward over the Middle Mississippi/Ohio Valleys
during the weekend. The 00Z CMC appeared to be a good compromise
between the faster and slower solutions, and was able to be used
through most of the period along with the agreeable ensemble
means. Ensemble spread shows that the position/timing of the
trough and thus the front pushing slowly ahead of it remain
uncertain, but felt this was a good approach for now for the
latter part of the period, after a mainly deterministic model
blend for the beginning of the period. The general idea of upper
ridging across western parts of the U.S., with the exceptions of
the aforementioned shortwave moving across southern Canada and
additional troughing impacting the Pacific Northwest early next
week, were indicated by the majority of model guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest is expected to
be less intense by midweek as the highly anomalous upper ridge is
forecast to weaken slightly and shift eastward. Nevertheless, high
temperatures across the interior sections of the Northwest will
remain 15 to 25 degrees above normal through the holiday weekend,
and warm overnight lows should increase the heat stress to these
areas. Some possible rain showers around the Northern Rockies will
do little to break the growing drought in these areas.

Downstream, the positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the Southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. for the latter half of the week. Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms, significantly increasing rainfall and runoff potential
along and ahead of the front with an elongated and focused zone
from the Southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across the
Mid-South, Ohio Valley, and the Northeast. Episodes of cell
training and flooding are likely across some of these areas, and
the heavy rainfall axis should slowly drop southward toward the
Gulf Coast by early next week.

A heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic during the
short range period should be broken by Friday as the upper
trough/low centered over the Great Lakes directs moisture into
much of the East Coast ahead of a frontal boundary. It appears
that the East Coast will enter a period of damp/wet weather just
in time for the July 4th holiday weekend with cool daytime
temperatures and warm and humid nights. Cool days and warm nights
are expected for the Deep South as well where the heavy rain
threat continues into early next week. In contrast, dry and hot
weather will return across the Northern Plains and should continue
into early next week under the weakened but still anomalous upper
ridge.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Mon Jun 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

Portions of the isolated dry thunderstorm area across southern
Nevada have been trimmed, as consensus among high-resolution
guidance members depict merging thunderstorm clusters that will have
a higher propensity to produce wetting rainfall amid 0.90-1.0 inch
precipitable water values. Previous to thunderstorm cluster-growth,
more isolated cells are expected across northern/central Nevada
towards the Sierra, farther from the deeper mid-level moisture, and
where a relatively greater potential for dry strikes exist.

Dry, easterly surface winds are expected to the lee of the Cascades
in eastern Oregon towards the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho
given thermally-induced surface troughing due to 90-100F afternoon
temperatures. Despite 15-20% surface RH in place, sustained surface
winds are expected to remain below 15 mph on a widespread basis,
precluding Elevated highlights this outlook. Elevated highlights may
be introduced in the Day 1 outlook should guidance trend windier.

..Squitieri.. 06/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0217 AM CDT Mon Jun 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level anticyclone centered over southwest Canada during
the previous few days will move east a bit on Tuesday, with the
mid-level ridge focused across the Intermountain West. This will
allow for onshore flow to occur across western portions of the
Pacific Northwest, reducing afternoon temperatures from  the
historic highs of the past few days. However, given the large-scale
mid-level height pattern, above-normal temperatures will remain.

... Sierra Mountains and the southern Great Basin ...

Increasing mid-level moisture along the western periphery of a large
anticyclone will combine with strong diurnal heating to support
isolated to scattered thunderstorms on Tuesday. Despite slow-moving
storms, a dry sub-cloud layer stemming from deep vertical mixing
will support at least some isolated dry thunderstorms. Furthermore,
given very receptive fuels stemming from the long-term drought,
lightning-induced fire starts will be possible with any
thunderstorms, especially with lightning on the periphery of the
main precipitation cores.

...Record-shattering heat forecast across the Northwest with
cooler temperatures finally entering areas west of the Cascades by
Tuesday...

...Additional rounds of heavy rain and flash flooding likely over
the Southern High Plains today...

...Flash flooding threat continues from the Midwest to the
Southern Plains through Tuesday, including parts of southwest
Louisiana and the Upper Texas Coast...

...Above average temperatures and oppressive heat found across the
Northeast early this week, while well below average temperatures
continue across much of the Southern Rockies/Plains...

Additional oppressive heat is expected across the Pacific
Northwest today, before the core of the unprecedented heat shifts
into interior sections of the region on Tuesday and Wednesday.
High temperatures are forecast to soar 30+ degrees above average
throughout Washington and north-central Oregon to start the
workweek, with temperatures peaking in the 100s and 110s. Numerous
daily, monthly, and all-time temperature records are forecast on
top of the records that went up in flames this weekend. To put it
in perspective, Portland and Seattle broke their all-time high
yesterday with high temperatures of 104 and 112 degrees,
respectively. This level of heat is extremely dangerous and can be
deadly if proper heat safety is not followed. Low temperatures are
expected to remain very warm and in the mid-70s, which can make it
even more difficult to stay cool. Excessive Heat Warnings have
been issued throughout most of the Northwest, Northern Great
Basin, as well as parts of western Nevada and interior California.
Residents are urged to stay in air-conditioned buildings, avoid
strenuous outdoor activities, drink plenty of water, and check on
family members/neighbors. Cooler temperatures associated with a
cold front and onshore winds are forecast to enter areas west of
the Cascades by Tuesday, but extreme heat will remain and build
farther inland across the Northern Great Basin this week.
Additional high temperature records are a guarantee for interior
sections of Washington and Oregon over the next few days,
extending into most of Idaho and western Montana on Tuesday.

For the central U.S., showers and thunderstorms will pose a threat
of flash flooding once again today and linger through midweek. A
stationary boundary bisecting the country from the Lower Great
Lakes to West Texas will be the focus for thunderstorm activity
and intense rainfall rates. The Southern High Plains in particular
are forecast to have the greatest chances of significant flash
flooding. A Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of Excessive Rainfall has
been issued through Tuesday morning across southeast New Mexico
and parts of West Texas, where widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to
5 inches are possible over previously saturated land. Farther
east, slow-moving thunderstorms may also lead to flash flooding
between central Oklahoma and northern Illinois. Much of this
region has dealt with numerous instances of heavy rain and
flooding over the last week; therefore, any additional downpours
could lead to flash flooding. A Slight Risk (level 2/4) of
excessive rainfall is in effect today from the Chicago Metro
extending southwest through Oklahoma City to the Red River. Little
change to the pattern is expected through tomorrow, and a Slight
Risk of excessive rain is in effect on Tuesday over Southeast New
Mexico, and Northern Oklahoma through Southeast Kansas with
additional thunderstorm development forecast.

Not to be outdone, tropical showers with efficient rainfall rates
are also possible throughout the Upper Texas Coast and Southwest
Louisiana today and Tuesday. Thunderstorms here will have the
capability of producing 2 to locally 4 inches of rain in a short
amount of time atop a flood sensitive area. An additional Slight
Risk area extends along the coast, including the Houston Metro,
until tomorrow morning.

Meanwhile, newly named Tropical Storm Danny is just offshore the
southern South Carolina coast, approximately 45 miles SSE of
Charleston, per the National Hurricane Center. By this evening,
Danny is forecast to move inland, producing tropical storm
conditions as it makes landfall. Tropical Storm Warnings arc from
the coastal South Carolina-Georgia border northward to the central
South Carolina coast and slightly inland, including areas
north/northwest of Charleston through late tonight/early tomorrow
morning. Maximum sustained winds near 40 mph are currently
estimated from Doppler RADAR and Air Force Reserve reconnaissance
aircraft. In addition to the wind near the coast, some heavy
rainfall is possible from coastal South Carolina and Georgia
inland over East-Central Georgia and all but Northwest South
Carolina, although widespread flood issues are not anticipated.
Fortunately, Danny is forecast to quickly weaken to a depression
by Tuesday morning as it treks northwest toward north Georgia.

The northwest corner of the country isn't the only place dealing
with oppressive heat this week. While not nearly as extreme, parts
of New England and the Northeast are expected to experience hot
and muggy weather through Wednesday as a Bermuda high pressure
system ushers consistent southerly winds up the East Coast. High
temperatures are forecast to reach the low-to-mid 90s from
Virginia to Maine, with heat indices into the triple digits. Heat
Advisories have been issued between Delaware and Maine, with a
subset of cities including Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Trenton
under an Excessive Heat warning from Tuesday to Wednesday. The
opposite is true for the Southern Rockies and Southern Plains,
where much below average temperatures are expected to remain
through at least Wednesday. Cloud cover and showers are forecast
to keep high temperatures in the 70s, which equates to 20-30
degrees below average.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 AM CDT Tue Jun 29 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
Beneath a record strength mid-level anticyclone, extremely warm and
dry conditions are expected to continue across the Pacific Northwest
and northern Rockies. To the west, a shortwave trough will approach
the coast of California, spreading lift and mid-level moisture
inland across the Great Basin. Showers and thunderstorms will
overspread much of the West, with isolated potential for lightning
strikes in dry fuels across the Great Basin and Southwest.

...Southern Great Basin and the Sierra...
As mid-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and eastern pacific
continue to spread north across the Southwest, lift from the
approaching western trough will overspread the region through the
day. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are forecast to form, first
on the higher terrain, before spread out with time. Model forecast
soundings show high PWATs, (0.7-1.1 inches across Arizona and New
Mexico, into western Colorado. A slightly drier airmass to the north
and west suggests a mixed mode of dry/west storms are possible.
Regardless of state, sufficient buoyancy (250-500 J/kg of MUCAPE)
should support isolated to widely scattered lightning strikes from
eastern California through the Great Basin and central Rockies.
Record dry fuels will be susceptible to lightning ignitions
necessitating dry thunder probabilities. The most likely corridor
for dry strikes will be at the northern and western fringes of the
moisture surge, where a more deeply mixed boundary-layer will better
support inefficient precipitation processes.

...Pacific Northwest...
Hot, dry, and unstable conditions are expected beneath the axis of
the mid-level ridge through the day, suggesting increased potential
for plume-dominated fire weather risks. The strong heating will
generate a thermal trough, which may also locally enhance surface
winds to 15 mph. Surface RH below 25% is expected, likely supporting
locally elevated fire weather conditions through the afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0132 AM CDT Tue Jun 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
High pressure will remain firmly entrenched across the Pacific
Northwest and North Rockies Day2/Wednesday, as the block remains
over the western CONUS. The strong heating at the surface will
support the development of a thermal low/trough, enhancing surface
winds from Washington state southward into northern California.
Moisture surging north across the Great Basin and Intermountain West
will again support isolated thunderstorm development through the
afternoon.

...Central/Northern Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest...
On the southern fringes of the mid-level ridge, weak ascent will
overspread mid-level moisture across the Great Basin and Southwest.
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop by
midday and increase in coverage with time. Model soundings show
steep low-level lapse rates beneath the moisture plume, suggesting
the potential for dry lightning strikes over receptive fuels. Storm
coverage is forecast to be slightly greater than Day 1, providing
better potential for wetting rains. This appears most likely over
western Colorado and eastern Utah where higher PWAT values near 1
inch are forecast. However, a few dry strikes may still develop,
with greater coverage of dry lightning expected across Nevada,
Oregon, and Idaho where Isolated dry thunder probabilities have been
added.

...Pacific Northwest...
Very strong heating beneath the mid-level high will support the
development of a thermal low/trough through much of the day across
portions of the Northwest. High-res guidance shows increased surface
pressure falls may locally enhance surface winds to 15 mph from mid
morning to sunset. With extremely warm temperatures, surface
humidity below 30% is expected. Locally elevated/critical fire
weather conditions may occur where fuels are dry.

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest becomes less intense and
continues through the 4th of July weekend...

...Heavy rain could impact portions of the Deep South, Southeast
and the East Coast ahead of an upper-level trough late this week
and through the weekend...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Global models continue to show a great deal of uncertainty in
predicting the details associated with a positively-tilted trough
over the northeastern portion of the country through the medium
range period.  Model guidance has split into two camps since
yesterday as the GFS now tends to close off an upper low over the
Ohio Valley while the ECMWF tends to lift the trough faster into
eastern Canada during the weekend.  The CMC on the other hand,
adopted an intermediate solution.  The ensemble means are more
agreeable with one another--which basically lift an amplified
positively-tilted trough very slowly across the Northeast.  This
pattern would generally bring damp/wet weather into the East Coast
by the holiday weekend but with important details yet to be
resolved.  Somewhat more certain is that the threat of heavy rain
ahead of a cold front should push southward across the Deep South
through the weekend.  Meanwhile, areas of heavy rainfall are also
possible along the East Coast but they will depend on the
uncertain details associated with the interaction between the
positively-tilted trough and the frontal boundary.

The guidance is much more agreeable in predicting the slow
weakening and eastward progression of the anomalous upper ridge
over the Northwest and into the northern Plains.

Given the uncertainties in the eastern U.S., the medium-range
forecasts put more weights on the ensemble means than usual, and
were based on the consensus of the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, 18Z
GFS/GEFS, and the 12Z CMC/CMC mean.  This solution yielded fairly
good continuity with the previous WPC forecasts.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest is expected to
be less intense but triple-digit heat is forecast for each
afternoon across the interior section through the holiday weekend
and into early next week.  Meanwhile, the heat is expected to
spread into the northern Plains and continue into next week as
afternoon temperatures could reach the century mark at some
locations.  Some rain showers over the northern Rockies may offer
slight relief to the heat but they will do little to ease the
growing drought concern in these areas.  Farther south, some
late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are expected
each day over the central to southern Rockies through the medium
range period.

Meanwhile, a heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic
during the short range period should be broken by Friday as the
upper trough/low centered over the Great Lakes directs moisture
into much of the East Coast ahead of a frontal boundary.  It
appears that the East Coast will enter a period of damp/wet
weather just in time for the July 4th holiday weekend with cool
daytime temperatures and warm and humid nights.  Areas of heavy
rain could also move into the East Coast late this week ahead of
the front but they will depend on the details of the trough-front
interactions that are yet to be resolved by models.  Cool days and
warm nights are expected for the Deep South as well where the
heavy rain threat continues into early next week.  Episodes of
cell training and flooding are likely across some of these areas.
This will be in stark contrast with the dry and hot weather
expected to persist over the northern Plains through the medium
range period.

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest becomes less intense and
continues through the 4th of July weekend...

...Heavy rain could impact portions of the Deep South, Southeast
and the East Coast ahead of an upper-level trough late this week
and through the weekend...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Global models continue to show a great deal of uncertainty in
predicting the details associated with a positively-tilted trough
over the northeastern portion of the country through the medium
range period.  Model guidance has split into two camps since
yesterday as the GFS now tends to close off an upper low over the
Ohio Valley while the ECMWF tends to lift the trough faster into
eastern Canada during the weekend.  The CMC on the other hand,
adopted an intermediate solution.  The ensemble means are more
agreeable with one another--which basically lift an amplified
positively-tilted trough very slowly across the Northeast.  This
pattern would generally bring damp/wet weather into the East Coast
by the holiday weekend but with important details yet to be
resolved.  Somewhat more certain is that the threat of heavy rain
ahead of a cold front should push southward across the Deep South
through the weekend.  Meanwhile, areas of heavy rainfall are also
possible along the East Coast but they will depend on the
uncertain details associated with the interaction between the
positively-tilted trough and the frontal boundary.

The guidance is much more agreeable in predicting the slow
weakening and eastward progression of the anomalous upper ridge
over the Northwest and into the northern Plains.

Given the uncertainties in the eastern U.S., the medium-range
forecasts put more weights on the ensemble means than usual, and
were based on the consensus of the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, 18Z
GFS/GEFS, and the 12Z CMC/CMC mean.  This solution yielded fairly
good continuity with the previous WPC forecasts.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest is expected to
be less intense but triple-digit heat is forecast for each
afternoon across the interior section through the holiday weekend
and into early next week.  Meanwhile, the heat is expected to
spread into the northern Plains and continue into next week as
afternoon temperatures could reach the century mark at some
locations.  Some rain showers over the northern Rockies may offer
slight relief to the heat but they will do little to ease the
growing drought concern in these areas.  Farther south, some
late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are expected
each day over the central to southern Rockies through the medium
range period.

Meanwhile, a heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic
during the short range period should be broken by Friday as the
upper trough/low centered over the Great Lakes directs moisture
into much of the East Coast ahead of a frontal boundary.  It
appears that the East Coast will enter a period of damp/wet
weather just in time for the July 4th holiday weekend with cool
daytime temperatures and warm and humid nights.  Areas of heavy
rain could also move into the East Coast late this week ahead of
the front but they will depend on the details of the trough-front
interactions that are yet to be resolved by models.  Cool days and
warm nights are expected for the Deep South as well where the
heavy rain threat continues into early next week.  Episodes of
cell training and flooding are likely across some of these areas.
This will be in stark contrast with the dry and hot weather
expected to persist over the northern Plains through the medium
range period.

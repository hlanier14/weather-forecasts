...Much below temperatures across the Central U.S. will continue
this week but should finally moderate back towards normal by next
weekend...

...Moderate to heavy precipitation expected across much of the
East Thursday into Friday...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

An amplified pattern across the CONUS the first half of the medium
range period will be replaced by a welcomed change to a flatter
more zonal upper level pattern by next weekend. This pattern shift
would allow for a moderation in temperatures across much of the
lower 48 and less active storm systems. In the meantime though, a
prevailing amplified mean trough over the Central U.S. on Thursday
will shift into the Eastern U.S. by Friday. The associated low
pressure/frontal system will emerge from the Gulf and race into
the East. A widespread area of moderate to heavy precipitation
(snow to the north, rain to the south) is likely from the central
Gulf Coast into the Northeast Thursday into Friday. A series of
fronts should also keep the Northwest active through much of the
period.

The troughing entering the East by Friday shows very good
agreement in the models with only minor timing differences (UKMET
slower than the consensus) so a blend of the deterministic
GFS/ECMWF/CMC sufficed. The next system entering the Pacific
Northwest this weekend exhibits a bit more variability in the
guidance, especially as the shortwave shifts into the central U.S.
early next week. The ECMWF is on the faster side of the spread,
with the CMC a bit more amplified/slower. The latest run of the
GFS lies somewhere in the middle, and has support from the
generally agreeable (albeit a bit washed out) ensemble means.
Therefore, WPC prefers a majority blend of the ensemble means
beyond day 5, with smaller contributions from the GFS just to
maintain some degree of system definition. This also maintains
good continuity with the previous shift.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Heavy precipitation will accompany the East system as it lifts
from the Gulf into the Northeast late this week. Wintry
precipitation on the northern side of the precipitation shield
will be ongoing as the medium range period begins Thursday, with
the greatest chance for significant snowfall Thursday into Friday
from the Ohio Valley into the interior Northeast. To the south,
moderate to heavy rainfall is likely across portions of the
Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic, with some ice/sleet possible
in between the rain and snow areas. Of course, the
rain/snow/wintry mix transition zones will continue to be refined
in the coming days. Also to note, SPC continues to mention the
severe weather potential, particularly for portions of the central
Gulf Coast where moisture and instability parameters are expected
to be most favorable.

Behind this system, another couple fronts reaching the Northwest
between Thursday and Saturday should bring the potential for
additional focused rainfall along coastal portions of
Washington/Oregon with heavy mountain snows in the
Washington/Oregon Cascades and northern Rockies. Meaningful
rain/high elevation snow may extend into parts of northern
California as well.

For temperatures, much below normal temperatures are expected to
persist through this week from the southern Plains and
northeastward, but finally should moderate back towards normal by
early next week as a less amplified pattern settles in across the
contiguous U.S.. Out West, temperatures should also trend warmer,
especially over the Southwest where highs may reach 5-10F or so
above normal Sunday into Monday, with above normal temperatures
also possible across parts of the Northern Plains. Warmer than
average temperatures across Florida/the Southeast will continue
into Thursday, but below normal temperatures should eventually
spread into the Sunshine State by Friday/Saturday after passage of
the front anchored by the system affecting much of the East.

...Over 150 million Americans are currently under Winter Storm
Warnings, Ice Storm Warnings, Winter Storm Watches, or Winter
Weather Advisories as impactful winter weather continues from
coast-to-coast...

...Major winter storm to spread heavy snow and significant ice
accumulations from the Southern Plains and Ohio Valley to the
Northeast...

...Additional winter weather is expected for the Northwest this
morning, spreading south and east through Tuesday...

...Frigid Arctic air and dangerously cold wind chills to persist
in the Heartland through a good part of the week...

...Severe thunderstorms, heavy rain, and warm temperatures are
expected for southern Georgia and Florida...

An unprecedented and expansive area of hazardous winter weather
continues into Presidents Day as disruptive snow and ice
accumulations transpire across the South Central U.S. early this
morning. This impressive onslaught of wicked wintry weather across
much of the Lower 48 is due to the combination of strong Arctic
high pressure supplying sub-freezing temperatures and an active
storm track escorting waves of precipitation from coast-to-coast.
While the current areas of snow and wintry mix over parts of the
Southern Plains will conclude later this morning, bitterly cold
temperatures will limit the amount of melting today, and thus
treacherous travel conditions are likely to persist. Heavy snow
and freezing rain are forecast to advance northeastward today from
the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys to the Northeast. A large swath
of 6 to 12 inches of snow is forecast from the Ohio Valley and
eastern Great Lakes to northern New England. South of the heavy
snow axis, freezing rain is expected to cause a plethora of
problems with over a tenth of an inch of ice in the forecast from
far east Texas northeastward to southern New England. Significant
ice amounts of a quarter to a half inch are expected in portions
of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Mid-South leading to
dangerous travel conditions, numerous power outages, and extensive
tree damage. Precipitation will likely stay rain for the southern
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast where cold air is more limited.

In the West, another surge of Pacific moisture is accompanying a
frontal system forecast to make landfall along the Pacific
Northwest coast this morning. More wintry weather is possible in
lower elevations of the Pacific Northwest, while locally heavy
rain could create localized flooding issues in far southwestern
Oregon and far northwestern California early this morning. Farther
inland, the Great Basin and Intermountain West can expect more
rounds of higher elevation snowfall with the more intense snowfall
rates occurring on Presidents Day. Snowfall accumulations
forecasts through Tuesday suggests 1 to 2 feet is likely in the
Cascades and Northern Rockies through Tuesday (localized totals
over 3 feet are possible), with measurable snow extending into the
Wind River Mountains/Tetons, Wasatch, and Central/Southern Rockies
as well. Avalanches remain a big concern in portions of Utah. This
storm system is expected to be the next winter storm to impact the
South Central U.S. mid-week.

The aforementioned Arctic high across the central U.S. is forecast
to slowly moderate as the week progresses, but still maintain a
firm and icy grip over the Heartland to open the week.
Teeth-chattering cold temperatures are expected to continue
between the Rockies and Appalachians through Tuesday with lows in
the -20s and -10s for the Northern/Central Plains and Upper/Middle
Mississippi Valley. Temperature anomalies are likely to be 25 to
45 degrees below normal for much of the central and southern
Plains today with a carbon-copy of similar anomalies expected
again on Tuesday. In addition, Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories
reach as far south as the Southern Plains and as far east as the
Ohio Valley. Hundreds of daily low maximum and minimum
temperatures have been/will be broken during this prolonged "polar
plunge", with some February and even all-time low temperature
records in jeopardy.

Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms are ongoing across parts of
the Southeast near and along a stationary front. Severe
thunderstorms are in the forecast today in southern Georgia and
into the Florida peninsula where a Slight Risk of severe weather
is in place courtesy of the Storm Prediction Center.
Moderate-to-heavy rainfall across portions of Florida, Georgia,
and the eastern Carolinas is anticipated Monday afternoon and
evening. Florida will remains the warm spot in the CONUS with
highs above normal and generally in the 80s. A few daily record
high temperatures may be challenged in localized areas of the
Sunshine State this afternoon.

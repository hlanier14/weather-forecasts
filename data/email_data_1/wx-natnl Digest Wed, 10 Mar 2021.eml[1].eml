Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1039 AM CST Tue Mar 09 2021

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN
PANHANDLES REGION...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR SOUTHWESTERN NEW
MEXICO...

Much of the previous forecast remains on track. A few small
modifications were made to the Elevated/Critical delineations to
reflect the latest model guidance consensus. Similar to yesterday,
mid/high level clouds are present across the southwest and southern
High Plains (evident via visible satellite imagery) and these clouds
are expected to continue overspreading the region through the
afternoon. Despite the cloud shield present, METAR observations show
RH rapidly decreasing from southern New Mexico to the Oklahoma
Panhandle/Kansas area. Additional boundary layer heating will
promote this surface drying trend to continue through the afternoon,
given that the depth of the drier air extends up to 500 mb (per 12Z
ABQ, AMA, and EPZ observed soundings). As such, widespread Elevated
to Critical conditions will still likely be realized across much of
the southern High Plains, with fire weather highlights remaining in
place.

Farther north, a cold front is currently sagging southward across
far northwest Nebraska, ushering in drier air across portions of the
northern Plains. Based on METAR observations over the last few
hours, the cold front is poised to move across the Elevated area
during the afternoon, when diurnal heating will encourage further
boundary-layer mixing behind the cold front. As such, Elevated fire
weather conditions are still likely across much of western Nebraska.

Lastly, high pressure continues to slowly meander out towards the
Atlantic, with residual dry surface air, characterized by 25-40% RH,
remaining in place across portions of the southeast towards the Mid
Atlantic. While finer fuels remain modestly receptive to wildfire
spread, the lack of stronger winds continues to preclude fire
weather highlights across the eastern U.S.

..Squitieri.. 03/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1247 AM CST Tue Mar 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery shows a broad longwave trough off
the West Coast with an embedded shortwave approaching the southern
CA coast. This feature will progress eastward through the day and
eject out over the southern/central High Plains this afternoon. As a
result, lee troughing/cyclogenesis is expected and will increase
southwesterly downslope winds off the southern Rockies. The
combination of increasing winds and warm, dry conditions will
support elevated to critical fire weather concerns for the southern
High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Breezy conditions are noted in recent surface observations across
west TX and eastern NM along a diffuse lee trough axis. Winds will
likely strengthen to 15-25 mph along the southern High Plains by mid
afternoon as increasing zonal flow aloft promotes further surface
pressure falls. Diurnal heating/boundary-layer mixing should allow
downward transport of stronger mid-level flow and wind gusts up to
30-40 mph where skies can remain sufficiently clear (though the
spatial extent of cloud cover is somewhat uncertain). Recent
guidance has trended towards slightly higher humidity across
east-central NM, which may be due to higher dewpoints across this
region and immediately upstream. As such, the northern critical risk
area has been reduced in southern extent to mainly the greater
OK/north TX Panhandles region where drier conditions are observed
and confidence in RH near or below 15% is highest.

To the south, 00Z EPZ and TUS soundings show very dry boundary
layers with surface relative humidity near 10%. Recent guidance has
also trended towards stronger mid-level flow over southern NM, which
will support a higher probability of winds over 20 mph. Critical
conditions appear likely for at least a few hours across this
region, but may be conditional on at least partly cloudy (or
clearer) skies to allow for sufficient boundary-layer heating and
mixing to realize the stronger flow aloft.

...Nebraska...
Elevated conditions remain likely behind a surface trough/weak
cold-frontal passage this afternoon across far southern SD and
western NE. Weak cold advection will likely be offset by diurnal
heating and allow RH values to fall into the low 20s. Meanwhile, a
tightening pressure gradient in the vicinity of the deepening low
should allow for winds in the 15-20 mph range. Dry fine fuels across
the region will help support the fire weather potential.

...Southeast and Carolinas...
The latest fuel analyses continue to show a drying trend in 10-hour
and 100-hour fuels across portions of the Southeast and western
Carolinas. Afternoon RH will likely fall into the low 20s (and
perhaps upper teens) once again this afternoon. However, persistent
surface high pressure and weak winds will mitigate most fire weather
concerns.

...Late week/weekend heavy rain threat from the south-central
Plains to the Lower Ohio Valley...
...Late week/weekend heavy snow threat increasing over the central
Rockies and High Plains...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A robust upper trough with embedded closed low will track slowly
across the Southwest and into the Plains where surface
cyclogenesis appears increasingly likely.  This system will
support areas of enhanced rain and higher elevation snow over the
southern Great Basin/Southwest and a favorable system track,
deformation, and several days of fairly strong upslope flow
suggest increasing potential for a significant heavy snow event
with focus over the central Rockies and High Plains.

Models and their ensembles have progressively trended toward more
vigorous interaction between the upper trough exiting the
Southwest and the pre-existing stationary front across the central
Plains.  This has led to the heaviest rainfall to shift westward
along and north of the stationary front with less rain forecast
for the Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley.  The
increased dynamic interaction has also led to an increasing chance
for heavy snowfall from the Front Range to the central High Plains
through the weekend.  The chance of snow has also increased
farther north into the northern Plains.  Nevertheless, models
continue to show significant run-to-run variations regarding the
details of the cyclogenesis and the cyclone's subsequent
downstream track and intensity.  The WPC forecast package was
based on the consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 06Z GFS/06Z
GEFS with a small from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  This takes the
system slowly eastward across the Plains early next week.  This
scenario agrees fairly well with the latest (12Z) from the GFS and
the ECMWF.

Behind this system, there is an emerging model signal for another
upper trough to dig southeastward through the western U.S. early
next week.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The system tracking through the Southwest and into the Plains
should produce the heaviest snow over the central Rockies and High
Plains toward the end of the week through the weekend, after first
producing areas of locally enhanced to possibly heavy rain/higher
elevation snow over the Great Basin/Southwest late this week.  In
general, the guidance signals are getting stronger for the
potential of a significant central Rockies/High Plains heavy snow
event, together with the tendency for the snow to extend farther
northeastward over the north-central U.S. and Midwest from late
weekend into early next week depending on system intensity and
track.

Model/ensemble consensus continues to highlight an area from the
south-central Plains into the Lower Ohio Valley for highest
rainfall totals during the period. Late this week into the weekend
there will be a persistent flow of Gulf moisture into a front that
stalls over the south-central Plains/Mississippi Valley while the
rest of the front crosses the East. Arrival of height falls aloft
from the Southwest and associated surface system will provide
reinforcement for heavy rainfall potential later in the
weekend/early next week. Meanwhile the Storm Prediction Center is
monitoring the threat for severe thunderstorms over and a little
east of the Southern Plains. Check the latest outlooks for more
information as severe weather details come into clearer focus.

Expect the Northwest to see an increase of rain/mountain snow and
a cooling trend by the weekend into early next week with the
arrival of an upper trough and cold front. The details of timing,
coverage, and amounts are uncertain at this time given guidance
spread for specifics of the upper trough.

...Late week/weekend heavy rain threat from the south-central
Plains to the Lower Ohio Valley...
...Late week/weekend heavy snow threat increasing over the central
Rockies and High Plains...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A robust upper trough with embedded closed low will track slowly
across the Southwest and into the Plains where surface
cyclogenesis appears increasingly likely.  This system will
support areas of enhanced rain and higher elevation snow over the
southern Great Basin/Southwest and a favorable system track,
deformation, and several days of fairly strong upslope flow
suggest increasing potential for a significant heavy snow event
with focus over the central Rockies and High Plains.

Models and their ensembles have progressively trended toward more
vigorous interaction between the upper trough exiting the
Southwest and the pre-existing stationary front across the central
Plains.  This has led to the heaviest rainfall to shift westward
along and north of the stationary front with less rain forecast
for the Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley.  The
increased dynamic interaction has also led to an increasing chance
for heavy snowfall from the Front Range to the central High Plains
through the weekend.  The chance of snow has also increased
farther north into the northern Plains.  Nevertheless, models
continue to show significant run-to-run variations regarding the
details of the cyclogenesis and the cyclone's subsequent
downstream track and intensity.  The WPC forecast package was
based on the consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 06Z GFS/06Z
GEFS with a small from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  This takes the
system slowly eastward across the Plains early next week.  This
scenario agrees fairly well with the latest (12Z) from the GFS and
the ECMWF.

Behind this system, there is an emerging model signal for another

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST March 09 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is likely to promote below normal
temperatures
and elevate chances for hazardous cold across portions of the Rockies, and the
Central and Southern Plains during early week-2. Surface low development may
trigger heavy precipitation over parts of the southeastern lower-48. Over
Alaska, wetter and colder than average conditions are possible over portions
of
the western Mainland during week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Rockies, and
Central and Southern Plains, Wed-Thu, Mar 17-18.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Rockies,
Central
and Southern Plains, and the Great Basin, Wed-Fri, Mar 17-19.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Lower Mississippi, Ohio
and
Tennessee Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and the Southeast, Wed-Fri, Mar
17-19.

Flooding possible for portions of the Ohio River Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 12 - TUESDAY MARCH 16:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!tJkfuPAzGBdM7ORLRFefgMxSAX-4H0g9pyPQVGgXbdtpzJu-1jXyX8gs3PRWAIQzl8uVILa7$

FOR WEDNESDAY MARCH 17 - TUESDAY MARCH 23: During early week-2, there is fair
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF 500-hPa height ensemble mean anomalies
which feature anomalous troughing throughout much of the western CONUS, and
downstream anomalous ridging over the eastern CONUS. Relative to yesterday's
guidance, the ECMWF favors the development of a more amplified trough over the
West, with stronger negative mid-level height departures centered over the
central Rockies and High Plains by the start of the outlook period. As both
models favor the longwave trough to gradually weaken and lift out over the
northeastern CONUS, a key change seen in the 6z GEFS and 0z ECMWF is the
development of positive mid-level height departures over the western CONUS,
with more amplified troughing upstream over the northeastern Pacific. Should
these mid-level features continue to shift eastward, this would help lead to a
faster moderation of below-normal temperatures across portions of the western
and central CONUS, but also increase the risk for precipitation related
hazards
over the West Coast later in the period.



With mid-level troughing forecast to be in place across much of the central
and
western CONUS early in week-2, both the GEFS and the ECMWF reforecast tools
depict a large coverage of elevated probabilities (>20%) of minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below freezing, with higher
chances (>40%) concentrated over the central and southern Rockies and High
Plains. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures remains issued for
much
of the Rockies and Plains from Mar 17 to 19, but is expanded slightly westward
to include portions of the Great Basin and the Southwest relative to
yesterday's outlook. Additionally, a moderate risk of much below normal
temperatures from Mar 17 to 18 is added over parts of the Rockies and High
Plains due to better agreement in today's reforecast tools and heavy snow
forecast in the region during week-1 to help sustain below-normal temperatures
into the outlook period. Temperatures are expected to moderate later in week-2
as the anomalous troughing aloft is anticipated to weaken.



Models continue to advertise surface low pressure ejecting out of the Rockies
and tracking across the Great Plains during early week-2. While there is much
ensemble spread relative to the track and strength of the surface low, there
is
better support in today's raw GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means and deterministic
solutions, compared to yesterday,  regarding elevated risk of heavy
precipitation over the southeastern CONUS. There is also better agreement
amongst the reforecast tools compared to yesterday, as both the GEFS and ECMWF
indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation accumulations exceeding
the 85th percentile and 1 inch. Thus, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is
maintained for Mar 17 to 19, and is expanded to include portions of the Lower
Mississippi Valley and central Florida. In the Ohio Valley, river flooding
continues to be a concern, as precipitation is forecast to be well above-
normal
over the lower Midwest during week-1. Although slightly drier conditions are
expected during week-2, any increase in precipitation during week-2 may
exacerbate river levels. Therefore a possible flooding area remains issued for
the region.



Farther west, the aforementioned eastward progression of an amplified trough
over the northeastern Pacific and associated onshore flow would favor
increased
chances for above-normal precipitation over portions of the West Coast by the
middle of the outlook period. Probabilities in today's GEFS reforecast tool
are
now supportive of heavy precipitation potential across portions of California.
The ECMWF reforecast tool, however, has since backed off of this potential.
The
raw GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means also indicate lower precipitation amounts
today compared to yesterday's guidance. Given these model disparities and
uncertainty at this lead, no precipitation hazards are posted but this region
will continue to be monitored in upcoming outlooks.



Over Alaska, there is significant disagreement between the GEFS and the ECMWF
week-2 mean 500-hPa height anomalies and the reforecast tools regarding the
potential for hazardous temperature and precipitation. While the GEFS favors
colder and wetter conditions across portions of the western Mainland, tied to
anomalous troughing over the Bering Strait, there is still insufficient
confidence to post any related hazards at this time.

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN INTO
CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

The forecast remains primarily on track. Eastward expansions to the
Elevated/Critical highlights have been made to account for the
latest guidance consensus. Questions remain regarding the exact
placement and timing of the cold front across northern Kansas into
northeast Colorado, though most guidance (with the exception of the
12Z ECMWF) is in reasonable agreement keeping the front along or
north of I-70, delineating the northward bounds of the Elevated
area. Portions of northeast Colorado into central Kansas have
received up to 0.50 inches of rainfall within the past week.
However, multiple preceding days of dry and breezy conditions have
primed some of the finer fuels to be more receptive of fire spread.
Farther southwest into southwest Kansas, southeast Colorado, and the
Texas Panhandle into eastern New Mexico, RH may drop below 10% in
some places by afternoon peak heating. Given overlapping 25-30 mph
sustained westerly surface winds (with higher gusts possible),
portions of the southern High Plains within the Critical area may
experience brief high-end Critical conditions by mid afternoon.

Along the East Coast, dry surface conditions (i.e. 25-40% RH) are
expected to linger along the lee of the Blue Ridge mountains
tomorrow afternoon. As in previous days, fire weather highlights
have been withheld given weak surface winds.

..Squitieri.. 03/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CST Tue Mar 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
A belt of stronger 60-85 mph upper-level flow is forecast to
overspread the southern Rockies/High Plains Wednesday as a broad
upper-level trough, currently situated off the West Coast,
progresses inland. While the residual lee trough from Tuesday may
migrate eastward early in the day, surface pressure falls along the
lee of the Rockies will anchor the trough over the CO/KS border
southward along the TX/NM border. Strengthening winds along this
axis will promote widespread elevated to critical fire weather
conditions over a region with dry fine fuels.

...Southern High Plains...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions remain likely from
southwest NM into eastern NM and the OK/TX Panhandles.
Guidance continues to show high probabilities of widespread
southwesterly winds between 20-30 mph across this region with wind
gusts upwards of 40-45 mph possible amid strong mid-level flow
within a deeply mixed boundary layer. Relative Humidity values
between 10-15% remain likely and may fall as low as the single
digits for portions of eastern NM. Nocturnal RH values in the teens
observed upstream across southern AZ, as well as expected low-level
trajectories emanating from the southern Rockies, give credence to
this forecast. Elevated conditions are expected on the periphery of
the critical risk area, and are possible as far north/northeast as
east-central CO and western KS in the wake of the departing surface
low, though confidence in the RH forecast is somewhat low for this
region. Although larger fuels are only modestly receptive per recent
fuel analyses, several grass fires in recent days across this region
confirm that fine fuels are receptive and will support a wildfire
threat.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Tue March 09 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 15 - 19 2021

Today's model forecasts are in good agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation
pattern across most of North America during the 6-10 day period. The ensemble
mean solutions from the GEFS, Canadian, and ECMWF model suites depict an
amplified mean trough and associated negative 500-hPa height anomalies over
the
Polar region north of Siberia. Farther to the south, anomalous ridging is
forecast over the North Pacific, leading to anticipated above normal heights
across the Aleutians. Over the CONUS, a southern stream trough is predicted
over the southern High Plains, resulting in anticipated below normal heights
extending from much of the western CONUS eastward to the Mississippi Valley.
Ridging and above normal heights are expected over much of the eastern CONUS.

Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures in much of the western and
central CONUS are associated with mean cyclonic flow and near to below normal
mid-level heights, with the highest (70%) probability over the parts of
central
High Plains and central Rockies. Conversely, amplified ridging favors enhanced
probabilities of above normal temperatures across much of the eastern CONUS.
Above normal temperatures are favored for parts of northern and western
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, consistent with the consolidation outlook
tool.

Enhanced flow from the Bering Sea is anticipated across much of Alaska,
favoring above normal precipitation for most of the state, except the Alaska
Panhandle where near normal precipitation is favored, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. Odds tilt toward below normal precipitation for
parts of the northwestern CONUS, and parts of the Southern Plains, consistent
with the consolidation forecast tool. Mean troughing centered over the
west-central CONUS and associated shortwaves, as well as the potential for
enhanced moisture advection downstream from the Gulf of Mexico increase
probabilities of above normal precipitation from parts of northern California
eastward across parts of the Central Plains into much of the eastern CONUS.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 15% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 15% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement on an amplified pattern across much of North America,
offset by differences among the dynamical precipitation and temperature
outlook
tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 17 - 23 2021

During the week-2 period, a transitional period is likely as the overall
pattern is forecast to de-amplify and model uncertainty increases. The most
anomalous features predicted by the models across the Northern Hemisphere
include a ridge over the North Pacific, a closed mid-level low north of
Siberia, and troughing over northeastern Canada. The week-2 official 500-hPa
height blend depicts near to below normal heights across much of the
north-central CONUS. Weak cyclonic flow is forecast near the Great Lakes, and
ridging is anticipated farther to the south across the Southeast, Gulf Coast
and Mid-Atlantic. Above normal heights are anticipated across much of western
Alaska.

Onshore flow and weak ridging favor above normal temperature over the interior
West Coast. Persistent negative height anomalies anticipated over parts of the
western and central CONUS favor enhanced probabilities of below normal
temperatures from the Rockies eastward to the Mississippi Valley. Conversely,
ridging enhances odds of above normal temperatures across much of the eastern
CONUS. Above normal temperatures are favored for northern Mainland Alaska,
ahead of a mean trough forecast over eastern Siberia.

Above normal precipitation is likely with predicted mean onshore flow for the
Pacific Northwest. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for the
remainder of the western and central CONUS, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool. Conversely, above normal precipitation is likely for parts of
the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, supported by dynamical forecast
tools. Above normal precipitation is likely for most of northern Mainland
Alaska and below normal precipitation is favored for southern Mainland Alaska
and the Aleutians, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 15% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, fair
agreement among the forecast tools, offset by the uncertainty across much of
the forecast domain.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

321 PM EST Tue Mar 09 2021

Valid 00Z Wed Mar 10 2021 - 00Z Fri Mar 12 2021

...Possibility for severe weather Thursday and Friday over
portions of northern Oklahoma, eastern Kansas, and western
Missouri...

...Heavy snows likely Tuesday night into early Wednesday across
portions of the California mountain ranges, Central Rockies, and
portions of the Northern High Plains...

...Critical risk of fire weather in the Southern Plains and
Southwest...

...Much above-normal temperatures likely into Friday across much
of the central and eastern U.S....

A low pressure/frontal system extending from the Northern Plains
to the Southwest will slowly move eastward, settling in the Upper
Midwest and Central Plains Wednesday through Thursday morning. The
system will produce moderate heavy snow over parts of the central
Great Basin/Rockies Tuesday evening before spreading into the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest on Wednesday. Winter Storm
Watches and Warnings are currently in effect for eastern Wyoming
and western South Dakota. Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico pulled
northward over the Plains to the Upper Midwest will interact with
the frontal boundary to produce moderate to heavy rain and
thunderstorms over parts of the Upper Great Lakes and Upper/Middle
Mississippi Valley Wednesday into Friday morning. These
thunderstorms can become severe at times, with the greatest risk
for severe weather isolated to the Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri
borders. A secondary cold front positioned behind the main system
will draw cool air southward over the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley on Wednesday, creating the potential for
freezing rain as rain changes over to snow with dropping
temperatures.

Elsewhere, short wave energy associated with a low pressure center
positioned off the West Coast will provide the impetus for
continuous showers and thunderstorms along the coast through
Thursday. This shortwave energy will also drive moderate to heavy
snow over the mountain ranges of California and the
Oregon/Washington Cascades Tuesday and Wednesday. Snowfall totals
of 1 to 2 feet are expected over the Sierra Nevada and the
northwest California coastal mountains. Winter Storm Watches and
Warnings are currently in effect for portions of California. Over
the Southwest and Southern Plains persistent dry conditions,
exacerbated by a passing cold front Wednesday evening, combined
with high winds associated with the frontal passage and a tight
pressure gradient nearby will create a critical risk of fire
weather throughout the period. Portions of southeast New Mexico,
the Texas Panhandle, northwest Oklahoma, southwest Kansas, and
southeast Colorado will be at greatest risk for fire weather and
currently have Red Flag Warnings in effect.

Over the central and eastern U.S. much more mild temperatures are
expected over the next few days, with high temperatures across
these regions sitting on average 10 to 20 degrees above normal and
reaching into 60s and 70s. The greatest departures will be likely
over portions of the Central and Northern Plains as well as the
Upper Mississippi Valley on Wednesday, where high temperatures
could hit 30 to 40 degrees above average. On Thursday and Friday,
these anomalously high temperatures will move to the Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, where temperatures will sit 20 to 25
degrees above normal.

...A major weekend snowstorm for the central Rockies/High Plains
and a heavy rainfall threat from the south-central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Weather/Threats Highlights and Guidance/Predictability
Assessment...

A powerful closed low/upper trough and ample height falls will
track slowly over the Southwest to the Plains this weekend to
spawn a deepening surface system. Favorable system track,
deformation, and deep layered/moist upslope flow will support a
significant heavy snow event with focus over the cooled central
Rockies/High Plains. In this pattern, heavy rains/convection will
also develop in earnest from the south-central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley where increasingly deep moisture inflow
from the Gulf of Mexico will wrap around the low into a slow
moving frontal zone. SPC also shows a threat for severe weather in
the unstable warm sector from the southern Plains to the mid-lower
Mississippi Valley.

Subsequent evolution in guidance offers less than stellar model
and ensemble forecast spread and run to run continuity, but
overall suggest a weakening system will lift northeastward across
the east-central U.S. early next week in response to the digging
of an uncertain/amplified upper trough energies down through the
West. Amplified and reinforcing norther stream upper trough
passage will in advance force cooled high pressure and lead cold
frontal push down through the Midwest and the East. There is
potential to spread enhanced rainfall/convection out across the
South, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic. Moisture still wrapping into
the weakening main system may also provide fuel for some lingering
Upper Midwest snows. There is also some chance for modest
overrunning snow from the north-central Appalachians to the
northern Mid-Atlantic.

Meanwhile, the upstream kicker system for the West has potential
to produce generally modest precipitation from the
Northwest/Northern California and to a lesser extent southeastward
across and Great Basin. Emergence into the south-central
Rockies/Plains next midweek does offer some opportunity to
eventually induce upslope flow and some return Gulf flow into/over
a wavy lead frontal system.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from best
clustered guidance and continuity from the 12 UTC ECMWF and
GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means days.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
An broad upper-level trough continues to move onshore across the
West Coast as a leading shortwave impulse propagates to the
northeast out of the Four-Corners region within a mean southwesterly
flow regime. A surface low noted over east CO/west KS will deepen as
it translates northeast with the shortwave trough through the day.
As a result, a trailing lee trough/dryline will migrate east as
well, allowing for a broad swath of west/southwesterly flow across
the southern High Plains this afternoon. Downslope winds off the
southern Rockies along with strong flow aloft will support dry,
windy conditions and a widespread fire weather threat from southern
New Mexico to central Kansas.

...Southern New Mexico and the southern High Plains...
The forecast remains on track with widespread elevated to critical
conditions likely for several hours this afternoon. Recent fuel
analyses continue to show receptive fine fuels in place with 10-hour
fuel moisture values generally between 4-8%. Observed surface trends
show dewpoints have fallen across southern/eastern NM over the past
12-24 hours. Regional 00 UTC soundings also reveal dry conditions
with deep, well-mixed boundary layers under a mid-level dry slot
(per recent water-vapor imagery).

These observed trends support the forecast and the potential for
widespread relative humidity values below 15%. Mostly clear skies
today will allow for ample diurnal warming and deep boundary-layer
mixing by late afternoon. Downward transport of stronger mid-level
flow within this layer will support wind gusts up to 35-45 mph amid
sustained winds between 20-30 mph. While widespread humidity values
in the 10-15% range with winds between 20-25 mph appear to be the
most likely scenario across much of the critical area, more
aggressive solutions show the potential for brief extremely critical
meteorological conditions across southern to eastern NM with RH near
5% and sustained winds around 30 mph. However, these conditions are
not expected to be widespread or persistent. Guidance has come into
somewhat better agreement regarding the potential for elevated
conditions as far northeast as central KS, and some solutions
suggest elevated wind/RH combinations may reach into far southwest
IA/southeast NE (though confidence in this potential is low).

...Western Carolinas/Virginia...
Dry conditions are expected once again this afternoon with RH values
falling to near 20%. The eastward shift of the surface high will
allow for weak moisture advection into the region through the day.
However,southwesterly winds increasing to around 10-15 mph may
overlap with diurnal humidity minimums and support brief/localized
elevated fire weather conditions.

...A major weekend snowstorm for the central Rockies/High Plains

...Weather/Threats Highlights and Guidance/Predictability
Assessment...

A powerful closed low/upper trough and ample height falls will
track slowly over the Southwest to the Plains this weekend to
spawn a deepening surface system. Favorable system track,
deformation, and deep layered/moist upslope flow will support a
significant heavy snow event with focus over the cooled central
Rockies/High Plains. Forecast predictability is high beyond
smaller scale details. In this pattern, heavy rains/convection
will also develop in earnest from the south-central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley where increasingly deep moisture inflow
from the Gulf of Mexico will wrap around the low into a slow
moving frontal zone. SPC shows a severe weather threat for the
southern Plains to the mid-lower Mississippi Valley unstable warm
sector.

Subsequent evolution in guidance offers less than stellar model
and ensemble forecast spread and run to run continuity, but
overall suggest a weakening system will lift northeastward across
the east-central U.S. early-mid next week in response to the
digging of an uncertain/amplified upper trough energies down
through the West. Amplified and reinforcing northern stream upper
trough passage will in advance force cooled high pressure and lead
cold frontal push down through the Midwest and the East. There is
potential to spread enhanced rainfall/convection out across the
South, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic. Moisture still wrapping into
the weakening main system may also provide fuel for some lingering
Upper Midwest snows. There is also some chance for light
overrunning snow for the north-central Appalachians and northern
Mid-Atlantic.

Meanwhile, the upstream kicker system for the West has potential
to produce generally modest precipitation from the
Northwest/Northern California and to a lesser extent southeastward
across and Great Basin. Emergence into the south-central
Rockies/Plains next midweek does offer some opportunity to
eventually induce upslope flow and some return Gulf flow into/over
a wavy lead frontal system.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from best
clustered guidance and continuity from the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF
ensemble mean and to a lesser extent the GEFS ensemble mean and 01
UTC National Blend of Models. This blended solution maintains
decent WPC continuity and overall remains on the less progressive
side of the full envelope of model and ensemble solutions. This
still seems more reasonable considering the initially amplified
and closed nature of the main systems.

...A major weekend snowstorm for the central Rockies/High Plains
and a heavy rainfall threat from the south-central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Weather/Threats Highlights and Guidance/Predictability
Assessment...

A powerful closed low/upper trough and ample height falls will
track slowly over the Southwest to the Plains this weekend to
spawn a deepening surface system. Favorable system track,
deformation, and deep layered/moist upslope flow will support a
significant heavy snow event with focus over the cooled central
Rockies/High Plains. Forecast predictability is high beyond
smaller scale details. In this pattern, heavy rains/convection
will also develop in earnest from the south-central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley where increasingly deep moisture inflow
from the Gulf of Mexico will wrap around the low into a slow
moving frontal zone. SPC shows a severe weather threat for the
southern Plains to the mid-lower Mississippi Valley unstable warm
sector.

Subsequent evolution in guidance offers less than stellar model
and ensemble forecast spread and run to run continuity, but
overall suggest a weakening system will lift northeastward across
the east-central U.S. early-mid next week in response to the
digging of an uncertain/amplified upper trough energies down
through the West. Amplified and reinforcing northern stream upper
trough passage will in advance force cooled high pressure and lead
cold frontal push down through the Midwest and the East. There is
potential to spread enhanced rainfall/convection out across the
South, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic. Moisture still wrapping into
the weakening main system may also provide fuel for some lingering
Upper Midwest snows. There is also some chance for light
overrunning snow for the north-central Appalachians and northern
Mid-Atlantic.

Meanwhile, the upstream kicker system for the West has potential
to produce generally modest precipitation from the
Northwest/Northern California and to a lesser extent southeastward
across and Great Basin. Emergence into the south-central
Rockies/Plains next midweek does offer some opportunity to
eventually induce upslope flow and some return Gulf flow into/over
a wavy lead frontal system.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from best
clustered guidance and continuity from the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF
ensemble mean and to a lesser extent the GEFS ensemble mean and 01
UTC National Blend of Models. This blended solution maintains
decent WPC continuity and overall remains on the less progressive
side of the full envelope of model and ensemble solutions. This
still seems more reasonable considering the initially amplified
and closed nature of the main systems.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley through Thursday
morning...

...Heavy snow from parts of the Northern/Central High Plains into
the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes through Thursday
morning...

...Critical risk of fire weather in the Southern Plains and
Southwest...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above average from parts
of the Central Plains into Great Lakes/Ohio Valley...

A front extending from the Upper Great Lakes roughly southwestward
to the Central Rockies will move eastward to the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Coast by Friday.  Showers and thunderstorms
will develop along and ahead of the boundary from parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley to the Central Plains on Wednesday.  The
SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley through Thursday
morning.  The primary threat will be from frequent lightning,
severe wind gusts, and large hail.  A wave of low pressure will
move northeastward along the front from the central Plains to the
Upper Mississippi Valley by Wednesday night. Snow will develop
over parts of the Northern/Central Rockies that will expand onto
parts of the Northern/Central Plains by the early afternoon and
continue to expand into parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley by
Wednesday evening.  The snow will be heavy at times from the
Central High Plains to the Upper Mississippi Valley overnight
Wednesday.  The snow will slowly end from west to east on Thursday
morning into Thursday evening.  Ahead of the front, temperatures
will be 15 to 25 degrees above average from parts of the Central
Plains into Great Lakes/Ohio Valley on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms will continue along the front
from parts of the Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes
through Thursday evening.  By Friday morning, rain will develop
along the boundary from New England to the Mid-Atlantic to the
Central Appalachians.  Showers and thunderstorms will continue
along and near the front from parts of the Southern Plains to the
Middle Mississippi Valley also by Friday morning.

In the meantime, an upper-level low will move onshore over the
West Coast on Wednesday morning, moving to Southern California to
the Great Basin by Friday.  As the energy moves inland, rain will
develop over parts of California as snow develops over the higher
elevations.  By Wednesday evening, the snow expands into parts of
the Northern Intermountain Region into the Great Basin and into
parts of the Northern/Central Rockies.  Overnight Wednesday, the
snow will be concentrated in the Great Basin, Southwest, and
Central Rockies.  On Thursday, the snow will pick-up again over
the Sierra Nevada Mountains and taper off overnight on Thursday
Night. The snow will extend from parts of the Southwest to the
Central Rockies/Central High Plains by Friday morning.

Elsewhere, over the Southwest and Southern Plains, persistent dry
conditions, exacerbated by a passing cold front Wednesday evening,
combined with high winds associated with the frontal passage and a
tight pressure gradient nearby, will create a critical risk of
fire weather throughout the period. Portions of southeast New
Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, northwest Oklahoma, southwest Kansas,
and southeast Colorado will be at greatest risk for fire weather
and currently have Red Flag Warnings in effect.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
The southwesterly flow regime over the Southwest will persist into
Thursday as the main trough axis shifts southward along the CA
coast. The lack of any notable upper-level features embedded within
the mean flow will limit the potential for strong surface pressure
falls in the lee of the Rockies, though sufficient zonal flow aloft
over the terrain will support modest lee troughing. This suggests
that windy conditions will be more regional in nature (as compared
to Wednesday). Windy conditions and an associated fire weather
threat appear most likely for the southeast quadrant of New Mexico
into the western TX Panhandle where dry/windy conditions have been
common over the past several days.

...Southeast New Mexico...
Dry conditions appear likely across much of the southern High Plains
for Thursday afternoon with relative humidity values in the 10-20%
range likely over southeast NM and the western TX Panhandle.
Mid-level flow is forecast to be weaker compared to Wednesday and
will most likely be focused across south-central to eastern NM per
recent deterministic and ensemble guidance. Diurnal heating should
allow for sufficient mixing to capitalize on this stronger flow and
support 25-35 mph wind gusts, though increasing clouds through the
day may hinder this potential. While elevated wind/RH combinations
will likely be met from south-central NM to the NM/CO/Panhandles
region, critical conditions appear most likely for portions of
southeast NM in the vicinity and downwind of the Guadalupe,
Sacramento, and Sandia Manzano mountains where the overlap of the
dry conditions, clear skies, and stronger mid-level winds appears
most likely.

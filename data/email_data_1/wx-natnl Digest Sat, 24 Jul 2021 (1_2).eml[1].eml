The previous forecast remains on track. See the discussion below for
more details.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0118 AM CDT Fri Jul 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough will move across Montana on Friday.
Moderate mid-level flow which is present this morning is expected to
weaken through the day. Deep mixing is expected across the northern
Rockies during the afternoon hours. Surface winds are expected to
strengthen as some of this moderate mid-level flow reaches the
surface. However, due to the weakening flow through the day,
sustained winds may only peak around 15 to 20 mph. Therefore,
critical conditions are expected to remain isolated with widespread
elevated conditions likely.

Elsewhere, wet, monsoonal thunderstorms are expected to be numerous
across the Southwest and the southern Great Basin.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 23 2021

SYNOPSIS: At the beginning of week-2, dynamical models are in good agreemen=
t
favoring mid-level high pressure over the central contiguous U.S, but becom=
ing
more amplified over the northwestern CONUS compared to yesterday. This favo=
rs
a
broad area with an increased risk for excessive heat throughout the period,
with elevated heat indices being more of a concern across eastern and south=
ern
portions of the U.S. For the Alaska region, mid-level low pressure is forec=
ast
across the northern Bering Sea favoring anomalously cooler and wetter
conditions over western Alaska. However, pre-defined hazards criteria are n=
ot
expected to be reached.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Great Plains, Middle an=
d
Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast, Sat-Sun, Jul 31-=
Aug
1.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Great Basin,
Sat-Sun, Jul 31-Aug 1.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the northwestern CONUS, Great
Plains, Mississippi Valley, and extending east to the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast coasts, Sat-Fri, Jul 31-Aug 6.

Flooding possible across portions of the Central and Southern Rockies.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY JULY 26 - FRIDAY JULY 30:

FOR SATURDAY JULY 31 - FRIDAY AUGUST 06: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles are in relatively good agreement regarding the depiction of broad=
,
amplified ridging across much of the CONUS, with a mid-level height maximum
over the Southern Plains on day-8. This is a slight westward shift compared=
 to
yesterday, with higher amplitude troughing being depicted across the
northeastern CONUS compared to yesterday, particularly in the deterministic=
 0z
ECMWF. This results in a retrogression of the mean ridge axis with increasi=
ng
amplitude across the northwestern CONUS. The largest positive 500-hPa heigh=
t
anomalies (over +60 meters) are indicated early in the period across portio=
ns
of the Northern Rockies eastward into the Great Plains, Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys. The GEFS reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance=
 of
maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 deg F (95 deg F
across southern portions of the highlighted region), while the ECMWF
reforecast
tool depicts these enhanced probabilities for the first half of week-2 with
probabilities dropping below 20% over most areas later in the period. Given
the
depiction of broad, low amplitude ridging at the end of the period across t=
he
CONUS in both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles, a slight risk of excessive heat=
 is
maintained for portions of the northwestern CONUS, Great Plains, Mississipp=
i
Valley, and extending east to the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast coasts for all=
 of
week-2.



As a result of the increased troughing signals in the East, the moderate ri=
sk
of excessive heat is downgraded to a slight risk over the mid-Atlantic. The
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict lower probabilities for maximum
temperatures reaching the 85th percentile compared to yesterday (>20% today
compared to >30% yesterday). The moderate risk remains posted for portions =
of
the Great Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, an=
d
Southeast for July 31-August 1 underneath greater influence from the ridgin=
g
and associated positive mid-level height anomalies. The GEFS reforecast too=
l
indicates at least a 40% chance maximum temperatures exceed the 85th
climatological percentile and 95 deg F across the Great Plains, with lower
chances shown in the ECMWF reforecast tool. Uncalibrated guidance from the
ECMWF and GEFS support triple digit heat across parts of the Great Plains, =
and
low soil moisture located throughout the northern Plains is also favored to
result in enhanced surface heating for that region. Actual temperatures are
forecast to be lower to the east over the Middle and Lower Mississippi Vall=
ey,
Tennessee Valley, and Southeast, with increased humidity becoming the domin=
ant
factor in the excessive heat. Heat risk guidance favors parts of these area=
s
having at least a 40% chance heat indices exceed 105 deg F supporting the
moderate risk. As a result of the westward expansion of the ridge, both
reforecast tools depict at least a 40% chance maximum temperatures exceed t=
he
85th climatological percentile over the valleys of the Northern Great Basin=
,
as
well as a 20% chance maximum temperatures exceed 100 deg F. Uncalibrated
guidance from both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles indicate maximum temperatur=
e
anomalies greater than +10 deg F.  Taking all of this into account, an upgr=
ade
to a moderate risk is justified across the Northern Great Basin on July
31-August 1.



The southwest monsoon is forecast to diminish during week-2 as a result of =
the
more eastward placement of the mean ridge axis over the Plains instead of t=
he
more climatologically favorable Four Corners region. However, the uncalibra=
ted
GEFS and ECMWF guidance still indicates the potential for convective
precipitation over the Rockies on the backside of the mean ridge axis.
Forecast
amounts are generally less than a half inch in a 3-day period precluding a
related heavy precipitation hazard, but localized flash flooding remains a
concern. As a result, the possible flooding hazard is continued in todays
outlook across parts of the Central and Southern Rockies. Flash flooding ca=
n
occur even in areas that do not receive any rain, and be a direct result of
runoff from precipitation upstream. Later in week-2, a combination of
increased
tropical activity in the East Pacific and the westward expansion of the mea=
n
ridge may increase the potential for moisture surges into the Southwest CON=
US.
However, given the uncertainty in the tracks and strengths of tropical
disturbances, as well as the amplitude and placement of the mean ridge late=
r
in
the period, the flooding hazard is not expanded at this time.



A low amplitude mid-level pattern is favored for Alaska during week-2 with
troughing forecast across the northern Bering Sea, favoring increased chanc=
es
for above normal precipitation across the western Mainland and Aleutians.
Precipitation totals over a 3-day period are forecast to be under an inch f=
or
most areas in the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools, precluding a related
hazard.
Weak ridging is favored downstream across the eastern Mainland and Panhandl=
e
with associated above normal temperatures. However, temperatures are not
anticipated to exceed 85 deg F, and mean week-2 temperature anomalies are
forecast to be less than 4 deg F. As a result, no related temperature hazar=
d
is
highlighted.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Brief elevated conditions
may occur in the Snake River Plain during the afternoon, as westerly
surface winds and falling RH values may approach critical thresholds
in localized areas. However, such conditions appear too
localized/transient to warrant any highlights at this time.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0118 AM CDT Fri Jul 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge will strengthen across the western CONUS on
Saturday. As it strengthens, mostly light winds are anticipated
across much of the dry portions of the west. In addition,
thunderstorms are expected to remain across areas with high PWAT and
wet fuels. Therefore, wind/relative humidity based fire weather
concerns are expected to remain mostly subdued. However, plume
dominated fire activity remains possible from ongoing large fires
across California, Oregon, and Idaho.

...Triple-digit heat in the north-central U.S. forecast to
moderate slightly toward the end of next week as heat intensifies
over interior Pacific Northwest...

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Model guidance continues to advertise a warm ridge dominating much
of the western U.S. while multiple shortwaves will push downstream
to sustain general troughing across the Northeast, where models
continue to struggle with resolving the various shortwave
interactions and arrive at a common and stable solution.  Rain
associated with a stationary front can be expected to spread
eastward from the Great Lakes early to middle of next week into
the Northeast later in the week but with considerable uncertainty
in its timing and intensity.  Meanwhile, scattered thunderstorms
can be expected Monday into Tuesday ahead of a cold front from the
central Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic where locally heavy
rainfall is possible.  The rain is forecast to push slowly south
into the Southeast by midweek and becomes more widely scattered.
However, the National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring the
potential for the formation of a tropical cyclone east of Florida
where the disturbance may intensify and drift toward the southeast
U.S. Coast early to middle of next week.

Meanwhile, another heatwave is forecast to peak by next Tuesday
across the northern Plains and the northern Great Basin where
widespread high temperatures are forecast to reach well into the
100s.  Gradual moderation into the 90s is forecast for the
north-central U.S. but it appears that the heat will once again
intensify across the interior Pacific Northwest toward the end of
next week.  Summer heat will sneak back and persist across the
Mid-Atlantic while cool than normal weather will prevail over the
Northeast.

An upper low drifting offshore into the Pacific and the
strengthening/consolidation of the Rockies-Plains upper ridge next
week should act to spread moisture to the north and west out from
from the Southwest.  Activity to extend into California, the Great
Basin, and northward over the Rockies should be less intense than
a mainly short term focusing Arizona event.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range forecast package was based a general model
compromise among the 00Z GFS/06Z GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, and
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  A greater weight
toward the ensemble means was used from Day 5 onward to handle the
above normal uncertainty over the Northeast.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri July 23 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 29 - AUG 02, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
Bering Sea. A ridge and associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. An amplified ridge=
 is
forecast with positive 500-hPa height anomalies over most of the CONUS.
However, a trough is predicted over the Northeast with below normal 500-hPa
heights anticipated across the region.

Near to above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over Alaska
underneath predicted above normal 500-hPa heights, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. Near to above normal temperatures are also
favored
for most of the CONUS due to the persistent ridging and above normal 500-hP=
a
heights over the region and also consistent with the consolidation forecast
tool. A predicted trough over the Northeast favors enhanced probabilities o=
f
below normal temperatures over the region.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the Aleutians an=
d
western Mainland Alaska due to a forecast trough near the Bering Sea and
potential storm system development. Below normal precipitation is likely fo=
r
eastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle underneath forecast above normal
500-hPa heights. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over the
Pacific Northwest eastward across much of the central and southeastern CONU=
S
due to forecast ridging or surface high pressure over the region. The posit=
ion
of the predicted 500-hPa ridge and low-level flow is favorable for near to
above normal precipitation for much of the Great Basin and parts of the
Southwest region, supported by the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offse=
t
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 31 - AUG 06, 2021

During the week-2 period, the overall 500-hPa circulation pattern is genera=
lly
similar but expected to weaken compared to the 6-10 day period. The
temperature
probability forecast during the week-2 period is very similar to the 6-10 d=
ay
period except that below normal temperatures are likely for western Mainlan=
d
Alaska and the probabilities for above normal temperatures over the CONUS a=
re
reduced, consistent with the operational autoblend forecast tool. The
precipitation probability forecast is also generally similar to the 6-10 da=
y
period. However, probabilities of below normal precipitation were reduced o=
ver
the eastern CONUS, consistent with the operational autoblend tools.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecas=
t
tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

Valid 00Z Sat Jul 24 2021 - 00Z Mon Jul 26 2021

...Heavy Monsoonal rainfall continues in the Desert Southwest,
creating significant concern for flash flooding and excessive
rainfall throughout the weekend...

...Severe thunderstorms possible from the Northern Plains to the
Upper Great Lakes through Sunday morning...

...There is an Elevated Risk of Fire Weather for portions of the
Northern High Plains, Northern Rockies, and Northern Great Basin
through Saturday morning...

During the short-range period all eyes will be on the Desert
Southwest, where monsoon driven heavy rainfall is forecast to
persist throughout the weekend. An upper-level low retrograding
over the Texas/New Mexico border will aid in ushering highly
anomalous moisture into the region as well as provide strong
forcing for ascent,
thus providing ingredients that could allow developing storms to
produce high rainfall rates from 1-2"/hr and widespread
accumulations of 2-4+". These rates combined with the antecedent
saturated soils and numerous burn scars scattered throughout the
area will be a significant cause of concern for widespread flash
flooding events. As such, the Weather Prediction Center has issued
a Moderate Risk for Excessive Rainfall for portions of Arizona and
New Mexico that will be carried through Sunday morning. A Slight
Risk for Excessive Rainfall is also in place for portions of
southwest Utah, central New Mexico, and southwest/central Colorado
where slow moving convection and strong upslope enhancement could
produce heavy rain in some isolated areas. Flash Flood Watches are
currently in effect for much of Arizona and the aforementioned
regions.

Meanwhile, a cold front extending from the Upper Midwest through
the Northern Plains is expected to slowly propagate to the south
and east through the Great Lakes before reaching the Central
Appalachians by Sunday evening. Showers and thunderstorms are
forecast to develop along and ahead of the front, leaving behind
light to moderate rainfall totals. Moderate forcing and
instability along the front will allow for some severe
thunderstorms with damaging winds and large hail to develop. The
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk for severe
thunderstorms from the central Dakotas to the western edge of Lake
Superior. As the front progresses east into the Great Lakes the
severe thunderstorm risk is forecast to shift east as well. From
Saturday into Sunday morning severe thunderstorms will likely
develop over portions of Michigan and coastal areas around
southern Lake Michigan that could produce damaging winds, large
hail, and an isolated tornado or two.

Elsewhere, an Elevated Risk for fire weather is in effect for
portions of the Northern High Plains, Northern Rockies, and
Northern Great Basin through Saturday morning. Drought conditions,
gusty winds, and dry fuels will aid in producing conditions
favorable for the development and/or spread of wildfires. Red Flag
Warnings are currently in effect for much of Montana and portions
of Idaho. Off the southeastern coast, an area of low pressure and
its associated stationary boundary will be the focus for showers
and thunderstorms over Florida and its adjacent states through
Sunday. The low pressure area itself is currently under watch by
the National Hurricane Center and may develop into a tropical
depression over the next couple of days.

Temperature-wise much of the country will experience temperatures
at or close to normal. An exception to this rule will be the
Desert Southwest, which will experience moderately below normal
temperatures due to the increased cloud cover from monsoonal
activity keeping temperatures unseasonably cool. Conversely,
portions of the Central Plains and Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley
will experience temperatures 5 to 10 degrees above normal on
Saturday, with daily highs reaching the mid 90s. Heat Advisories
are currently in effect for potions of the Middle Mississippi
Valley and eastern Central Plains while an Excessive Heat Warning
is in effect for the Kansas City metro area. On Sunday, above
normal temperatures will be felt in northern California and the
Northern Great Basin, where daily highs are forecast to hit the
high 90s and low 100s.

...Triple-digit heat in the north-central U.S. forecast to
moderate slightly toward the end of next week as heat intensifies
over interior Pacific Northwest...

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Model guidance continues to advertise a warm ridge dominating much
of the western U.S. while multiple shortwaves will push downstream
to sustain general troughing across the Northeast, where models
continue to struggle with resolving the various shortwave
interactions and arrive at a common and stable solution.  Rain
associated with a stationary front can be expected to spread
eastward from the Great Lakes early to middle of next week into
the Northeast later in the week but with considerable uncertainty
in its timing and intensity.  Meanwhile, scattered thunderstorms
can be expected Monday into Tuesday ahead of a cold front from the
central Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic where locally heavy
rainfall is possible.  The rain is forecast to push slowly south
into the Southeast by midweek and become more widely scattered.
However, the National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring the
potential for tropical cyclone formation east of Florida where the
disturbance may intensify and drift toward the southeast U.S.
coast early to middle of next week.

Meanwhile, another heatwave is forecast to peak by next Tuesday
across the northern Plains and the northern Great Basin where
widespread high temperatures are forecast to reach well into the
100s.  Gradual moderation into the 90s is forecast for the
north-central U.S. toward the end of next week but it appears that
the heat will once again intensify across the interior Pacific
Northwest.  Across the Mid-Atlantic, summer heat is forecast to
return and persist while cool than normal weather will prevail
over the Northeast.

An upper low drifting offshore into the Pacific and the
strengthening/consolidation of the Rockies-Plains upper ridge next
week should act to spread moisture to the north and west out from
the Southwest.  Activity to extend into California, the Great
Basin, and northward over the Rockies should be less intense than
the mainly short term focusing Arizona event.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The most uncertain part of the forecast is across the Northeast
where models continue to struggle with resolving the various
shortwave interactions converging along a mean trough.  A wide
variety of solutions regarding the timing/intensity and whether a
low pressure system will develop over the Northeast exists later
next week.  In
view of these model spread, more weights from the ensemble means
were applied than normal especially from Day 5 onward.  The 06Z
GFS appeared to overdevelop the low pressure wave over the
northern Plains and thus the more reasonable 00Z GFS was adopted
instead.  On the other hand, the 06Z GEFS mean was compatible with
the ensemble means from the ECMWF and CMC through Day 7.
Meanwhile, the 12Z ECMWF now indicates cyclogenesis over New
England late next week, which is not well supported by its
ensemble mean.

The WPC medium range forecast package was based on a general model
compromise among the 00Z GFS/06Z GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, and
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  A greater weight
toward the ensemble means was used from Day 5 onward to handle the
above normal uncertainty over the Northeast.

...North-central U.S. triple-digit heat may exceed records into
early-mid next week...

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Latest guidance continues to advertise a hot ridge dominating much
of the west-central U.S. into next week while multiple shortwaves
push downstream to sustain general troughing across the
Midwest/Northeast, where models continue to struggle with
resolving the various shortwave interactions and arrive at a
common and stable solution. Rain associated with wavy and slow
moving fronts can be expected to spread mainly from the
Midwest/Great Lakes to the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic with
considerable uncertainty in its timing and intensity. Meanwhile,
lead scattered thunderstorms can also be expected to push slowly
south into the Southeast by midweek. In addition, the National
Hurricane Center continues to monitor the potential for tropical
cyclone formation east of northern Florida. The disturbance may
intensify and drift toward the southeast U.S. coast early to
middle of next week along with deepened moisture availability to
fuel local downpours.

Meanwhile, a heatwave is forecast to peak Tuesday for the northern
Plains/Rockies and into the northern Great Basin. High
temperatures for the northern Plains are forecast to exceed 100F
into Tuesday and Wednesday, likely producing some record values.
Gradual moderation is forecast for the north-central U.S. later
next week, but it appears that anomalous heat will once again
intensify across the interior Pacific Northwest.

An upper low drifting offshore into the Pacific and the
strengthening of the west-central U.S. upper ridge into next week
should act to spread moisture to the north and west out from the
Southwest. Expect modest monsoonal activity will extend into
California, the Great Basin, then northward and onward into the
Rockies then Plains.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern evolution at mid-larger scales overall
seems to offer slightly above average predictability Days 3-7.
However, the least certain mass field part of the forecast remains
across the Midwest/Northeast where models continue to struggle
with resolving the various shortwave interactions converging along
a mean trough. A wide variety of solutions regarding the timing
and intensity of the upper trough and surface based low pressure
system developments. Prefer an upper trough amplitude at least on
the more amplified side of the full guidance envelope given the
staying power and amplitude of the building upstream upper ridge.
Of the models, a blend of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF seems to
best provide this. In view of forecast spread, also recommend
inclusion of the 18 UTC GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble means to
the composite along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models.
Respective 00 UTC models stayed in line.

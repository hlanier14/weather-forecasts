Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1154 AM CDT Sat Aug 21 2021

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

Expanded the elevated area slightly west into northern California
and far southern Oregon where dry and breezy conditions may impact
ongoing large fires. In addition, expanded the isoDryT area slightly
west across northwest Nevada due to slightly higher thunderstorm
probabilities than were previously forecast.

..Bentley.. 08/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0103 AM CDT Sat Aug 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level short-wave trough located over portions of the Pacific
Northwest will translate eastward throughout the day, entering
portions of the northern Rockies by the end of the forecast period.
Enhanced mid-level flow will accompany the southern periphery of
this feature and intensify throughout the day.

...Portions of the Northern Great Basin...
The approaching trough and diffluent flow aloft will allow for at
least modest ascent to overspread the region. With somewhat modest
low- and mid-level moisture in place amid a well-mixed boundary
layer, isolated dry thunderstorms should develop by mid afternoon.
Given the enhanced flow aloft, relatively quick storm motions are
anticipated and should offset any wetting rain potential.
Additionally, strong low-level lapse rates will support the
potential for gusty outflow winds with the stronger cells.

In addition, a cold front should push through the region throughout
the day. Dry/breezy post-frontal conditions should occur during the
afternoon, resulting in elevated fire-weather conditions. Fuels
across the region remain at least marginally receptive to large-fire
spread, supporting both the elevated and isolated dry thunderstorm
designations.

...Remnants of Henri forecast to depart New England on Tuesday...
...Late-week heavy rain possible across the upper Midwest....


...Overview...

The medium-range period should begin with the remnants of Henri
weakening further while departing New England.  In the wake of
Henri, a typical late-summer pattern is expected to prevail into
next weekend as a couple of frontal waves are forecast to move
across the northern half of the country where heavy rain is
possible across the upper Midwest.  Meanwhile, as a warm ridge
aloft remains anchored across the South, heat and oppressive
humidity are expected to continue into midweek near/along the
Mississippi Valley.  Another upper ridge building in from the
eastern Pacific will likely bring another the heatwave into the
West Coast during the latter portion of next week.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Latest model guidance has come into better agreement that the
remnant circulation of Henri will be exiting New England on
Tuesday after having interacted with an upper-level low and
meandering over New England during the short-range period.  Behind
Henri, ensemble means show very good agreement on the pattern
evolution across the U.S. through the end of next week.  The GFS
tends to emphasize the development of a frontal wave over the
northern Plains on Tuesday, giving rise to uncertainty in the
placement of the QPF axis across the northern Plains.  However,
agreement is much better regarding the next wave moving into the
northern Plains late next week.

Therefore, a composite blend of the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and a smaller proportion from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean as used
to compose the WPC medium range package.  This yielded a solution
quite compatible with the previous WPC forecast package.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Expect Henri's threats for high winds/waves along with some bands
of heavy rainfall over and near New England (with some terrain
enhancement possible) to be mainly in the short range period from
this weekend into Monday.  Henri will likely be weaker and in
post-tropical form as the system progresses east-northeastward
away from New England Tuesday onward.  Surface waves/fronts
crossing the northern U.S. and southern Canada will interact with
leading moisture and instability to produce episodes of showers
and thunderstorms that could be locally heavy.  Over the past day
the guidance has been fairly consistent in highlighting the best
potential for highest five-day totals over and near the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Midwest.  This region will see an early
frontal passage, followed by the front stalling to the south
(Mid-Mississippi Valley) and then lifting back north as a warm
front ahead of another system emerging into the Plains.  Central
and southern parts of the East may see areas of diurnally-favored
convection within a humid and warm to hot airmass.  Upper level
energy from a combination of the tail end of the initial East
Coast trough and what tracks underneath the western Atlantic ridge
may enhance convection over parts of the Southeast and southern
Mid-Atlantic.  Specific details of this energy have low
predictability though.

Through midweek very warm to hot temperatures will prevail from
the central-southern Plains through much of the East.  The axis of
warmest anomalies should be from the central Plains/Midwest into
the Northeast with some readings 10-15F above normal, and more
coverage of such anomalies for morning lows versus daytime highs.
Some daily records for warm lows may be challenged even away from
the areas with highest anomalies.  Expect highs to moderate after
midweek but very warm lows are likely to persist over many areas
through the end of the week.  A cold front should bring cooler
weather to the Northeast by the start of the weekend.  The highest
heat index values during the period should be through midweek over
the Mid/Lower Mississippi Valley and along the Gulf Coast where
max values may locally exceed 110F.  Westward expansion of upper
ridging will promote increasing coverage of highs 5-10F above
normal over southern parts of the West and then across much of
California later in the week.  Some of this heat may reach western
Oregon by next Saturday.  The Northern Plains region will be
consistently cool during the period with some highs up to 10-15F
below normal, mainly during Tuesday-Thursday.

...Remnants of Henri forecast to depart New England on Tuesday...
...Late-week heavy rain possible across the upper Midwest....


...Overview...

The medium-range period should begin with the remnants of Henri
weakening further while departing New England.  In the wake of
Henri, a typical late-summer pattern is expected to prevail into
next weekend as a couple of frontal waves are forecast to move
across the northern half of the country where heavy rain is
possible across the upper Midwest.  Meanwhile, as a warm ridge
aloft remains anchored across the South, heat and oppressive
humidity are expected to continue into midweek near/along the
Mississippi Valley.  Another upper ridge building in from the
eastern Pacific will likely bring another the heatwave into the
West Coast during the latter portion of next week.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Latest model guidance has come into better agreement that the
remnant circulation of Henri will be exiting New England on
Tuesday after having interacted with an upper-level low and
meandering over New England during the short-range period.  Behind
Henri, ensemble means show very good agreement on the pattern
evolution across the U.S. through the end of next week.  The GFS
tends to emphasize the development of a frontal wave over the
northern Plains on Tuesday, giving rise to uncertainty in the
placement of the QPF axis across the northern Plains.  However,
agreement is much better regarding the next wave moving into the
northern Plains late next week.

Therefore, a composite blend of the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and a smaller proportion from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean as used
to compose the WPC medium range package.  This yielded a solution
quite compatible with the previous WPC forecast package.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Expect Henri's threats for high winds/waves along with some bands
of heavy rainfall over and near New England (with some terrain
enhancement possible) to be mainly in the short range period from
this weekend into Monday.  Henri will likely be weaker and in
post-tropical form as the system progresses east-northeastward
away from New England Tuesday onward.  Surface waves/fronts
crossing the northern U.S. and southern Canada will interact with
leading moisture and instability to produce episodes of showers
and thunderstorms that could be locally heavy.  Over the past day
the guidance has been fairly consistent in highlighting the best
potential for highest five-day totals over and near the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Midwest.  This region will see an early
frontal passage, followed by the front stalling to the south
(Mid-Mississippi Valley) and then lifting back north as a warm
front ahead of another system emerging into the Plains.  Central
and southern parts of the East may see areas of diurnally-favored
convection within a humid and warm to hot airmass.  Upper level
energy from a combination of the tail end of the initial East
Coast trough and what tracks underneath the western Atlantic ridge
may enhance convection over parts of the Southeast and southern
Mid-Atlantic.  Specific details of this energy have low
predictability though.

Through midweek very warm to hot temperatures will prevail from
the central-southern Plains through much of the East.  The axis of
warmest anomalies should be from the central Plains/Midwest into
the Northeast with some readings 10-15F above normal, and more
coverage of such anomalies for morning lows versus daytime highs.
Some daily records for warm lows may be challenged even away from
the areas with highest anomalies.  Expect highs to moderate after
midweek but very warm lows are likely to persist over many areas
through the end of the week.  A cold front should bring cooler
weather to the Northeast by the start of the weekend.  The highest
heat index values during the period should be through midweek over
the Mid/Lower Mississippi Valley and along the Gulf Coast where
max values may locally exceed 110F.  Westward expansion of upper
ridging will promote increasing coverage of highs 5-10F above
normal over southern parts of the West and then across much of
California later in the week.  Some of this heat may reach western
Oregon by next Saturday.  The Northern Plains region will be
consistently cool during the period with some highs up to 10-15F
below normal, mainly during Tuesday-Thursday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat August 21 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0105 AM CDT Sat Aug 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level short-wave trough located over portions of the northern
Rockies will lift northeast into south-central Canada. In its wake,
a broad region of modestly enhanced mid-level flow will overspread
much of the northern Rockies and northern High Plains for the
remainder of the forecast period. At the surface, a cold front will
sweep across the lee of the Rockies in the northern High Plains.

Vertical mixing and downslope/compression in the post-frontal
airmass may allow for brief/isolated elevated conditions to develop,
mainly across east-central Wyoming into southwest South Dakota and
the Nebraska Panhandle. Sustained surface winds of 20-25 mph should
occur, however, RH values appear to remain generally above 20% in
most areas.

excessive rainfall starting Sunday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
northern Mid-Atlantic/Southern New England and Tennessee/Lower
Mississippi Valleys through Sunday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Northern/Central Plains and the Upper/Middle Mississippi
Valley from Sunday morning into Monday morning...

Hurricane Henri is forecast to make landfall over parts of
Southern New England on Sunday afternoon. Check with the NHC=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs
latest bulletin for the most up-to-date track and intensity of
Henri.  Overnight Saturday into early Sunday morning, Henri will
start producing rain over parts of Southern New England. The rain
will steadily increase in intensity, producing heavy rain.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall for the heavy rain. The heavy rain will create numerous
areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood,
potentially affecting larger rivers from Sunday morning to Monday
morning.

Meanwhile, tropical moisture, an old boundary, and upper-level
energy will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms over the
Tennessee/Lower Mississippi Valleys through Sunday morning.  The
showers and thunderstorms will produce heavy rain over the area.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable through Saturday morning.
The excessive rainfall threat will continue over the region on
Saturday into Sunday morning.

A front over the Northern Rockies into the Great Basin will move
eastward across the Northern/Central Plains into parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley before dissipating on Monday.  The system
will produce showers and thunderstorms over parts of the
Intermountain West into the Great Basin on Saturday evening into
Sunday. On Sunday, the showers and thunderstorms will move east
across the Upper Midwest. Some of the thunderstorms may become
severe.  Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Northern/Central Plains and the
Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley from Sunday morning into Monday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.

Elsewhere, Red Flag Warnings and an Elevated fire weather risk
remain across parts of the Great Basin through Sunday morning. Air
Quality Alerts are also in effect throughout Central California
and Central/Eastern Oregon due to thick wildfire smoke.
Furthermore, Below-average temperatures are forecast for much of
the western and north-central U.S., while muggy heat and humidity
conditions remain over the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley. Heat Advisories have been issued from eastern Oklahoma to
southern Louisiana, where heat indices could approach 110F.
Meanwhile, Excessive Heat Warnings are in effect for parts of
Louisiana and coastal Mississippi, including New Orleans, LA.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CDT Sun Aug 22 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...Synopsis...
A midlevel shortwave trough currently over the northern
Intermountain West this morning is forecast to move
east-northeastward across the northern Rockies/Plains throughout the
day.  Behind the shortwave trough, enhanced westerly flow aloft will
linger over the northern/central High Plains.  At the surface, a low
pressure system over eastern Montana will deepen throughout the day
as it moves northeastward into southern Manitoba.  An associated
cold front will shift eastward across the northern/central Plains,
leaving downslope westerly winds in its wake.

...Portions of southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, and
the Nebraska Panhandle...
Westerly post-frontal winds should result in rapid drying and
warming throughout the day across the region in a favored
downslope-flow regime.  Additionally, enhanced westerly flow aloft
will be mixed down to the surface as the boundary layer deepens
through the afternoon.  As a result, sustained westerly surface
winds will likely exceed 20 mph in the afternoon with gusts commonly
exceeding 30 mph. While RH values may not fall below critical
values, they will be low enough (15-20%) to elevate fire weather
concerns, especially for locations that have received little rain
over the past few days.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0148 AM CDT Sun Aug 22 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
Another shortwave trough is forecast to move eastward from the
Pacific Northwest across Montana on Monday.  An enhanced belt of
west-southwesterly flow aloft associated with this trough will move
across the northern Intermountain West/Rockies.  At the surface, low
pressure will develop over southeastern Montana by Monday afternoon.

...Central/Northeastern Wyoming...
Warm and dry conditions will lead to very deep, well-mixed boundary
layers across the region by the afternoon.  With enhanced
west-southwesterly flow aloft glancing the region, vertical mixing
should promote sustained afternoon winds approaching 20 mph with
gusts around 30 mph.  When coupled with afternoon RH values falling
below 15%, elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions will
be possible, especially considering the dry fuels across the area
(ERC values generally exceeding the 90th percentile).

Valid 12Z Wed Aug 25 2021 - 12Z Sun Aug 29 2021

...Upper Midwest heavy rain potential late week into the weekend...


...Overview...

Guidance maintains a fairly typical late-summer pattern during the
forecast period.  Flow across southern Canada and the northern
contiguous U.S. will push along a couple rainfall-focusing
waves/frontal systems, with the Upper Midwest region likely to see
the heaviest activity.  Meanwhile a broad upper ridge over the
South and parts of the East will maintain hot and humid
conditions.  The most oppressive heat/humidity combination is
likely to continue into midweek or so over the Mississippi Valley
and vicinity.  Recent consensus has been showing a West
Coast/Northwest upper troughing departing toward the Plains,
allowing a southern tier ridge to bridge across California and
join with an East Pacific ridge--supporting another West Coast
heat wave from late week through the weekend.  Some new 00Z
guidance is casting some doubt on this scenario though.  At the
same time slow retrogression of a western Atlantic ridge may
ultimately reinforce ridging over the East.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Most models and the ensemble means have been identifying two
primary features within the southern Canada/northern U.S. flow but
with some detail differences and run-to-run variability.  For the
leading system tracking eastward from central North America
mid-late week, the 12Z CMC became the most suspect solution by day
5 Friday and beyond--closing off an upper low near Nova Scotia
instead of carrying the core of the upper trough well northward.
The new run is closer to consensus.  Meanwhile some guidance has
trended a little more amplified over eastern Canada in a partial
nod to some recent GFS runs.  The upstream trough expected to
track from the Northwest into the Plains still exhibits various
trends and differences in character due in part to involvement of
multiple pieces of shortwave energy.  Heading into yesterday there
had been somewhat of a faster trend but 12Z/18Z consensus had
become a bit slower and more amplified.  The new 00Z GFS and ECMWF
have added a new wrinkle, trending out of sync with other guidance
(including the GEFS mean) for northeastern Pacific flow by the
latter half of the period.  This leads to a shortwave dropping
into the Northwest instead of feeding into the Plains trough.  It
will be interesting to see if/how much the 00Z ECMWF mean follows
this idea.  The 12Z/18Z GFS runs compared much better to the means
(and also somewhat better versus the 12Z ECMWF) late in the period.

In the tropical realm, attention will turn to the northwestern
Caribbean through the western Gulf of Mexico where guidance is
suggesting at least a wave if not a defined tropical system.  CMC
runs had been on the strong and northern side of the spread though
the new 00Z run has trended southward, a sensible adjustment given
the prevalence of upper ridging to the north.  The manual forecast
for Sunday depicts extrapolation of yesterday's tropical wave for
Saturday that was coordinated with the National Hurricane Center.

A blend of 12Z/18Z operational models represented consensus well
for days 3-4 Wednesday-Thursday.  The questionable 12Z CMC
over/near the Northeast required phasing out its solution after
Thursday and increasing detail uncertainties led to increasing 18Z
GEFS/12Z ECens input by next weekend.  The 12Z/18Z GEFS and 12Z
ECMWF provided some continued operational model weight through the
weekend.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Surface waves and associated fronts will cross the northern U.S.
and southern Canada, producing episodes of showers and
thunderstorms that could be locally heavy.  Guidance continues to
highlight the best potential for heavy rainfall over the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Midwest from late this week into the
weekend.  This region will see an early frontal passage, followed
by the front stalling to the south (Mid-Mississippi Valley) and
then lifting back north as a warm front ahead of another system
whose trailing cold front will move into the area during next
weekend.  Parts of this region have been dry recently so some of
the rain may initially be beneficial.  However a multi-day period
of significant rainfall could end up being problematic over some
areas.  Central and southern parts of the East may see areas of
diurnally-favored convection within a humid and warm to hot
airmass.  Upper level energy from a combination of the tail end of
the initial East Coast trough and what tracks underneath the
western Atlantic ridge may enhance convection over parts of the
South and/or southern Mid-Atlantic.  Specific details of this
energy have low predictability.  Rainfall may increase along the
central/western Gulf Coast next Sunday as a possible wave reaches
the western Gulf of Mexico.

Very warm to hot temperatures from the central-southern Plains
through much of the East as of Wednesday (plus 10F or so anomalies
for highs from the Mid Mississippi Valley into Northeast) should
gradually moderate with time, especially with highs trending to
within a few degrees of normal by next Sunday.  The highest heat
index values should be on Wednesday over the Mid/Lower Mississippi
Valley and along the Gulf Coast where max values may locally reach
110F or so.  Morning lows will be more persistently above normal
with areas from the Midwest into Great Lakes/Ohio Valley tending
to see readings stay close to or a little above 10F above normal
through the period.  Some daily records for warm lows may be
challenged even away from areas with the highest anomalies.  A
cold front and trailing high pressure will bring the Northeast a
break from the warmth late week into the weekend.  Based on recent
guidance consensus, expansion of the upper ridge across southern
parts of the West would support increasing coverage of highs 5-10F
above normal over southern parts of the West and then across much
of California later in the week, followed by up to plus 10-15F
highs reaching western Oregon next weekend.  More western
troughing aloft in the new 00Z GFS/ECMWF would significantly
curtail this warming trend though.  The Northern Plains region
will be consistently cool during the period.  Some 10-15F below
normal highs are possible from Wednesday into Saturday.

...Hurricane Henri to make landfall over Southern New England this
afternoon and produce damaging winds, heavy rain, and dangerous
storm surge across the region...

...Isolated severe thunderstorms possible across parts of the
Central and Northern Great Plains into the Mid-Missouri Valley
today...

...Oppressive heat found across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
portions of the Southern Plains...

The center of Hurricane Henri is currently located southeast of
Long Island and moving north toward Southern New England. This
track will likely lead to Henri making landfall sometime this
afternoon as either a tropical storm or category 1 hurricane
between western Long Island and Rhode Island. Heavy rain is
already occurring away from the center of the storm across New
Jersey, which has led to numerous flash flood warnings overnight.
Conditions are likely to drastically deteriorate throughout
Southern New England this morning as Henri approaches. Dangerous
storm surge is expected from Long Island to southeastern
Massachusetts, where Storm Surge Warnings are in effect, and
damaging winds are likely to topple numerous trees and powers
lines. Gusty winds are expected to extend farther inland across
Massachusetts by tonight as Henri weakens and continues to push
northward. Meanwhile, heavy rain and flash flooding will also
remain a major concern as upwards of 10 inches of rain could fall
from New Jersey to New England. WPC has issued a Moderate Risk
(level 3/4) of excessive rainfall across this region. Henri's
forward speed is forecast to slow down after landfall and linger
over parts of New England on Monday before exiting eastern Maine
as a post-tropical cyclone by Tuesday. Therefore, impacts
associated with heavy rain may last through Monday.

Throughout the central U.S., a potent upper-level low is forecast
to enter the Northern Plains today and spark scattered
thunderstorms over the Northern and Central Plains. A few storms
may turn severe and produced damaging wind gusts, large hail, and
isolated tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe weather between far southern
North Dakota and far northern Kansas, extending into western Iowa
as well. Scattered thunderstorms may also impact the Southeast
through this evening. However, the main hazard with these storms
will be associated with heavy rain. A tropical airmass and surface
trough could produce thunderstorms capable of intense rainfall
rates and isolated instances of flash flooding, particularly over
eastern South Carolina.

Temperatures across the central and eastern United States are
forecast to gradually turn hotter through midweek as an
upper-level ridge builds over the southern tier. Oppressive heat
will already be found across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
parts of the Southern Plains today, as heat and humidity push heat
indices up to around 110F. Heat Advisories have been issued for
eastern Oklahoma, northeast Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and
Louisiana.

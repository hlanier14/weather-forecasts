...Heavy Rain Threat with Fred to focus over the
Southeast/South-Central Appalachians early next week...
...Tropical Storm Grace may threaten southern Florida and move
into the Gulf of Mexico later next week...
...Monsoonal moisture from the Southwest/Great Basin leads into
emerging Heavy Rain Threat over the north-central U.S. mid-later
next week...


...Pattern Overview...

An upper level shortwave trough will work through the northern
Rockies and northern Plains early in the forecast period then lift
well north into Canada as upper level ridging off the Southeast
U.S. asserts itself westward over the southern U.S. by next
weekend. This will favor synoptic storm tracks across the Plains
and Great Lakes. Attention focuses also on two tropical systems -
Fred as it moves inland across the Southeast and South-Central
Appalachians and Tropical Storm Grace as it nears southern Florida
late in the week and then could move into the Gulf of Mexico by
next weekend. Both systems will pose a heavy rainfall threat.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest model guidance suite was reasonably clustered for the
Northwest to northern Plains shortwave trough, though there
remains some uncertainty in how much if any energy splits into a
closed low over the Intermountain West. For now, the WPC blend
favored a more progressive/flatter system that leaned on the
ensemble means by day 5 onward. By the end of the period, signals
are that the upper pattern takes on a more zonal direction with
several impulses quickly moving through the flow - overall
uncertainty/spread is higher than normal for day 6 and day 7.
Other areas of uncertainties are associated with the tropics -
particularly for Grace as it emerges into the Gulf of Mexico late
in the week and next weekend. The strength/position of the upper
level ridging off the Southeast U.S. may shunt the system further
west/southwest but the ECENS/GEFS members show a wide spread, with
the GFS being the southern solution scenario while the ECENS,
including its deterministic run, show a weaker ridge that allows
the system to curve northward toward the central Gulf Coast. For
now, following the latest NHC advisory, a compromise of the two
scenarios was used with the caveat that model spread and
uncertainty is higher than normal for the system.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Tropical moisture is expected to lift northward across interior
portions of the Southeast and southern Appalachians after Fred
makes landfall, potentially interacting with a stalled frontal
boundary and terrain enhancement. There remains some uncertainty
in the heaviest rainfall axis however across the southern
Appalachians, Deep South, and TN/OH Valleys are the favored
locations for several inches of rainfall that may lead to flash
flooding. For Tropical Storm Grace, heavy rainfall hazards may
impact the southern Florida peninsula and then the system may
emerge into the Gulf of Mexico by next weekend. It's too early to
tell where the system goes beyond that. Follow the latest NHC
advisories for the most updated forecast information.

Elsewhere, monsoonal moisture activity over the Desert
Southwest/Great Basin will again bring a localized flash flood
risk. Moisture should stream northward and northeastward ahead of
the incoming Northwest to north-central U.S. upper trough, with a
potential for moderate to heavy rainfall/convection emerging from
the northern Rockies/high Plains to the north-central Plains and
mid-upper MS Valley mid-later next week, with organized and
enhanced rainfall focusing along a developing frontal system.

0235 AM CDT Sun Aug 15 2021

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTH-CENTRAL
MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
The persistent mid-level anticyclone across the West will start to
break down late on Sunday as a short-wave trough impinges upon its
northern periphery over the Pacific Northwest. Before breakdown
commences, another hot and unstable day will occur across a large
portion of the West. Farther east, broadly cyclonic mid-level flow
will persist across the eastern United States despite a nondescript
height field.

... Wind/RH Areas -- North-central Oregon, much of eastern
Washington, and much of Montana ...

The aforementioned short-wave trough and associated speed maximum
will move across interior portions of the Pacific Northwest and into
the northern Rockies during the forecast period. This belt of
enhanced westerly flow will support strong downslope flow in the lee
of the Cascades across the interior Pacific Northwest and in the lee
of the northern Rockies across Montana. The result will be gusty
afternoon westerly surface winds across these areas, potentially
exceeding 30 mph. Additionally, adiabatic warming from the
downsloping winds will allow relative humidity to fall into the
10-15% range. The result is elevated to critical fire conditions
across these areas.

At this time, the most likely area for critical conditions will
occur across portions of north-central Montana where the greatest
confidence and duration of hot, dry, and windy conditions will
occur. Secondary and tertiary areas of potential critical conditions
will occur across east-central Washington, near and around Spokane,
and across north-central Oregon, in the vicinity and to the west of
Pendleton. Here, lower confidence in the combination of minimum
relative humidity falling below 20% overlapping winds exceeding 20
mph for more than three hours will preclude the introduction of
critical delineation with this outlook. However, locally critical
conditions are possible.

... Dry Thunderstorm Area -- Northern California, Oregon, and areas
to the north and east ...

Mid-level moisture being advected around the large western
anticyclone will combine with another day of diurnal heating to
support terrain-driven circulations capable of initiating
thunderstorms. Thunderstorms across the Sierra will be closely tied
to these terrain circulations and relatively slow-moving, capable of
producing wetting rains. Farther north, the influence of the
previously identified speed maximum moving across the interior
Pacific Northwest will support faster storm motions and a decreased
likelihood of wetting rains across far northeast California and
eastern Oregon. Farther northeast -- across portions of central
Idaho -- a small signal for dry thunderstorms is apparent in the 00
UTC high-resolution guidance. However, confidence in thunderstorm
potential here is too low to warrant probabilistic delineation.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTH-CENTRAL INTO NORTHEAST
MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
The breakdown of the western anticyclone will continue on Monday as
a lead mid-level speed maximum lifts through the northern Rockies
and a stronger mid-level trough moves into the Pacific Northwest
overnight Monday. Further east, across the central United States,
broadly cyclonic mid-level flow associated with a pocket of cooler
mid-level temperatures will persist.

... Wind/RH Area #1 -- Much of northern Montana and northern North
Dakota ...

The mid-level flow will strengthen on Monday as a lead speed maximum
moves from the interior Pacific Northwest into southern
Saskatchewan.  This belt of enhanced westerly flow will support
strong downslope flow in the lee of the northern Rockies across
Montana and North Dakota. The result will be gusty afternoon
westerly surface winds across these areas, potentially exceeding 30
mph. Additionally, adiabatic warming from the downsloping winds will
allow relative humidity to fall into the 10-15% range. The result is
elevated to critical fire conditions across these areas. At this
time, the most likely area for critical conditions will occur across
portions of north-central and northeast Montana, where the greatest
confidence and duration of hot, dry, and windy conditions will
occur.

... Wind/RH Area #2 -- North-central Oregon and South-central
Washington ...

In the wake of the departing mid-level speed maximum, winds will
temporarily relax early in the forecast period, before strengthening
again in response to the approaching stronger mid-level trough. This
strengthening flow will support an elevated risk of fire conditions
as surface winds strengthen to around 20 mph with gusts exceeding 30
mph locally. The mitigating factor is that cooler surface
temperatures than in previous days, owing to the lowering heights,
will support higher minimum relative humidity. Thus, despite
stronger winds than on Sunday/Day1, critical conditions should be
limited to isolated/brief areas.

... Wind/RH Area #3 -- Western Great Basin ...

The last vestiges of the weakening western ridge will be felt across
western portions of the Great Basin. Here, strong diurnal heating
will once again contribute to a deep, well-mixed boundary layer
allowing minimum relative humidity to fall into the low teens.
Surface troughing will increase in the lee of the Sierra on Monday
supporting an increase in surface winds over previous days. Although
sustained winds will likely remain in the 10-20 mph range, frequent
gusts approaching 30 mph will support elevated fire concerns.

... Dry Thunderstorm Area -- Northern Nevada, much of Idaho,
northwest Wyoming, and southwest Montana ...

Large-scale ascent associated with the approaching Pacific Northwest
mid-level trough should be sufficient to result in high-based
showers and thunderstorms across the area. Dry low levels and fast
storm motions should limit the potential for wetting rains and
support a risk for lightning-induced fire starts.

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding are expected along a
slow-moving frontal system in the eastern CONUS...

...Fred will reform into a tropical storm and impact portions of
Florida into the Southeast with heavy rain and gusty winds...

...Another potentially record-breaking hot day for portions of the
West, along with poor air quality and fire danger...

Multiple weather features will continue to set up to the south of
a typical summer jet stream focused along the northern U.S. and
Canada. One area of concern over the next few days will be the
eastern third of the U.S., with heavy rain and flash flooding
expected. A frontal system is forecast to meander around the
region and provide a place for above normal moisture to focus,
causing possibly multiple rounds of heavy rain. Today and tonight,
a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in place for the
Southern/Central Appalachians and into portions of the southern
Mid-Atlantic, where scattered flash floods are possible. The
greatest flash flooding threat should move northward a bit with
the front on Monday, over parts of the Ohio Valley/Central
Appalachians and into the Mid-Atlantic.

The area of troughing/low pressure in the eastern Gulf of Mexico
that once was Tropical Storm Fred is expected to redevelop into a
tropical storm later today. Fred is then expected to move
northwestward and northward through the Gulf and is currently
forecast to make landfall somewhere in the central Gulf Coast
around Monday evening. Heavy rainfall and gusty winds can be
expected along its track. Most of the rain may stay offshore of
Florida today and tonight if the system takes a western track away
from the Florida Gulf Coast, but by Monday into Tuesday, very
heavy rain should begin over the Florida Panhandle and the
Southeast. Slight Risks of excessive rainfall are in place for the
scattered flash flooding threat.

Another hazard early this week will be the hot temperatures, which
will continue to be oppressive and possibly break daily record
maximum and minimum temperatures across much of the western U.S.
Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories are in place mainly in
lower elevations of California and the Intermountain West as
temperatures soar into the 100s. The heat is forecast to spread
into the Northern Plains, with highs around 100F there as well. In
addition to the heat, Air Quality Alerts are in place for the
Northwest and into parts of the Rockies given smoke from fires and
high ozone levels. Unfortunately, isolated dry thunderstorms and
Elevated to Critical fire conditions remain a threat through at
least Monday as well, which could worsen the ongoing fire
situation in the West. Relief from the heat is expected in the
Northwest Monday and Tuesday as a cold front pushes through and
temperatures cool, but temperatures remain near 100F in the
Northern Plains. Meanwhile, cooler temperatures are expected over
portions of the Southwest into the Southern High Plains, along
with the chance for rain and thunderstorms as monsoonal moisture
continues to stream into the region. Flash floods are possible
over the next couple days, and Flash Flood Watches remain in
effect today over southern Arizona and New Mexico and into far
western Texas.

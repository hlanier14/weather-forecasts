Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0949 AM CST Wed Mar 03 2021

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

The ongoing forecast is on track and no changes are needed.  Surface
flow is expected to increase dramatically across Arizona today as a
storm system approaches California.  Initially, a dry airmass will
reside across the state, though gradual moistening will occur from
southwest to northeast, resulting in rising RH values.  The current
elevated delineation highlights areas where elevated to locally
critical fire weather will exist for at least a few hours today.

See the previous discussion below for more information.

..Cook.. 03/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CST Wed Mar 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
A closed upper low will move into southern California during the day
today, overspreading moderate to strong mid-level flow across the
Southwest and into the southern Great Basin. At the surface, an area
of low pressure will strengthen as it moves into southern Nevada by
evening. The combination of the strengthening pressure gradient and
deep mixing transporting stronger flow from aloft toward the surface
will bring strengthening surface flow. Winds are expected to be
around 25 mph across much of southern Arizona. Dry surface
conditions will be in place with RH of 8 to 15 percent, but moisture
advection from the southwest will lead to increasing humidity,
especially across southwest Arizona. Current elevated area
highlights where humidity will be minimally impacted by increasing
moisture and where duration of the stronger winds will be long
enough for some large-fire concerns.

1232 PM CST Wed Mar 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND
WEST TEXAS...

The ongoing forecast is on track and no changes are needed.  Broad
areas of elevated to critical fire-weather are expected to develop
along and west of a dryline oriented generally along the I-27
corridor in west Texas.  See the previous discussion below for more
information.

..Cook.. 03/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CST Wed Mar 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
A closed upper low will move eastward across the southern Rockies
during the day Thursday. A lee cyclone is expected to develop in
southeast Colorado and move southeast into the TX/OK Panhandles
through the day. Dry conditions are expected west of the dry line
with relative humidity of 5 to 13 percent. In this area, strong
winds of 20 to 30 mph are also likely. The strongest winds will
likely be in northeast New Mexico/western TX Panhandle where the
gradient is maximized and in southeast New Mexico where mid-level
flow will be the strongest. Some guidance suggests sustained winds
in excess of 30 mph are possible in the TX Panhandle. Therefore,
critical conditions are likely in this area.

147 PM EST Wed Mar 03 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Mar 06 2021 - 12Z Wed Mar 10 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The synoptic pattern across the CONUS during the period is
expected to feature quasi-persistent troughing over the eastern
Pacific / West Coast while deep troughing over the East Coast this
weekend quickly is replaced by zonal flow to ridging by early to
mid next week. The troughing over the West Coast is expected to
bring an unsettled to active period of sensible weather with
several episodes of precipitation. By Tuesday/Wednesday next week,
a more significant shortwave could track across the Rockies and
result in a deepening low over the Plains with more widespread
precipitation across portions of the north-central/east U.S.
Downstream ridging over the East Coast could bring a few days of
above normal temperatures by day 7.

Model guidance spread has lessened somewhat this cycle with
respect to the overall pattern. Earlier timing issues between the
GFS and other global models have lessened and more or less, an
agreeable progression has set up. The East Coast trough and
associated sprawling high pressure shows high agreement between
the various models and should exit offshore late in the
weekend/Monday. A shortwave trough moving onshore the West Coast
on day 3 /Saturday/ will ripple through the flow and weaken as it
opens up over the Plains on day 5 /Monday/. Here, there remain
some timing/strength differences where the GFS is still
flatter/faster, but the spread is fairly minimal for being day
3-5. Finally, persistent closed low wobbling over the eastern
Pacific offshore Washington will bring several shortwave troughs
the flow in fast progression early to mid week. There is fairly
good agreement in the large scale pattern between the
GFS/ECMWF/CMC. Overall, the WPC blend had average to slightly
above average forecast confidence and primarily was made up of the
latest ECMWF/GFS/GFSP/CMC with higher weights toward the ECMWF and
ECENS (in latter periods).


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The sensible weather highlights include the unsettled weather
pattern expected for the West Coast with a parade of weather
systems bringing rain and higher elevation snow mainly from
northern California to the Pacific Northwest. Precipitation could
be moderate to locally heavy at times with highest five-day totals
(perhaps reaching several inches) most likely over southwest
Oregon into northern California. This unsettled weather then is
forecast to spread to the Interior West and Rockies though with
less intensity. This system will eject into the Plains by the
middle of next week and could spawn a deepening/significant low
pressure. With an open source/return flow from the Gulf of Mexico,
widespread precipitation, rain, thunderstorms will be possible
across the warm sector while colder/northern areas could see a
round of wintry weather.

Much above normal temperatures over the Northern Plains this
weekend, reaching 10-25F above normal, will gradually extend
eastward into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes with less extreme
warmth also reaching into the Northeast by late in the period.
Some daily records for highs and/or warm lows will be possible.
By next Tuesday-Wednesday well above normal readings for morning
lows in particular will extend well southward over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley as Gulf inflow increases.  Elsewhere, a cooling
trend toward moderately below normal readings will spread across
the western U.S. during the period.  East Coast states will be
chilly during the weekend with highs 5-10F or so below normal and
then trend warmer.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The synoptic pattern across the CONUS during the period is
expected to feature quasi-persistent troughing over the eastern
Pacific / West Coast while deep troughing over the East Coast this
weekend quickly is replaced by zonal flow to ridging by early to
mid next week. The troughing over the West Coast is expected to
bring an unsettled to active period of sensible weather with
several episodes of precipitation. By Tuesday/Wednesday next week,
a more significant shortwave could track across the Rockies and
result in a deepening low over the Plains with more widespread
precipitation across portions of the north-central/east U.S.
Downstream ridging over the East Coast could bring a few days of
above normal temperatures by day 7.

Model guidance spread has lessened somewhat this cycle with
respect to the overall pattern. Earlier timing issues between the
GFS and other global models have lessened and more or less, an
agreeable progression has set up. The East Coast trough and
associated sprawling high pressure shows high agreement between
the various models and should exit offshore late in the
weekend/Monday. A shortwave trough moving onshore the West Coast
on day 3 /Saturday/ will ripple through the flow and weaken as it
opens up over the Plains on day 5 /Monday/. Here, there remain
some timing/strength differences where the GFS is still
flatter/faster, but the spread is fairly minimal for being day
3-5. Finally, persistent closed low wobbling over the eastern
Pacific offshore Washington will bring several shortwave troughs
the flow in fast progression early to mid week. There is fairly
good agreement in the large scale pattern between the
GFS/ECMWF/CMC. Overall, the WPC blend had average to slightly
above average forecast confidence and primarily was made up of the
latest ECMWF/GFS/GFSP/CMC with higher weights toward the ECMWF and
ECENS (in latter periods).


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The sensible weather highlights include the unsettled weather
pattern expected for the West Coast with a parade of weather
systems bringing rain and higher elevation snow mainly from
northern California to the Pacific Northwest. Precipitation could
be moderate to locally heavy at times with highest five-day totals
(perhaps reaching several inches) most likely over southwest
Oregon into northern California. This unsettled weather then is
forecast to spread to the Interior West and Rockies though with
less intensity. This system will eject into the Plains by the
middle of next week and could spawn a deepening/significant low
pressure. With an open source/return flow from the Gulf of Mexico,
widespread precipitation, rain, thunderstorms will be possible
across the warm sector while colder/northern areas could see a
round of wintry weather.

Much above normal temperatures over the Northern Plains this
weekend, reaching 10-25F above normal, will gradually extend
eastward into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes with less extreme
warmth also reaching into the Northeast by late in the period.
Some daily records for highs and/or warm lows will be possible.
By next Tuesday-Wednesday well above normal readings for morning
lows in particular will extend well southward over the Plains and

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST March 03 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast over the western contiguous U.=
S.
resulting in below normal temperatures and continued increased precipitatio=
n
chances along the Pacific Coast. Downstream, mid-level high pressure is
forecast across portions of the eastern lower-48 states early in the period=
.
An
active frontal region may set up between these mid-level high and low press=
ure
areas bringing enhanced precipitation chances to portions of the east-centr=
al
contiguous U.S. Transient mid-level flow is favored across Alaska with
intermittent surface lows forecast to impact the western and southern parts=
 of
the state throughout the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Northern and Central
Plains, Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Tennessee Valley, and Ohio Valley,
Thu-Wed, Mar 11-17.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Pacific
Northwest, California, Great Basin, and Southwest, Thu-Sat, Mar 11-13.

Flooding possible for portions of the Ohio River Valley.

oZTJz8eJjK5$

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 11 - WEDNESDAY MARCH 17: At the onset of the week-2 peri=
od,
the 6z GEFS, 0z ECMWF, and 0z Canadian ensembles are in good agreement in
regards to mid-level troughing moving into the western CONUS. The greatest
onshore flow and moisture advection is favored on days 6 and 7, allowing th=
e
heavy precipitation and snow hazards highlighted over the region yesterday =
to
be discontinued. However, shortwave impulses are still forecast to propagat=
e
through the mean trough axis, enhancing precipitation chances (rain and hig=
h
elevation snow) across portions of the Pacific Northwest and California
throughout the period. Exact timing and spatial coverage is uncertain, and =
the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools keep probabilities under 20% in most places
for
3-day precipitation exceeding the 85th percentile. Therefore, no related ne=
w
precipitation hazards are depicted at this time.



The troughing over the western CONUS favors below normal temperatures to
expand
across the region. The GEFS reforecast tool has greater spatial coverage of
20%
or greater probabilities for minimum temperatures dropping below the 15th
percentile compared to the ECMWF reforecast tool. The ECMWF reforecast tool=
 is
confined to mostly California and the Southwest with these enhanced
probabilities, and only for the early part of the period. The GEFS tool als=
o
depicts these increased probabilities over parts of the Pacific Northwest,
Great Basin, and Rockies. The sight risk for below normal temperatures haza=
rd
is reduced in coverage compared to yesterday due to the less robust ECMWF
guidance, and because much of the anomalous cold is forecast to be associat=
ed
with maximum temperatures. The hazard is valid for 3/11-3/13 coinciding wit=
h
the elevated probabilities in the ECMWF reforecast tool. Subfreezing overni=
ght
temperatures are favored across most of the highlighted area, with minimum
temperatures over some of the mountainous regions possibly falling into the
teens (deg F). Although slightly warmer temperatures are forecast across th=
e
California Central Valley, patchy frost will be a concern with overnight
temperatures possibly dropping below 40 deg F.



This same trough axis is also forecast to result in one or more areas of
surface low pressure ejecting out of the Rockies during week-2. Impacts wil=
l
be
dependent on the exact track and strength of the lows, but increased chance=
s
of
heavy precipitation are likely across portions of the Northern Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Tennessee Valley, and the Ohio Valley wher=
e
the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools both continue to depict at least a 20%
chance that 3-day precipitation totals exceed the 85th percentile. A slight
risk for heavy precipitation is posted across these regions for all of week=
-2.
Although the greatest potential looks to be in the early part of the period
based on the reforecast tools, the synoptic pattern supports the heavy
precipitation potential through the end of the period. Wintry precipitation=
 is
possible on the northwestern side of these systems, with increased frontal
convergence and rain favored in the warm sector to the southeast of the
surface
low tracks. River flooding is ongoing across portions of the Ohio River
Valley.
Although dry conditions are generally forecast prior to the start of week-2=
,
river levels may remain elevated in some areas, and any additional
precipitation during week-2 would once again potentially bring some areas b=
ack
above flood stage. Therefore a flooding possible hazard is depicted across =
the
region.



A transient pattern is forecast across Alaska, with zonal flow developing
across the state and troughing upstream over the Bering Sea. This favors
multiple surface low pressure systems to impact the Aleutians and Mainland
Alaska during week-2. Given that temperatures are also likely to average be=
low
normal, increased snowfall is also favored especially across southwestern
Mainland Alaska. The surface lows crossing the Bering Sea are likely to
increase the risk of high winds along the coast of the southwestern Mainlan=
d
and over the Aleutians, however, wind speeds are not forecast to reach haza=
rds
thresholds.

...A low pressure system will spread precipitation across the
southwestern to south-central CONUS...

...Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather are in place for
portions of the Southwest and Southern High Plains...

An area of low pressure will spread rain and snow showers across
an area extending from the Southwest to the Lower Mississippi
Valley tonight through Friday night. Increasing winds and dry
conditions will contribute to an Elevated fire weather threat out
ahead of the approaching system over much of Arizona tonight. Red
Flag Warnings are in effect as well for this area. Snow is likely
to spread over the Central/Southern Rockies as the system moves
over the region tonight into Thursday. Between 4-8 inches of snow
can be expected over the Central/Southern Rockies while some of
Colorado's peaks may receive higher amounts. The fire weather
threat will shift into the New Mexico-Texas border area on
Thursday in the form of a Critical Fire Weather area as winds pick
up ahead of the approaching system and a dryline sets up somewhere
over the region. Rain and scattered thunderstorms will spread over
the Central/Southern Plains on Thursday, before sliding into the
Lower Mississippi Valley on Friday as the low pressure system
dives down into the Gulf Coast.

Meanwhile, light snow will continue over the Lower Great lakes
through tomorrow, on the backside of a passing cold front.
Temperatures will fall well below average over much of the
Northeast and coastal Mid/Atlantic on the backside of this front.
A stationary boundary draped across the Great Plains and surface
ridging to the east will trap warm air over the Northern Plains
for the next several days. A low pressure system will arrive over
the Pacific Northwest on Thursday, bringing with it the chance for
rain and mountain snow to the region and northern California.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 09 - 13 2021

Today's model forecasts are in very good agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America during the 6-10 day period. A
forecast
amplified mean trough favors negative 500-hPa height anomalies over western
Mainland Alaska and the western Aleutians. Ridging over northwestern Canada
has
become more amplified in today's model solutions, leading to positive mid-
level
height anomalies over eastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle. The easter=
n
and central Aleutians remain under the influence of the strong ridging
forecast
for the North Pacific, causing positive mid-level height anomalies. Over th=
e
CONUS, amplified troughing/ridging is favored in the western/eastern CONUS,
respectively.

Increased mid-level ridging over northwestern Canada, compared to yesterday=
's
6-10 day forecast, has resulted in an increased southerly component to the
mean
flow over Alaska. This increased southerly flow favors near to above-normal
temperatures across western and northern Mainland Alaska and near-normal
temperatures across the Aleutians. As low pressure systems move along the
northeastern periphery of the North Pacific ridge, cooler temperatures are
forecast on the back sides of these systems, leading to below-normal
temperature probabilities in southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle=
.
Enhanced probabilities of below-normal temperatures in the western CONUS ar=
e
associated with a forecast amplified mean trough and below-normal mid-level
heights. East of the Rockies, amplified ridging favors enhanced probabiliti=
es
of above-normal temperatures across much of the central and eastern CONUS,
with
the highest probabilities (>70%) over the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and
Northeast.

Enhanced southerly and southwesterly flow favors above-normal precipitation
across Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Odds tilt toward below-normal
precipitation in the Alaska Panhandle, associated with a forecast increase =
in
surface high pressure over northwestern Canada, relative to yesterday's mod=
el
solutions. Mean troughing centered over the West Coast increases probabilit=
ies
of above-normal precipitation over most of the western CONUS. Enhanced
above-normal precipitation probabilities extend into the Great Plains and
continue eastward to the Appalachians, associated with low pressure systems
that are likely to amplify in the lee of the Rockies and move off to the ea=
st
and northeast. Additionally, there is the potential for an enhancement of t=
he
subtropical jet by the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) early in the 6-10 da=
y
period, which may influence precipitation across areas of central and south=
ern
California via enhanced moisture advection. In the Southeast, below-normal
precipitation is favored under strong mean surface high pressure.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement offset slightly by disagreement among some of the
forecast
tools in the precipitation fields over western North America.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 11 - 17 2021

Today's model solutions depict a de-amplified pattern over the CONUS, relat=
ive
to yesterday's Week-2 forecast. Additionally, there is increased uncertaint=
y
among the models in the predicted mid-level height anomalies across the
forecast domain, particularly over Alaska and the central and eastern CONUS=
.
Increased ridging over northwestern Canada in today's model solutions resul=
ts
in an increased southerly component to the mean flow over Alaska. The
Aleutians
remain under the influence of strong North Pacific ridging, favoring near t=
o
above-normal 500-hPa heights. Mean ridging over the eastern CONUS is foreca=
st
to de-amplify during the Week-2 period, but remain, favoring positive mid-
level
height anomalies over the Southern Plains, Southeast, and Northeast. Broad
troughing over the western and central CONUS favors below-normal 500-hPa
heights across the West, Central and Northern Plains, and the Midwest.

With increased ridging east of Alaska and troughing to the west, probabilit=
ies
of below-normal temperatures are reduced due to increased southerly flow
during
the period, relative to yesterday's Week-2 forecast. Amplified troughing ov=
er
the western CONUS favors enhanced probabilities of below-normal temperature=
s
from the West Coast to the Central and Northern Plains. Conversely, amplifi=
ed
ridging and mean southerly flow across the eastern CONUS enhances odds of
above-normal temperatures from the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley t=
o
the East Coast. Due to the increased suppression of the mean ridge on it's
northwestern side in today's manual 500-hPa height blend, the highest
probabilities of above-normal temperatures (>60%) are favored in the
Southeast.

Increased southwesterly onshore flow favors above-normal precipitation over
much of Mainland Alaska and the eastern Aleutians. In the western CONUS,
above-normal precipitation is favored near the base of the broad mean troug=
h.
Elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities extend across the Central
Rockies and become more enhanced over the Midwest and Tennessee Valley, as
energy exiting the Rockies is forecast to amplify and move eastward. Across
the
southern Florida Peninsula, high pressure is favored to dominate, despite t=
he
potential for transient frontal boundaries, leading to a tilt in the odds
toward below-normal precipitation. In the southwestern CONUS, below-normal
precipitation is also favored, as frontal boundaries from low pressure syst=
ems
passing to the north are not expected to influence the region.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
large inconsistencies among the models in the predicted 500-hPa height patt=
ern
across the forecast domain.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The dominant feature of interest from Sunday through most of next
week will be an amplified eastern Pacific mean trough aloft that
gradually makes its way into the western U.S.  This trough will
support a broad area of rain and higher elevation snow across the
West along with below normal temperatures.  Meanwhile by
Tuesday-Wednesday a fairly vigorous shortwave expected to eject
from the trough is likely to produce a significant Northern Plains
storm system that should spread a broad area of precipitation
across the central/east-central U.S.  Ahead of this evolution, an
amplified East Coast upper trough will depart after Sunday and
eastern heights will continue to rise through the period as
ridging moves in from the central U.S. and an upper high builds
from Mexico into the Gulf around midweek.

There is decent consensus for the overall evolution within the
East Pacific into western U.S. upper trough.  The most likely
scenario has an upper low drifting southward off the Pacific
Northwest while energy flowing around the western/southern side of
this low reaches the West by Tuesday and then continues
northeastward to provide the dynamic support for the midweek
Northern Plains storm.  Meanwhile energy from the upper low off
the Northwest should drop southeastward and possibly combine with
upstream flow to yield an upper trough that reaches near the Great
Basin/Southwest by day 7 Thursday.

The primary forecast challenges involve the timing and evolution
of the ejecting energy that supports the Plains storm as well as
the overall amplitude of flow to the southeast--affecting
specifics of the surface system and how far southeastward the
trailing front extends.  Overall preference is to stay closest to
the ensemble means for timing later in the period, given
reasonable continuity thus far and intermediate position between
faster GFS runs and slower ECMWF runs.  The new 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted favorably faster for the northern tier storm.  GFS runs
through the 18Z cycle had been the most eager to close off an
upper low (though the 12Z ECMWF did the same but later), and while
the new 00Z GFS keeps the energy as an open wave it continues the
theme from previous runs of extending height falls and the cold
front farther southeastward than most other guidance.  It will
likely take additional time to resolve the specifics of how this
energy evolves given its medium to smaller scale lending itself to
lower predictability.  With the 18Z parallel GFS (GFSP) comparing
better to the means in principle versus operational GFS runs, the
initial blend followed a 12Z model consensus with the 18Z GFSP for
the GFS contribution early-mid period and then transitioned to
about half ensemble means and the rest weighted more to the GFSP
than 12Z ECMWF.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect a large portion of the West to see at least some
rain/higher elevation snow during the period.  Highest totals
should extend from southwestern Oregon through favored terrain in
California, perhaps maximizing along the Sierra Nevada.
Meaningful though more moderate precipitation is likely across the
Interior West and Rockies.  Energy ejecting into the Plains should
produce a fairly strong storm system that tracks across northern
tier locations Tuesday onward, with a broad area of precipitation
extending across the northern/eastern Plains and into the
east-central U.S.  Some wintry weather may be possible over
extreme northern locations depending on exactly how the storm
evolves.  Farther south there may be locally moderate to heavy
rainfall with the Middle Mississippi Valley and Lower Ohio Valley
currently the most likely to see highest rainfall totals.  Also
the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring the potential for some
strong to severe thunderstorms.  Check future outlooks as the
system's details come into clearer focus.  Around the end of the
period and beyond, the cold front anchored by the surface low
could stall with continued Gulf inflow helping to add to the
rainfall potential.  There is currently enough spread to temper
confidence in this scenario somewhat but it requires monitoring.

Much above normal temperatures will persist over the Northern
Plains/Midwest and expand into the Great Lakes through the first
part of next week with readings generally 10-25F above normal.
Daily records should be more numerous for warm lows than daytime
highs.  Development/progression of Northern Plains low pressure
and the trailing front Tuesday onward will finally push this
warmth more into the eastern half of the country by mid-late week.
 At that time morning lows should remain as warm as 15-25F above
normal while highs will likely be somewhat less extreme.  The West
will see a cooling trend spread across the region from west to
east during the period with highs tending to drop to 5-10F or so
below normal.  On the other hand the East Coast states will start
out chilly with similar negative anomalies on Sunday followed by a
steady warming trend.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The dominant feature of interest from Sunday through most of next
week will be an amplified eastern Pacific mean trough aloft that
gradually makes its way into the western U.S.  This trough will
support a broad area of rain and higher elevation snow across the
West along with below normal temperatures.  Meanwhile by
Tuesday-Wednesday a fairly vigorous shortwave expected to eject
from the trough is likely to produce a significant Northern Plains
storm system that should spread a broad area of precipitation
across the central/east-central U.S.  Ahead of this evolution, an
amplified East Coast upper trough will depart after Sunday and
eastern heights will continue to rise through the period as
ridging moves in from the central U.S. and an upper high builds
from Mexico into the Gulf around midweek.

There is decent consensus for the overall evolution within the
East Pacific into western U.S. upper trough.  The most likely
scenario has an upper low drifting southward off the Pacific
Northwest while energy flowing around the western/southern side of
this low reaches the West by Tuesday and then continues
northeastward to provide the dynamic support for the midweek
Northern Plains storm.  Meanwhile energy from the upper low off
the Northwest should drop southeastward and possibly combine with
upstream flow to yield an upper trough that reaches near the Great
Basin/Southwest by day 7 Thursday.

The primary forecast challenges involve the timing and evolution
of the ejecting energy that supports the Plains storm as well as
the overall amplitude of flow to the southeast--affecting
specifics of the surface system and how far southeastward the
trailing front extends.  Overall preference is to stay closest to
the ensemble means for timing later in the period, given
reasonable continuity thus far and intermediate position between
faster GFS runs and slower ECMWF runs.  The new 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted favorably faster for the northern tier storm.  GFS runs
through the 18Z cycle had been the most eager to close off an
upper low (though the 12Z ECMWF did the same but later), and while
the new 00Z GFS keeps the energy as an open wave it continues the
theme from previous runs of extending height falls and the cold
front farther southeastward than most other guidance.  It will
likely take additional time to resolve the specifics of how this
energy evolves given its medium to smaller scale lending itself to
lower predictability.  With the 18Z parallel GFS (GFSP) comparing
better to the means in principle versus operational GFS runs, the
initial blend followed a 12Z model consensus with the 18Z GFSP for
the GFS contribution early-mid period and then transitioned to
about half ensemble means and the rest weighted more to the GFSP
than 12Z ECMWF.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect a large portion of the West to see at least some
rain/higher elevation snow during the period.  Highest totals
should extend from southwestern Oregon through favored terrain in
California, perhaps maximizing along the Sierra Nevada.
Meaningful though more moderate precipitation is likely across the
Interior West and Rockies.  Energy ejecting into the Plains should
produce a fairly strong storm system that tracks across northern
tier locations Tuesday onward, with a broad area of precipitation
extending across the northern/eastern Plains and into the
east-central U.S.  Some wintry weather may be possible over
extreme northern locations depending on exactly how the storm
evolves.  Farther south there may be locally moderate to heavy
rainfall with the Middle Mississippi Valley and Lower Ohio Valley
currently the most likely to see highest rainfall totals.  Also
the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring the potential for some
strong to severe thunderstorms.  Check future outlooks as the
system's details come into clearer focus.  Around the end of the
period and beyond, the cold front anchored by the surface low
could stall with continued Gulf inflow helping to add to the
rainfall potential.  There is currently enough spread to temper
confidence in this scenario somewhat but it requires monitoring.

Much above normal temperatures will persist over the Northern
Plains/Midwest and expand into the Great Lakes through the first
part of next week with readings generally 10-25F above normal.
Daily records should be more numerous for warm lows than daytime
highs.  Development/progression of Northern Plains low pressure
and the trailing front Tuesday onward will finally push this
warmth more into the eastern half of the country by mid-late week.
 At that time morning lows should remain as warm as 15-25F above
normal while highs will likely be somewhat less extreme.  The West
will see a cooling trend spread across the region from west to
east during the period with highs tending to drop to 5-10F or so
below normal.  On the other hand the East Coast states will start
out chilly with similar negative anomalies on Sunday followed by a
steady warming trend.

...Snow is expected in the Central Rockies today while rain and
thunderstorms are likely in the Central/Southern Plains...

...A Critical Risk of fire weather is in place for the Southern
High Plains today...

...Precipitation will increase for the Pacific Northwest today and
in Northern California Friday...

A low pressure system is forecast to move southeastward across the
Southern Plains through Friday and into the Gulf of Mexico early
Saturday, spreading precipitation across the central U.S. and then
the Gulf Coast states. Snow is expected for higher elevations,
especially in the Central Rockies, where 6-12 inches could fall
today before ending tonight. Farther east, rain showers and
thunderstorms are forecast across the Central/Southern High
Plains. Rainfall amounts should be generally less than an inch,
but there is some chance thunderstorms could be strong to severe,
containing hail. Light showers and thunderstorms could then spread
across central and eastern portions of the Gulf Coast and into
Florida later Friday into Saturday.

Behind the dryline and cold front associated with the low pressure
system, fire danger will be a threat today with dry conditions and
gusty winds. A Critical Risk of fire weather is delineated by the
Storm Prediction Center over the Southern High Plains, along with
Wind Advisories and a Fire Weather Watch.

Rounds of upper-level energy spinning in the eastern Pacific and
approaching frontal systems will lead to increasing precipitation
chances in the Pacific Northwest today, spreading into Northern
California on Friday. Rain is expected along the coast and in
lower elevations, while higher elevations should see snow.
Snowfall of over a foot is forecast for the Shastas though
Saturday morning. Gusty winds are also possible in the West, and
Wind Advisories and High Wind Warnings are scattered into Oregon
and Northern California.

Elsewhere, rounds of fairly light snow are possible across the
interior Northeast over the next couple of days, which could end
up accumulating to a few inches in the Green Mountains and
Adirondacks. This will be in conjunction with cooler than normal
temperatures there over the next couple of days, which should
spread southward toward the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas Friday as a
cold front passes. Meanwhile, the Northern Plains can expect
warmer than average temperatures by 20 to 35 degrees over the next
couple days--highs could exceed 60 degrees.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS....

...Synopsis...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected in portions of the
southern High Plains today.

...Southern High Plains...
A closed mid-level low will move eastward across the southern
Rockies today. Lee cyclogenesis is expected to begin in southeast
Colorado early today before the surface low shifts southeastward
into the Texas Panhandle by evening. As this pressure gradient
tightens, winds are expected to increase to 20 to 30 mph across much
of the southern High Plains. The strongest winds will be from
southeast New Mexico into the western Texas Panhandle and eastern
New Mexico where the pressure gradient will be strongest and where
strong mid-level flow amid deep mixing will transport stronger winds
to the surface. Some breezy southeasterly conditions are expected
across Oklahoma and Kansas, but higher relative humidity and fuel
moisture will mitigate the overall fire weather threat in these
areas.

...North Carolina...
Dry and breezy downslope flow is expected in the lee of the
Appalachians today. The strongest winds of 15 to 20 mph are expected
in North Carolina where relative humidity is also forecast to drop
to 18 to 20 percent. Similar downslope flow scenarios and
Wednesday's observed relative humidity suggests relative humidity
may be even lower than this forecast. However, despite these dry and
breezy conditions expected, fuels are still somewhat moist in the
region. Coordination with local NWS offices suggests another day or
two of drying may be sufficient to support large fire spread, but at
this time, fuels are not supportive and therefore, no elevated
delineation has been added.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
...Great Basin into the Northwest...
Some dry and breezy conditions are expected in portions of the
western Great Basin into eastern Oregon on Friday as strong
mid-level flow overspreads the region and the surface pressure
gradient strengthens. However, fuels in this area are still moist
and therefore, no fire weather delineation is warranted.

...Texas...
Breezy conditions are expected in the wake of a cold front across
Texas on Friday, but high relative humidity and cool temperatures
will preclude the fire weather threat for much of this region. There
will be a narrow area near the Rio Grande which may have elevated
fire weather concerns, but this area is too small and conditions are
too marginal at this time for an elevated area to be added.

...Carolinas...
Dry downslope flow is expected on Friday in the Carolinas. Low
relative humidity is expected and fuels will likely be more dry
after dry and breezy conditions on Thursday. However, winds are
currently forecast to be lighter on Friday than Thursday which
precludes fire weather concerns. However, this will be monitored and
if 15+ mph winds appear more likely, an elevated area could be
needed.

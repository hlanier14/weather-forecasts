...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN
NEVADA...SOUTHWEST UTAH...AND NORTHERN ARIZONA...

No changes. Previous discussion follows.

..Bentley.. 05/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0102 AM CDT Wed May 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is noted off the coast of the Pacific
Northwest in early-morning water vapor imagery. This feature is
expected to begin deepening along the West Coast over the next 24
hours, which will place a belt of strengthening mid and upper-level
winds over the southern Great Basin late this afternoon. At the
surface, pressure falls over the inter-mountain West will lead to
increasing winds and a heightened fire weather concern across the
southern Great Basin and portions of the Southwest. Elsewhere across
the county, scattered rain chances and weak winds will limit
additional concerns.

...Southern Great Basin and the Southwest...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions continue to appear
likely late this afternoon as surface winds increase to 15-25 mph
across portions of the southern Great Basin and Southwest region.
Deep boundary-layer mixing will aid in downward transfer of 850-700
mb winds as they gradually strengthen to 30-40 mph by 22-00 UTC.
Confidence remains generally high that the strongest mid-level flow,
and the greatest potential for sustained critical conditions, will
reside across southern NV into adjacent areas of southern UT and
northwest AZ (though transient critical conditions are possible in
the peripheral elevated risk area). Early-morning surface
observations show poor overnight RH recovery with humidity values in
the low teens to 20s noted. Diurnal warming and deep mixing will
likely yield RH values in the 5-15% range for most locations.
Minimal precipitation across this region over the past two weeks has
resulted in receptive fuels that will further support the fire
weather conditions.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Cooling temperatures aloft coupled with a modest influx of mid-level
moisture will likely support isolated to scattered convection across
northern UT into western CO and adjacent areas of WY as lift ahead
of the approaching wave overspreads the region this afternoon.
Limited instability above a deep, well-mixed boundary layer with
PWAT values between 0.4 to 0.6 inches will likely support a mixture
of wet and dry thunderstorms. Isolated dry convection appears
probable, but modest fuel readiness across northeastern parts of the
Great Basin precludes a risk area.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 19 2021

SYNOPSIS: Model guidance and reforecast tools continue to maintain an elevated
potential for heavy precipitation and possible flooding throughout portions of
the Great Plains and the Mississippi Valley. Anomalously warm, and possibly
record breaking temperatures are favored over the Southeast and the
Mid-Atlantic early in the period but are expected to remain below excessive
heat thresholds. Over Alaska, onshore flow is expected to bring above-normal
precipitation to portions of the southern Mainland and Panhandle during
week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Central and Southern
Plains, and the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Thu-Mon, May 27-31.

Flooding possible for parts of the eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi
Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY MAY 22 - WEDNESDAY MAY 26:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!t1T3Um8_ze1E-sflBlvyqEcb3tWcDwg29JpHSlImoLF1-hEYDthoqYodyApV8NDi9RHKacAX$

FOR THURSDAY MAY 27 - WEDNESDAY JUNE 02: A relatively low amplitude 500-hPa
height pattern continues to be advertised by the dynamical models over the
contiguous U.S. during week-2. At the start of the period, both the 0z GEFS
and
0z ECMWF model runs favor anomalous mid-level ridging overspreading much of
the
eastern CONUS with amplified troughing confined to the higher latitudes of
eastern Canada. Upstream, dynamical models also depict anomalous mid-level
ridging centered over the Eastern Pacific, where the GEFS has become slightly
more amplified with this feature in the mean week-2 height fields compared to
previous guidance. Should this trend continue, this would favor the
development
of anomalous troughing downstream over the north-central CONUS in-between the
two positive height centers aloft. However, the ensembles remain rather
tenuous
with this realization during the period. Regardless, the forecast temperature
pattern closely follows the predicted 500-hPa height field, where the
strongest
signals for anomalous warmth look to continue from late week-1 into the start
of the period over parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, which then looks
to
moderate over the region as the mid-level ridging aloft weakens with time.



During late week-1, the Weather Prediction Center's (WPC) day-7 surface
analysis depicts high pressure settled over the Southeast with enhanced
southerly return flow favoring Gulf moisture advection into the Plains and the
Mississippi Valley. The predicted frontal activity tied to surface lows across
the Plains early in week-2 remains favorable for possible heavy precipitation
where reforecast tools continue to indicate at least a 20% chance for 3-day
rainfall accumulations exceeding an inch extending from the Southern Plains
into the Middle Mississippi Valley through the middle portion of the outlook
period. Compared to yesterday, there are higher daily precipitation amounts in
the ECMWF ensemble means and higher probabilities for 3-day precipitation
amounts exceeding the 85th percentile in the ECMWF reforecast tool indicated
further south into many parts of the Southern Plains. To account for this
trend, the slight risk of heavy precipitation is expanded further south into
Texas from May 27 to May 31. As much of Texas is now registering above-normal
streamflow and precipitation since last month, and with heavy rainfall
forecast
during week-1 particularly across the eastern half of the state, there is a
continued risk of localized flooding and river inundation across parts of
southern Oklahoma, eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Thus, the
possible flooding hazard is also expanded further east into Texas as minor to
moderate river flooding may persist into week-2.



Across the southeastern CONUS, both the GEFS and the ECWMF ensemble means
feature large positive 850-hpa temperature departures to help promote the
warmest temperatures of the season from the mid-Atlantic to the Southeast.
Similar to yesterday, the ECMWF reforecast tool remains especially bullish
with
this warm signal, depicting probabilities in excess of 60% (20%) of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th (95th) percentile on day 8 (May 27) to suggest
the possibility of record breaking temperatures in the region. The GEFS, on
the
other hand, is less supportive of this potential while favoring the highest
temperatures to occur late in week-1. Although maximum temperatures are
forecast to be in the 90's (degrees F) for many areas along the I-95 corridor,
dewpoint temperatures are likely to remain below 70 degrees F, which should
keep heat index values below hazard thresholds to allay excessive heat
concerns
and no corresponding hazards are posted. However, it is worth noting that in
the absence of enhanced precipitation observed during week-2, the above-normal
temperatures are likely to worsen D0 and D1 drought conditions currently being
felt in parts of the Carolinas and Virginia.



Over Alaska, there is good agreement among the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
favoring onshore flow to bring above-normal precipitation across the southern
Mainland and the Panhandle. Although reforecast tool guidance shows pockets of
3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile over the
southwestern
Mainland, these amounts are not likely to exceed hazard thresholds, and no
corresponding hazards are issued.

Valid 12Z Sat May 22 2021 - 12Z Wed May 26 2021

18Z Update:  The deterministic guidance remains in above average
agreement on the synoptic scale pattern through early next week,
so a general blend of the CMC/UKMET/GFS/ECMWF sufficed as a good
starting point.  By the end of the forecast period, more
appreciable differences emerge over the eastern Pacific, and this
leads to a little more forecast uncertainty for the West Coast
region, and the GFS becomes stronger with the shortwave crossing
the northern Plains and northern Great Lakes region by Wednesday.
In terms of the temperature forecast for the East Coast region,
highs were slightly lowered from the NBM to account for the
possibility of a back door cold front, since the upper ridge axis
will likely be centered to the west over the Ohio Valley and Deep
South.  The previous discussion is appended below. /Hamrick

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium-range product suite was derived days 3-5 (Sat-Mon)
from a composite of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and
12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models in a pattern with above normal predictability. By days
6-7, the GEFS/ECENS means were added to the blend consistent with
slowly increasing forecast spread. WPC continuity is well
maintained and is in line with latest 00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Lingering south-central Plains troughing and an increasingly
localized threat for slow moving convection/heavy downpours will
gradually weaken this weekend into early next week, blocked by an
amplified downstream ridge. Ridge transition supports much above
normal temperatures from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast where some record high minimum and maximum values will
be possible with temperature anomalies 10-20F above normal.

An amplified trough over the West this weekend favors some
moderate precipitation for the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies to include some high elevation snows enhanced by
upslope. This occurs as post-frontal conditions cool to 10-20F
below normal across the Intermountain West and Northern Rockies.
The focus for precipitation episodes is expected to increasingly
shift toward the north-central states into next week, with more
scattered strong thunderstorms down through the Plains. This
occurs as ample ejecting western U.S. trough energies interact
with wavy boundaries. Energies will spill some activity over the
downstream ridge to the Midwest/Great Lakes and drive backdoor
cold fronts from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic. Upstream, less
certain upper troughing with modest amplitude/precipitation may
dig renewed over the Northwest/West early-mid next week.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND
GREAT BASIN...

Expanded the elevated area northeastward into eastern Utah/western
Colorado and into central Wyoming. Expanded the critical in this
area also, but kept it south of the Wyoming border as this area has
seen more rainfall in the last month and fuels become more sparse.

In addition, added an elevated area for the Central Valley in
California. A favorable pressure gradient and deep mixing beneath
moderate cyclonic flow aloft parallel to the Valley will combine for
some winds of 15 to 20 mph and relative humidity around 15 to 20
percent.

..Bentley.. 05/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Wed May 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is expected to continue deepening across
central to southern California through the day Thursday. This will
maintain a belt of strong mid and upper-level flow over southern
Nevada into the northern Four Corners region, and support further
deepening of a surface low over the central Rockies. As a result,
another day of heightened fire weather concerns is expected given
the antecedent dry conditions and increasing winds over the region.

...Southern Great Basin into the Four Corners...
Conditions are largely expected to remain dry across the southern
Great Basin through Thursday afternoon, which will help maintain
receptive fuels that are already in place. Across the eastern Great
Basin/northern Four Corner region, fuels are slightly less
receptive, and isolated to scattered rain chances Wednesday
afternoon may further mitigate fuel readiness. While this introduces
some uncertainty into fire weather threat for eastern UT and far
western CO, areas that do not see rainfall will likely undergo
drying through the day Thursday amid the warm and windy conditions.

An antecedent dry air mass will likely support another day of RH
reductions well below 15% for many locations. Surface winds between
20-30 mph are likely across the region as a surface low continues to
deepen to the north. Aloft, 35-45 mph mid-level winds are forecast
to gradually spread from southern NV into the northern Four Corners
through the day. Deep boundary-layer mixing will help realize these
winds at the surface by the mid to late afternoon hours.
Localized/transient critical wind speeds will be possible across
portions of southern AZ and western NM, but weaker flow aloft and a
greater displacement from the tighter surface pressure gradient
suggest lower potential for sustained critical conditions.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed May 19 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 25 - 29 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa pattern
across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period.
Dynamical models forecast a  500-hPa trough over the Aleutians and anomalous
ridging over eastern areas of the North Pacific, extending through Mainland
Alaska. Downstream, a trough is forecasted over the western CONUS, and
enhanced
ridging is predicted over the central and eastern CONUS. Near to below normal
heights are forecast over much of the western CONUS, while above normal
heights
are predicted under the ridging over the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS and
much of Alaska.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across much of western
and northern Alaska associated with above normal heights. Troughing favors
below normal temperatures from parts of the Northwest to the Northern Plains.
A
broad ridge predicted over the central and eastern CONUS favors above normal
temperatures for much of the eastern and central CONUS, consistent with the
ERF
consolidation forecast tool.

Predicted surface low pressure leads to increased chances of above normal
precipitation for southwestern Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Mean surface
flow is forecast to become northeasterly from the northern West Coast of the
CONUS eastward to the Front Range of the Rockies, increasing chances of near
to
below normal precipitation over the western CONUS, extending eastward to the
High Plains. Increased odds of above normal precipitation are indicated across
parts of the Southern and Central Plains, the Great Lakes, and Middle
Mississippi Valley, ahead of predicted mean troughing. The enhanced ridging
increases probabilities of below normal precipitation over the southeastern
CONUS and the Northeast Atlantic coast.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset slightly by increasing
uncertainty in regards to the precipitation forecast over the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 27 - JUN 02, 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is generally forecast to
shift eastward and become less amplified compared to the 6-10 day period.
Above
normal heights extend into the northern West Coast from the eastern North
Pacific. A weakening 500-hPa trough is forecast across the western CONUS with
near normal heights, while ridging is forecast over most of the eastern CONUS
with slightly above normal heights.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across much of
Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians associated with the troughing and enhanced mid-level
southerly flow. High latitude troughing favors below normal temperatures
across
the Northern Plains and parts of the Central High Plains. Above normal heights
over the northern West Coast increase the probability of above normal
temperature there. Elevated chances of near to above normal temperatures are
forecast across most of the remainder of the CONUS associated with ridging and
consistent with temperature tools.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across most of Alaska
due to predicted storm systems. Surface anomalous northeasterly flow,
predicted
across the western CONUS, elevates chances of near to below normal
precipitation over much of the western CONUS. Conversely, above normal
precipitation is favored over the Great Plains, Mississippi Valley, the Great
Lakes, and much of the eastern CONUS, related to potential storm systems and
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool. Below normal
precipitation
is favored for the Eastern Gulf Coast and Florida due to predicted ridging.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty in regards to the temperature and precipitation
forecast
over the CONUS.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

No changes. Previous discussion follows.

..Bentley.. 05/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0102 AM CDT Wed May 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is noted off the coast of the Pacific
Northwest in early-morning water vapor imagery. This feature is
expected to begin deepening along the West Coast over the next 24
hours, which will place a belt of strengthening mid and upper-level
winds over the southern Great Basin late this afternoon. At the
surface, pressure falls over the inter-mountain West will lead to
increasing winds and a heightened fire weather concern across the
southern Great Basin and portions of the Southwest. Elsewhere across
the county, scattered rain chances and weak winds will limit
additional concerns.

...Southern Great Basin and the Southwest...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions continue to appear
likely late this afternoon as surface winds increase to 15-25 mph
across portions of the southern Great Basin and Southwest region.
Deep boundary-layer mixing will aid in downward transfer of 850-700
mb winds as they gradually strengthen to 30-40 mph by 22-00 UTC.
Confidence remains generally high that the strongest mid-level flow,
and the greatest potential for sustained critical conditions, will
reside across southern NV into adjacent areas of southern UT and
northwest AZ (though transient critical conditions are possible in
the peripheral elevated risk area). Early-morning surface
observations show poor overnight RH recovery with humidity values in
the low teens to 20s noted. Diurnal warming and deep mixing will
likely yield RH values in the 5-15% range for most locations.
Minimal precipitation across this region over the past two weeks has
resulted in receptive fuels that will further support the fire
weather conditions.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Cooling temperatures aloft coupled with a modest influx of mid-level
moisture will likely support isolated to scattered convection across
northern UT into western CO and adjacent areas of WY as lift ahead
of the approaching wave overspreads the region this afternoon.
Limited instability above a deep, well-mixed boundary layer with
PWAT values between 0.4 to 0.6 inches will likely support a mixture
of wet and dry thunderstorms. Isolated dry convection appears
probable, but modest fuel readiness across northeastern parts of the
Great Basin precludes a risk area.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
407 PM EDT Wed May 19 2021

Valid 12Z Sat May 22 2021 - 12Z Wed May 26 2021

18Z Update:  The deterministic guidance remains in above average
agreement on the synoptic scale pattern through early next week,
so a general blend of the CMC/UKMET/GFS/ECMWF sufficed as a good
starting point.  By the end of the forecast period, more
appreciable differences emerge over the eastern Pacific, and this
leads to a little more forecast uncertainty for the West Coast
region, and the GFS becomes stronger with the shortwave crossing
the northern Plains and northern Great Lakes region by Wednesday.
In terms of the temperature forecast for the East Coast region,
highs were slightly lowered from the NBM to account for the
possibility of a back door cold front, since the upper ridge axis
will likely be centered to the west over the Ohio Valley and Deep
South.  The previous discussion is appended below. /Hamrick

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium-range product suite was derived days 3-5 (Sat-Mon)
from a composite of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and
12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models in a pattern with above normal predictability. By days
6-7, the GEFS/ECENS means were added to the blend consistent with
slowly increasing forecast spread. WPC continuity is well
maintained and is in line with latest 00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Lingering south-central Plains troughing and an increasingly
localized threat for slow moving convection/heavy downpours will
gradually weaken this weekend into early next week, blocked by an
amplified downstream ridge. Ridge transition supports much above
normal temperatures from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast where some record high minimum and maximum values will
be possible with temperature anomalies 10-20F above normal.

An amplified trough over the West this weekend favors some
moderate precipitation for the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies to include some high elevation snows enhanced by
upslope. This occurs as post-frontal conditions cool to 10-20F
below normal across the Intermountain West and Northern Rockies.
The focus for precipitation episodes is expected to increasingly
shift toward the north-central states into next week, with more
scattered strong thunderstorms down through the Plains. This
occurs as ample ejecting western U.S. trough energies interact
with wavy boundaries. Energies will spill some activity over the
downstream ridge to the Midwest/Great Lakes and drive backdoor
cold fronts from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic. Upstream, less
certain upper troughing with modest amplitude/precipitation may
dig renewed over the Northwest/West early-mid next week.

...Ongoing flooding in parts of eastern Texas and Louisiana will
be exacerbated by additional rainfall over the next couple of
days...

...Cold temperatures and snow are expected in parts of the West,
with heavy snow in the Northern Rockies...

...Severe weather is possible in the Northern/Central High Plains
on Thursday...

...Critical Risks of fire weather are in place for the
Southwest/Central Great Basin through Friday...

Ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to flow into
the central U.S. over the next few days, and upper-level energy
should help trigger even more scattered showers and thunderstorms
for the region. Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are
forecast for portions of southeastern Texas and Louisiana, with
some potential for locally higher amounts. Due to heavy rain over
the past few days in portions of the area, the additional rain
will serve to exacerbate ongoing flooding and could lead to
numerous instances of flash flooding. Moderate Risks of excessive
rainfall as well as Flash Flood Watches are in place through late
Thursday along the western/central Gulf Coast.

A deep upper-level low is forecast to drop southward across the
western U.S. tonight through Friday, leading to several hazardous
weather concerns. First, temperatures are expected to be
considerably below normal over the Northwest, spreading to the
Great Basin on Thursday and toward parts of the Desert Southwest
on Friday. These cold temperatures will lead to dropping snow
levels across the West. Snow totals could be greater than 2 feet
in higher elevations of the Northern Rockies in Montana through
late Friday, and a Winter Storm Warning is in place there as
persistent snow occurs. Lesser amounts of late-season snow are
expected for portions of the Intermountain West and
Cascades/Sierra Nevada, and some areas are under Winter Weather
Advisories.

The upper low and the associated slow-moving front as well as a
tightening dryline could also cause severe thunderstorms across
northern and central portions of the High Plains on Thursday, and
there is a Slight Risk of severe weather in place for wind and
hail threats. Rain and thunderstorms are also likely for the
north-central U.S. near a frontal system, with some possible
severe weather, and some rain totals could be over an inch.
Meanwhile, persistent dry weather and gusty winds should combine
to produce fire danger across much of the Central Great Basin and
Southwest through at least Friday, and Elevated to Critical Risks
of fire weather are delineated for those areas.

Surface high pressure over the eastern U.S. will lead to generally
dry conditions, though southern Florida could see a few showers,
and so could portions of the Northeast on Thursday and Friday
along a meandering front. Warmer than normal conditions are
forecast to continue for the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic over the next several days, though the
south-central U.S. and Florida should stay slightly cooler than
average.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 AM CDT Thu May 20 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN FOUR
CORNERS REGION...

...Synopsis...
Early-morning water vapor imagery reveals an upper-level trough
beginning to deepen and dig southward into northern California. This
feature will continue to shift southward through the day,
maintaining southwesterly flow from southern California into the
Great Basin and northern Rockies. This will also contribute to the
deepening of a surface low over the northern Rockies throughout the
day, which will tighten the pressure gradient over the southwestern
U.S. The combination of increasing winds and antecedent dry
conditions will support another day of critical fire weather
conditions across much of the Southwest. Elsewhere across the CONUS,
rain chances and generally weak low-level flow will limit additional
fire weather concerns.

...Southern Great Basin and northern Four Corners...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions remain likely again
today from southern NV eastward into the Four Corners region.
Sustained surface winds between 20-30 mph are expected, and frequent
gusts up to 35-45 mph (and perhaps upwards of 50 mph for a few
locations) are probable as the general pressure gradient strengthens
over the region. Regional 00 UTC soundings show a very dry boundary
layer in place across the region and overnight RH recovery has been
poor (RH values in the teens and low 20s). These factors, combined
with little moisture recovery and mostly clear skies today, will set
the stage for another day of RH values 5-15% over a region with
receptive fuels.

Although eastern UT and western CO received precipitation over the
past 24 hours, MRMS estimates suggest this rainfall was fairly light
and scattered, and likely did little to moisten fuels. Furthermore,
several lightning strikes were noted across the region that may
become active this afternoon as dry/windy conditions become
prevalent. Elevated fire weather conditions will likely extend into
central NM and the central High Plains, but recent rainfall has
sufficiently mitigated fuel readiness across this region.

...California's Central Valley...
Northerly down-valley winds are expected to gradually increase to
15-20 mph through the day as the regional pressure gradient
strengthens. While overnight RH recoveries are slightly better than
areas to the east across the southern Great Basin, diurnal heating
and boundary-layer mixing will likely yield afternoon RH values in
the teens as mid-level dry air mixes downward. 10-hour fuels across
the region are generally dry with fuel moisture values between 3-7%,
which will support at least elevated fire weather conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0128 AM CDT Thu May 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN UTAH AND NORTHERN
ARIZONA...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough currently digging into northern California is
forecast to gradually shift into southern NV by Friday afternoon.
The slow progression of this wave will continue to place strong mid
and upper-level flow over the Southwest where conditions have been
dry. A surface low lingering over the central Rockies is forecast to
be weaker compared to previous day, but will still maintain a
sufficient pressure gradient to support fire weather concerns for
parts of the Southwest that do not see precipitation during the
afternoon hours.

...Utah and Arizona...
Portions of southern UT and northern AZ are expected to reside
within the dry slot of the synoptic low as it slowly moves east
through the day. While cloud cover and precipitation chances across
the Four Corners will limit the spatial extent of the fire weather
concern, strong mid-level flow within the dry slot and a lingering
surface low across the UT/WY/ID region will support dry and windy
conditions Friday afternoon. Sustained surface winds between 20-30
mph with frequent gusts up to 35-45 mph appear likely as
boundary-layer mixing increases through the day. 5-15% RH values are
expected from southern AZ into central UT, and fuel conditions will
remain supportive of wildfire spread. The eastern and western extent
of the fire weather threat is somewhat uncertain due to rain chances
and the approach of a cold front (respectively), but confidence in
critical conditions for the AZ/UT region remains high.

...Central to Southern New Mexico...
Lee troughing along the central to northern High Plains will result
in 15-20 mph winds across much of NM and adjacent portions of west
TX. Downslope warming and drying of low-level parcels emanating out
of southern AZ will result in widespread RH values in the 10-20%
range. While elevated wind/RH combinations are possible across much
of the southern High Plains, the fire weather threat will be
confined to areas of NM that have not recently received wetting
rainfall and have low rain chances Friday afternoon.

...California's Central Valley...
Northerly down-valley winds will persist into Friday afternoon
thanks to a generally static synoptic pattern. As with Thursday,
relative humidity values will likely fall into the teens with breezy
winds sustained near 15-20 mph. Little to no rainfall is expected,
which will maintain receptive fine fuels.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium-range product suite was derived days 3-5 (Sun-Tue)
from a composite of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and
12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models in a pattern with above normal predictability. By days
6-7, the GEFS/ECENS means were added to the blend consistent with
slowly increasing forecast spread. WPC continuity is well
maintained and is in line with latest 00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Lingering south-central Plains southern stream troughing from
short range time scales and localized threat for slow moving
convection with heavy downpours will gradually weaken this weekend
into early next week. Meanwhile, an amplified trough over the West
and dynamic ejection favors some moderate precipitation for the
north-central Intermountain West/Rockies/High Plains including
elevation snows as enhanced by upslope, especially for the
Northern Rockies. This occurs as regional post-frontal conditions
cool to 10-20F below normal.

Downstream, the focus for precipitation episodes is expected to
increasingly shift toward the north-central states next week, with
scattered strong thunderstorms down through the Plains. This
occurs as ample ejecting western U.S. trough energies interact
with wavy boundaries. Energies will spill activity across the
Midwest/Great Lakes overtop an amplified east-central U.S. upper
ridge and drive backdoor cold fronts from the Northeast to the
Mid-Atlantic. Upper ridge transition and backdoor fronts suggests
a transition of lead much above normal temperatures from the
Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic to the South/Southeast where some
record high minimum and maximum values will be possible with
temperature anomalies 10-20F above normal.

Upstream, less certain upper troughing with mainly modest
amplitude/precipitation may dig renewed over the Northwest/West
early-mid next week. Guidance has not been as stellar with run to
run variance for these features.

Valid 12Z Thu May 20 2021 - 12Z Sat May 22 2021

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over the
Central/Western Gulf Coast through Friday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Northern/Central High Plains through Friday morning...

...Late-season snow is expected for the Cascades, Northern
Rockies, and higher elevations of the Intermountain West...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire danger across the Great Basin
and Southwest...

Moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will continue to flow
across the Plains and Mississippi Valley through Saturday.
Upper-level energy over the Plains will trigger showers and
thunderstorms over the region through Friday.  The WPC has issued
a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over the Central/Western
Gulf Coast through Friday.  The showers and thunderstorms will
produce heavy rain over the region producing numerous areas of
flash flooding.  Additionally, the heavy rain may cause many
streams and possibly larger rivers to flood. The SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Northern/Central High Plains through Friday morning.  The main
threats from the severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning,
severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and maybe a tornado. On
Friday, the excessive rainfall threat will lessen to a Moderate
Risk over parts of the Western/Central Gulf Coast through Saturday.

Meanwhile, a deep upper-level low over the Pacific Northwest will
advance southward to California and the Great Basin.  The
associated upper-level trough will help produce late-season snow
over parts of the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, Great
Basin, and the higher elevations of California. The lower
elevations will have rain.  Winter Storm Warnings are in place
over parts of the Northern Rockies, while areas of the
Intermountain West and Cascades/Sierra Nevada and some areas are
under Winter Weather Advisories.  Additionally, persistent dry
weather and gusty winds should combine to produce fire danger
across parts of the Great Basin and Southwest through Friday, and
Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather are delineated for
those areas.

Surface high pressure and upper-level ridging over the eastern
U.S. will produce generally dry conditions.  However, southern
Florida could see a few showers, and so could portions of the
Northeast on Thursday and Friday along a meandering front.  Warmer
than average temperatures are forecast to continue for the Great
Lakes/Ohio Valley and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic over the next few
days.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1113 AM CDT Sun Jun 27 2021

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

The isolated dry thunderstorm area across the Southwest was adjusted
based on the latest guidance consensus. In addition, locally
Elevated conditions are possible across portions of northern New
England by afternoon peak heating, where patchy areas of receptive
fuels are in place. Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on
track. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 06/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Sun Jun 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
A very strong mid-level anticyclone will remain centered across
southwest Canada on Sunday, as a seasonably strong mid-level trough
moves northward along the West Coast and western periphery of the
anticyclone. The resulting juxtaposition of these two features will
maintain easterly to southeasterly mid-level flow across much of the
Pacific Northwest. The exception to this will be across portions of
Idaho, where an increasing mid-level height gradient between the
strong mid-level anticyclone and a downstream trough will support a
belt of enhanced northerly mid-level flow. This northerly mid-level
flow will extend all the way southward into Arizona.

The mid-level anticyclone will provide support for maintaining a
surface anticyclone across much of the Intermountain West. Farther
west, a south-to-north oriented trough will strengthen during the
day, resulting in an increasing pressure gradient that will favor
gusty easterly low-level flow.

Across the central and eastern United States, broad troughing, rich
tropical moisture, or both will maintain a wet pattern and limited
fire potential.

... Pacific Northwest ...

Elevated fire weather conditions will develop during the day on
Sunday as gusty easterly flow of 15 to 20 mph occurs in response to
the aforementioned increased surface-pressure gradient. This
pronounced easterly low-level flow will occur in conjunction with
widespread temperatures over 100 F and numerous areas warming to
greater than 110 F. This alone will result in elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions. However, a very deep mixing layer
will envelop much of the area, resulting in a turbulent and unstable
lower troposphere. These meteorological conditions will also support
plume-dominated fire behavior potential.

... Northeast Arizona and the Four Corners Region ...

Increasing mid-level moisture will support isolated thunderstorms
across northeast Arizona and southeast Utah, particularly across
terrain favored areas. However, strong diurnal heating will support
the development of a well-mixed boundary layer by late morning and
early afternoon across the region. This dry sub-cloud layer will
make it difficult to achieve wetting rains with afternoon
thunderstorms. Additionally, increased northerly flow in the
cloud-bearing layer should allow thunderstorms to move off the
terrain, decreasing the likelihood that precipitation cores will be
able to completely overcome the dry low levels at any one location.
Additionally, given the belt of enhanced northerly flow in the
presence of strong diurnal mixing, surface winds may gust as high as
20 mph resulting in elevated fire weather conditions.

Extended Forecast Discussion

204 PM EDT Sun Jun 27 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Jun 30 2021 - 12Z Sun Jul 04 2021

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest should become less
intense but continue into the 4th of July weekend...

...Anomalous heat for New England into Wednesday...

...Heavy rain threat from southern Rockies/Plains to the Midwest
midweek should shift south to near the Gulf Coast by the weekend...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles show good agreement that the strong upper
ridge currently located over the Pacific Northwest and British
Columbia may finally begin to weaken and shift east into the
northern High Plains through the medium range period as an upper
wave moves into British Columbia and across southwest Canada.
Meanwhile, a positively-tilted trough over the Northern Plains and
Upper Great Lakes region on Wednesday will move only slightly
eastward into the Northeast by the end of next weekend. There
continues to be increasing model signals for the upper trough to
develop into a closed low over or near the Great Lakes later this
week although the ensemble means tend to retain the
positively-tilted configuration, likely due to uncertainties in
individual ensemble runs. Meanwhile, a slow-moving frontal
boundary across the mid-section of the country should begin to
push slowly southward amid increasing model signals for the upper
trough/low over the Great Lakes to dip further south. This pattern
should bring the heavy rain threat progressively southward from
the mid-South to the Gulf Coast while directing moisture toward
much of the East Coast for the 4th of July weekend following the
early/mid-week heat wave across New England and the Mid-Atlantic.

The WPC medium range product suite used a majority deterministic
model blend the first half of the period with above average
predictability. Thereafter, shifted the blend towards the ensemble
means amid increasing forecast spread, but did include a fair
amount of the GFS/ECMWF (with some manual intervention in the
resulting 500mb charts) due to the good run-to-run consistency on
the Great Lakes low. This maintained fairly good continuity with
the previous WPC forecasts.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge over the Northwest will prolong the
dangerous and oppressive heat over the region. As the ridge is
forecast to weaken slightly, the heat should become much less
intense by Wednesday near the Pacific Northwest coast but high
temperatures across the interior sections will remain 20 to nearly
30 degrees above normal through late week with some improvement
possible by the holiday weekend. Little rainfall is expected to
ease this excessive heat in a pattern with growing drought and
fire threats and minimal recovery overnight will also increase the
heat stress.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. through the medium-range period. Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms which will significantly increase rainfall and runoff
potential along and ahead of the front with an elongated and
focused zone from the southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across
the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast. Episodes of
cell training and flooding are likely across some of these areas
before the heavy rainfall axis slowly drops southward toward the
Gulf Coast by next weekend.

A heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic into midweek
should be broken by Thursday as the upper trough/low centered over
the Great Lakes directs moisture into much of the East Coast ahead
of a frontal boundary. It appears that the East Coast will enter a
period of damp/wet weather just in time for the July 4th holiday
weekend.

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest should become less
intense but continue into the 4th of July weekend...

...Anomalous heat for New England into Wednesday...

...Heavy rain threat from southern Rockies/Plains to the Midwest
midweek should shift south to near the Gulf Coast by the weekend...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles show good agreement that the strong upper
ridge currently located over the Pacific Northwest and British
Columbia may finally begin to weaken and shift east into the
northern High Plains through the medium range period as an upper
wave moves into British Columbia and across southwest Canada.
Meanwhile, a positively-tilted trough over the Northern Plains and
Upper Great Lakes region on Wednesday will move only slightly
eastward into the Northeast by the end of next weekend. There
continues to be increasing model signals for the upper trough to
develop into a closed low over or near the Great Lakes later this
week although the ensemble means tend to retain the
positively-tilted configuration, likely due to uncertainties in
individual ensemble runs. Meanwhile, a slow-moving frontal
boundary across the mid-section of the country should begin to
push slowly southward amid increasing model signals for the upper
trough/low over the Great Lakes to dip further south. This pattern
should bring the heavy rain threat progressively southward from
the mid-South to the Gulf Coast while directing moisture toward
much of the East Coast for the 4th of July weekend following the
early/mid-week heat wave across New England and the Mid-Atlantic.

The WPC medium range product suite used a majority deterministic
model blend the first half of the period with above average
predictability. Thereafter, shifted the blend towards the ensemble
means amid increasing forecast spread, but did include a fair
amount of the GFS/ECMWF (with some manual intervention in the
resulting 500mb charts) due to the good run-to-run consistency on
the Great Lakes low. This maintained fairly good continuity with
the previous WPC forecasts.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge over the Northwest will prolong the
dangerous and oppressive heat over the region. As the ridge is
forecast to weaken slightly, the heat should become much less
intense by Wednesday near the Pacific Northwest coast but high
temperatures across the interior sections will remain 20 to nearly
30 degrees above normal through late week with some improvement
possible by the holiday weekend. Little rainfall is expected to
ease this excessive heat in a pattern with growing drought and
fire threats and minimal recovery overnight will also increase the
heat stress.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. through the medium-range period. Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms which will significantly increase rainfall and runoff
potential along and ahead of the front with an elongated and
focused zone from the southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across
the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast. Episodes of
cell training and flooding are likely across some of these areas
before the heavy rainfall axis slowly drops southward toward the
Gulf Coast by next weekend.

...The Historic Heat Wave to continue across the Northwest.  Some
relief for areas to the west of the Cascades by Tuesday...

...Additional Heavy rains likely from the Southern High Plains
into the Middle Mississippi Valley, leading to a continued flood
and flash flood threat across these areas...

...Much above average temperatures likely for the Northeast early
this week, while much below average temperatures expected across
much of the Central and Southern Plains...

...Tropical weather threat for the Southeast Coast Monday into
Tuesday...

The large scale weather pattern across the nation is not expected
to change appreciably over the next few days, maintaining
anomalous weather conditions across many areas.  The historic
Northwest Heat Wave will continue through much of the upcoming
week, with numerous daily, monthly and even all time records
likely to be set.  Monday will be the hottest day for the big
cities of Seattle and Portland with all time record highs likely
in both cities.  For both Seattle and Portland the forecast highs
Sunday and Monday will be back to back all time highs, with the
new all time highs of Sunday being broken the next day.  Some
relief is possible from the record heat for Seattle and Portland
on Tuesday as the core of the hottest air pushes inland to the
east of the Cascades. Still, high temperatures Tuesday will be 15
to 20 degrees above average and morning lows will be near the
average afternoon highs for both Seattle and Portland.

No relief in sight for this week for areas to the east of the
Cascades across eastern Oregon, eastern Washington State, much of
Idaho into western Montana where daily highs will be 25 to 30
degrees above average and daily records are likely.  Excessive
Heat Warnings are currently in effect across all of the Northwest,
southward into northern California, western Nevada and portions of
Southern California.  In addition to the life-threatening aspects
of the historic heat wave across the Northwest, the hot/dry
conditions will also pose a fire weather threat for much of the
upcoming week.

The overall stagnant weather pattern across the nation will keep a
frontal boundary stationary from the Southern Plains,
northeastward into the Middle Mississippi Valley.  This front will
be the focus for additional heavy rains over the next days, with
flood and flash flood watches currently in effect across these
areas.    Stream flows have become elevated from heavy rains over
the past 24 hours across these areas, with the threat of more
heavy rains into the start of this week continuing the flood and
flash flood threat.  The heavy rain threat will also keep
temperatures well below average over the next few days, especially
across the Central to Southern High Plains.  Across this region,
high temperatures are forecast to be 15 to 20 degrees below
average with even the chance of record low maximum temperatures
Monday and Tuesday across New Mexico into northwest Texas.

Across the eastern U.S....much above average temperatures will
also be in store for early this week from the Ohio Valley into the
Mid-Atlantic and New England.  While temperature anomalies are not
expected to be as great as the Northwest, a few record highs are
possible in the urban corridor from Boston to New York City.

Off the Southeast Coast, an area of disturbed tropical weather is
currently moving westward toward the coast.  The National
Hurricane Center is investigating this system for potential
tropical development.  Please see the latest outlooks and/or
advisories from the National Hurricane Center for further details
of potential impacts to the Southeast coast Monday and Tuesday.

300 PM EDT Sun June 27 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0248 PM CDT Sun Jun 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

Slight adjustments to the isolated dry thunderstorm delineation have
been made to account for the latest guidance consensus. Based on the
latest guidance, it appears that isolated dry thunderstorm potential
will exist within 3 regimes. The first two regimes will become
established during the afternoon hours. First, in proximity to the
southern Sierra, upslope flow amid scant buoyancy will support a few
dry strikes given a very dry boundary layer in place. Second,
diurnal mixing within a deep boundary layer across portions of
northern Arizona into the Four Corners will also foster dry strike
potential. Third, in between the aforementioned two regimes (across
mainly southern Nevada), very sparse storm coverage is expected
during the day. However, richer mid-level moisture will continue to
drift slowly northward across the southern Great Basin overnight,
with increasing buoyancy and associated storm coverage expected.
Still, the nocturnal boundary/sub-cloud layer is expected to be deep
and dry enough to support at least a few dry strikes tomorrow night.

Locally Elevated fire weather conditions may also occur across
southern portions of the Sacramento Valley into the San Joaquin
Valley by afternoon peak heating tomorrow. A thermally induced
pressure gradient may promote modestly dry and breezy northerly
surface flow atop fuels that will support fire spread, however, the
threat appears too constrained in space/time to warrant an Elevated
delineation. The forecast for hot, dry and windy conditions across
the Pacific Northwest remains on track. Please see the previous
forecast below for details on the Pacific Northwest.

..Squitieri.. 06/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CDT Sun Jun 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
A very strong mid-level anticyclone will remain centered across
southwest Canada on Monday, as a seasonably strong mid-level trough
moves northward along the Oregon Coast. This will maintain easterly
to southeasterly mid-level flow across much of the Pacific
Northwest, including areas farther east that had northerly flow on
Sunday, as the mid-level height gradient relaxes across the Northern
Rockies.

The mid-level anticyclone will provide support for maintaining a
surface anticyclone across much of the Intermountain West. Given the
continued a south-to-north oriented trough along the Oregon and
Washington coast, strong, gusty easterly surface winds will once
again remain possible on Monday.

Across the central and eastern United States, broad troughing, rich
tropical moisture, or both will maintain a wet pattern and limited
fire potential.

... Pacific Northwest ...

Elevated fire weather conditions will persist on Monday as gusty
easterly flow of 15 to 20 mph continues in response to the
aforementioned surface-pressure gradient. This pronounced easterly
low-level flow will occur in conjunction with widespread
temperatures over 100 F and numerous areas warming to greater than
110 F,  resulting in elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions. A very deep mixing layer will once again envelop much of
the area resulting in a turbulent and unstable lower troposphere.
These meteorological conditions will also support plume-dominated
fire behavior potential.

... Northwest Arizona, southwest Utah, southern Nevada, into the
central Sierras ...

Mid-level moisture will continue to slowly progress northward on
Monday, resulting in more widespread thunderstorm development than
on Sunday. However, on the leading edge of the moisture return,
moisture may not be sufficiently robust enough to support
precipitation cores that can overcome the dry sub-cloud layer
stemming from strong diurnally driven vertical mixing of the
boundary layer. As such, any thunderstorm that does develop in this
region will have the potential to remain dry.

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest becomes less intense and
continues through the 4th of July weekend...

...Heavy rain threat shifts south from southern Rockies/Plains to
near the Gulf Coast by the weekend...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles agree that the highly anomalous upper ridge
currently located over the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia
will weaken slightly and shift east into the northern High Plains
during the medium range period as an upper wave/trough moves into
British Columbia and across southwest Canada.  Meanwhile, ensemble
means continue to indicate a positively-tilted trough will drift
across the Great Lakes region by late this week, where
deterministic model solutions tend to call for a closed low to
form under this highly amplified synoptic pattern.  There is
increasing model agreement that a slow-moving frontal boundary
across the mid-section of the country will begin to push southward
when the upper trough/low over the Great Lakes is forecast to dip
further south late this week.  This pattern should bring the heavy
rain threat progressively southward from the mid-South to the Gulf
Coast while directing moisture toward much of the East Coast for
the 4th of July weekend and into early next week.  However, models
continue to show considerable uncertainty regarding the details.
Solutions range from a wavy front becoming stalled across the
eastern U.S. to a more consolidated low pressure system moving
into the Northeast by the holiday weekend.

Given the uncertainties, the Day 5-7 forecasts were derived mainly
from the consensus of the 12Z EC mean, 18Z GEFS, and the 12Z CMC
mean.  The 18Z GFS was not included beginning on Day 5  since it
began to place a low pressure center over the Ohio Valley that
lagged far behind its the ensemble mean position over the
Northeast.  For Day 3-4, a general blend of the 18Z GFS/GEFS mean,
12Z ECMWF/ECENS means and some contributions from the 12Z CMC/CMC
mean was adopted.  This maintained fairly good continuity with the
previous WPC forecasts.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest is expected to
be less intense by midweek as the highly anomalous upper ridge is
forecast to weaken slightly and shift eastward.  Nevertheless,
high temperatures across the interior sections will remain 15 to
25 degrees above normal through the holiday weekend and into early
next week.  Little rainfall is anticipated to ease this excessive
heat in a pattern with growing drought and fire threats and
minimal recovery overnight will also increase the heat stress.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. into midweek.  Deep moisture streaming in from the Gulf of
Mexico will continue to help organize showers and storms which
will significantly increase rainfall and runoff potential along
and ahead of the front with an elongated and focused zone from the
southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across the
Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast.  Episodes of
cell training and flooding are likely across some of these areas
before the heavy rainfall axis slowly drops southward toward the
Gulf Coast by next weekend.

A heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic into midweek
should be broken by Friday as the upper trough/low centered over
the Great Lakes directs moisture into much of the East Coast ahead
of a frontal boundary.  It appears that the East Coast will enter
a period of damp/wet weather just in time for the July 4th holiday
weekend with cool daytime temperatures and warm and humid nights.
Cool days and warm nights are expected for the Deep South as well
where the heavy rain threat continues into early next week.  In
contrast, dry and hot weather will return across the northern
Plains and should continue into early next week under the weakened
but still anomalous upper ridge.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 AM CDT Mon Jun 28 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
A very strong mid-level anticyclone will persist across southwest
Canada on Monday, prolonging the historic heatwave across the
Pacific Northwest. Farther east, broad troughing will persist across
the central United States, between the mid-level high across
southwest Canada and another mid-level high across the Mid-Atlantic
region.

At the surface, a strong pressure gradient across the Pacific
Northwest will support enhanced easterly winds, and flow around a
high across the Mid-Atlantic will maintain rich low-level moisture
across much of the central United States.

... Pacific Northwest ...

The strong mid-level anticyclone will maintain a background
environment conducive to maintaining hot and dry conditions across
much of the Pacific Northwest on Monday. Here, diurnally driven
vertical mixing within a warm lower-troposphere will allow surface
temperatures to warm in excess of 110 F across many areas.
Additionally,strong gusty winds will develop during the day as the
thermally induced surface-pressure gradient strengthens during the
day. These hot, dry, and windy conditions will support elevated fire
weather concerns. Additionally, strong vertical mixing will support
plume-dominated fire potential as well across much of the region.

... Four Corners Region west to the Sierra Mountains ...

Increasing mid-level moisture will combine with strong diurnal
heating to support isolated to scattered thunderstorm development
during the afternoon. Given precipitable water values between 0.5
and 0.75 inches, a mixed mode of wet and dry thunderstorms will be
possible. However, warm temperatures, dry low-levels, and long-term
drought conditions will keep most fuels receptive to
lightning-induced fire starts.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 AM CDT Mon Jun 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level anticyclone centered over southwest Canada during
the previous few days will move east a bit on Tuesday, with the
mid-level ridge focused across the Intermountain West. This will
allow for onshore flow to occur across western portions of the
Pacific Northwest, reducing afternoon temperatures from  the
historic highs of the past few days. However, given the large-scale
mid-level height pattern, above-normal temperatures will remain.

... Sierra Mountains and the southern Great Basin ...

Increasing mid-level moisture along the western periphery of a large
anticyclone will combine with strong diurnal heating to support
isolated to scattered thunderstorms on Tuesday. Despite slow-moving
storms, a dry sub-cloud layer stemming from deep vertical mixing
will support at least some isolated dry thunderstorms. Furthermore,
given very receptive fuels stemming from the long-term drought,
lightning-induced fire starts will be possible with any
thunderstorms, especially with lightning on the periphery of the
main precipitation cores.

...Record-shattering heat forecast across the Northwest with
cooler temperatures finally entering areas west of the Cascades by
Tuesday...

...Additional rounds of heavy rain and flash flooding likely over
the Southern High Plains today...

...Flash flooding threat continues from the Midwest to the
Southern Plains through Tuesday, including parts of southwest
Louisiana and the Upper Texas Coast...

...Above average temperatures and oppressive heat found across the
Northeast early this week, while well below average temperatures
continue across much of the Southern Rockies/Plains...

The hottest temperatures of the ongoing historic heat wave are
expected across the Pacific Northwest today, before the core of
the unprecedented heat shifts into interior sections of the region
on Tuesday and Wednesday. High temperatures are forecast to soar
30+ degrees above average throughout Washington and north-central
Oregon to start the workweek, with temperatures peaking in the
100s and 110s. Numerous daily, monthly, and all-time temperature
records are forecast. To put it in perspective, today will likely
go down in history as the hottest day ever recorded for places
such as Seattle, WA and Portland, OR (records date back to the
1940s here). This level of heat is extremely dangerous and can be
deadly if proper heat safety is not followed. Low temperatures are
expected to remain very warm and in the mid-70s, which can make it
even more difficult to stay cool. Excessive Heat Warnings have
been issued throughout most of the Northwest, Northern Great
Basin, as well as parts of western Nevada and interior California.
Residents are urged to stay in air-conditioned buildings, avoid
strenuous outdoor activities, drink plenty of water, and check on
family members/neighbors. Cooler temperatures associated with a
cold front and onshore winds are forecast to enter areas west of
the Cascades by Tuesday, but extreme heat will remain and build
farther inland across the Northern Great Basin this week.
Additional high temperature records are a guarantee for interior
sections of Washington and Oregon over the next few days,
extending into most of Idaho and western Montana on Tuesday.

For the central U.S., showers and thunderstorms will pose a threat
of flash flooding once again today and linger through midweek. A
stationary boundary bisecting the country from the Lower Great
Lakes to West Texas will be the focus for thunderstorm activity
and intense rainfall rates. The Southern High Plains in particular
are forecast to have the greatest chances of significant flash
flooding. A Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of Excessive Rainfall has
been issued through Tuesday morning across southeast New Mexico
and parts of West Texas, where widespread rainfall amounts over 2
inches are possible over previously saturated land. Farther east,
slow-moving thunderstorms may also lead to flash flooding between
central Oklahoma and northern Illinois. Much of this region has
dealt with numerous instances of heavy rain and flooding over the
last week; therefore, any additional downpours could lead to flash
flooding.

Not to be outdone, tropical showers with efficient rainfall rates
are also possible throughout the Upper Texas Coast and Southwest
Louisiana today and Tuesday. Thunderstorms here will have the
capability of producing 2 to 4 inches of rain in a very short
amount of time, which would likely lead to ponding on roadways and
swollen streams/rivers. Meanwhile, an area of low pressure
approaching the Southeast has been highlighted by the National
Hurricane Center as having a medium chance of tropical cyclone
formation. Regardless, this system is expected to swing onshore by
tonight and produce isolated pockets of heavy rain over southeast
Georgia and southern South Carolina.

The northwest corner of the country isn't the only place dealing
with oppressive heat this week. While not nearly as extreme, parts
of New England and the Northeast are expected to experience hot
and steamy weather through Wednesday as a Bermuda high pressure
system ushers consistent southerly winds up the East Coast. High
temperatures are forecast to reach the low-to-mid 90s from
Virginia to Maine, with heat indices into the triple digits. Heat
Advisories have been issued between Delaware and Maine, including
several major cities. The opposite is true for the Southern
Rockies and Southern Plains, where much below average temperatures
are expected to remain through at least Wednesday. Cloud cover and
showers are forecast to keep high temperatures in the 70s, which
equates to 20-30 degrees below average.

...Heavy lake effect snow likely through Saturday across the
eastern shores of the Great Lakes...

...Multiple rounds of heavy snow on the way for the Cascades and
Northern/Central Rockies...

...Life-threatening wind chills enter the Northern Plains
tonight...

Active weather is set to continue over the next few days and bring
plenty of winter weather hazards. A strengthening area of low
pressure located over the Upper Great Lakes is forecast to move
north-northeast into southeast Ontario, Canada this afternoon.
Behind this system, strong westerly winds and bitter temperatures
will make conditions ripe for lake effect snow across the typical
snowbelts. To help this natural snow machine, ice coverage across
the Great Lakes is currently well below average and will add more
moisture to the potential snow bands. By Saturday as much as 6 to
12 inches of snow could fall across localized regions, with higher
amounts possible downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. This
system will also be responsible for light snow across the Interior
Northeast and New England today, as well as rain showers along the
central Gulf Coast and Southeast.

Farther west, multiple rounds of heavy snow will traverse the
mountainous regions of the Northwest and Northern Rockies
beginning today. After the first area of low pressure passes this
afternoon, a separate system will be on its heels and enter on
Saturday. Upwards of two to three feet of total snowfall
accumulation is expected in the higher elevations by Sunday. Heavy
snow will also be likely across the High Plains of Montana, where
up to a foot of snow is forecast. Winter Storm Warnings are in
effect and include cities such as Billings, Great Falls, and
Bozeman, Montana.

By late afternoon on Saturday, the storm system to cross the
Northern Rockies today will enter the Midwest and lead to a swath
of light-to-moderate snow from southeast Nebraska to northern
Illinois. Precipitation will also develop from the Gulf Coast to
southern Appalachians as a separate area of low pressure forms
along the Gulf Coast on Saturday. This low is forecast to move up
the Mid-Atlantic coast by Sunday morning and possibly bring snow
from western North Carolina to coastal New England. Higher than
usual uncertainty remains with how far inland moderate snowfall
will reach, but at least light snow accumulations can be expected
for major I-95 cities from Richmond to Philadelphia by Sunday
morning.

Meanwhile, the coldest air of the season is set to enter the
Northern Plains tonight and slowly filter southward into the
Midwest and Ohio Valley by Sunday. High temperatures are forecast
to be 20 to 30 degrees below normal. This equates to highs below
zero for much of the Upper Midwest and Northern Plains this
weekend. While these temperatures are very cold, only a few daily
records could fall. Gusty winds will make it feel even colder.
Therefore, Wind Chill Advisories and Wind Chill Watches have been
issued for eastern Montana, much of North Dakota, and northwest
Minnesota, where it could feel as cold as 50 degrees below zero at
times. Temperatures this cold are extremely dangerous and can lead
to frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.

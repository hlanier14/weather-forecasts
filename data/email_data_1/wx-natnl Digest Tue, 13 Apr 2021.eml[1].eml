Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1139 AM CDT Mon Apr 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

The overall forest remains on track with minimal changes. The
elevated area across the Southwest was extended into southern
portions of the San Luis Valley where elevated to locally critical
fire weather conditions are expected this afternoon. The Central
High Plains elevated area has been expanded slightly to the east
with latest guidance.

..Lyons.. 04/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0131 AM CDT Mon Apr 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow aloft will dominate much of the western and central U.S.
as an upper trough slowly moves across the northern Plains, while a
second trough aloft gradually deepens across the Interior West. Flow
aloft will be relatively modest across portions of the southwest
U.S. Nonetheless, a dry boundary layer will encourage downward
momentum transport and dry downslope flow across terrain favoring
areas to support modest wildfire-spread potential. Modestly dry and
breezy conditions may also accompany a post-cold-frontal environment
across portions of the Central Plains.

...Portions of the Southwest U.S...
Widespread 10-20% RH is likely by afternoon peak heating across much
of the Lower Colorado River Basin into central New Mexico. The
aforementioned downward mixing is expected to contribute to 15 mph
sustained westerly winds, with Elevated highlights delineating where
the most favorable surface winds/RH overlap are expected to occur.
The lower terrain will be most favorable for wildfire spread as
fuels are more receptive in these areas.

...Central Nebraska...
A surface low departing the Upper Mississippi Valley and persistent
high pressure across the northern Rockies will fortify a dry
northwesterly flow regime across portions of the Central Plains. 20+
mph sustained northwesterly surface winds are expected across
portions of central Nebraska, when minimum RH is expected to dip
into the 20-25% range. Modestly receptive fine fuels are in place,
warranting the introduction of an Elevated highlight given the
aforementioned surface conditions.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 12 2021

SYNOPSIS: A strong ridge is forecast to encompass most of Alaska and the
western CONUS during Week-2. This should result in warm, quiet weather
throughout those regions. Model guidance forecasts a weak trough over much of
the East during the week. There is a slight chance that temperatures will be
cold enough at night to damage sensitive vegetation throughout parts of the
eastern U.S.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures from the Central Plains to the
Ohio Valley, Tue-Fri, Apr 20-23.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 15 - MONDAY APRIL 19:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!oGpALf_n6nE3CsCZGe2aWsZS7PGAzVHksnUZO6FYjBajAcXDjzN5D9keN8fDvJ34Clc9rvc3$

FOR TUESDAY APRIL 20 - MONDAY APRIL 26: The GFS and ECMWF ensembles are in
good
agreement regarding Week-2. Positive height anomalies are forecast to reach
from Alaska to the Rockies. Negative height anomalies are forecast to be
concentrated over eastern Canada, with weak troughing expected over the
eastern
U.S. The surface temperature pattern is expected to follow this pattern
closely, with above normal temperatures underneath the ridging and below
normal
temperatures underneath the troughing.



There are some ensemble members that forecast minimum temperatures in the
eastern U.S. reaching the bottom 15th percentile during the first four days of
the forecast period. Some areas in the Central Plains and Ohio Valley could
experience overnight temperatures near or below freezing, which might damage
sensitive vegetation. This pattern is expected to moderate during the later
part of Week-2 as the associated trough moves out to sea.



The warmest temperatures are expected throughout the West Coast, especially
within interior California. Daily maximum temperatures are forecast to be
within their upper 15th percentile, but should not reach our thresholds for
hazardous weather. Still, these warm temperatures and dry conditions will
exacerbate the ongoing drought conditions throughout the Southwest.

...Late-week Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A highly blocky synoptic pattern will continue through much of the
medium range period.  The main areas of concern will be related to
the progression/evolution of a couple of upper-level lows--one
sliding across the Great Lakes and then off to the east of New
England, and another exiting the central Rockies toward the
eastern U.S.  There is increasing model support for the
slow-moving upper low over the Great Lakes to trigger cyclogenesis
off the southern New England coast on Friday before heading out to
sea on Saturday.  Meanwhile, the upper low exiting the central
Rockies should culminate with the highest threat of wet snow on
Friday from the central Rockies to the High Plains.  There is
general model agreement that the system will continue to track
eastward and weaken while heading toward the eastern U.S. this
weekend.  There is also good model indication for another
shortwave to dip into the northern Plains from southern Canada
late this week. The ECMWF and CMC generally take it on a more
southerly track into the central U.S. while the GFS tracks it more
toward the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes.  Nevertheless, the
GEFS mean was in better agreement with the EC mean and the CMC
mean regarding this system.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of well clustered guidance of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 00
UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean together with some contribution from
the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  Guidance is in decent agreement, bolstering
forecast confidence.  Applied an even blend of the deterministic
and ensemble means for days 4-5 (Friday-Saturday); then shifted
blend weights in favor of the ensemble means for days 6/7
(Sunday-next Monday) amid growing forecast spread. This acts to
maintain good WPC continuity in an overall forecast scenario that
seems in line with latest guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A closed mean trough/low over the West and lead cold Canadian high
pressure (with temp anomalies ~10-20 degrees below normal) this
week should allow a potentially heavy upslope snow event over the
North-Central Rockies/High Plains to linger into late week.  Some
deformation and terrain enhanced precipitation still remains
possible over parts of the Great Basin.  Confidence is also
increasing on a moderate rain focus which should gradually shift
into the Plains Thursday-Friday.

Meanwhile, a wavy frontal boundary settles and lingers this period
into the northern Gulf of Mexico and vicinity to focus several
periods of moderate to heavy rains over Florida/Gulf Coast/Lower
Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains through the forecast period.
The heavy rain chances appear highest from the central Gulf Coast
to the Florida Panhandle this weekend and possibly into Monday as
a low pressure wave could form along the front.  The central Gulf
Coast states and vicinity have had much above normal rainfall
recently with continued flooding concerns.

Farther north, recent guidance has maintained a stronger and less
progressive main upper trough/low over the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast Thursday-Friday.  Moderate to locally heavy rainfall can
be expected to accompany an associated front and surface low to
track across the region.  The possibility of coastal cyclogenesis
will also present some maritime and coastal threats later week
into the weekend.  There may also be some mountain snows over the
interior Northeast as the upper low over the Great Lakes interacts
with the developing coastal low.

...A slow moving, blocked upper level pattern to support late
season snows across portions of the Northern Plains, Central
Rockies and northern Great Basin...

...An Elevated to Critical Fire Weather threat expected across the
Southwest Tuesday and Wednesday...

...Additional Heavy rains possible along the Central Gulf Coast
and Lower Mississippi Valley...


The mid to upper level flow pattern across much of North America
will continue to exhibit a high degree of blocking, resulting in
very slow moving systems affecting large portions of the nation.
The lead slow moving upper low over the Northern Plains/Upper
Mississippi Valley region will continue to support late season
accumulating snows across northern to eastern North Dakota into
northwestern Minnesota Monday night night into Tuesday.  The snow
threat from this system will decrease significantly late Tuesday
into Wednesday with only light snow possible from the Northern
Plains into the Upper Great Lakes.

While the lead mid to upper level system meanders over the
Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley region, a second slow
moving system will develop over the Pacific Northwest on Tuesday
and sink only slowly southward into the northern Great Basin by
Wednesday.  This system will not have a lot of associated
precipitation initially, but should expand its precipitation
effects from Tuesday night into Wednesday across the northern
Great Basin and into the Central Rockies.  Late season heavy snows
are possible across the Rockies of Colorado and Wyoming and across
the Wasatch and Unitas of Utah.

Additional heavy rains are on tap late Tuesday into Wednesday
across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Central Gulf coastal
regions.  These areas have been wet over the past week with rain
totals 200-300% of average.  This has resulted in high stream flow
values and saturated soils.  The additional heavy rainfall threat
will also lead to an increasing threat of flooding across portions
of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Central Gulf coast late
Tuesday into Wednesday.

In contrast to the wet conditions along the Central Gulf Coast
into the Lower Mississippi Valley, dry conditions, low relative
humidities and gusty winds will support an Elevated to Critical
Fire Weather Threat over the Southwest Tuesday and Wednesday.
With the large scale pattern not expected to change much over the
western U.S., with the above mentioned slow moving mid to upper
level system, there will likely continue to be a fire weather
threat over the Southwest into the end of this week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon April 12 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 18 - 22 2021

Today's models are in good agreement on the longwave 500-hPa pattern forecast
over North America during the 6-10 day period. A closed mid-level low is
predicted south of Alaska, while anomalous ridging is forecast along the
western coast of the CONUS, extending north along western coastal Canada and
over parts of Alaska. Exceptionally high positive height anomalies are
forecast
by today's 6z deterministic GFS over parts of Alaska, in which normalized
500-hPa anomalies approach 3 standard deviations above normal during the
earlier part of the 6-10 day period. Downstream of this ridging, a large-scale
trough is predicted over the eastern half of the CONUS.

Beneath large positive height anomalies, above normal temperatures are favored
for Alaska and the western third of the CONUS. The large positive height
anomalies over Alaska favor near to below normal precipitation for Alaska.
Ridging along the west coast of the CONUS is forecast to suppress storm system
activity and increase chances of below normal precipitation from the west
coast
of the CONUS to much of the eastern U.S. Beneath the mean trough forecast over
eastern portions of the CONUS, cold surface high pressure is forecast to
funnel
cold air from Canada into much of the East, favoring below normal temperatures
for the eastern two thirds of the CONUS. Probabilities are especially high for
areas typically much warmer, such as parts of Texas and the Lower Mississippi
Valley. A short-wave trough forecast to swing south around the trough enhances
the likelihood of above normal precipitation for parts of New Mexico and
western Texas. As a forecast frontal boundary stalls across Florida during the
6-10 day period, above normal precipitation is favored there. Above normal
temperatures are slightly favored for the southern tip of the Florida
Peninsula
to the south of this stalled boundary.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 60% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to excellent model agreement on the large-scale pattern, combined with
good
agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 20 - 26 2021

Models remain in fairly good agreement on the large-scale pattern forecast
across the domain during the week-2 period, and the forecast pattern is
similar
to the 6-10 day period, though somewhat less amplified. The temperature
probability forecast for week-2 is very similar to the forecast for the 6-10
day period, with a few minor differences. The mid-level ridging forecast in
the
West shifts a bit to the east by the week-2 period, expanding enhanced
probabilities of above normal temperatures into New Mexico and lowering below
normal probabilities over the Southern Plains relative to the 6-10 day period.
The precipitation probability forecast is also very similar to the 6-10 day
period, except that the shortwave predicted during the 6-10 day period is
expected to exit the Southwest and Southern Plains before the week-2 period,
increasing the likelihood of near to below normal precipitation for these
regions. In addition, one or more potential storm systems within the
large-scale forecast trough increase chances of above normal precipitation for
parts of the Northeast, though probabilities are low due to a good deal of
uncertainty.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Yesterday's
operational 12z GFS centered on Day 10, and 60% of Today's 0z European
Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to very good agreement among the dynamical models and temperature and
precipitation tools over most of the country.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE LOWER GREAT
BASIN...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA
AND WESTERN NEW MEXICO...

...Southeastern Arizona/western New Mexico...
A critical area has been added from the Mexican border northward
through Arizona and into western New Mexico. Regional model
soundings show a warm and deeply mixed boundary layer with surface
humidity values of 7-10%. Overall background flow is not expected to
be strong, but some momentum transport from an increasing mid-level
flow should support winds of 20 mph with higher gusts by mid
afternoon. Critical fire weather conditions appear likely
predominately in the lower and middle elevations where significant
drought has cured fuels.

The rest of the forecast remain on tack with only minor changes to
the critical area across the southern Great Basin.

..Lyons.. 04/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Mon Apr 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
An amplifying mid-level trough across the Interior West will
encourage rapid surface low development across portions of the Lower
Great Basin into the Lower Colorado River Basin tomorrow. Strong,
dry southwesterly surface flow will become prevalent by afternoon
peak heating, promoting appreciable wildfire-spread potential where
dry, receptive fuels exist, especially in lower-terrain areas.

...Lower Great Basin into the Lower Colorado River Basin...
The favorable timing of surface low intensification with the diurnal
heating cycle will promote widespread 20+ mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds amidst 10-15% RH across portions of the
lower Great Basin, where Critical highlights have been introduced.
Farther southeast, a broader Elevated delineation covers portions of
the Lower Colorado River Basin into central New Mexico, where 15-25
mph sustained westerly winds are expected to overlap with 10-15% RH,
atop fuels that support wildfire spread. At least locally Critical
conditions are likely across this broader Elevated area, with
guidance hinting at lower-terrain areas of western New Mexico
potentially seeing longer lasting, more widespread Critical
conditions. Should future guidance show greater consistency in
overlapping widespread Critical conditions across western New
Mexico, Critical highlights may be introduced in future outlooks.

...Late-week Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A highly blocky synoptic pattern will continue through much of the
medium range period.  The main areas of concern will be related to
the progression/evolution of a couple of upper-level lows--one
sliding across the Great Lakes and then off to the east of New
England, and another exiting the central Rockies toward the
eastern U.S.  There is increasing model support for the
slow-moving upper low over the Great Lakes to trigger cyclogenesis
off the southern New England coast on Friday before heading out to
sea on Saturday.  Meanwhile, the upper low exiting the central
Rockies should culminate with the highest threat of wet snow on
Friday from the central Rockies to the High Plains.  There is
general model agreement that the system will continue to track
eastward and weaken while heading toward the eastern U.S. this
weekend.  There is also good model indication for another
shortwave to dip into the northern Plains from southern Canada
late this week. The ECMWF and CMC generally take it on a more
southerly track into the central U.S. while the GFS tracks it more
toward the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes.  Nevertheless, the
GEFS mean was in better agreement with the EC mean and the CMC
mean regarding this system.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of well clustered guidance of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 00
UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean together with some contribution from
the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  Guidance is in decent agreement, bolstering
forecast confidence.  Applied an even blend of the deterministic
and ensemble means for days 4-5 (Friday-Saturday); then shifted
blend weights in favor of the ensemble means for days 6/7
(Sunday-next Monday) amid growing forecast spread. This acts to
maintain good WPC continuity in an overall forecast scenario that
seems in line with latest guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A closed mean trough/low over the West and lead cold Canadian high
pressure (with temp anomalies ~10-20 degrees below normal) this
week should allow a potentially heavy upslope snow event over the
North-Central Rockies/High Plains to linger into late week.  Some
deformation and terrain enhanced precipitation still remains
possible over parts of the Great Basin.  Confidence is also
increasing on a moderate rain focus which should gradually shift
into the Plains Thursday-Friday.

Meanwhile, a wavy frontal boundary settles and lingers this period
into the northern Gulf of Mexico and vicinity to focus several
periods of moderate to heavy rains over Florida/Gulf Coast/Lower
Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains through the forecast period.
The heavy rain chances appear highest from the central Gulf Coast
to the Florida Panhandle this weekend and possibly into Monday as
a low pressure wave could form along the front.  The central Gulf
Coast states and vicinity have had much above normal rainfall
recently with continued flooding concerns.

Farther north, recent guidance has maintained a stronger and less
progressive main upper trough/low over the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast Thursday-Friday.  Moderate to locally heavy rainfall can
be expected to accompany an associated front and surface low to
track across the region.  The possibility of coastal cyclogenesis
will also present some maritime and coastal threats later week
into the weekend.  There may also be some mountain snows over the
interior Northeast as the upper low over the Great Lakes interacts
with the developing coastal low.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0148 AM CDT Tue Apr 13 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE LOWER GREAT
BASIN...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHEAST ARIZONA INTO
WESTERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the Interior West as a
surface low deepens across the lower Great Basin today. Dry
southwesterly flow will develop during the afternoon across the
southern Great Basin and Lower Colorado River Basin, promoting
conditions favorable for wildfire spread across the lower terrain,
where fuels are most receptive to fire spread.

...Southern Great Basin into the Lower Colorado River Basin...
The combination of diurnal heating, increased gradient wind speeds
with the intensifying surface low, and downslope flow will promote
widespread 15-25 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds
across much of the lower Great Basin into the Lower Colorado River
Basin, where 10-20% RH will be common. Latest guidance consensus
continues to depict portions of southern Nevada into northwest
Arizona and far southeast Arizona into western New Mexico as primary
regions for longer-term, overlapping Critical winds/RH. Still, at
least locally Critical conditions are possible across the remainder
of the Elevated area.

...Portions of the Southeast...
Relatively dry surface air is expected to meander across portions of
the southeast this afternoon, from South Carolina into the Florida
Peninsula. While much of the Southeast has experienced 2+ inch
rainfall within the past week, a minimum in precipitation
accumulations is noted across eastern Georgia into central and
southern South Carolina, where RH may dip into the 25-35% range by
afternoon peak heating. Fire weather highlights are being withheld
since mainly light and variable winds are present. However,
localized fire-spread concerns exist where 30% or less surface RH
overlaps dry fuels.

...A lingering Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat into
late week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was derived from a composite
blend of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian days 3-5 (Friday/weekend) in a pattern with
above normal predictability. A composite blend of the 18 UTC GEFS
mean, 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models for seems best consistent with growing forecast spread days
6/7 (Monday/next Tuesday), in a pattern with average
predictability for these longer time frames. This acts to maintain
good WPC continuity in an overall forecast scenario that seems in
line with latest 00 UTC guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A closed trough/low working out from the West and lead cold
Canadian high pressure (with temp anomalies ~10-20 degrees below
normal) should allow a potentially heavy upslope snow event over
the Central Rockies/High Plains linger Friday into Saturday as a
moderate rain focus spreads across the Plains. Upper trough
reinforcement seems likely back through an unsettled Rockies and
Plains into early next week considering upstream upper ridge
amplitude and blocky nature of the Pacific. This seems best shown
by ensemble means versus the more varied model solutions that
suffer from uncertain shortwave wavelength spacing.

Meanwhile, recent guidance offers a stronger and less progressive
main upper trough/low over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday
into Saturday. Lingering moderate to locally heavy wrapping
rainfall can be expected to accompany an associated front and
surface low. There should also be some mountain snows over the
cooled Northeast as potent coastal cyclogenesis presents maritime
and coastal high wind and wave threats.

Well south, a wavy frontal boundary settles and lingers this
period over the northern Gulf of Mexico and vicinity to focus
several periods of moderate to heavy rains over Florida/Gulf
Coast/Lower Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains. Heavy rain chances
appear highest from the central Gulf Coast to Florida as hard to
time low pressure waves work along the front and focus moisture
convergence and instability. The central Gulf Coast states and
vicinity have had much above normal rainfall recently and
continued flooding concerns.

appear highest from the central Gulf Coast to Florida as hard to
time low pressure waves work along the front and focus moisture
convergence and instability. The central Gulf Coast states and
vicinity have had much above normal rainfall recently and
continued flooding concerns.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 AM CDT Tue Apr 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST ARIZONA INTO
NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
The amplifying mid-level trough and associated surface low that will
promote favorable wildfire-spread conditions across the Southwest on
Day 1 will meander across the Interior West as a cutoff low on Day
2. Given the lack of anticipated rainfall, fuels will continue to
cure and support wildfire spread, especially across the lower
terrain. Meanwhile, a weak mid-level shortwave trough is expected to
traverse the Southeast U.S., with a surface lee trough promoting a
strong enough surface wind field coincident with very dry air across
the southeast to promote some wildfire spread concerns.

...Portions of the Southwest U.S...
Through the afternoon, widespread sustained southwesterly 15-25 mph
surface winds are expected to develop with daytime heating,
coinciding with 10-20% RH in most places across the Lower Colorado
River Valley, where Elevated highlights were introduced.  Guidance
currently depicts northern Arizona into west-northwest New Mexico as
the most likely location for Critical winds/RH to overlap for well
over 3 hours, hence the Critical highlights. At least locally
Critical conditions are expected across the Elevated area, and
expansions to the Critical delineation may be needed in future
outlooks.

...Portions of the Southeast U.S...
20-30% RH may develop across portions of eastern Georgia into South
Carolina by afternoon peak heating tomorrow. Compared to previous
days though, the passage of a surface lee trough and associated wind
shift may result in at least 10-15 mph sustained southwesterly winds
across the area before moister conditions and potential rainfall
arrive. This surface wind/RH combination atop drying fine fuels
(devoid of meaningful precipitation for over a week) may encourage
Elevated conditions for fire spread. Some disagreement exists among
guidance members, with some models showing a lack of favorable
winds/RH. However, enough of a consensus has been reached among
individual model members and ensemble guidance for the confidence in
delineating Elevated fire weather highlights.

Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Tue Apr 13 2021 - 12Z Thu Apr 15 2021

...A slow-moving storm will bring widespread snows to the Great
Basin and central Rockies, with heavy accumulations for the
mountains...

...Strong to severe storms, including damaging winds, large-hail
and heavy rain are expected for portions of eastern Texas and
Louisiana...

...Critical Fire Weather conditions are expected across portions
of the Southwest...

A slow-moving area of low pressure will continue to produce
widespread precipitation across the northern Great Plains and
Upper Midwest, including some late-season accumulating snows from
Montana to the Upper Great Lakes.  Precipitation is expected to
continue through Tuesday before diminishing from west to east
across the Plains as the system moves east on Wednesday.  As the
system moves east, scattered precipitation will begin to develop
across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Wednesday, with organized
heavier precipitation forecast to develop over the northern
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast by Thursday morning.

A slow-moving frontal boundary to the south, interacting with
increasing moisture, is expected to encourage shower and
thunderstorm development across the southern Plains and lower
Mississippi valley on Tuesday and Wednesday.  There is the
potential that some of these storms may become strong to severe,
especially across eastern Texas and Louisiana.  In addition to
concerns for large hail and damaging winds, these storms may also
produce heavy rainfall amounts.  Given the high stream flows and
saturated soils due to recent heavy rains across the lower
Mississippi Valley and central Gulf Coast, the threat for
additional heavy rains will also likely lead to increasing
flooding concerns across the region on Tuesday and Wednesday.

As the lead system over the Midwest drifts east, a second
slow-moving system will develop over the Pacific Northwest on
Tuesday and sink slowly southward into the northern Great Basin by
Wednesday.  Increasing precipitation coverage across the Great
Basin and Rockies will include late-season snows the region.  Snow
developing on Tuesday and continuing through Wednesday into
Thursday is expected to result in heavy accumulations for portions
of the region, including the central and to southeastern Wyoming
ranges, as well as the central Colorado and northern Utah ranges.

In contrast to the wet conditions along the central Gulf Coast
into the lower Mississippi Valley, dry conditions, low relative
humidities and gusty winds will support an Elevated to Critical
Fire Weather Threat over the Southwest Tuesday and Wednesday.  Red
Flag Warnings will be in effect on Tuesday for a significant
portion of the California deserts, southern Nevada, northwestern
Arizona and southern Utah.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1156 AM CDT Mon Jul 26 2021

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. Ample mid-level moisture
continues to pivot around the upper ridge along the West Coast into
the Pacific Northwest, evident via the 12Z MFR sounding, which
showed precipitable water values exceeding 1.25 inches. Current MRMS
mosaic radar data also shows showers and isolated thunderstorms
extending from southern California into northeast Oregon, with a few
flashes noted over the past hour or so. With 16Z mesoanalysis
showing only about 250 J/kg MUCAPE on a more widespread basis along
the West Coast, storms are expected to remain very isolated through
the morning hours.

An increase in storm coverage is expected later this afternoon and
evening, as instability increases some with diurnal heating. Storms
are expected to be wet overall given 1+ inch precipitable water
values. Nonetheless, strikes on the periphery of storm cores will
support efficient lightning-induced fire starts given critically
receptive fuels. Isolated dry thunderstorms remain in place where
dry strikes are most likely, over the most receptive fuels.

..Squitieri.. 07/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0221 AM CDT Mon Jul 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
Monsoon moisture has started to advect northward along the
California coast with PWAT of 1.31 inches at VBG and 1.07 inches at
OAK. This moisture will continue to rotate around the upper-level
anticyclone through the day today. Some elevated convection may be
possible across northern California and southern Oregon early in the
day with some isolated lightning possible. The greater threat will
likely be during the afternoon and evening hours during peak
heating. Forecast soundings show limited instability (200 to 400
J/kg) which may keep storms weak/isolated. In addition, storms may
be on the wetter side given slow storm motions and PWAT values
approaching 1 inch. However, fuels are extremely dry in the area
with widespread 98th percentile to near record dry fuels. Therefore,
even if storms are more wet, there will likely still be an ignition
threat outside cores and where forest canopy is dense.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 26 2021

SYNOPSIS: A mid-level ridge, slightly strong for early August, is forecast =
to
become centered over the Southern Great Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley
during week-2. The location and strength of this ridge favors a continued
elevated risk of excessive heat for much of the Great Plains, western Corn
Belt, and Middle to Lower Mississippi Valley. An elevated risk for excessiv=
e
heat is also favored over the northwestern CONUS where multiple large
wildfires
continue to burn across parts of California, the Pacific Northwest, and
Northern Rockies. A strong area of mid-level low pressure over the Bering S=
ea
is likely to result in a continued wet pattern for western Mainland Alaska.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for parts of the Central to Southern Great
Plains, western Corn Belt, and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tue-Mon, Aug 3-9.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the Great Plains, western Corn Be=
lt,
and Middle to Lower Mississippi Valley, Tue-Mon, Aug 3-9.

Slight risk of excessive heat for eastern Oregon and Washington along and
parts
of Idaho, Tue-Mon, Aug 3-9.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for western Mainland Alaska, Tue-Thu, Au=

FOR THURSDAY JULY 29 - MONDAY AUGUST 02:

0MFtEXDnFd4$

FOR TUESDAY AUGUST 03 - MONDAY AUGUST 09: The ensemble means are in good
agreement that an amplified 500-hPa ridge axis becomes centered over the Gr=
eat
Plains early in week-2. This evolving longwave pattern is expected to maint=
ain
a heat wave risk over the central CONUS through early August. Based on 500-=
hPa
heights ranging from 588 to 594 dam along with various temperature tools, a
slight risk of excessive heat is posted for much of the Great Plains, weste=
rn
Corn Belt, and Middle to Lower Mississippi Valley. The GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools depict that daily maximum temperatures have near or more t=
han
a 20 percent chances of exceeding the 85th percentile of the climatological
distribution for the outlined slight risk area through the entirety of week=
-2.
Maximum temperatures are forecast to range from near 90 degrees F across th=
e
Northern Great Plains to more than 100 degrees F across parts of Oklahoma a=
nd
Texas. A moderate risk of excessive heat is posted for parts of the central
and
southern Great Plains where 500-hPa heights are forecast to be at or above =
594
dam and maximum daily heat index values are most likely to exceed 105 degre=
es
F
and meet heat advisory/warning criteria. This moderate risk covers the
entirety
of week-2 as this anomalous 500-hPa ridge is forecast to persist. Due to mo=
del
differences regarding how far north the anomalous heat extends, the norther=
n
Plains are not included in the moderate risk at this time.



A slight risk of excessive heat is posted for eastern Oregon and Washington
along with parts of Idaho where the GEFS reforecast tool depicts that there=
 is
near a 20 percent chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percent=
ile
and 95 degrees F. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, valid on July 20,
extreme (D3) to exceptional (D4) drought is designated for more than half o=
f
Oregon. In addition to the worsening drought conditions, multiple large
wildfires continue to burn from Oregon and Washington east to Idaho and
western
Montana. Also, the Dixie wildfire has burned more than 180,000 acres in Plu=
mas
County of northern California. The predicted above normal temperatures thro=
ugh
at least through early August is likely to maintain elevated wildfire dange=
r
and further dry fuels across California, the Pacific Northwest, and the
northern Rockies. Prevailing mid-level flow is likely to spread smoke plume=
s
well eastward and reduce air quality at times across much of the CONUS.



No precipitation hazards are posted for the CONUS since the expansive ridge
centered over the Great Plains is favored to result in near to below normal
precipitation across a majority of the lower 48. Shortwave troughs and
mesoscale consecutive systems may bring locally heavy rain to the Midwest
during week-2, but large uncertainty on timing precludes designation of any
heavy rain hazard. Given the predicted location of the 500-hPa ridge axis t=
o
the east, monsoonal moisture is forecast to be suppressed during the Aug 3-=
9
period.



An amplified 500-hPa trough over the Bering Sea elevates probabilities of
above
normal precipitation across most of Alaska. Due to the likelihood of heavy
rainfall prior to week-2 and a continued signal for additional heavy rainfa=
ll
(GEFS reforecast with a 20 percent chance of 3-day amounts exceeding the 85=
th
percentile), a slight risk of heavy rain is posted from Bristol Bay northwa=
rd
across western Mainland Alaska from Aug 3-5.

Valid 12Z Thu Jul 29 2021 - 12Z Mon Aug 02 2021

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Guidance has been increasingly consistent during the last few days
and overall agrees that a strong closed upper high over the
central U.S. will gradually weaken and shift southward from late
this week into Monday while a ridge extends through the Rockies
and north-central Intermountain West into western Canada. The
northward amplitude and sharpness of this ridge will likely
support an unseasonably deep eastern Canada/U.S. upper trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting across the West between the
ridge/closed high and emerging eastern Pacific troughing will
promote widespread chances for monsoonal rainfall with isolated
local runoff issues. Highest rainfall totals during the five-day
period are likely to be over the Great Basin and northern-central
Rockies where there should also be increasing coverage of daytime
highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand the Pacific Northwest
may see very warm to hot conditions (highs up to 10-15F above
normal), especially Thursday-Saturday, before a moderating trend
as heights aloft decline. Some record warm minimum temperature
records will be possible to the west of the Rockies, both within
the warm pattern over the Northwest and elsewhere due to
clouds/moisture. Areas from the southern Plains into Lower
Mississippi Valley will be rather hot albeit with mostly
single-digit anomalies for daytime highs.

Meanwhile, multiple shortwaves will dig downstream from the ridge
to amplify the mean upper trough over the northeastern quadrant of
the lower 48. Favorable upper support may help to produce strong
convection and locally heavy downpours focusing with
moisture/instability pooling near wavy fronts that may become slow
moving as they reach the southern periphery of the mean trough
aloft. Expect convective outflow and reinforcing frontal surges to
shift the best focused rainfall chances later this week from the
Midwest to Northeast down to the Southeast. Dependent on frontal
boundary placement/reinforcement and smaller scale surface lows
upstream, focused moisture may then round the top of the central
U.S. ridge to fuel periods of renewed convection/local downpours
from the northern Plains to the Midwest/Tennessee Valley. The
eastern U.S. pattern will be most favorable for below normal
temperatures over the Northeast. A few locations with shorter
periods of record in the northern Mid-Atlantic could even approach
or reach daily record low values on Saturday morning.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest guidance still suggests that the overall pattern evolution
during Thursday-Monday offers above average predictability.
Primary uncertainties in the forecast involve the specifics of the
mean trough's embedded shortwaves that will affect surface low
pressure/frontal details and the timing of a Northeast Pacific
upper low's arrival into the Alaska Panhandle/western Canada (with
some potential effect on the downstream trough). Looking at the
past couple days of guidance for the eastern trough, the ensemble
means have been fairly steady through the period while the ECMWF
has been more consistent in principle than the GFS for the second
main feature within the mean trough. The 00Z/06Z GFS runs appeared
closer to consensus than some earlier runs but the 00Z run became
flatter toward the end of the period while the 06Z run was on the
fast/amplified side mid-late period. Both the GFS and ECMWF have
been inconsistent for the northeastern Pacific upper low. 06Z
GFS/00Z ECMWF trends from their prior 6/12-hourly runs
respectively added support for a slower upper low progression.
Given the GFS comparisons over the East, the 00Z/06Z operational
model composite used early in the period phased out GFS input
after mid-period on the way to a model/mean blend that
incorporated the 00Z ECMWF and a little 00Z CMC along with 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means.  The only noticeable continuity adjustment
was a slower trend for the front dropping southeastward from the
northern tier Saturday onward--which was plausible given the trend
for a more persistent western Canada upper ridge that could hold
back the progression of height falls within the eastern trough.

12Z solutions still vary within the eastern trough aloft
especially mid-late period and thus for timing of the
Saturday-Monday front. The model/mean average appears to have
returned to a slightly faster frontal progression. The new CMC is
on its own in straying faster with the northeastern Pacific upper
low by next Monday.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon July 26 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 01 - 05 2021

Todays numerical model solutions from the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian forecas=
t
suites are generally in good agreement today on the mean 500-hPa height
pattern
across the forecast domain. A persistent and anomalously strong closed 500-=
hPa
low is predicted over the western Bering Sea. A split-flow pattern is
predicted
downstream of this closed low, with 500-hPa ridging anticipated across cent=
ral
and eastern Alaska and troughing forecast farther to the south off the coas=
t
of
the Pacific Northwest. Subtropical ridging is expected to dominate much of =
the
CONUS during the outlook period. The ridge is forecast to be centered over =
the
west-central CONUS early in the period and then expand across the Plains an=
d
Southeast as time progresses. An anomalously strong trough is expected acro=
ss
the Northeast for most of the 6-10 day period, but is generally forecast to
weaken near the end of the period. The manual 500-hPa height blend, based
primarily on the ensemble means from the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models,
supports below normal heights across the Northeast as well as parts of west=
ern
Alaska. Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are expected elsewhere across =
the
forecast domain.

With subtropical ridging expected to dominate much of the country, above
normal
temperatures are favored across the northwestern, central, and southeastern
CONUS. The primary focus of the above normal temperatures is expected to be
across the interior northwestern CONUS early in the period and then spreadi=
ng
eastward across the Plains and Southeast with time. The Northeast and Great
Lakes are largely expected to be spared from the heat as a mean trough favo=
rs
below normal temperatures across these regions for most of the period.
Probabilities of below normal temperatures are also enhanced across parts o=
f
the Great Basin and Southwest as moisture and cloud cover may act to keep
maximum temperatures down. Above normal temperatures are generally favored
across much of Mainland Alaska ahead of a closed upper level low forecast o=
ver
the western Bering Sea.

Expansive subtropical ridging is expected to favor below normal precipitati=
on
across the Southern Plains and parts of the Florida Peninsula. Conversely, =
the
potential continuation of moist monsoonal flow leads to enhanced probabilit=
ies
of above normal precipitation across much of the interior West. Below norma=
l
precipitation is likely for much of the Great Lakes and Northeast associate=
d
with relatively cool, stable surface high pressure. Above normal precipitat=
ion
is likely for parts of the Southeast as a frontal boundary pushes to the so=
uth
early in the period. An active pattern is favored across western Alaska ahe=
ad
of the closed upper level low predicted over the western Bering Sea.
Conversely, downstream ridging favors below normal precipitation for easter=
n
Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on

ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Slightly above normal, 4 out o=
f 5
due to relatively good model agreement.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 03 - 09 2021

During the week-2 period, numerical model guidance depicts a generally simi=
lar
500-hPa flow pattern to that predicted for the preceding 6-10 day period. A
strong upper low is forecast to persist well into week-2 over the Bering Se=
a
continuing an active pattern for western Alaska. Downstream, ridging is
forecast to continue over eastern Alaska and a weak trough is forecast fart=
her
to the south off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. Subtropical ridging is
predicted to build across much of the CONUS with peak strength expected dur=
ing
the middle of the week-2 period across the Southern Plains. A trough is
forecast to persist early in week-2 across the Great Lakes and Northeast an=
d
weaken as time progresses. 500-hPa heights are generally forecast to be nea=
r
to
slightly above normal for the period as a whole across most of the CONUS, w=
ith
the exception of the Northeast where near to slightly below normal heights =
are
favored. Above normal heights are favored for eastern Alaska while below
normal
heights are likely over western Alaska near the persistent upper level low
over
the Bering Sea.

The week-2 temperature pattern is expected to be very similar to that
predicted
for the 6-10 day period across much of the forecast domain. Above normal
temperatures are favored for the northwestern, central, and southeastern CO=
NUS
as well as the West Coast. Near normal temperatures are favored for much of

week-2. The temperature pattern for Alaska is forecast to be similar to the
6-10 day period, with above normal temperatures favored for the northeaster=

Mainland and a slight tilt toward near or below normal temperatures for the
remainder of the state.

With the persistent upper level low forecast over the Bering Sea, an active
pattern is forecast to continue well into week-2 across western Alaska.
Probabilities of above normal precipitation exceed 50 percent across much o=

Therefore, a slight tilt toward below normal precipitation extends westward=

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0237 PM CDT Mon Jul 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. The latest guidance
continues to show 1+ inch precipitable water values pivoting around
a mid-level anticyclone across the northwest U.S., providing ample
moisture for isolated to scattered thunderstorm development tomorrow
afternoon and evening, from northern California to the northern
Rockies. Isolated dry thunderstorm highlights remain in place for
areas that have the greatest chance of experiencing dry strikes
(particularly on the periphery of storm cores), and where fuels are
critically receptive to fire spread.

Southerly surface flow will become prevalent across the
central/northern High Plains as surface lee troughing takes shape
tomorrow afternoon and evening. The latest guidance consensus
suggests that minimum RH will range from 15-25% across the western
Dakotas into northwest Nebraska by afternoon peak heating. However,
guidance agreement is not as strong in depicting widespread 15+ mph
sustained surface winds coinciding with the aforementioned surface
RH. Fire weather highlights have been withheld for now, though an
Elevated delineation may be needed in future outlooks should
guidance consensus trend windier.

..Squitieri.. 07/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0221 AM CDT Mon Jul 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
Moisture will increase across the Northwest and northern Rockies on
Tuesday. A few weak mid-level shortwave troughs are forecast to move
northward from California and across eastern Oregon and Idaho. These
may provide ample lift for isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms throughout the day. PWAT values are forecast to be as
high as 1.25 inches in some areas which may limit the ignition
threat somewhat. However, fuels are near record dry across most of
this area and thus will be very susceptible to any lightning. In
addition, forecast soundings show LCLs around 4km with a mostly dry
sub-cloud layer which should evaporate some of the falling rainfall
and may lead to gusty and erratic surface winds.

...Above normal temperatures continue to impact a large portion of

...Severe weather likely for portions of the northern Great Plains
and Upper Midwest Monday evening...

Monsoon moisture continues to fuel showers and thunderstorms
across portions of the southwestern U.S.  These storms will have
the potential to produce locally heavy rainfall amounts, resulting
in flash flooding.  Flash flood watches remain in effect across
portions of California, Nevada, southern Utah, and southwestern
Colorado.  As this moisture streams north, shower and thunderstorm
coverage is expected to increase across the Great Basin and
portions of the Northwest on Tuesday.  While widespread heavy
rainfall amounts are not expected, locally heavy accumulations
resulting in flash flooding will remain a concern over the next
couple of days.

From the southwestern U.S. to southern Oregon, these storms will
help to keep temperatures at or below their seasonal averages
through Tuesday.  However, temperatures for much of the remainder
of the contiguous states will remain above normal into the middle
part of the week.  Heat Advisories and Excessive Heat Warnings
currently cover a significant portion of the central U.S. -- from
the central Gulf Coast to central Montana.  Heat Advisories or
Excessive Heat Warnings are also in effect for portions of
southern Idaho, northern Nevada, eastern Oregon, and Florida.

It expected to become a stormy afternoon and evening across
portions of the northern Great Plains and Upper Midwest.  Storms
that develop later today will have significant potential to become
severe, with damaging winds and large hail expected from portions
of the eastern Dakotas to northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin,
and Upper Michigan.  There is also the threat for severe storms to
develop producing damaging winds across parts of southern Virginia
and North Carolina.  Storms developing across these areas will
also have to the potential to produce locally heavy rainfall
amounts resulting in flash flooding.

Showers and thunderstorms are forecast to develop once again
across portions of the Upper Midwest on Tuesday.  However, the
greater threat for severe weather is expected to shift farther
south into southern Minnesota and Wisconsin, where storms
producing damaging winds and hail may become a concern.
Meanwhile, locally severe storms may also develop along a cold
front dropping into the Northeast on Tuesday.  In addition to
those storms, this front is expected to deliver much cooler
temperatures to the region that will continue through midweek.

Valid 12Z Thu Jul 29 2021 - 12Z Mon Aug 02 2021

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Guidance has been increasingly consistent during the last few days
and overall agrees that a strong closed upper high over the
central U.S. will gradually weaken and shift southward from late
this week into Monday while a ridge extends through the Rockies
and north-central Intermountain West into western Canada. The
northward amplitude and sharpness of this ridge will likely
support an unseasonably deep eastern Canada/U.S. upper trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting across the West between the
ridge/closed high and emerging eastern Pacific troughing will
promote widespread chances for monsoonal rainfall with isolated
local runoff issues. Highest rainfall totals during the five-day
period are likely to be over the Great Basin and northern-central
Rockies where there should also be increasing coverage of daytime
highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand the Pacific Northwest
may see very warm to hot conditions (highs up to 10-15F above
normal), especially Thursday-Saturday, before a moderating trend
as heights aloft decline. Some record warm minimum temperature
records will be possible to the west of the Rockies, both within
the warm pattern over the Northwest and elsewhere due to
clouds/moisture. Areas from the southern Plains into Lower
Mississippi Valley will be rather hot albeit with mostly
single-digit anomalies for daytime highs.

Meanwhile, multiple shortwaves will dig downstream from the ridge
to amplify the mean upper trough over the northeastern quadrant of
the lower 48. Favorable upper support may help to produce strong
convection and locally heavy downpours focusing with
moisture/instability pooling near wavy fronts that may become slow
moving as they reach the southern periphery of the mean trough
aloft. Expect convective outflow and reinforcing frontal surges to
shift the best focused rainfall chances later this week from the
Midwest to Northeast down to the Southeast. Dependent on frontal
boundary placement/reinforcement and smaller scale surface lows
upstream, focused moisture may then round the top of the central
U.S. ridge to fuel periods of renewed convection/local downpours
from the northern Plains to the Midwest/Tennessee Valley. The
eastern U.S. pattern will be most favorable for below normal
temperatures over the Northeast. A few locations with shorter
periods of record in the northern Mid-Atlantic could even approach
or reach daily record low values on Saturday morning.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest guidance still suggests that the overall pattern evolution
during Thursday-Monday offers above average predictability.
Primary uncertainties in the forecast involve the specifics of the
mean trough's embedded shortwaves that will affect surface low
pressure/frontal details and the timing of a Northeast Pacific
upper low's arrival into the Alaska Panhandle/western Canada (with
some potential effect on the downstream trough). Looking at the
past couple days of guidance for the eastern trough, the ensemble
means have been fairly steady through the period while the ECMWF
has been more consistent in principle than the GFS for the second
main feature within the mean trough. The 00Z/06Z GFS runs appeared
closer to consensus than some earlier runs but the 00Z run became
flatter toward the end of the period while the 06Z run was on the
fast/amplified side mid-late period. Both the GFS and ECMWF have
been inconsistent for the northeastern Pacific upper low. 06Z
GFS/00Z ECMWF trends from their prior 6/12-hourly runs
respectively added support for a slower upper low progression.
Given the GFS comparisons over the East, the 00Z/06Z operational
model composite used early in the period phased out GFS input
after mid-period on the way to a model/mean blend that
incorporated the 00Z ECMWF and a little 00Z CMC along with 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means.  The only noticeable continuity adjustment
was a slower trend for the front dropping southeastward from the
northern tier Saturday onward--which was plausible given the trend
for a more persistent western Canada upper ridge that could hold
back the progression of height falls within the eastern trough.

12Z solutions still vary within the eastern trough aloft
especially mid-late period and thus for timing of the
Saturday-Monday front. The model/mean average appears to have
returned to a slightly faster frontal progression. The new CMC is
on its own in straying faster with the northeastern Pacific upper
low by next Monday.

...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern spreads over
the West...

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Latest guidance remains consistent and agrees that a strong closed
upper high over the central U.S. will gradually weaken and shift
southward from late this week into next as a ridge extends through
the Rockies and north-central Intermountain West to western
Canada. The northward amplitude and sharpness of the ridge will
likely support an unseasonably deep eastern Canada/U.S. upper
trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting across the West between the
ridge/closed high and emerging eastern Pacific troughing will
promote widespread chances for monsoonal rainfall with isolated
local runoff issues. Highest rainfall totals during the five-day
period are likely to be over the Great Basin and northern-central
Rockies where there should also be increasing coverage of daytime
highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand the Pacific Northwest
may see very warm to hot conditions (highs up to 10-15F above
normal), especially Friday-Saturday, before a moderating trend as
heights aloft decline. Some record warm minimum temperature
records will be possible to the west of the Rockies, both within
the warm pattern over the Northwest and elsewhere due to
clouds/moisture. Areas from the southern Plains into Lower
Mississippi Valley will be rather hot, albeit with mostly
single-digit anomalies for daytime highs. Many record warm lows
are also likely across the moist South.

Meanwhile, multiple shortwaves rounding the aforementioned upper
ridge will dig downstream to amplify the mean upper trough over
the northeastern quadrant of the lower 48. Favorable upper support
may help to produce strong convection and locally heavy downpours
focusing with moisture/instability pooling near wavy fronts that
may become slow moving as they reach the southern periphery of the
mean trough aloft. Convective outflow and reinforcing frontal
surges will act to gradually shift best focused rainfall chances
later this week into next down over the Plains and from the
Mid-MS/TN Valleys to the Carolinas/Southeast, with guidance trends
forcing the main axis of precipitation slightly southward compared
to continuity. The eastern U.S. pattern will be most favorable for
below normal temperatures from the Great Lakes/Northeast to the
Mid-Atlantic where a few locations with shorter periods of record
may approach record low values on Saturday morning.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability Days
3-7. A trend to develop an unseasonably amplified eastern U.S.
upper trough seems reasonable considering the strength of the
upstream ridge. The WPC medium range product suite was derived
from a blend of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and 12
UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models Friday into the weekend before switching to a blend of the
ECENS/GEFS ensemble means and 18 UTC GFS/12 UTC ECMWF by early
next week. This strategy maintained excellent WPC product
continuity.

The latest 00 UTC GFS/ECMWF maintain good run to run continuity
despite continued differences with shortwaves in the large scale
eastern U.S. upper trough. The blend mitigates these differences.
The 12 UTC UKMET/Canadian were outliers into Sunday-Tuesday by
bringing northeast Pacific upper trough energy more robustly
inland into western Canada than the GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means. The 00 UTC UKMET/Canadian have trended in line
with other guidance, bolstering forecast confidence.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 AM CDT Tue Jul 27 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will slowly drift eastward toward the central
Plains today. Thunderstorm activity has been prolific near the
monsoon moisture on the southwest fringe of this upper-level ridge.
Some of this monsoon moisture is advecting northward into the
Pacific Northwest with PWAT values of 1.31 inches on the 00Z MFR
sounding, which is near the daily maximum recorded value for this
RAOB site. Cloud cover limited instability across Oregon on Monday
and kept afternoon thunderstorm activity to a minimum. Expansive
cloud cover is forecast once again on Tuesday across northern
California and eastern Oregon, which could limit convective
coverage. However, with this cloud cover will also come increasing
low-level moisture and therefore, there may not be much heating
required for thunderstorm activity from northern California into
Oregon, especially with a weak shortwave forecast to cross the
region during the afternoon hours.

Farther northeast, less mid-level cloud cover is forecast and thus
surface heating is expected to be sufficient for some afternoon
thunderstorm activity.

Fuels are very dry across the entire Northwest with ERC percentiles
above the 95th percentile and some areas near record fuel dryness.
Therefore, even though some storms may be on the wetter side given
the PWAT values, lighting ignitions are still possible given the dry
fuels.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 AM CDT Tue Jul 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge will amplify on Tuesday night and be centered
near western Nebraska during the day Wednesday. At the surface, a
weak low pressure is forecast to cross the Dakotas. In its wake, dry
and breezy conditions are forecast in its wake.

...IsoDryT - Pacific Northwest...
Isolated dry thunderstorms will be possible again on Wednesday
across much of northern California and the Northwest. Cloud cover
which limited instability on Monday and Tuesday is not expected to
be an inhibiting factor on Wednesday. Therefore, despite warming
temperatures aloft due to the building upper-level ridge, ample
instability is forecast for isolated to scattered storm development
from northern California into Idaho and western Montana. Slightly
greater coverage may be possible in south-central Oregon as a weak
shortwave is forecast to move northward during the afternoon hours
and may provide enough additional ascent for more storms.

...Southeast Montana, northwest North Dakota, and northeast
Wyoming...
Dry and breezy conditions are forecast in the wake of a surface cold
front on Wednesday afternoon across portions of the northern Plains.
At this time the elevated area is focused in the immediate wake of
the cold front where there is the best chance for dry and breezy
conditions, but the GFS has a much larger area of potential elevated
conditions which extends across much of North Dakota. Since
high-resolution guidance keeps the threat confined to areas
immediately behind the front, have not expanded the elevated to
these areas, but will continue to monitor this in later forecasts.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southeast through Wednesday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes Wednesday through early Thursday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Upper Midwest and the Lower Great Lakes through Wednesday
morning...

...Excessive Heat Warning over parts of the Northern High Plains;
Heat Advisory over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley/Southern
Plains, Northern/Central Plains, and the Northern High Plains...

A front extending from the Northeast across the Great Lakes into
the Northern High Plains will have multiple waves of low pressure
that will travel along the boundary as the front slowly settles
southward to the Mid-Atlantic roughly westward to the Northern
Rockies by Thursday. Showers and thunderstorms will develop along
and near the boundary, some of which may become severe.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Upper Midwest and the Lower Great
Lakes through Wednesday morning. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and minimal risk of tornadoes. The severe
thunderstorm threat increases on Wednesday into Thursday over the
Upper Great Lakes/Upper Mississippi Valley with the SPC hoisting
another Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms and the WPC
introducing a Slight Risk for flash flooding.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Mid-Atlantic across the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys into the Northern Plains will slowly
dissipate this evening.  South of the front, tropical moisture
will extend from the Southeast to parts of the Lower Mississippi
Valley and the Southern Plains. An upper-level impulse over the
Southeast will trigger showers and thunderstorms over the region
yielding heavy rain. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms through Wednesday
morning.  The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized
areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small
streams.  While showers and thunderstorms will continue across the
Southeast to the Southern Plains through midweek, the excessive
rainfall threat will lessen Wednesday into Thursday.

Furthermore, the excessive rainfall threat over the West will
diminish as the moisture associated with the monsoon has weakened.
Showers and thunderstorms will continue over the Southwest,
Central/Southern Rockies, and Great Basin through Thursday,
becoming more diurnal.

Over the Northwest, there is an Excessive Heat Warning over parts
of the Northern High Plains, where temperatures will rise into the
100s. Furthermore, Heat Advisories are currently in effect for
portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains,
Northern/Central Plains, and the Northern High Plains.  Moreover,
several regions have Air Quality Alerts due to wildfires over the
Northwest into the Northern Rockies.

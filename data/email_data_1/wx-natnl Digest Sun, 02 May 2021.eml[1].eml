Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1150 AM CDT Sat May 01 2021

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEVADA...SOUTHWEST
UTAH...NORTHWEST ARIZONA...

Minor changes to the ongoing forecast based on current observations.
Locally critical conditions appear possible in the northern Plains.
The typically drier guidance appears to be much too aggressive with
boundary-layer mixing. Coupled with decreasing 0-2 km winds during
the day, confidence in sustained critical is low.

The leading edge of moisture return is roughly along the OK/KS
border. Timing the northward advance of this moisture suggests that
it will mostly impact Kansas this afternoon. For Nebraska into Iowa,
current observations and the 12Z OAX sounding do indicate potential
for several hours of elevated to locally critical conditions into
late afternoon. As previously noted, the presence of greening fuels
in many locations reduces confidence in large fire potential. That
being said, smaller fires are certainly possible in areas where
fuels are relatively drier.

The forecast for parts of the southern Great Basin vicinity remains
unchanged.

..Wendt.. 05/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Sat May 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime punctuated by transient shortwave
troughing across the West is expected to develop through the
forecast period. The upper low over southern Texas will eject
northeastward while upper-level ridging envelops the Southeast. At
the surface, high pressure across the central Appalachians will move
offshore while low pressure develops across the central Rockies and
Plains from a previous low over the Upper Midwest.

...Southern Nevada, Southwest Utah, and Northwest Arizona...
Ahead of a cold front trailing from the central Rockies/Plains area
of low pressure, dry southwesterly winds are expected to develop
through the afternoon hours. Increasing flow aloft from the West
Coast trough should bolster low-level winds to critical criteria
(20-25 mph) through the afternoon. Warm temperatures in the 80s to
90s F will support dry conditions with widespread surface RH below
15%. The resulting overlap will support elevated/critical fire
weather conditions across much of the southern Great Basin and
southwest where fuels are drier than normal.

...Montana and North Dakota...
Northwesterly surface winds, in the wake of a weakening area of low
pressure across the Upper Midwest, will likely remain strong enough
to support a few hours of elevated fire weather conditions this
afternoon. Surface RH is forecast to remain in the 25-30% range,
with winds peaking around 15-20 mph. The most likely corridor for
overlap of gusty winds and low humidity is expected across
central/southern North Dakota, with decreasing confidence farther
northwest into eastern Montana. Cooler air to the northwest will
gradually increase humidity recoveries this evening and overnight,
decreasing the fire weather threat after sunset.

...Carolinas...
Offshore flow should gradually weaken through midday as surface high
pressure builds in from the northwest and slowly moves offshore.
Warm temperatures from strong diurnal heating will support humidity
values as low as 15-20% across the Piedmont through the afternoon.
Limited confidence exists concerning the overlap of the lingering
gusty surface winds and low surface humidity, suggesting that the
fire weather threat will be local in nature.

...Central Plains and Upper Midwest...
A developing area of low pressure across the Rockies and High Plains
will interact with a weakening low across northern Minnesota
increasing southerly winds to around 15-20 mph during the afternoon.
Relatively dry surface conditions are expected ahead of a surge of
Gulf moisture being drawn north across the central Plains. A few
hours of dry and windy conditions appear possible into the evening.
The primary limiting factors will be the presence of fuels in green
up, and the arrival of surface moisture later in the
afternoon/evening, which should keep the threat of elevated fire
weather conditions local in nature.

...Heavy rainfall threat across the South into Tuesday/Wednesday...

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

Guidance remains in above average agreement days 3-7 and offer
good run to run continuity, bolstering forecast confidence. Broad
cyclonic flow over much of the lower 48 states early next week
will feature numerous embedded shortwaves in two streams. The
active pattern will then significantly amplify as upper troughs
work into the West Coast and the East to sandwich a warming
west-central U.S. upper ridge. Variance remains with the timing
and strength of smaller scale systems. Composites tend to mitigate
these differences consistent with predictability. Accordingly, the
WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a blend
of well clustered guidance of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, the 12 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC National Blend
of Models. Latest 12 UTC models and ensembles remain in line.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A threat of widespread moderate to heavy rain and strong
thunderstorms remains mainly into Tue/Wed for portions of the
South, especially from eastern TX and the lower MS/TN Valleys to
the southern Appalachians. This may cause some flooding,
particularly where convective training develops or across areas
that will have already received noteworthy prior rains. Depending
on the downstream evolution and track of developing low pressure
off the East Coast later next week as the flow amplifies, moderate
rain can be expected for portions of the Mid-Atlantic and the
Northeast. Trough amplification into the West Coast may meanwhile
support enhanced precipitation over the Pacific Northwest that
seem slated to work inland to the northern Rockies next weekend.

In terms of temperatures, highs are expected to be about 5-15
degrees above average for much of the eastern U.S. early next
week. This will be followed by a return to below normal
temperatures to close out the week. Across the western U.S., heat
is expected to build in response to the upper level ridge, with
highs 10-20 degrees above normal possible for the middle to end of
the week for portions of the Intermountain West and the Desert
Southwest. This will equate to some 100+ degree high temperatures
for the lower elevations of eastern CA and southern AZ.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat May 01 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0206 PM CDT Sat May 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA INTO EAST-CENTRAL
NEW MEXCIO...

A few changes have been made to the forecast. The critical area has
been shifted slightly eastward in southern New Mexico as strong
winds and very low RH will exist in areas that were not
significantly impacted by precipitation the last few days. Given the
strength of the surface low, the critical has also been expanded
into portions of east-central New Mexico. Light rainfall has fallen
in these locations, but dead fuels remain dry, ERCs are at least
slightly above average, and strong winds and low RH should
compensate for any less receptive fuels. The elevated area has been
expanded into southeastern New Mexico and parts of the Trans-Pecos.
MRMS QPE shows roughly 1-2 inches of precipitation over the past 3
days in some of this region and ERCs have dropped accordingly.
Despite similarly very dry and windy conditions as surrounding
locations, fuels do not support a critical designation.

In northern California, elevated conditions are still likely
tomorrow. Locally critical conditions are most probable along the
western Valley where mid-level winds will be slightly stronger.

..Wendt.. 05/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Sat May 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Shortwave troughing across the western US will intensify through the
day as mid-level flow increases near the Four Corners. At the
surface, the central Plains lee low will slide southeastward across
the Texas Panhandle, drawing deep moisture northward across much of
the eastern CONUS. Ahead of a cold front across the southern Great
Basin, dry westerly winds are forecast to develop supporting
elevated/critical fire weather conditions over much of the
Southwest.

...Eastern Arizona and western New Mexico...
As southwesterly flow aloft increases ahead of the shortwave trough
digging in across the Four Corners, surface pressure falls in the
lee of the southern Rockies will drive low-level southwesterlies of
25-35 mph across much of Arizona and New Mexico. Dry air in place
and warm surface temperatures in the 70s and 80s F will support low
surface humidity values of 7-15% across a broad swath of the
Southwest. Elevated and critical fire weather conditions appear
likely across western New Mexico and eastern Arizona, where little
precipitation over the last several days and dry fuels will support
fire spread. To the south and east of this corridor, recent
precipitation will hamper fuel drying to some extent. Pockets of
locally elevated/critical conditions appear possible given the
favorable meteorological conditions expected. However, the
questionable fuel state precludes expansion of the elevated and
critical zones at this time.

...Northern California...
Post frontal northerly flow is expected across much of the
Sacramento Valley through the afternoon Day2/Sunday. Enhanced by
vertical momentum transport from a 50-60 kt mid-level jet on the
backside of the Four Corners trough, low-level winds of 15-25 mph
and higher gusts are expected. With warm temperatures and little
Pacific moisture in place, surface humidity of 15-25% are forecast
to develop through the afternoon. Elevated fire weather conditions
appear likely across the northern half of the Central Valley given
above-average fuel dryness.

408 PM EDT Sat May 01 2021

Valid 00Z Sun May 02 2021 - 00Z Tue May 04 2021

...There is a Sight risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Plains, Mississippi Valley, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys into
Monday...

...There is a Slight risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley into Sunday...

...Late-season wet snow over the Northern/Central Rockies on
Sunday into Monday...

A weakening upper-level low over Texas will move northeastward to
the Ohio Valley by Monday.  The system will produce showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains and the Lower
Mississippi Valley that will move to the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys
and the Southeast by Monday.  The WPC has issued a Slight risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Southern Plains through
Sunday morning.  Showers and thunderstorms will produce heavy rain
over parts of the region through Sunday.  The heavy rain will
produce scattered areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams being the most vulnerable.

Additionally, the SPC has issued a Sight risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Central Gulf Coast through Sunday
morning.  The main hazards with severe thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few
tornadoes.  The showers and thunderstorms will expand into the
Mid-Atlantic on Monday into Monday evening. There is also a risk
of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Central Gulf
Coast/Tennessee Valley on Sunday and over parts of the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley on Monday.
Furthermore, a quasi-stationary front extending from the Northeast
to the Upper Midwest will produce rain over the area through
Monday evening.

Meanwhile, an upper-level trough will develop over the Northern
Rockies into the Southwest by Sunday afternoon, which will deepen
over the Four Corners Region on Monday.  The upper-level trough
will weaken slightly by Monday evening.  The trough will help
produce rain over parts of the Pacific Northwest into the Northern
Rockies on Saturday evening.  Overnight Saturday, wet snow will
develop over parts of the Northern Rockies as rain moves into
parts of the Northern Plains by Sunday morning.  The rain will
expand into parts of the Central Plains and Central Rockies by
Sunday evening.  Overnight Sunday, the wet snow will expand into
parts of the Central Rockies, ending over most of the Northern
Rockies by Monday morning.  The snow will continue over the
Central Rockies through Monday evening. Likewise, the rain will
move into parts of the Southern Rockies and Southern High Plains
by Monday evening.

Elsewhere, a new front will move onshore over the Pacific
Northwest on Monday, moving inland by Monday evening.  Late Monday
morning, light rain will move into parts of the Northwest.

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

Broad cyclonic flow across the northern tier of the U.S. on
Wednesday is expected to remain in place across the Great Lakes
and the Northeast through the end of the week.  The western
Atlantic ridge near the East Coast will be shunted eastward as the
trough amplifies.  Out West, an upper level ridge axis builds in
ahead of the next Pacific storm system as the overall upper level
flow pattern becomes more amplified for the middle to end of the
week.

The deterministic guidance remains in above average agreement on
the synoptic scale features across the nation, especially through
Friday.  One of the main differences noted was a faster
progression of the 00Z CMC across the western U.S. for the second
half of the medium range period with the Pacific trough moving
inland.  Similar to yesterday, the GFS is considerably stronger
with the potential nor'easter off the East Coast by Friday, and
would be an impactful system if that solution comes to pass.  The
WPC forecast was primarily derived from a multi-deterministic
blend through Thursday night, and then a GFS/ECMWF blend along
with some of their respective ensemble means for Friday through
Sunday, while depicting a more modest low near the Northeast for
now.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Lingering heavy showers and storms remain likely across portions
of the central Gulf Coast on Wednesday, albeit less intense than
what is expected early in the week.  Depending on the evolution
and track of the developing low pressure off the East Coast late
in the week, light to moderate rain can be expected across
portions of the Mid-Atlantic region and the Northeast states.  The
next noteworthy rainfall event on the horizon for next weekend
would likely be across the middle Mississippi River valley as a
stationary front develops over this region.

In terms of temperatures, a cool down is expected across much of
the eastern U.S. behind the cold front and the upper level trough
builds in across the region, with readings of 5 to 10 degrees
below normal going into the weekend.  Across the western U.S.,
heat is expected to build in response to the upper level ridge,
with highs 10-20 degrees above normal possible for the second half
of the week for portions of the Intermountain West and the Desert
Southwest.  This will equate to some 100+ degree high temperatures
for the lower elevations of eastern California and southern
Arizona.  With the passage of the cold front on Saturday, more
seasonal temperatures are expected in time for the weekend.

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF ARIZONA...NEW
MEXICO...AND FAR WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
In a split flow regime across the CONUS, a southern-stream shortwave
trough over the Great Basin will dig southeastward and arrive over
the Four Corners by the end of the forecast period. As the trough
moves southeast, mid-level flow will gradually increase above the
southern Rockies and Southwest where a lee cyclone is forecast to
deepen across the western Texas Panhandle. In response to the
increasing flow aloft and lee cyclone, strong west-southwesterly
surface winds are expected across much of Arizona and New Mexico
ahead of a cold front forecast to strengthen across the southern
Great Basin.

...Arizona, New Mexico, and west Texas...
As mid-level flow increases ahead of the trough moving in from the
Great Basin, southwesterly surface winds will increase considerably
across eastern Arizona and New Mexico. Hi-res ensemble guidance
members show high confidence in sustained critical winds of 25-35
mph and higher gusts through much of the day. Warm temperatures and
very dry conditions, with surface RH in the 6-10% range, will be
conducive for elevated and critical fire weather conditions along a
corridor from eastern Arizona eastward into portions of northern and
central New Mexico.

Fuel conditions and the nature of the fire weather threat across
southeastern New Mexico and far west Texas remain much less clear
after widespread precipitation in the previous 72 hours. Rapid
curing of lower and middle-elevation fuels, given the significant
dry/windy conditions, appears probable by mid afternoon. This
suggests the threat for widespread critical fire weather conditions
exists, but is somewhat conditional and likely limited to
lower-density fuels. The critical area was expanded slightly
eastward to account for this threat.

...Northern California...
Dry post-frontal flow is expected across the northern half of the
Central Valley through the day and into this evening. Low-level
winds, primarily from the north, are forecast to reach speeds of
10-20 mph through the day. Already limited surface moisture is
expected to gradually mix out through the afternoon, aided by a 50
kt mid-level jet on the backside of the departing Four Corners
trough. With surface temperatures expected to remain warm (in the
70s and 80s F), source humidity should fall to near 10-15% by peak
heating. Only modest recoveries to 30-35% are expected after sunset,
suggesting the threat may linger into the overnight hours. The
combination of meteorological factors and above-average fuel dryness
should easily support elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions across much of the Sacramento Valley through the forecast
period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CDT Sun May 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing across the Four Corners will gradually intensify
as it shifts eastward into the central Plains through Day2/Monday.
High pressure is forecast to increase over the West Coast, while
northwesterly flow aloft dominates the East. At the surface, a cold
front is forecast to move from the Rockies southeastward onto the
Plains, bringing cooler air and little fire weather activity to much
of the country.

...Northern California...
With poor overnight humidity recoveries expected from the scouring
of low-level moisture by the previous days frontal passage, elevated
fire weather conditions appear possible again across the Sacramento
Valley. The onshore pressure gradient will support down-valley winds
of 10-15 mph through the afternoon, though winds are forecast to
gradually weaken through the day as the mid-level jet shifts
eastward. Warm temperatures and little moisture will support
humidity values as low as 6-10%, suggesting elevated and locally
critical fire weather conditions are likely.

...Southwest Texas...
Ahead of the cold front forecast to move across through the
Southwest late in the period, dry and windy conditions may support
locally elevated fire weather potential along the Rio Grande Valley.
Warm surface temperatures and humidity near 15-20% are expected with
westerly winds of 10-15 mph. Relatively dry fuels will support some
potential for fire weather conditions until higher RH recoveries
develop with the passage of the front later in the evening.

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across the lower
Mississippi Valley today...

...Advancing cold front to bring the threat of flash flooding and
severe weather across the central High Plains today and into the
Ohio and Middle Mississippi valleys on Monday...

...Late-season heavy snow to impact the northern/central Rockies
through Monday...

After multiple days of heavy rain across southern Texas, the
upper-level low and warm front responsible will drift north today
and into the lower Mississippi Valley. Although the overall
weather system will be weakening, heavy rain and severe
thunderstorms will still remain a concern. Over an inch of rain
could lead to flash flooding from southeast Louisiana to southern
Alabama. This area has experienced double its normal rainfall over
the last month, which will likely amplify the flood threat. WPC
has issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for the region,
with Flash Flood Watches in effect as well. Regarding the
potential for severe weather, SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms for much of the lower Mississippi Valley.
Damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes are all
possible through this evening.

Meanwhile, a spring cold front traversing the midsection of the
country will bring plenty of active weather from the Ohio Valley
to the central Rockies through the beginning of this week. Showers
and thunderstorms are forecast to develop across the central High
Plains this afternoon along the frontal boundary. A few storms
could turn severe and produce damaging wind gusts and large hail.
By tonight, slow moving thunderstorms may lead to flash flooding
across portions of the central Plains. At the same time, the
higher terrain of Wyoming and Colorado will have snow to contend
with. Upwards of 7 to 14 inches of snowfall are possible across
the highest peaks of northern Colorado by Monday evening. Winter
Storm Watches have been issued. A separate system entering the
northern Rockies on Monday evening could bring additional high
elevation snow showers.

As the aforementioned cold front progresses southeast Monday and
Monday night, showers and thunderstorms are expected to extend
throughout the Ohio and Mid-Mississippi valleys, as well as into
adjacent sections of the southern Plains. Severe weather will be
the biggest concern across the region, with destructive hail and
damaging wind gusts possible. SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms for Monday that stretches from southwest Ohio
to northeast Oklahoma.

Overall, temperatures are forecast to rise above average across
much of the country today, with the northern High Plains being the
only major exception. The advancing cold front will quickly drop
temperatures to around 10 to 20 degrees below average on Monday
across the central Rockies and central/southern High Plains. High
winds and low relative humidity found ahead of this frontal
boundary could produce critical fire weather today across eastern
Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas.

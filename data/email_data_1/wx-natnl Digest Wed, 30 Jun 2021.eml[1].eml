Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1139 AM CDT Tue Jun 29 2021

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

The latest high-resolution guidance has trended slightly windier
across the Cascades in Oregon to the Snake River Plain in southern
Idaho. Sustained easterly surface winds above 15 mph are expected on
a widespread basis, overlapping with 15-20% RH for several hours
this afternoon, warranting the addition of Elevated fire weather
highlights. A dry strike or two is also possible across far
northeast California into southeast Idaho this afternoon and
evening. However, very sparse thunderstorm coverage precludes an
isolated dry thunderstorm area addition/expansion. Otherwise, the
previous forecast remains on track for dry-strike potential across
the Sierra into the central Great Basin. Please see the previous
forecast (below) for more details on dry lightning potential. A few
storms may also produce erratic, strong to potentially damaging
gusts across the central Great Basin, where a Marginal risk for
severe storms is in place. Please see the latest Day 1 Convective
Outlook for more information on damaging gust potential.

..Squitieri.. 06/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0130 AM CDT Tue Jun 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
Beneath a record strength mid-level anticyclone, extremely warm and
dry conditions are expected to continue across the Pacific Northwest
and northern Rockies. To the west, a shortwave trough will approach
the coast of California, spreading lift and mid-level moisture
inland across the Great Basin. Showers and thunderstorms will
overspread much of the West, with isolated potential for lightning
strikes in dry fuels across the Great Basin and Southwest.

...Southern Great Basin and the Sierra...
As mid-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and eastern pacific
continue to spread north across the Southwest, lift from the
approaching western trough will overspread the region through the
day. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are forecast to form, first
on the higher terrain, before spread out with time. Model forecast
soundings show high PWATs, (0.7-1.1 inches across Arizona and New
Mexico, into western Colorado. A slightly drier airmass to the north
and west suggests a mixed mode of dry/west storms are possible.
Regardless of state, sufficient buoyancy (250-500 J/kg of MUCAPE)
should support isolated to widely scattered lightning strikes from
eastern California through the Great Basin and central Rockies.
Record dry fuels will be susceptible to lightning ignitions
necessitating dry thunder probabilities. The most likely corridor
for dry strikes will be at the northern and western fringes of the
moisture surge, where a more deeply mixed boundary-layer will better
support inefficient precipitation processes.

...Pacific Northwest...
Hot, dry, and unstable conditions are expected beneath the axis of
the mid-level ridge through the day, suggesting increased potential
for plume-dominated fire weather risks. The strong heating will
generate a thermal trough, which may also locally enhance surface
winds to 15 mph. Surface RH below 25% is expected, likely supporting
locally elevated fire weather conditions through the afternoon.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 29 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure favors the continuation of
anomalously warm temperatures and excessive heat concerns across the western
and north-central contiguous U.S. during week-2. Surface low pressure
development increases the potential for heavy precipitation from the Southern
Plains to the Great Lakes during the period. Enhanced monsoonal moisture and
precipitation may result in localized flooding over parts of Desert Southwest.
Over Alaska, mid-level low pressure is likely to bring below (above) normal
temperatures (precipitation) across much of the state.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Intermountain
region, Great Basin, Rockies, Northern Plains and the Upper Mississippi
Valley,
Wed-Sun, Jul 7-11.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western CONUS, and the
north-central CONUS, Wed-Tue, Jul 7-13.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Southern and Central
Plains, Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, the Great Lakes, and the
Appalachians, Wed-Fri, Jul 7-9.

Flooding possible across southeastern Arizona and southern New Mexico.

continued agreement between the dynamical models favoring the deamplification
of a strong 500-hPa ridge centered over western North America which is
expected
to alleviate excessive heat potential and the near record breaking
temperatures
affecting many parts of the western U.S. By early week-2, there are some
disparities in the latest GEFS and ECMWF ensemble guidance in regards to the
predicted redevelopment of the anomalous mid-level ridging over the CONUS. By
days 8 and 9 (Jul 7-8), the 0z GEFS features more of a zonal pattern across
the
northwestern CONUS, then favoring the anomalous ridging retrograding from the
north-central CONUS to the West towards the middle of the period. The 0z
ECMWF,
however, favors the persistence of anomalous ridging across the northwestern
CONUS early in the period, which is then forecast to gradually strengthen and
expand throughout the southwestern CONUS through day 12 (Jul 11).  Despite
some
of these differences early in the period, excessive heat remains the primary
hazard concern across much of the western and north-central CONUS during the
outlook period.



Similar to yesterday, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools maintain a
broad
region covering much of the western and north-central CONUS with at least a
20%
chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 degrees F.
Thus, a slight risk of excessive heat remains issued for the entirety of
week-2. Reforecast tool guidance continues to show elevated signals for
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile across the Northeast, however
actual
temperatures are not anticipated to exceed hazardous thresholds at this time.
Higher probabilities (>40%) remain featured in both reforecast tools across
the
north-central CONUS. There are, however, increased signals further south
relative to yesterday's reforecast guidance across the higher elevations of
the
West tied to the predicted development of anomalous ridging by the middle of
the period.  As a result, a moderate risk of excessive heat remains issued
from
Jul 7 to 11 but has been expanded further south to include parts of the Great
Basin and Central Rockies. The continuation of excessive heat is anticipated
to
promote the emergence of flash drought, and worsen ongoing moderate (D1) to
extreme (D4) conditions being felt throughout much of the West and
north-central CONUS. Heat-driven impacts expected also include locally
elevated
fire weather conditions as well as direct health risks for human and animal
populations across the highlighted regions. As heat remains the top
weather-related killer in the U.S., please consider reviewing the National
Weather Service's heat safety page at:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/saftey/heat__;!!DZ3fjg!o8b4bKE-aRaDQ8063dKD516z_X071z7dnh7SzJpg_DbG2MTWUZit2Mtvk9rLExnWzYh7GyoE$ .



A weakness in the mid-level height pattern remains favored over the southern
CONUS, which is likely to lead to above-normal and possible heavy
precipitation
extending from the Southern Plains to the Northeast. The Weather Prediction
Center's day 7 surface analysis features surface low development across the
Great Plains with return flow from the Gulf of Mexico, which would advect
ample
moisture into the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley. While the GEFS ensemble
and the reforecast tool remain fairly weak regarding the potential for heavy
precipitation, there is a large coverage of elevated probabilities in the
ECMWF
ensemble for 3-day accumulations exceeding one inch and the ECMWF reforecast
tool also depicts a broad region from the Southern Plains to the Great Lakes
with at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th
percentile and one inch early in the period. Thus, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation remains issued for portions of the Southern and Central Plains,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, the Great Lakes, and the Appalachians
from Jul 7 to 10.



Upstream, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles remain in agreement favoring
mid-level ridging (594 dam) centered over the Four Corners region conducive
for
the enhancement of monsoonal moisture across Mexico and the Desert Southwest
during week-2. Agreement also exists in the reforecast tools indicating at
least a 20% chance for 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th
percentile during the period. Although totals are not expected to exceed
pre-defined hazard thresholds, the risk of convective episodes may result in
localized flash flooding across parts of Arizona and New Mexico. While the
enhanced rainfall is expected to benefit the ongoing drought in the region,
locally heavy rainfall over very dry soils elevates the potential for enhanced
runoff across the higher elevations into the valleys, and a flooding possible
hazard remains issued in the region.



Across the tropics, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring two
tropical disturbances currently located in the Main Development Region (MDR)
as
of 2pm EDT.  While the first disturbance (approximately located near 50W) has
at least a 30% chance of formation during the next 5 days, ensemble guidance
continues to favor a weakening of this potential system as it tracks into the
Caribbean. However, the second disturbance (approximately located near 35W),
is
gaining better support for development in the latest GEFS guidance. The 0z and
6z GEFS shows several ensemble members with deepening low centers entering the
southern Caribbean which then tracks into the Gulf of Honduras by late week-1.
By the start of the period, spread increases in the GEFS ensembles and there
is
also little evidence of this disturbance in the ECMWF ensemble. Given the
uncertainty at this lead, no corresponding hazard is issued, however, these
disturbances will continue to be monitored and addressed in upcoming outlooks.



Over Alaska, anomalous mid-level troughing favored over the Gulf of Alaska is
likely to bring below-normal temperatures and above-normal precipitation
throughout much of the state. The largest signals for heavy precipitation
reside along the Panhandle associated with enhanced onshore flow, however
these
totals are not expected to exceed thresholds deemed hazardous thus no
corresponding hazards are issued. The anomalously cool and wet conditions
during early July are also likely to quell ongoing wildfire activity.

257 PM EDT Tue Jun 29 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Jul 02 2021 - 12Z Tue Jul 06 2021

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest becomes less intense but
continues through the 4th of July weekend...

...Heavy rain could impact portions of the Deep South, Southeast
and the East Coast ahead of an upper-level trough late this week
and through the weekend...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance agrees that the large scale pattern should return to a
more typical summer regime by next Tuesday after a fairly
amplified evolution from late this week through the weekend.
During the first half of the period expect an eastern U.S. upper
trough (likely with an embedded low) to amplify downstream from a
strong but slowly weakening upper ridge dropping from southern
Canada into the Plains/Midwest.  Behind the descending upper
ridge, flatter mean flow will likely help to eject the eastern
trough by early next week.  Meanwhile expect an upper ridge
initially over the far southern High Plains/Rockies to retrograde
slowly toward the Southwest U.S.  Weak upper energy to the east of
this ridge may settle/consolidate somewhat over the southern
Plains by next Monday or Tuesday.

Models and ensembles are still in the process of refining the
forecast of the eastern U.S. upper trough.  Through the 00Z/06Z
cycles there appeared to be some progress toward convergence with
better agreement toward an upper low closing off and tracking over
or near the Upper Ohio Valley by this weekend.  GFS/CMC runs
represented a farther east solution than some earlier runs while
the 00Z ECMWF was slower than its prior two runs but similar to
the run from 36 hrs ago.  This left the 00Z UKMET on the slow side
of the spread.  Not surprisingly the new 12Z model runs display
some adjustments, in particular trending faster with the upper
low's ejection after early Saturday.  Interestingly the new GEFS
mean holds back its overall trough more like the 00Z ECMWF mean.

Confidence is fairly good with the general idea of southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. flow aloft becoming flatter and more
progressive, supporting the consensus that establishes a mean
frontal boundary across the northern tier next week.  However
typically low predictability with shortwave details will keep
confidence lower for exact frontal position and wave details on a
day-to-day basis.

Based on the available guidance through the 06Z cycle, the updated
forecast started with a blend of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z-06Z GFS/00Z CMC
for about the first half of the period to reflect increasing
consensus toward a closed low within the eastern upper trough.
Then the blend incorporated some 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean input as
details diverged for the eastern trough as well as flow extending
from the North Pacific across southern Canada and northern U.S.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest should be less
intense than it has been over recent days but triple-digit heat is
still likely each afternoon across some interior areas through the
holiday weekend and into early next week.  A portion of this heat
will spread into the northern Plains and continue into next week.
Best potential for afternoon temperatures to reach the century
mark at some locations in Montana and the Dakotas should be during
Friday-Sunday before a front dips into the northern tier.  In
terms of anomalies, the very gradual moderating trend will bring
high temperatures from the Northwest into northern Plains down to
about 10-15F above normal by next Tuesday after starting the
period at 15-25F above normal on Friday.  Some rain showers over
the northern Rockies may offer slight relief to the heat but they
will do little to ease the growing drought concern in these areas.
 Farther south, some late-day monsoonal type showers and
thunderstorms are likely each day over the central to southern
Rockies through the medium range period.  Low level upslope flow
could enhance activity over some areas.

Meanwhile, a heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic
during the short range period should be broken by Friday as the
upper trough/low forecast to be centered over the Great Lakes at
that time directs moisture into much of the East Coast along and
ahead of a frontal boundary.  It appears that the East Coast will
enter a period of cloudy and wet weather just in time for the July
4th holiday weekend with cool daytime temperatures and warm/humid
nights.  Rainfall amounts over the northern Mid-Atlantic and
vicinity will be very sensitive to exactly how the upper trough
and possible embedded low evolve.  A closed low would increase the
potential for some areas of enhanced rainfall over this area.
Confidence is somewhat higher that areas of heavy rainfall will be
possible along the trailing front, from the southern Mid-Atlantic
across the South and into southeastern Texas.  The front should
stall near the Gulf Coast for a time before lifting north and
dissipating--increasing the potential for a period of cell
training/repeat activity that would pose a flooding threat.
Clouds/rainfall will yield multiple days of below normal highs
(generally minus 5-12F anomalies) from the southern High Plains
into portions of the South and East.  High pressure behind the
front should also provide moderately below normal morning lows to
areas from central Plains and Midwest into the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys, especially Saturday-Sunday.  Next week's northern tier
front may produce one or more bands of meaningful rainfall but
details for totals/timing/location are uncertain at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 PM CDT Tue Jun 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

The southern extent of the isolated dry thunderstorm area across
parts of the Great Basin was trimmed to account for higher wetting
rain potential given near 1 inch precipitable water values, and
potential for accumulating rain from Day 1 thunderstorms. However, a
relatively greater concentration of dry strikes is still expected
across portions of western Utah, northern Nevada into southern
portions of the Pacific northwest tomorrow afternoon and evening,
where isolated dry thunderstorm highlights remain in place.

As the thermally-induced surface pressure trough across the Pacific
Northwest shifts eastward towards the Northern Rockies, portions of
central/northern Montana may experience dry easterly surface winds,
with locally Elevated fire weather conditions expected. An Elevated
area may be added to central/northern Montana in future outlooks
should guidance consensus depict a stronger wind field.

..Squitieri.. 06/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0132 AM CDT Tue Jun 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
High pressure will remain firmly entrenched across the Pacific
Northwest and North Rockies Day2/Wednesday, as the block remains
over the western CONUS. The strong heating at the surface will
support the development of a thermal low/trough, enhancing surface
winds from Washington state southward into northern California.
Moisture surging north across the Great Basin and Intermountain West
will again support isolated thunderstorm development through the
afternoon.

...Central/Northern Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest...
On the southern fringes of the mid-level ridge, weak ascent will
overspread mid-level moisture across the Great Basin and Southwest.
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop by
midday and increase in coverage with time. Model soundings show
steep low-level lapse rates beneath the moisture plume, suggesting
the potential for dry lightning strikes over receptive fuels. Storm
coverage is forecast to be slightly greater than Day 1, providing
better potential for wetting rains. This appears most likely over
western Colorado and eastern Utah where higher PWAT values near 1
inch are forecast. However, a few dry strikes may still develop,
with greater coverage of dry lightning expected across Nevada,
Oregon, and Idaho where Isolated dry thunder probabilities have been
added.

...Pacific Northwest...
Very strong heating beneath the mid-level high will support the
development of a thermal low/trough through much of the day across
portions of the Northwest. High-res guidance shows increased surface
pressure falls may locally enhance surface winds to 15 mph from mid
morning to sunset. With extremely warm temperatures, surface
humidity below 30% is expected. Locally elevated/critical fire
weather conditions may occur where fuels are dry.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue June 29 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 05 - 09 2021

A transitional 500-hPa geopotential height pattern is favored across North
America during the 6-10 day period, with troughing forecast to shift across
Alaska and a deamplification of the pattern downstream over the western CONUS.
Toward the end of the period, increased ridging is predicted to expand across
the north-central CONUS, with the 0z GEFS and Canadian ensembles being
slightly
more amplified with this feature compared to the 0z ECMWF ensemble. Todays
manual height blend favors weakly positive height anomalies across much of the
western CONUS, and through the northern tier of the central and eastern CONUS.
Near normal heights are forecast across the Central and Southern Plains, and
extending through much of the Middle and Lower Mississippi, and Tennessee
Valleys. Negative height anomalies are predicted over most of Mainland Alaska,
with positive height anomalies favored across portions of the Aleutians and
the
Panhandle.

Many of todays temperature and precipitation tools are very similar to
yesterday leading to increased confidence in the forecast. Elevated
probabilities of above normal temperatures are indicated for much of the
western CONUS and extending across the Northern and Central Plains, Upper
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast. Most of these areas are
experiencing drought conditions, which will ultimately favor warmer
temperatures due to stronger surface heating. Increased chances of below
normal
temperatures are forecast for parts of the Southern Great Plains, Middle and
Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and the Southeast, due to enhanced
cloud cover and precipitation resulting from return flow out of the Gulf of
Mexico, in addition to elevated soil moisture over these areas. The exception
is over the southern Florida Peninsula where above normal temperature
probabilities are elevated outside of the return flow. Troughing forecast to
move across Alaska favors increased probabilities of near to below normal
temperatures across most of the state, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool.

Enhanced ridging and positive height anomalies support increased chances of
below normal precipitation across the western CONUS, the Northern and Central
Plains, and extending into the Upper Mississippi Valley. Surface high pressure
forecast over the Atlantic favors anomalous southerly return flow over the
east-central CONUS, resulting in elevated chances of above normal
precipitation, especially across the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley. Mid-level flow is forecast to be weaker along the Eastern Seaboard
favoring increased chances of below normal precipitation from coastal areas of
the Northeast, southward through the Mid-Atlantic and the Florida Peninsula.
Two tropical disturbances are being monitored by the National Hurricane Center
over the Central Atlantic, although it is too early to determine if there will
be any impacts from these disturbances along the Southeast or Gulf Coasts
during the period. A monsoonal moisture surge still favors slightly enhanced
above normal precipitation probabilities across parts of southeastern Arizona
and New Mexico. Troughing forecast to move over Alaska supports an active
storm
track across the state, leading to increased chances of above normal
precipitation for much of the state, excluding the southern Panhandle where
probabilities for below normal precipitation are increased.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to good agreement between the dynamical models, in addition to minimal
differences in the tools compared to yesterday.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 07 - 13 2021

The mid-level pattern is forecast to continue to favor ridging across the
north-central CONUS, with an eastward expansion of positive 500-hPa anomalies
across southern Canada and the northeastern CONUS. Troughing is forecast to
weaken across Alaska, which may lead to increasing mid-level heights over the
western CONUS by the end of week-2. The 0z ECMWF ensemble is the most robust
with this evolution compared to the other guidance. The manual height blend
depicts positive 500-hPa height anomalies across the CONUS, with the highest
positive anomalies across the Northeast, and closer to normal mid-level
heights
across the southern tier and the Gulf of Mexico coast, where enhanced moisture
flow is still likely to persist. Near to slightly below normal heights are
favored across Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle associated with the
aforementioned weakening trough, with positive height anomalies forecast over
the Aleutians.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures remain elevated over the western
CONUS and extending into the Northern and Central Great Plains. Above normal
temperature probabilities are also increased across the Northeast and
mid-Atlantic in association with the eastward expansion of the ridge, which is
supported by both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Southerly moisture
flow,
and associated increased cloud cover and precipitation, is likely to persist
into week-2 across parts of the south, which would continue to favor below
normal temperatures over the Southern Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley,
Tennessee Valley, and the Southeast (excluding the southern Florida Peninsula
where above normal temperature probabilities remain elevated), although
probabilities are weaker compared to the 6-10 day period. Below normal
temperature probabilities remain enhanced over much of Alaska, in association
with weak troughing over the state.

The precipitation forecast for week-2 is generally similar to the 6-10 day
outlook, with continued elevated chances of below normal precipitation across
much of the western half of the CONUS. Continued southerly moisture flow
favors
increased chances of above normal precipitation from the Southern Plains
northeastward through the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, the Great
Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, supported by both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools. Uncertainty remains across portions of Arizona and New
Mexico
as the GEFS reforecast tool now depicts a more robust monsoon signal in week-2
compared to the ECMWF, particularly over Arizona, likely due in part to the
weakness in the mid-level heights persisting longer over the region in the
GEFS
compared to the ECMWF. A tilt toward higher above normal precipitation
probabilities is depicted over southern Arizona and New Mexico, with near to
below normal probabilities increased further north. The Florida Peninsula is
forecast to be well enough displaced from the return flow, tilting the odds
toward below normal precipitation. Near to above normal precipitation
probabilities remain elevated over Alaska, resulting from troughing and a
continued active storm track across the state.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement, offset by some differences in the temperature and
precipitation forecast across the Southwest CONUS.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Historic heat wave continues across interior sections of the
Northwest and Northern Rockies...

...A series of fronts will be the focus for ongoing heavy rain and
flooding risk across the central U.S....

...Heat continues for the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast ahead of a
cold front bringing rain and severe weather chances Tuesday and
Wednesday...

The unprecedented heat wave continues today for the interior
Northwest and Northern Rockies, although the temperatures have
peaked for most places. A cold front overnight brought some relief
to the Portland/Seattle urban corridor and the focus for the
hottest temperatures has shifted into eastern Washington and
Oregon as well as western Idaho. The stagnant upper-level high
pressure in place over the region will also begin to shift to the
east over the next couple of days. Highs approaching 110 are
likely Wednesday but will be closer to 100 on Thursday. Excessive
heat warnings remain in effect for the region. An excessive heat
watch is in place over eastern Montana beginning Thursday as the
heat shifts to the east with the upper-level high.

A lingering surface front will remain in place today for the
Midwest and Central Plains ahead of back to back cold fronts that
will move into the region on Wednesday and Thursday. These fronts
will be the focus for continued heavy rain and storms along with
the risk for flooding. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in
effect for portions of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri in the
Central Plains both today and tomorrow with daily rainfall totals
between 1 to 3" possible. A more widespread Marginal Risk oriented
from the northeast to the southwest is also in place to cover
heavy rain and storm chances along the length of the fronts.

Hot weather will also continue today and tomorrow for the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with afternoon highs in the mid to
upper 90s likely. Unfortunately, the heat is also combined with
humidity across the region leading to temperatures that feel above
100. A cold front will approach from the northwest during day
Wednesday, which combined with the moist and buoyant airmass will
lead to the chance for severe thunderstorms. The Storm Prediction
Center has issued an Enhanced Risk for severe weather for portions
of east-central New York east into Massachusetts, with a broader
Slight Risk in place from central Pennsylvania northeast into
coastal Maine. High winds are the most likely threat from the
severe weather, but some hail is also possible. The cold front
will begin to move through the region on Thursday, with continued
rain and thunderstorm chances along the coast ahead of the front.
Behind the front, temperatures will drop below normal for this
time of year, with 70s likely for the higher terrain and interior
portions of the area.

Elsewhere, daily rain and thunderstorm chances will continue
across the south, stretching west from Florida to the Desert
Southwest. Temperatures will be below normal and relatively
comfortable for this time of Summer, with highs mostly in the 80s.

Valid 12Z Fri Jul 02 2021 - 12Z Tue Jul 06 2021

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest becomes less intense but
continues through the 4th of July weekend...

...Heavy rain could impact portions of the Deep South, Southeast
and the East Coast ahead of an upper-level trough late this week
and through the weekend...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance agrees that the large scale pattern should return to a
more typical summer regime by next Tuesday after a fairly
amplified evolution from late this week through the weekend.
During the first half of the period expect an eastern U.S. upper
trough (likely with an embedded low) to amplify downstream from a
strong but slowly weakening upper ridge dropping from southern
Canada into the Plains/Midwest.  Behind the descending upper
ridge, flatter mean flow will likely help to eject the eastern
trough by early next week.  Meanwhile expect an upper ridge
initially over the far southern High Plains/Rockies to retrograde
slowly toward the Southwest U.S.  Weak upper energy to the east of
this ridge may settle/consolidate somewhat over the southern
Plains by next Monday or Tuesday.

Models and ensembles are still in the process of refining the
forecast of the eastern U.S. upper trough.  Through the 00Z/06Z
cycles there appeared to be some progress toward convergence with
better agreement toward an upper low closing off and tracking over
or near the Upper Ohio Valley by this weekend.  GFS/CMC runs
represented a farther east solution than some earlier runs while
the 00Z ECMWF was slower than its prior two runs but similar to
the run from 36 hrs ago.  This left the 00Z UKMET on the slow side
of the spread.  Not surprisingly the new 12Z model runs display
some adjustments, in particular trending faster with the upper
low's ejection after early Saturday.  Interestingly the new GEFS
mean holds back its overall trough more like the 00Z ECMWF mean.

Confidence is fairly good with the general idea of southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. flow aloft becoming flatter and more
progressive, supporting the consensus that establishes a mean
frontal boundary across the northern tier next week.  However
typically low predictability with shortwave details will keep
confidence lower for exact frontal position and wave details on a
day-to-day basis.

Based on the available guidance through the 06Z cycle, the updated
forecast started with a blend of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z-06Z GFS/00Z CMC
for about the first half of the period to reflect increasing
consensus toward a closed low within the eastern upper trough.
Then the blend incorporated some 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean input as
details diverged for the eastern trough as well as flow extending
from the North Pacific across southern Canada and northern U.S.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest should be less
intense than it has been over recent days but triple-digit heat is
still likely each afternoon across some interior areas through the
holiday weekend and into early next week.  A portion of this heat
will spread into the northern Plains and continue into next week.
Best potential for afternoon temperatures to reach the century
mark at some locations in Montana and the Dakotas should be during
Friday-Sunday before a front dips into the northern tier.  In
terms of anomalies, the very gradual moderating trend will bring
high temperatures from the Northwest into northern Plains down to
about 10-15F above normal by next Tuesday after starting the
period at 15-25F above normal on Friday.  Some rain showers over
the northern Rockies may offer slight relief to the heat but they
will do little to ease the growing drought concern in these areas.
 Farther south, some late-day monsoonal type showers and
thunderstorms are likely each day over the central to southern
Rockies through the medium range period.  Low level upslope flow
could enhance activity over some areas.

Meanwhile, a heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic
during the short range period should be broken by Friday as the
upper trough/low forecast to be centered over the Great Lakes at
that time directs moisture into much of the East Coast along and
ahead of a frontal boundary.  It appears that the East Coast will
enter a period of cloudy and wet weather just in time for the July
4th holiday weekend with cool daytime temperatures and warm/humid
nights.  Rainfall amounts over the northern Mid-Atlantic and
vicinity will be very sensitive to exactly how the upper trough
and possible embedded low evolve.  A closed low would increase the
potential for some areas of enhanced rainfall over this area.
Confidence is somewhat higher that areas of heavy rainfall will be
possible along the trailing front, from the southern Mid-Atlantic
across the South and into southeastern Texas.  The front should
stall near the Gulf Coast for a time before lifting north and
dissipating--increasing the potential for a period of cell
training/repeat activity that would pose a flooding threat.
Clouds/rainfall will yield multiple days of below normal highs
(generally minus 5-12F anomalies) from the southern High Plains
into portions of the South and East.  High pressure behind the
front should also provide moderately below normal morning lows to
areas from central Plains and Midwest into the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys, especially Saturday-Sunday.  Next week's northern tier
front may produce one or more bands of meaningful rainfall but
details for totals/timing/location are uncertain at this time.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
437 PM EDT Tue Jun 29 2021

Valid 00Z Wed Jun 30 2021 - 00Z Fri Jul 02 2021

...Historic heat wave continues across interior sections of the
Northwest and Northern Rockies...

...A series of fronts will be the focus for ongoing heavy rain and
the risk for flooding across the central U.S....

...Heat continues for the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast ahead of a
cold front bringing rain and severe weather chances Wednesday and
Thursday...

The unprecedented heat wave continues today for the interior
Northwest and Northern Rockies, although the temperatures have
peaked for most places. A cold front overnight brought some relief
to the Portland/Seattle urban corridor and the focus for the
hottest temperatures has shifted into eastern Washington and
Oregon as well as western Idaho. The stagnant upper-level high
pressure in place over the region will also begin to shift to the
east over the next couple of days. Highs approaching 110 are
likely Wednesday but will be closer to 100 on Thursday. Excessive
Heat Warnings remain in effect for the region. An Excessive Heat
Watch is in place over eastern Montana for Thursday as the heat
shifts to the east with the upper-level high.

A lingering surface front will remain in place today across the
Midwest and Central/Southern Plains ahead of back to back cold
fronts that will move into the region on Wednesday and Thursday.
These fronts will be the focus for continued heavy rain and
thunderstorms along with the risk for flooding. A Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall is in effect for portions of Oklahoma, Kansas,
and Missouri both today and Wednesday with daily rainfall totals
between 1 to 3" possible. A more widespread Marginal Risk oriented
from the northeast to the southwest is also in place for each day
of the period to cover heavy rain and storm chances along the
length of the fronts.

Hot weather will also continue today and tomorrow for the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with afternoon highs in the mid to
upper 90s likely. Unfortunately, the heat is also combined with
humidity across the region leading to temperatures that feel above
100. Widespread heat-related advisories are in place through
Wednesday. A cold front will approach from the northwest during
the day Wednesday, which combined with the moist and buoyant
airmass will lead to the chance for severe thunderstorms. The
Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk for severe
weather for portions of east-central New York east into
Massachusetts, with a broader Slight Risk in place from central
Pennsylvania northeast into coastal Maine. High winds are the most
likely threat from the severe weather, but some hail is also
possible. The cold front will begin to move through the region on
Thursday with continued rain and thunderstorm chances ahead of the
front along the coast southwest into the southern Appalachians.
Marginal Risks for excessive rainfall are in place for the chance
of heavy rain with some of the storms, although the threat for
more significant rainfall will likely hold off until Thursday
night after the end of the current period. Behind the front,
temperatures will drop below normal for this time of year, with
70s likely for the higher terrain and interior portions of the
area.

Elsewhere, daily rain and thunderstorm chances will continue
across the south, stretching from Florida west through the Gulf
Coast, Texas, and into the Desert Southwest. Temperatures will be
around or even below normal and relatively comfortable for this
time of Summer, with highs mostly in the 80s.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CDT Wed Jun 30 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
A large mid-level anticyclone will remain stationary across the
northwestern CONUS bringing abnormally warm temperatures to much of
the West. To the south across the Great Basin, monsoonal moisture
will allow for scattered thunderstorms and isolated dry lightning
strikes to develop through the afternoon. Across the eastern US,
troughing will intensify over the Mid Atlantic, supporting
widespread showers and thunderstorms.

...Great Basin and Pacific Northwest...
On the southern fringes of the record mid-level ridge over western
Canada and the northwestern US, neutral to weak height falls will
overspread monsoonal moisture across portions of the Great Basin and
Pacific Northwest. Similar to the last several days, diurnal
thunderstorms should develop with the potential for isolated to
widely scattered lightning strikes. Fuels over much of the Great
Basin and Pacific Northwest are near record levels of dryness,
suggesting high susceptibility to lightning starts. Even with
several days of slowly accumulating precipitation and PWATS favoring
wetter storm modes, isolated dry lightning strikes appear likely
through the forecast period. The highest concentration of dry
strikes will likely be located across portions of northern Nevada,
into southeastern Oregon, and western Idaho. Here, along the
northern fringes of the plume of moisture, the greatest overlap of
steep low/mid-level lapse rates enhancing low-level drying and
favorable PWAT values (0.5-0.8 inches) will reside.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 AM CDT Wed Jun 30 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
The blocking high over the western US will gradually begin to move
east through the day, as weak southwesterly flow aloft develops over
the Pacific Northwest. As the ridge shifts to the east, warm and dry
conditions will migrate over the northern Rockies/High Plains,
supporting elevated fire weather concerns. To the east, troughing
over the northeastern US will intensify, keeping shower and
thunderstorm activity likely over much of the central and eastern
CONUS.

...Montana...
While the strong mid-level ridge pushes to the east, surface high
pressure will build over the northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Dry
and warm easterly flow will overspread much of Montana through the
afternoon. Surface humidity values of 20 to 30% are expected, with
winds of 10-15 mph. With little recent precipitation across the
region, fuels remain quite dry. Elevated fire weather conditions
will likely develop through the afternoon across portions of central
and eastern Montana.

...Pacific Northwest...
Scattered thunderstorms are again forecast to develop through the
day across portions of the northern Great Basin and Pacific
Northwest. As southwesterly flow aloft increases, total column
moisture will continue to increase with PWATS near 1 inch expected
by early afternoon. This should result in wet storms with the
potential for a few dry lightning strikes. However, given the
presence of exceptionally dry fuels, isolated dry thunder
probabilities will be maintained across the Northwest/Northern Great
Basin despite wetter storm modes. A dry strike or two may still
occur across portions of the Southwest and Four Corners, but wet
storms and several days of precipitation will reduce the threat for
lightning ignitions.

...Triple-digit heat continues over the interior Northwest while
spreading into portions of the northern Plains through the 4th of
July weekend...

...Threat of heavy rain lingers near the Gulf Coast through the
weekend into next week...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance continues to show difficulties in handling a fairly
amplified trough together with its interaction with a frontal
boundary across the eastern U.S. through the holiday weekend.  The
GFS has since abandoned the idea of closing off the
positively-tilted trough over the Ohio Valley much farther to the
west than what the ECMWF and CMC have been indicating.  This has
improved the agreement among model solutions.  Nevertheless, even
the more consistent ECMWF solutions continue to exhibit more
run-to-run variability than desirable.  Therefore, it is best not
to lean toward a particular deterministic solution but to
incorporate more of the ensemble means.  A general compromise
based on the 12Z EC mean, 18Z GEFS, the 12Z CMC mean, together
with some of their deterministic components yielded an
intermediate solution that is most compatible with continuity.
This basically keeps a positively-tilted trough with a hint of a
closed off low over the northeastern quadrant of the country
through the holiday weekend.  The axis of the upper trough has
been nudged faster toward the south and east with each successive
forecast cycle.

Models agree that the upper trough should lift northeastward into
the Canadian Maritimes on Monday.  This will allow the large scale
pattern to return to a more typical summer regime by next Tuesday
as a slowly weakening upper ridge drops from southern Canada into
the Plains/Midwest.  Meanwhile, expect an upper ridge initially
over the far southern High Plains/Rockies to retrograde slowly
toward the Southwest U.S.  Weak upper energy to the east of this
ridge may settle/consolidate somewhat over the southern Plains by
next Monday or Tuesday.

Confidence is fairly good with the general idea of southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. flow aloft becoming flatter and more
progressive, supporting the consensus that establishes a mean
frontal boundary across the northern tier next week.  However
typically low predictability with shortwave details will keep
confidence lower for exact frontal position and wave details on a
day-to-day basis.

The WPC medium-range forecasts were based on a general compromise
of the 12Z EC mean, 18Z GEFS, the 12Z CMC mean, together with some
of their deterministic components.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest will be less
intense than it has been over recent days but triple-digit heat is
still likely each afternoon across some interior areas through the
holiday weekend and into early next week.  A portion of this heat
will spread into the northern Plains and continue into next week.
Best potential for afternoon temperatures to reach the century
mark at some locations in Montana and the Dakotas should be during
Friday-Sunday before a front dips into the northern tier.  In
terms of anomalies, the very gradual moderating trend will bring
high temperatures from the Northwest into northern Plains down to
about 10-15F above normal by next Tuesday after starting the
period at 15-25F above normal on Saturday.  Some rain showers over
the northern Rockies may offer slight relief to the heat but they
will do little to ease the growing drought concern in these areas.
 Farther south, some late-day monsoonal type showers and
thunderstorms are likely each day over the central to southern
Rockies through the medium range period.  Low level upslope flow
could enhance activity over some areas.

Meanwhile, cloudy and wet weather is forecast to replace a heat
wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic by the holiday
weekend as the upper trough/low forecast to be centered over the
Great Lakes directs moisture into much of the East Coast.  Cool
daytime temperatures and warm/humid nights will be likely
following the passage of a cold front.  Rainfall amounts over the
northern Mid-Atlantic and vicinity will be very sensitive to
exactly how the upper trough and possible embedded low evolve.  A
closed low would increase the potential for some areas of enhanced
rainfall over this area.  Recent model trend appears to favor a
faster progression of the upper trough, leading to partial
clearing skies possible over portions of the East Coast later in
the July 4th weekend.

Confidence is somewhat higher for areas of heavy rainfall to
impact portions of the southern Mid-Atlantic, the Deep South and
into southeastern Texas along the trailing front.  The front
should stall near the Gulf Coast for a time before lifting north
and dissipating--increasing the potential for a period of cell
training/repeat activity that would pose a flooding threat.
Clouds/rainfall will yield multiple days of below normal highs
(generally minus 5-12F anomalies) from the southern High Plains
into portions of the South and East.  High pressure behind the
front should also provide moderately below normal morning lows to
areas from central Plains and Midwest into the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys, especially Saturday-Sunday.  Next week's northern tier
front may produce one or more bands of meaningful rainfall but
details for totals/timing/location are uncertain at this time.

and dissipating--increasing the potential for a period of cell
training/repeat activity that would pose a flooding threat.
Clouds/rainfall will yield multiple days of below normal highs
(generally minus 5-12F anomalies) from the southern High Plains
into portions of the South and East.  High pressure behind the
front should also provide moderately below normal morning lows to
areas from central Plains and Midwest into the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys, especially Saturday-Sunday.  Next week's northern tier
front may produce one or more bands of meaningful rainfall but
details for totals/timing/location are uncertain at this time.

...Dangerous heat continues across interior sections of the
Northwest and Northern Rockies, while extending into the Northern
High Plains...

...One more day of oppressive heat throughout the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast before a cold front produces rain and severe weather
chances by this evening...

...Flash flood threat found between the Ohio Valley and Central
Plains today ahead of an advancing cold front, shifting into the
Mid-Atlantic and Tennessee Valley by Thursday...

The ongoing extreme heat wave over the Northwest has likely
peaked, but dangerous temperatures are still forecast across the
region through the end of this week. The upper-level pattern
responsible for the scorching temperatures is expected to
gradually weaken and allow for highs to settle around 10 to 20
degrees above average over the Northern Great Basin and Northern
Rockies on Thursday and Friday, versus 30+ degrees above average
expected today. Record-shattering high temperatures will still be
found this afternoon throughout interior Washington, Oregon, and
Idaho. High temperatures into the 100s and 110s will once again
challenge monthly and even all-time temperature records. Low
temperatures only dipping into the upper-70s will make it even
harder too cool off after a full day of blazing heat. Well above
average temperatures are also expected to extend into much of
Montana and the Northern High Plains by Thursday. High
temperatures here are forecast to reach the upper-90s and triple
digits. This has prompted Heat Advisories and Excessive Heat
Watches to be issued. Meanwhile, Excessive Heat Warnings remain in
effect throughout the Northern Great Basin and Northern Idaho, as
well as portions of northwest Nevada and northern California.

Incomparable to the historic heat found across the Northwest, much
of the Northeast will also be dealing with oppressive heat today.
High temperatures are forecast to reach the mid-to-upper 90s
throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with heat indices into
the triple digits. Excessive Heat Warnings have been issued for
central/northern New Jersey, northern Delaware, and southeast
Pennsylvania, while Heat Advisories stretch from southern Maine to
eastern Pennsylvania. A cold front will bring relief from the heat
by this evening, but not without the chances for severe
thunderstorms. As the frontal boundary collides with the warm and
humid airmass located over the Northeast, thunderstorms are
expected to develop and rapidly strengthen. The Storm Prediction
Center has issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) for severe weather
across southern New England, with a surrounding Slight Risk (level
2/5) extending from eastern Maine to central Pennsylvania. The
main threat associated with the vigorous thunderstorms are
expected to be from damaging wind gusts, although large hail and
isolated tornadoes cannot be ruled out over northern New England.

The aforementioned cold front may also produce a flash flooding
threat between the Ohio Valley and Central Plains today, before
gradually pushing southeastward and into the Tennessee Valley,
central/southern Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic by Thursday. The
combination of high atmospheric moisture and a relatively
slow-moving cold front may produce showers and thunderstorms that
remain over similar areas for extended amounts of time. A Slight
Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive Rainfall has been issued today
between western Pennsylvania and northeast Oklahoma. This means
scattered flash flooding is possible, especially throughout urban
and low-lying areas. By Thursday, the frontal boundary is expected
to shift the heavy rainfall threat south and east. Much of the
Tennessee Valley and Mid-Atlantic could see 1 to 3 inches of rain
by Friday morning, with locally higher amounts. A Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall has been issued for Thursday and extends from
Long Island to Middle Tennessee.

Elsewhere, scattered showers and thunderstorms can be expected
across much of the southern half of the country, besides central
Texas. Thunderstorms are also possible throughout the Southwest
and Central Great Basin, which could lead to isolated instances of
flash flooding.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1201 PM CDT Sun Mar 28 2021

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN MONTANA...FAR WESTERN
NORTH DAKOTA...AND FAR NORTHWESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...

Expanded the elevated area slightly east across North Dakota and
South Dakota to best capture where the deeply mixed air behind where
the dryline is expected to reach. The northeastern portion of the
critical area may struggle for relative humidity to drop to critical
levels, with dewpoints in the upper 20s to low 30s in northeast
Montana. However, winds are expected to be strong enough to overcome
the more marginal humidity, and therefore no modifications of the
critical area are necessary.

..Bentley.. 03/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0139 AM CDT Sun Mar 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale trough positioned over the central CONUS this morning
will quickly shift east. In its wake, a mid-level short-wave trough
will enter portions of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies,
accompanied by enhanced 70-90 kt mid-level flow along the base of
the trough. At the surface, lee cyclogenesis will occur across
portions of Alberta throughout the day, and a cold front will enter
portions of the Pacific Northwest by this evening into the
overnight.

...Montana into the western Dakotas...
As enhanced mid-level flow overspreads the region, diurnal heating
and mixing processes will result in downward-directed momentum
transfer and strong flow into the boundary layer. This process, in
combination with the developing surface low farther north and
strengthening pressure gradient, should yield sustained winds of
15-25 mph during the afternoon, with gusts to 35-45 mph. In
addition, a strong westerly downslope component to the low-level
flow will aid in surface temperatures warming into the 60s F to near
70 F, while RH values fall into the teens. Fuels across the region
have become increasingly receptive to large-fire spread due to a
lack of precipitation recently. Thus, elevated to critical
fire-weather conditions appear likely to develop across the region
today.

The previous elevated and critical areas have been expanded to the
northwest, into portions of north-central Montana. Mid-level flow in
this area will be a bit stronger and under greater influence of the
approaching mid-level trough, as compared to areas farther east.
These adjustments were made in consideration of local terrain
features that will support the aforementioned enhancements to the
surface conditions. A minor southeastward expansion was also made to
the elevated area based on the latest high-resolution guidance.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
208 PM EDT Sun Mar 28 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 31 2021 - 12Z Sun Apr 04 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Wednesday with an amplified
mid-upper trough over the central U.S. that should shift eastward
toward the East Coast through the end of the workweek before
pivoting northward. At the surface, a cold front is forecast to
sweep across the East, with rain (and snow in the interior
Northeast) ahead of it and a spate of cooler temperatures behind
it as a cool Canadian surface high comes in. Then, upper ridging
will lead to a warm-up in the western/central U.S. late in the
week, while a trough approaching the Pacific Northwest could lead
to increased precipitation chances there by the weekend.

...Model Guidance and Predictability...

00Z/06Z model guidance continues to be in good overall agreement
especially for the early part of the medium range period given the
amplified pattern, with the longwave upper trough tracking across
the central/eastern U.S. and the ridging behind. Once again the
00Z/06Z GFS suite was a little faster with the trough movement
compared to the non-NCEP models that clustered well, so leaned
toward the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC with that feature and the
associated surface front timing by Friday. It appears one
shortwave trough should move across southwestern to south-central
Canada Thursday to Saturday, ahead of the potential for upper
troughing to drop into the Northwest by the weekend. Model
guidance varies quite a bit from run to run and model to model
with this second trough in terms of position and potential for
flow to split and a closed low to develop. Given this variability,
it seemed prudent to shift toward a mainly 06Z GEFS/00Z EC
ensemble mean blend by the weekend after a multi-model
deterministic blend early on.

Another feature to note is a southern stream shortwave trough
moving eastward across the Pacific midweek and into the southern
California/northern Mexico vicinity on Friday. Some model
variability remains with its strength especially once it gets over
land, with the GFS runs maintaining relatively stronger energy
over the Southwest and even toward the Southern Plains over the
weekend, and this leads to differences in the rain and
thunderstorm potential for those areas. For now a multi-model
solution sufficed there, indicating a weak shortwave feature.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread precipitation is forecast Wednesday into Thursday for
the Appalachians to the Eastern Seaboard as moisture flows ahead
of and into the vicinity of the aforementioned cold front. There
is some potential for moderate to heavy rain causing flooding from
the Southern Appalachians toward the Northeast Wednesday and
Wednesday night. Precipitation is expected to change to snow
across higher elevations of the Appalachians and across interior
parts of the Northeast behind the lead cold front, and several
inches of snow could fall from the Adirondacks to northern Maine.
After that, generally dry conditions are expected to prevail
across the contiguous U.S. as a surface high pressure system moves
across, and as a frontal system in the north-central U.S. does not
have much moisture to work with. The Northwest could see some
light to modest precipitation though, with chances increasing over
the weekend as the upper trough and a surface front approach.
Other possibilities for light precipitation include the Southern
Plains, southern Florida, and the interior Northeast.

Colder than average conditions are forecast behind the potent cold
front in the eastern half of the U.S. for the latter part of the
workweek, with highs generally 10 to 25 degrees below normal.
Daily record low minimum and maximum temperatures could be broken
across the East as lows reaching the freezing mark are possible as
far south as northern Georgia and South Carolina Friday morning.
Temperatures should moderate toward normal across the East by the
weekend as the upper trough lifts into eastern Canada. Meanwhile,
temperatures are expected to soar to much above normal in most of
the western and central U.S., with northern/central portions of
the Plains seeing widespread 70 degree temperatures, about 20-25
degrees above normal. Temperatures in the 90s could occur in the
Desert Southwest, and for many these temperatures could be the
warmest of the calendar year.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
208 PM EDT Sun Mar 28 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 31 2021 - 12Z Sun Apr 04 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Wednesday with an amplified
mid-upper trough over the central U.S. that should shift eastward
toward the East Coast through the end of the workweek before
pivoting northward. At the surface, a cold front is forecast to
sweep across the East, with rain (and snow in the interior
Northeast) ahead of it and a spate of cooler temperatures behind
it as a cool Canadian surface high comes in. Then, upper ridging
will lead to a warm-up in the western/central U.S. late in the
week, while a trough approaching the Pacific Northwest could lead
to increased precipitation chances there by the weekend.

...Model Guidance and Predictability...

00Z/06Z model guidance continues to be in good overall agreement
especially for the early part of the medium range period given the
amplified pattern, with the longwave upper trough tracking across
the central/eastern U.S. and the ridging behind. Once again the
00Z/06Z GFS suite was a little faster with the trough movement
compared to the non-NCEP models that clustered well, so leaned
toward the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC with that feature and the
associated surface front timing by Friday. It appears one
shortwave trough should move across southwestern to south-central
Canada Thursday to Saturday, ahead of the potential for upper
troughing to drop into the Northwest by the weekend. Model
guidance varies quite a bit from run to run and model to model
with this second trough in terms of position and potential for
flow to split and a closed low to develop. Given this variability,
it seemed prudent to shift toward a mainly 06Z GEFS/00Z EC
ensemble mean blend by the weekend after a multi-model
deterministic blend early on.

Another feature to note is a southern stream shortwave trough
moving eastward across the Pacific midweek and into the southern
California/northern Mexico vicinity on Friday. Some model
variability remains with its strength especially once it gets over
land, with the GFS runs maintaining relatively stronger energy
over the Southwest and even toward the Southern Plains over the
weekend, and this leads to differences in the rain and
thunderstorm potential for those areas. For now a multi-model
solution sufficed there, indicating a weak shortwave feature.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread precipitation is forecast Wednesday into Thursday for
the Appalachians to the Eastern Seaboard as moisture flows ahead
of and into the vicinity of the aforementioned cold front. There
is some potential for moderate to heavy rain causing flooding from
the Southern Appalachians toward the Northeast Wednesday and
Wednesday night. Precipitation is expected to change to snow
across higher elevations of the Appalachians and across interior
parts of the Northeast behind the lead cold front, and several
inches of snow could fall from the Adirondacks to northern Maine.
After that, generally dry conditions are expected to prevail
across the contiguous U.S. as a surface high pressure system moves
across, and as a frontal system in the north-central U.S. does not
have much moisture to work with. The Northwest could see some
light to modest precipitation though, with chances increasing over
the weekend as the upper trough and a surface front approach.
Other possibilities for light precipitation include the Southern
Plains, southern Florida, and the interior Northeast.

Colder than average conditions are forecast behind the potent cold
front in the eastern half of the U.S. for the latter part of the
workweek, with highs generally 10 to 25 degrees below normal.
Daily record low minimum and maximum temperatures could be broken
across the East as lows reaching the freezing mark are possible as
far south as northern Georgia and South Carolina Friday morning.
Temperatures should moderate toward normal across the East by the
weekend as the upper trough lifts into eastern Canada. Meanwhile,
temperatures are expected to soar to much above normal in most of
the western and central U.S., with northern/central portions of
the Plains seeing widespread 70 degree temperatures, about 20-25
degrees above normal. Temperatures in the 90s could occur in the
Desert Southwest, and for many these temperatures could be the
warmest of the calendar year.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun March 28 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

... There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts
of the Mid-Atlantic through late Sunday evening...

...Strong cold front to bring gusty winds and heavy mountain snow
across the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies Monday evening...

...High winds and a Critical Risk of fire weather found across the
Northern High Plains on Sunday and Southern High Plains on
Monday...

A front along the East Coast will move offshore later on Sunday
evening.  The boundary will produce showers and thunderstorms
along and ahead of the front over parts of the southern
Mid-Atlantic into the Southeast/Central Gulf Coast through late
Sunday evening.  The SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Mid-Atlantic until the associated
front moves offshore later on Sunday evening.  The primary hazards
associated with severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning,
severe wind gusts, hail, and tornadoes.  Rain will develop along
the front over the Northeast and northern Mid-Atlantic that will
mainly end by Monday morning.  On the backside of the
precipitation shield, light snow will develop over parts of the
Northeast into parts of the Central Appalachians ending on Monday.


Meanwhile, a front over the Pacific Northwest will move eastward
to the Great Lakes southwestward to the Southern Plains by Tuesday
evening.   The system will produce heavy mountain snow over the
Cascades and parts of the Northern Rockies/Northern High Plains
through Tuesday afternoon.  Snowfall totals of 1 to 2 feet are
possible across Washington's higher elevations, where Winter Storm
Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories have been issued.  However,
the most widespread hazard associated with this system will be
high winds that will impact a large area from the Northwest to
High Plains.  Wind gusts up to 60 mph are possible and could bring
down power lines and trees. Winds of this magnitude can also make
travel very dangerous for high-profile vehicles. High Wind
Warnings and Watches have been issued over the region.

Furthermore, across the High Plains, the combination of gusty
winds, warm temperatures, and low relative humidity will make
conditions ripe for wildfires to spread uncontrollably. SPC has
issued a Critical Risk of fire weather for much of eastern Montana
and western North Dakota through Monday morning.  The fire weather
threat then shifts south and into eastern Colorado and the
Southern High Plains on Monday. Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather
Watches have been posted from North Dakota to eastern New Mexico
and the Texas Panhandle.

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THE PLAINS AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
On Monday, a mid-level trough will amplify as it crosses the
northern Rockies. At the surface, a strong cold front will extend
from a surface low in southern Manitoba down the Plains into the
southern High Plains. A very strong pressure gradient is expected to
develop given the strength of the surface low (~980mb). This will
lead to a broad area of strong winds which will lead to fire weather
concerns across much of the Plains/southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains into eastern Colorado and Kansas...
A tightening pressure gradient, a strengthening low-level jet, and
deep mixing is expected to combine to bring very strong winds across
the southern High Plains into Kansas, Missouri, and parts of Iowa.
Here winds are expected to be 20 to 30 mph across a broad area with
some sustained winds of 35 mph possible. These strong winds will
overspread dry conditions west of the Dryline across eastern
Colorado, eastern New Mexico, Western Kansas, and the TX/OK
Panhandles. Relative humidity of 8 to 12 percent combined with the
aforementioned winds will bring a broad area of critical fire
weather conditions. Isolated extremely critical meteorological
conditions will be present, but the isolated nature and fuels which
are not extremely dry, will preclude the need for an extremely
critical delineation.

...Northern Plains...
Multiple periods of critical fire weather conditions are expected
from Nebraska into the Dakotas on Monday. First, warming conditions
ahead of the cold front will bring strong southwesterly/westerly
surface winds approaching 30 mph with relative humidity of 15 to 20
percent. This will be most common across South Dakota and Nebraska
as winds will be a bit weaker across North Dakota and relative
humidity will be slightly higher. However, behind the cold front,
very strong winds are expected. Widespread 30 to 40 mph sustained
surface winds are expected from northern North Dakota to the
Nebraska Panhandle. Initially, behind the front, relative humidity
is expected to increase as temperatures drop but a dry continental
airmass will quickly move in and drop relative humidity to less than
20 percent once again despite cooler temperatures.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THE PLAINS AND
THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level short-wave trough positioned over portions of the
Pacific Northwest will shift eastward and overspread much of the
central CONUS throughout the day while undergoing significant
amplification. This process will result in a broad region of
enhanced mid-level flow (60-90 kt) atop much of the northern/central
Plains and the southern High Plains. At the surface, a cold front,
associated with an intensifying surface cyclone over south-central
Canada, will move east-southeast out of Montana into the Dakotas,
northwestern parts of Nebraska and far western Minnesota.

...Southern High Plains into eastern Colorado and Kansas...
Diurnal heating and mixing, combined with a strengthening surface
pressure gradient, will produce sustained winds of 20-30 mph,
gusting to near 40 mph. A downsloping westerly component to the
low-level flow will allow temperatures to warm into the 80s F, which
will drive down RH values into the teens and single digits. Despite
fuels across region remaining somewhat marginally receptive to
large-fire spread, the aforementioned meteorological indices should
support elevated to critical fire-weather conditions across the
region.

...Northern Plains...
A broad region of critical fire-weather conditions can be expected
today, in association with both pre- and post-frontal winds. Ahead
of the front, sustained southwesterly winds of 20-25 mph (gusting to
near 30 mph) and RH values should fall into the teens as diurnal
heating occurs. With the frontal passage, surface winds will
increase to sustained values near 30-40 mph with gusts of 45-50 mph
possible from the northwest. Temperatures are expected to fall
behind the front into the 40s and 50s F, which may help limit the
fire-weather potential to some extent, but considering the strength
of the aforementioned post-frontal winds combined with dry/receptive
fuels across the region, there is sufficient evidence to maintain
the critical designation. Surrounding the critical area, elevated
fire-weather conditions can be expected where the pre-frontal
airmass is expected to reside most of the day, and far behind the
front where air temperatures will be exceedingly cooler.

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST ARIZONA...SOUTHERN NEW
MEXICO AND FAR WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A large-scale trough positioned over the central CONUS will slowly
shift eastward throughout the forecast period. As this occurs,
ridging will take hold across much of the West. At the surface, a
cold front will continue sweeping across the central Plains, while
high pressure builds into the West.

...Southeast Arizona, southern New Mexico and Far West Texas...
Diurnally driven mixing of enhanced mid-level flow over the region
will allow strong winds to mix toward the surface, resulting in
sustained westerly winds of 20-30 mph while RH values fall into the
teens and single digits. Despite somewhat marginally receptive
fuels, dry conditions remain present across the region, supporting
the potential for critical fire-weather conditions during the
afternoon hours.

...Southern California...
Surface high pressure is expected to settle into the Great Basin
region, which will result the development of a surface pressure
gradient conducive for offshore winds. Sustained winds of 20-30 mph
can be expected, gusting to 35+ mph (particularly in terrain-favored
regions). Meanwhile RH values will fall into the single digits as
temperatures warm into the 80s F by afternoon. Despite these
conditions, fuels across the region are marginally receptive to
large-fire spread. Thus, elevated to locally critical fire-weather
conditions appear likely.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
251 AM EDT Mon Mar 29 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 1 2021 - 12Z Mon Apr 5 2021

...Overall Weather Pattern...

An amplified upper level flow pattern is expected to be in place
for the end of the week across the eastern half of the U.S. with a
deep upper level trough across the Great Lakes and the Northeast.
A more zonal pattern ensues by the weekend as the eastern trough
lifts out.  At the surface, a strong cold front will be exiting
the East Coast Thursday morning, with a much colder airmass
arriving as a large Canadian surface high builds in east of the
Rockies.  The next frontal boundary reaches the Pacific Northwest
and northern Rockies by next weekend, although not as strong as
the past storm system.

...Model Guidance and Predictability...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in very good overall agreement
through Friday owing to the amplified pattern in place across the
eastern half of the nation.  The main difference during this time
was with the 00Z CMC being much weaker with a southern stream
shortwave crossing the southwestern U.S.  For next weekend,
forecast confidence decreases across the eastern Pacific with both
the timing and amplitude of the next trough.  The 00Z ECMWF
remains considerably slower with the upper low off the California
coast by Sunday/Monday, whereas the CMC is much more progressive
with the trough well inland across the western U.S.  The 00Z GFS
appears closest to the ensemble means for the West Coast region
during this time period.  The WPC fronts/pressures were primarily
derived from a GFS/ECMWF/UKMET blend for Thursday and Friday, and
then more of the ensemble means for Saturday through Monday whilst
still maintaining some of the operational GFS/ECMWF.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

After widespread rain across the East Coast region on Wednesday,
most of the medium range period should be quiet in terms of
precipitation with no episodes of heavy rain expected since a
large surface high will be governing the overall weather pattern.
Strong cold air advection in the wake of the departing storm
system will likely lead to a changeover to snow for interior
portions of New England and upstate New York during the day
Thursday, with perhaps several inches of accumulation for portions
of northern New England.  Windy conditions are also likely for the
East Coast on Thursday with a strong pressure gradient in place.
Another exception to the dry pattern will be across western
Washington and Oregon as the next storm system slowly approaches
that region, and potentially bringing some snow to the Sierra
Nevada by next Sunday.

Temperatures will be more reminiscent of late February for much of
the eastern half of the nation to close out the work week with
blustery conditions behind the cold front, and subfreezing low
temperatures likely reaching as far south as northern Georgia and
South Carolina by Friday morning.  The cold weather will abate
going into the weekend as the airmass modifies and the upper level
trough lifts out across eastern Canada.  Much warmer weather is
forecast to return to much of the central and western U.S. in time
for the weekend, as an upper level ridge builds in along with
southerly flow ahead of the next frontal boundary, and results in
readings of 15 to potentially 25 degrees above normal.  Highs
could reach the low 80s across portions of Nebraska and South
Dakota, and the low-mid 90s for the lower elevations of the Desert
Southwest.

...Strong cold front to bring an extensive area of high winds and
critical fire weather today across the Northern Rockies and
Northern/Central Plains...

...Potentially damaging wind gusts found across New England
today...

...Moderate to locally heavy rain to make a return to the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee valleys beginning Tuesday afternoon...

The biggest weather story to start the workweek will be high winds
found across the Northern Rockies and much of the northern and
central Great Plains. Not to be outdone, New England will also
have its fair share of gusty winds to contend with today.
Regarding the Central U.S., a strong cold front currently pushing
across the Northern Rockies will enter the Central Rockies and
Northern Plains by mid-morning, while quickly sinking into the
Southwest and Southern Plains by Tuesday morning. A few snow
showers may accompany the front as it passes through the high
terrain of the Rocky Mountains today, which may significantly
reduce visibility at times. Behind the front, strong winds will
usher in below average temperatures. Wind gusts could exceed 60
mph for many locations across Northern Rockies and
Northern/Central Plains. This could lead to downed power limes and
treacherous travel for high profile vehicles. High Winds Warnings
have are in effect for a large portion of the north-central United
States. Another hazard associated with the strong winds is fire
weather. The combination of warm temperatures ahead of the cold
front, low relative humidity, and gusty winds could make
conditions ripe for wildfires to spread uncontrollably. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Critical Risk of fire weather
across a majority of the Great Plains from North Dakota to the
Texas Panhandle today, shifting toward southern New Mexico and
West Texas on Tuesday. Red Flag Warnings have also been issued
across a sizable area from the Northern Plains to Southern High
Plains.

High winds will also impact portions of the Northeast and New
England today as a potent storm system exits toward the Canadian
Maritimes. Winds could gust up to 60 mph between central New York
and Massachusetts, which has prompted High Wind Warnings to be
posted. Wind Advisories extend outward to include much of New
England where maximum wind gusts are expected to reach up to 55
mph. Below average temperatures will accompany the gusty winds,
with a few snow showers possible as well.

By Tuesday afternoon and evening, the aforementioned cold front
across the Central U.S. is forecast to reach the Lower Mississippi
Valley. At the same time, moisture is expected to return to the
region from the Gulf of Mexico via a slow moving warm front and
fuel showers and thunderstorms from the Arklatex to the Tennessee
Valley between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning. SPC has
issued a Marginal Risk of severe thunderstorms from northeast
Texas to northern Mississippi/southwest Tennessee. However, the
main concern may be in regards to flash flooding as heavy rain
impacts a region that recently experienced flooding just a few
days ago. The current forecast shows total rainfall amounts of 1
to 2 inches across the region. As a result, WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for Tuesday that includes
southwest Kentucky, western Tennessee, northeast Arkansas, and far
northern Mississippi.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0951 AM CDT Thu May 27 2021

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Morning surface observations across the Southwest show very dry, but
relatively calm conditions. Elevated fire weather conditions appear
probable across southern NM this afternoon, but will likely remain
confined to locations with limited cloud cover and near terrain
features where winds will be locally enhanced.

..Moore.. 05/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1152 PM CDT Wed May 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
Ridging will build aloft in portions of the West. Subtle enhancement
to the mid-level winds across parts of New Mexico will be present
during the afternoon. A weak lee trough to the east and a cold front
moving in from the north may promote areas of 15-20 mph westerly
winds in southern New Mexico. A very dry airmass will remain in the
Southwest with 5-15% RH likely. With the diffuse surface pressure
gradient and mid/high level clouds in much of the area, elevated
fire weather conditions that develop are likely to be localized and
generally brief.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1242 PM CDT Thu May 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Elevated fire weather conditions are possible from southern UT into
southern WY and pockets of west ID, but will largely be localized in
nature and confined to terrain features where orographic wind
enhancements are common. Additionally, recent fuel analyses continue
to indicate that fuels in these areas are only modestly receptive.
Elevated conditions may extend along the Mogollon Rim across AZ, but
notable spread in guidance yields low confidence in this potential.

..Moore.. 05/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CDT Thu May 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns across the CONUS are expected to be low on
Friday. Both the Great Basin and the Southwest will be beneath
upper-level, shortwave ridging. These areas, which have the driest
fuels, will only see weak surface winds despite continued very dry
conditions. Shortwave troughs will be over the northern Rockies and
the Midwest. Any elevated/critical meteorological conditions are
expected to occur over fuels that are not yet receptive.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 27 2021

SYNOPSIS: Multiple models (0Z GEFS, 0Z ECMWF, 0Z Canadian) generally favor
weak
mid-level flow throughout the period, with mid-level high pressure across the
western and northeastern contiguous U.S. This pattern supports increased
chances for parts of the West reaching excessive heat criteria at the
beginning
of week-2. These models indicate mid-level high pressure shifting westward and
transitioning to mid-level low pressure near the middle to end of the period,
although models differ regarding the timing of this transition. This pattern
transition would provide some relief to the anticipated heat across the West.
Mid-level low pressure forecast across the North-Central Pacific favors a
wetter pattern for Alaska, but amounts are not anticipated to reach pre-
defined
hazards thresholds.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for parts of the Central Great Basin,
Southwest, California and southern Idaho, Fri, Jun 4.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Central Great Basin, interior
California, Southwest, and southern portions of the Northern Great Basin,
Fri-Sun, Jun 4-6.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of eastern Texas, the Lower
Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southern Appalachians, and Southeast,
Fri-Sun, Jun 4-6.

Flooding possible for parts of the eastern Texas and Louisiana.

FOR FRIDAY JUNE 04 - THURSDAY JUNE 10: Amplified mid-level ridging across the
West during week-1 is predicted to linger into at least the beginning of
week-2. Ensemble means from multiple models (0Z GEFS, 0Z ECMWF, 0Z Canadian)
favor a transition to a weaker mid-level pattern by week-2, although the ECMWF
maintains the ridging across the West longer than the GEFS and Canadian. A
slight risk (>20% chance) of excessive heat is posted for the Central Great
Basin, interior California, Southwest, and southern portions of the Northern
Great Basin, June 4 to 6, while an embedded area of moderate risk is
highlighted for parts of the Central Great Basin, Southwest, California and
southern Idaho, June 4. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools show enhanced
probabilities in these highlighted areas of maximum temperatures exceeding the
85th percentile. Temperatures across the Northwest may exceed 90 deg F, while
areas across the Desert Southwest may exceed 105 deg F. The high risk of
excessive heat from yesterday's outlook is not included in today's due to the
timing out of probabilities exceeding 60% by week-2. The reforecast tools
indicate at least a 20% chance of some areas experiencing maximum temperatures
exceeding the 95th percentile, although it is likely to be localized. The
ongoing severe to extreme drought conditions being felt across the region are
likely to exacerbate heat-related impacts. Additionally, drought conditions in
combination with anticipated heat may support enhanced wildfire risk across
parts of the West. The National Interagency Fire Center forecast shows low to
moderate potential for significant fire potential for many parts of California
and the Southwest on June 2, where dry, hot conditions are predicted for
week-2. The ridging is forecast to weaken sometime around the middle to end of
the period, bringing a moderation in temperatures. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean
indicates the transition to mid-level troughing across the West by day 13
(June
9), whereas the 0Z GEFS and 0Z Canadian ensemble means develop this troughing
by day 11 (June 7).



Downstream, ensemble means from the aforementioned models continue to indicate
anomalously positive mid-level heights across the Northeast and Great Lakes
throughout week-2. The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools depict at least a 20%
chance of temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile throughout the period
across the Northeast, Great Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic, expanding southward to
the
Ohio and Tennessee Valley from the middle to end of week-2. However, at this
time, temperatures are generally forecast to remain below 90 deg F in many of
these areas, precluding a related temperature hazard from being designated.



Mid-level troughing is anticipated to form across the Southern Plains and
Mississippi Valley at the beginning of the period, potentially supporting
surface low formation and frontal activity across the central CONUS. This
pattern, combined with favored southerly moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico,
supports a slight risk of heavy rainfall across parts of the South-Central and
southeastern CONUS at the beginning of week-2. There is more model disparity
in
today's model guidance regarding the heavy precipitation risk compared to
yesterday's forecasts. The ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a 20%
chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch
for eastern Texas, Gulf Coast states extending eastward into the Carolinas at
the beginning of the period, whereas the GEFS reforecast tool does not show
any
widespread areas exceeding this threshold. The last few deterministic GFS and
GEFS ensemble mean runs as well as uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble means have
generally favored Tennessee, the Southeast and Carolinas as having the higher
rainfall totals. Given these model guidance differences, a broad area is
highlighted across portions of eastern Texas, the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee
Valley, Southern Appalachians, and Southeast for a slight risk of heavy
precipitation, June 4 to 6.



The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools both depict at least a 20% chance of 3-day
precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch across the
highlighted heavy precipitation risk areas. Uncalibrated ECMWF guidance also
shows some of these areas having at least a 40% chance for 3-day precipitation
amounts exceeding 1 inch, further supporting the precipitation hazard.
Interestingly, the uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble indicates the heaviest rainfall
further east, across parts of the Tennessee Valley and Carolinas, whereas the
uncalibrated GEFS highlights a similar area as the calibrated counterpart. The
anticipated heavy rainfall is a concerning trend due to persistent above-
normal
rainfall observed resulting in ongoing river flooding in these areas. The risk
for possible flooding continues to be posted for today for parts of eastern
Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley, with the area slightly expanded to
include areas where streamflows are greater than the 90th percentile.



Mid-level troughing is forecast over the North-Central Pacific, with
associated
surface low pressure depicted across Alaska. This pattern favors above normal
precipitation for week-2 across many parts of mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle. However, precipitation amounts are not expected to reach pre-
defined
hazardous thresholds, and the increased cloud cover and precipitation supports
below-normal temperatures over much of the state during the period.

...Record highs likely in parts of the West next week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with a possibly closed
mid-upper low over the eastern U.S., with a surface low
pressure/frontal system in the western Atlantic spreading rain and
cool temperatures to parts of the East Coast. Meanwhile, periods
of troughing should affect the north-central U.S. southwestward
toward the Four Corners/Desert Southwest, leading to several
chances of rain and cooler than normal temperatures with abundant
cloud cover in central and southern portions of the Plains for the
first half of the week, shifting east as the week progresses. An
upper ridge along the West Coast will cause warm/hot and
potentially record-breaking temperatures for the Pacific Northwest
and northern California into the Great Basin.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The 00Z/06Z guidance cycle was in generally good agreement with
the pattern described above, but with typical differences in the
lower predictability details of the pattern. Most guidance shows
the eastern upper low as being closed on Sunday before rejoining
with the main flow by Monday, but the 06Z GFS was the exception.
Nevertheless, a multi-model deterministic blend was able to be
used for the early part of the medium range period, including the
00Z GFS/ECMWF/CMC/UKMET, which also led to good continuity with
previous WPC forecasts. By Tuesday through Thursday, shortwaves
moving through the central CONUS trough had some spread amongst
guidance, and there was model variability with the potential for
energy to split off and form a separate upper low around Baja
California or not--which also affects the timing of the main
trough shifting eastward. Better agreement was seen with the upper
ridge affecting the West and then troughing sneaking into the
Pacific Northwest by Thursday. For the latter part of the forecast
period, trended toward the GEFS and EC ensemble means to reduce
reliance on any particular model's smaller scale features.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains along the west end of the wavy frontal
boundary and ahead of a weaker northern stream cold front. High
pressure that builds in behind the latter front could lead to some
areas of low level upslope flow that would help to enhance
convective development over the High Plains. Some areas could see
several inches of rainfall over the multi-day period, perhaps
adding to flooding concerns over areas that have seen above normal
rainfall recently. Rain and scattered thunderstorms are expected
to spread eastward into the Mississippi and Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys, but with less certainty on any areas of focused heavy
rainfall totals. These areas may welcome at least some of the
rainfall as little has been observed in the past week or two.

Along the East Coast, the offshore frontal boundary and low
pressure is likely to bring showers to the region early in the
week. Rainfall amounts will depend on the evolution of the system,
but the heaviest rain amounts still look to be offshore.
Nevertheless, at least some light rainfall is forecast for areas
east of the Appalachians with higher chances in the Northeast.
Meanwhile, the West Coast should see little to no precipitation
given the ridge, but coastal Washington may see some scattered
showers as the upper trough and cold front move in next Wednesday
into Thursday.

Cool temperatures in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Sunday will
moderate through the rest of the week as skies clear and high
pressure moves offshore. The Pacific Northwest can expect
temperatures 10-25F above normal by Memorial Day into next
Tue-Wed. This could approach or exceed record levels for parts of
the West Coast states. As the cold front comes ashore, the warm
temperatures will push through the Great Basin to the Divide next
Wed-Thu. The cloudy/stormy pattern setting up over the
central/southern Plains and eastern slopes of the Rockies should
bring highs down to 10-15F below normal through much of next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu May 27 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 02 - 06 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
North Pacific, centered over the Aleutians, and ridging over the eastern North
Pacific and western North America. Downstream, a trough is predicted over the
south-central CONUS, and ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over the eastern CONUS. The manual blend of models forecasts
positive
500-hPa height anomalies across most of the northern CONUS, with stronger
positive height anomalies centered over the Pacific Northwest under the
amplified ridge axis. Slightly negative 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast
over the south-central CONUS, associated with the trough there. Southerly
low-level surface flow is predicted into the central and eastern CONUS, around
surface high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean.

Negative 500-hPa height anomalies lead to likely near to below normal
temperatures for Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle as well as the
Aleutians. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced for the
western CONUS extending eastward across the Northern Plains, the Great Lakes
region, and the East coast, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below
normal temperatures are most favored over the south-central CONUS, as a trough
and storm systems are predicted to traverse the region, consistent with the
ERF
consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the Aleutians and North Pacific and associated onshore
flow lead to increased chances of near to above normal precipitation for
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle as well as the Aleutians. A predicted
ridge over the northwestern CONUS and positive 500-hPa height anomalies across
the northern tier lead to increased probabilities of near to below normal
precipitation for the West and the north-central CONUS. Increased
probabilities
of above normal precipitation are indicated over the southern High Plains and
most of the eastern CONUS, ahead of a predicted trough, and consistent with
the
precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 04 - 10 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is generally forecast to
persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, while ensemble spread
and uncertainty increases. Troughing over the Aleutians deamplifies relative
to
the 6-10 day period. Flow becomes increasingly zonal over the northern CONUS.
Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF ensemble mean slightly
greater than the NCEP GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to recent model
skill.

Above normal temperatures are favored for the western and northern as well as
the eastern CONUS, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
temperatures are likely over south-central CONUS, due to a shortwave trough
traversing the region. Below normal temperatures are favored over Mainland
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, consistent with the temperature consolidation
tool.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored for Mainland Alaska, the
Aleutians and the Alaska Panhandle, due to predicted onshore flow. Near to
below normal precipitation is likely over much of the western CONUS, under
positive 500-hPa height anomalies associated with the predicted ridge. Chances
of above normal precipitation are slightly enhanced over much of the central
and eastern CONUS, related to potential storm systems associated with
shortwave troughs and anomalous southerly surface flow.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...A deep low pressure system will bring moderate to heavy showers
and thunderstorms to much of the eastern and southern US before
moving offshore Saturday evening...

...Enhanced risk of strong to severe thunderstorms and moderate
risk of excessive rainfall over portions of the southern Plains
and Middle Mississippi Valley through Friday morning...

...Cold spell in store for the Midwest, Ohio Valley and Northeast
to start off Memorial Day weekend..

Showers and thunderstorms will continue throughout the southern
Plains and Mississippi Valley overnight, spreading eastward as a
low pressure system moves across the Midwest. Several of these
thunderstorms are anticipated to become severe, bringing with them
significant damaging winds, very large hail, and potentially a few
tornadoes. At present, the Storm Prediction Center has issued an
enhanced risk of severe weather for portions of northern Texas,
Oklahoma, southwest Missouri, and northwest Arkansas. In addition
to the severe weather threat, heavy downpours from multiple rounds
of thunderstorms could result in flash flooding. The Weather
Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk of excessive rainfall
for portions of northeast Oklahoma, southwest Missouri, and
northwest Arkansas through Friday morning. Pushed to the south and
east by a descending area of Canadian high pressure, the system
and its trailing cold front will reach the Gulf and East Coasts by
Friday afternoon. Thunderstorms developing over the Mid-Atlantic
and southwestern Plains could become severe, producing damaging
winds a large hail. Meanwhile, moderate to heavy rain will is
forecast to fall over southern New England on Saturday.

The aforementioned Canadian high pressure system will also drive
the southern transport of cold arctic air into the Midwest, Ohio
Valley and Northeast early this weekend. On Friday and Saturday,
daily highs across these regions will likely drop as much as 15 to
20 degrees below normal into the 50s and 60s. Over portions of the
Upper Midwest and northern New England tonight's lows are forecast
to drop to near or below freezing, promoting the issuance of
Freeze Warnings and Watches and Frost Advisories for some areas
through tomorrow morning.

Elsewhere, a low pressure system moving through the Northwest is
forecast to bring rain to the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Rockies, some of which may transition into mixed precipitation or
wet snow at higher elevations overnight and early Friday as
temperatures drop behind a cold front. Friday night showers and
thunderstorms are expected to develop across the north and central
High Plains before moving east into the northern Plains and Upper
Midwest on Saturday. Meanwhile, the formation of new low pressure
center over southeast Colorado Saturday evening will bring
widespread showers and thunderstorms to the central and southern
Rockies and portions of the western Plains.

...Record highs likely in parts of the West next week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with a possibly closed
mid-upper low over the eastern U.S., with a surface low
pressure/frontal system in the western Atlantic spreading rain and
cool temperatures to parts of the East Coast. Meanwhile, periods
of troughing should affect the north-central U.S. southwestward
toward the Four Corners/Desert Southwest, leading to several
chances of rain and cooler than normal temperatures with abundant
cloud cover in central and southern portions of the Plains for the
first half of the week, shifting east as the week progresses. An
upper ridge along the West Coast will cause warm/hot and
potentially record-breaking temperatures for the Pacific Northwest
and northern California into the Great Basin.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The 00Z/06Z guidance cycle was in generally good agreement with
the pattern described above, but with typical differences in the
lower predictability details of the pattern. Most guidance shows
the eastern upper low as being closed on Sunday before rejoining
with the main flow by Monday, but the 06Z GFS was the exception.
Nevertheless, a multi-model deterministic blend was able to be
used for the early part of the medium range period, including the
00Z GFS/ECMWF/CMC/UKMET, which also led to good continuity with
previous WPC forecasts. By Tuesday through Thursday, shortwaves
moving through the central CONUS trough had some spread amongst
guidance, and there was model variability with the potential for
energy to split off and form a separate upper low around Baja
California or not--which also affects the timing of the main
trough shifting eastward. Better agreement was seen with the upper
ridge affecting the West and then troughing sneaking into the
Pacific Northwest by Thursday. For the latter part of the forecast
period, trended toward the GEFS and EC ensemble means to reduce
reliance on any particular model's smaller scale features.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains along the west end of the wavy frontal
boundary and ahead of a weaker northern stream cold front. High
pressure that builds in behind the latter front could lead to some
areas of low level upslope flow that would help to enhance
convective development over the High Plains. Some areas could see
several inches of rainfall over the multi-day period, perhaps
adding to flooding concerns over areas that have seen above normal
rainfall recently. Rain and scattered thunderstorms are expected
to spread eastward into the Mississippi and Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys, but with less certainty on any areas of focused heavy
rainfall totals. These areas may welcome at least some of the
rainfall as little has been observed in the past week or two.

Along the East Coast, the offshore frontal boundary and low
pressure is likely to bring showers to the region early in the
week. Rainfall amounts will depend on the evolution of the system,
but the heaviest rain amounts still look to be offshore.
Nevertheless, at least some light rainfall is forecast for areas
east of the Appalachians with higher chances in the Northeast.
Meanwhile, the West Coast should see little to no precipitation
given the ridge, but coastal Washington may see some scattered
showers as the upper trough and cold front move in next Wednesday
into Thursday.

Cool temperatures in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Sunday will
moderate through the rest of the week as skies clear and high
pressure moves offshore. The Pacific Northwest can expect
temperatures 10-25F above normal by Memorial Day into next
Tue-Wed. This could approach or exceed record levels for parts of
the West Coast states. As the cold front comes ashore, the warm
temperatures will push through the Great Basin to the Divide next
Wed-Thu. The cloudy/stormy pattern setting up over the
central/southern Plains and eastern slopes of the Rockies should
bring highs down to 10-15F below normal through much of next week.

...Record breaking temperatures likely in parts of the West next
week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the southern and central
Plains...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The pattern during the first half of the medium range period
should be rather stagnant as amplified ridging anchors over the
West Coast and mean troughing becomes established over the Central
states. This translates to possibly record breaking heat out West
and the potential for rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall for
portions of the Southern/Central Plains. By late next week, a
shortwave entering the Pacific Northwest should suppress the upper
ridge south and eastward, and push the Central trough into the
East.

The 12z/18z guidance was generally in above average agreement with
the overall pattern, though with typical uncertainties in the
details of individual features. ECMWF was a tad slow/stronger than
the consensus with an exiting Eastern U.S. shortwave on Monday,
though a general model blend seemed to mitigate this. Some
variability with individual bursts of energy embedded within the
main trough across the Plains, which at this time scale are
impossible to pin down anyways. Some timing and evolution
differences begin to arise late week regarding the trough as it
shifts eastward and also with the next wave coming into the
Pacific Northwest. The WPC blend relied on a general deterministic
model blend days 3-5 eventually reaching a 50/50 deterministic vs
ensemble means by days 6 and 7 to help mitigate these lower
predictability details. This approach fit well with previous WPC
continuity as well.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains as Gulf of Mexico moisture intercepts a
slow moving cold front.  Some locations could see several inches
of rain with the best chance at this point from parts of northern
Texas into Oklahoma. Much of this area is already over saturated
due to above normal precipitation recently which would only
increase flooding concerns across the region. High pressure
building in behind the front may also aid low level upslope flow
to enhance convective development over the High Plains. Rain and
scattered thunderstorms are expected to spread eastward into the
Mississippi Valley, the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, and parts of the
East by mid to late next week ahead of the main trough, but with
less certainty on any areas of focused heavy rainfall totals.
Meanwhile, the West should stay dry beneath upper level ridging
with maybe some scattered precipitation as shortwave energy moves
across the region later next week.

Main concern for temperatures during the medium range period is
from California into the Great Basin where daytime highs 20 to 25
degrees above average could approach or exceed record values,
centered around next Tuesday/Wednesday. As the upper ridge weakens
and shifts, values may moderate a bit but still are expected to be
above normal across much of the West and into the northern Plains.
The south-central U.S./High Plains will be below normal under
cloudy and stormy skies the first half of the period, while the
Eastern U.S. sits near normal all next week.

...Record breaking temperatures likely in parts of the West next
week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the southern and central
Plains...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The pattern during the first half of the medium range period
should be rather stagnant as amplified ridging anchors over the
West Coast and mean troughing becomes established over the Central
states. This translates to possibly record breaking heat out West
and the potential for rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall for
portions of the Southern/Central Plains. By late next week, a
shortwave entering the Pacific Northwest should suppress the upper
ridge south and eastward, and push the Central trough into the
East.

The 12z/18z guidance was generally in above average agreement with
the overall pattern, though with typical uncertainties in the
details of individual features. ECMWF was a tad slow/stronger than
the consensus with an exiting Eastern U.S. shortwave on Monday,
though a general model blend seemed to mitigate this. Some
variability with individual bursts of energy embedded within the
main trough across the Plains, which at this time scale are
impossible to pin down anyways. Some timing and evolution
differences begin to arise late week regarding the trough as it
shifts eastward and also with the next wave coming into the
Pacific Northwest. The WPC blend relied on a general deterministic
model blend days 3-5 eventually reaching a 50/50 deterministic vs
ensemble means by days 6 and 7 to help mitigate these lower
predictability details. This approach fit well with previous WPC
continuity as well.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains as Gulf of Mexico moisture intercepts a
slow moving cold front.  Some locations could see several inches
of rain with the best chance at this point from parts of northern
Texas into Oklahoma. Much of this area is already over saturated
due to above normal precipitation recently which would only
increase flooding concerns across the region. High pressure
building in behind the front may also aid low level upslope flow
to enhance convective development over the High Plains. Rain and
scattered thunderstorms are expected to spread eastward into the
Mississippi Valley, the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, and parts of the
East by mid to late next week ahead of the main trough, but with
less certainty on any areas of focused heavy rainfall totals.
Meanwhile, the West should stay dry beneath upper level ridging
with maybe some scattered precipitation as shortwave energy moves
across the region later next week.

Main concern for temperatures during the medium range period is
from California into the Great Basin where daytime highs 20 to 25
degrees above average could approach or exceed record values,
centered around next Tuesday/Wednesday. As the upper ridge weakens
and shifts, values may moderate a bit but still are expected to be
above normal across much of the West and into the northern Plains.
The south-central U.S./High Plains will be below normal under
cloudy and stormy skies the first half of the period, while the
Eastern U.S. sits near normal all next week.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface low/cold front will sweep
across the eastern CONUS today as a second upper trough traverses
the northern Rockies and upper riding builds across the Southwest.
Appreciable rainfall and modestly moist low-level conditions are
expected to limit the potential for widespread significant
wildfire-spread concerns across most of the eastern U.S. The one
small exception may be portions of the eastern Carolinas to the
central Florida Peninsula. Here, 30-40% RH may be observed by
afternoon peak heating along with 5-15 mph sustained southwesterly
flow ahead of the cold front/surface lee-trough axis. Given very dry
fuels across the region, some localized wildfire-spread potential
may exist during the afternoon.

Farther west, upper ridging and associated weak surface wind fields
are expected to preclude widespread wildfire-spread potential as
well. Given critically dry fuels overspread by 10-15% surface RH
across parts of Arizona into New Mexico, locally Elevated conditions
may manifest in terrain favoring areas that typically favor breezy
conditions during the diurnal heating cycle.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Fri May 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the northern Plains while another
positively tilted upper trough meanders across the eastern U.S. and
upper ridging builds across the southern Plains tomorrow/Saturday.
While the upper pattern does not support widespread significant
wildfire spread potential, a few areas of localized, more favorable
fire weather conditions may manifest.

Compared to Day 1, intensifying surface low pressure across the
Lower Colorado River Basin will support a period of stronger (i.e.
15 mph) sustained southwesterly surface winds across western into
central New Mexico, where 10-20% RH and very dry fuels are in place.
The overlap of stronger winds and favorable RH atop critically dry
fuels necessitates the introduction of an Elevated delineation for
tomorrow afternoon.

A cold front will continue sagging southward across the southeast
U.S with modestly dry, breezy conditions preceding the front across
the Carolinas into the central Florida Peninsula. Given the very dry
fuels in place, localized fire spread may occur wherever dry and
breezy conditions overlap the dry fuels in the absence of Day 1
precipitation accumulations.

On the backside of the eastern upper trough, northeasterly mid-level
flow is expected to coincide with northeasterly surface winds to the
south of a surface high across Lower Michigan. While flow aloft will
be modest, the presence of a very dry, deep boundary layer may
promote enough downward momentum transport to support locally dry
and breezy conditions. The locally favorable surface meteorological
conditions atop dry fuels may support localized wildfire-spread
potential during the afternoon.

...Severe thunderstorms and isolated flash flooding possible
across the Southern Plains and Mid-Atlantic through Saturday...

...Below average temperatures found throughout much of the central
and eastern United States this Memorial Day weekend...

A low pressure system entering the Ohio Valley this morning is
forecast to bring widespread showers and locally heavy rain to the
central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic today. Additionally,
thunderstorms are likely to form along and south of an associated
warm front that is expected to slowly lift northward across the
Mid-Atlantic today. A few storms may turn severe, particularly
throughout central and northern Virginia, with damaging wind
gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes possible. The system is
then expected to stall as it reaches the East Coast on Saturday,
leaving a stiff northeast wind and light rain to linger through
the weekend for the Mid-Atlantic region and Northeast.

Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms will also continue to form
along an attached cold front that currently extends from the
middle Mississippi Valley to the Southern Plains. This cold front
is forecast to push southward and reach the Gulf Coast by Saturday
morning, while remaining draped across the Southern Plains. Heavy
rain and severe thunderstorms will be a concern both today and
Saturday throughout the southern High Plains, as well as portions
of central Texas. Multiple rounds of thunderstorms could lead to
several inches of rain today in the aforementioned region. WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall that includes parts of
central and West Texas to highlight the flash flooding threat.
Severe weather may also accompany thunderstorms in the southern
High Plains today and Saturday. Large hail and isolated tornadoes
will be possible from southeast New Mexico to West Texas before
the threat shifts slightly north for the beginning of the weekend.

Speaking of the weekend, many with outdoor plans in the central
and eastern U.S. will have chilly temperatures to contend with. In
fact, portions of the northern Plains and northern New England are
waking up to patchy frost and temperatures near freezing this
morning while a strong high pressure system settles over the
region. Farther south, highs will struggle to escape the 40s in
the Midwest today. Overcast skies, showers, and a northeast breeze
will also make for a cold Memorial Day weekend along the Northeast
and Mid-Atlantic. High temperatures in the 50s on Saturday equates
to around 20 degrees below average and could lead to several daily
record low maximum temperatures. Heat won't be hard to come by
throughout the West however, as triple digit temperatures are
forecast across the Desert Southwest and Sacramento/San Joaquin
valleys of California.

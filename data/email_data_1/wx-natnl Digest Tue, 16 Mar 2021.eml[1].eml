.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CDT Mon Mar 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper-air pattern punctuated by two dominate upper
lows across the Southwest and central US will continue through the
forecast period. A shortwave ridge between the lows will amplify
across eastern New Mexico and west Texas, decreasing wind speeds
through the day. A similar pattern is expected across the East Coast
as surface high pressure dominates the pattern temporarily. While
locally elevated conditions may occur across eastern New Mexico and
west Texas due to the warm/dry airmass, the lack of broader synoptic
forcing for critical criteria winds suggests minimal threat exists
for organized fire weather conditions through this evening. A
similar evolution is expected across the Mid-Atlantic where a dry
airmass with RH of 25-30% is expected. However, cool temperatures
and decreasing wind speeds through the day suggest little organized
threat. Locally elevated conditions may develop, but it appears that
highlights will be unnecessary given the brief/localized nature of
the threat.

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 151743
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 15 2021

SYNOPSIS: A somewhat quiet weather pattern appears in store for much of the
country during Week-2. Of greatest concern are some signs for mid-level low
pressure across the Central U.S., which could see periodic disturbances
develop
downstream of the Rockies and lift toward the Great Lakes. One such system
early in the period could yield some heavy rain concerns for portions of the
Great Plains through the Ohio Valley. Mid-level low pressure is also forecast
over western mainland Alaska and the Bering Sea.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Central and Southern Plains,
Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and the
Southeast, Wed-Thu, Mar 24-25.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 18 - MONDAY MARCH 22:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!utUlXJtnv0IPQem5pI5KKgWPynXnT5ckWEJJag4zxwYRXxV6iBd7U_MMEP8tqUO452XM1SiQ$

FOR TUESDAY MARCH 23 - MONDAY MARCH 29: A general deamplification of the
forecast circulation over North America appears on tap over the course of
Week-2, resulting in a period that is not particularly conducive for hazardous
weather potential. Anomalous ridging is forecast to shift east from Eastern
Canada and deamplify off New England, while anomalous troughing lies over the
West at the outset of the period. Models diverge on the handling of the
western
troughing, with the ECMWF more amplified, and the 0Z ensembles even supporting
a cutoff low by the middle of next week, that is suppressed well to the south
near the Mexican border. The GEFS keeps the feature weaker with troughing
instead stretching from the Northern Rockies through Baja California.



Tied to the evolving longwave pattern, a slight risk of heavy rain is forecast
to shift eastward with time from the Central and Southern Plains through the
Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and parts of the Central Gulf Coast on the 24th and
25th. The driver behind these increased precipitation chances is a cold front
extending southward from a surface low pushing toward the Upper Midwest
interacting with Gulf moisture. Convection at the leading edge of the
advancing
cold front is showing a better than 20% chance to yield three quarters of an
inch of rain, or more, in 24 hours across a region where soil moisture levels
are generally near to above-normal. While no flooding possible area is denoted
across portions of the Missouri, Ohio, and Mississippi River Basins, some
highly localized lingering flooding is being forecast by the River Forecast
Centers at the start of Week-2. Fresh rainfall could see a brief uptick in
river levels, but the net impacts are not anticipated to be widespread enough
to continue any flooding headlines.



There are some signs of heavy snow potential across the Central or Southern
Rockies on the 24th tied to the aforementioned surface low. Generally, amounts
do not appear likely to approach warning criteria, and may be further hampered
by the warm ground and high sun angle during late March. By the 25th, these
concerns may shift to the Upper Mississippi Valley, but similarly appear
unlikely to be particularly impactful in terms of snow amounts.



The Week-2 mean circulation for Alaska features anomalous 500-hPa troughing
extending from the Bering Strait southeastward through the Panhandle. This
setup is likely to promote below-normal temperatures for much of the state,
while also somewhat enhancing onshore flow into the Panhandle. Nevertheless,
temperature departures do not appear particularly extreme, and coupled with
the
warming climatological minimum temperatures during transition season, no
temperature hazards appear likely. Similarly, onshore flow into the Panhandle
appears fairly persistent in nature, with no consistent signals for a period
of
enhanced precipitation or high winds manifesting in model guidance.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN/EASTERN NEW
MEXICO AND WEST TEXAS...

The primary change to the ongoing forecast is to expand the
elevated/critical areas westward into more of southern New Mexico.
With the shortwave trough trending slower in guidance, these areas
are likely to see very windy and drier conditions longer than
previously expected. The potential for extremely critical
meteorological conditions still exists within an axis from the
Trans-Pecos and northward along the NM/TX border. Fuels, despite
ongoing drought, are only on the margins for extreme fire weather
risk. This is especially true with eastward extent. The latest
TICC/SWCC fuels information shows ERCs generally below the 70th
percentile as well as below normal grass fuel loads within the area
of greatest concern. Combined with the duration of extreme
conditions being potentially short, an upgrade does not appear
warranted.

..Wendt.. 03/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Mon Mar 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low near the Four Corners will rapidly intensify and
eject eastward across the southern Rockies through Day2/Tuesday. At
the surface, lee cyclogenesis will take place across the Texas
Panhandle in the afternoon as a sub-1000 mb low is expected to
develop by 00z Day3/Wednesday. Critical fire weather conditions are
likely to the southwest of the developing lee low where strong
winds, warm temperatures, and low RH are forecast to overlap.

...Southern High Plains...
In response to the strong mid-level jet streak moving overhead and
rapid lee cyclogenesis, boundary-layer flow is forecast to increase
quickly through the morning hours. Peak winds during the afternoon
of 25-45 mph are expected within the warm/dry airmass across
southern New Mexico and west Texas. Widespread critical RH of 10 to
15% is expected through the afternoon. Widespread elevated and
critical fire weather conditions are expected to develop given ample
fine fuels.

Some questions remain on the eastward extent of the critical and
elevated conditions into west Texas. Warm temperatures are forecast,
but moistening return flow and weaker overall winds will likely
hamper more widespread fire weather potential. Nonetheless, locally
elevated/critical conditions may develop east of the current
delineated area through the day.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
249 PM EDT Mon Mar 15 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 18 2021 - 12Z Mon Mar 22 2021

19Z Update:  Similar to yesterday, the 12Z models are in very good
agreement across the continental U.S. through most of the medium
range period, and therefore a general multi-deterministic model
blend was used as a starting point in the forecast process.  For
the building western trough this weekend and into next Monday,
there are some modest timing differences with the shortwave
tracking across the Desert Southwest, with the 12Z GFS slightly
ahead of the consensus.  Greater differences are apparent on
Monday with the next shortwave trough approaching the Pacific
Northwest with the 12Z CMC/ECMWF more amplified and faster than
the GFS.  Otherwise the rest of the forecast remains on track and
the previous discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Upper ridging initially over the northern Rockies and southern
Canada will translate eastward through the period, allowing a
closed low to linger over the Southeast. Troughing in the
northeastern Pacific will move ashore through the West this
weekend, setting up another round of snow for parts of the central
Rockies.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance, a deterministic/consensus blend
sufficed for the Thu-Fri period as an area of low pressure moves
through the Ohio River/Tennessee valleys and off the Carolina
coast. By next weekend, guidance continues to indicate lingering
troughing over the Southeast, supporting surface wave development
along the front just offshore. Upper pattern (Rex block) would
allow for such a feature but its proximity to the coast and
strength remain unclear. For now, kept most of its associated
precipitation just offshore but strong northeast flow aided by
high pressure to the north could pose some marine hazards (see
products from OPC and TAFB).

Over the West, upper trough is poised to move inland a bit quicker
than forecast 24 hrs ago (ECMWF EPS trended quicker towards the
faster GEFS mean) but a blended solution between the GFS/GEFS and
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean was a good starting point as the 12Z
Canadian was on the quicker side of the spread (possible outcome
but not preferred at this time). Split between northern and
southern portions of the trough could allow for a close low in the
Great Basin/Four Corners region by early next week.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Rainfall will slip eastward to the Mid-Atlantic ahead of the warm
front on Thursday, perhaps with a bit of snow on the northern
fringe of the precipitation shield. Much of the region has seen
little to no precipitation the past 7-14 days. Rainfall may be
confined to coastal portions of the Southeast into Florida next
weekend as long as the offshore system stays far enough away. High
pressure over the Northeast will maintain cool temperatures this
weekend.

Approaching Pacific systems will spread low elevation rain and
higher elevation snow to the West Coast (NorCal and northern
Sierra into coastal OR/WA) Thu-Sat until the upper trough axis
moves inland. Another system may bring in light rain/snow late Sun
into early Mon. Farther east, light to modest snow is likely for
the terrain in the Great Basin to the central Rockies as the
southern portion of the upper trough slows the system progression.
Question will be how much moisture can be tapped from the Gulf
early next week as the system pulls into the Plains.

Mild temperatures over Florida (record highs in the upper 80s to
near 90 are possible) will give way to 60s/70s behind the cold
front over the Southeast/Florida Friday into the weekend.
Temperatures will moderate in the northern tier by Sunday into
Monday to about 5-10 degrees above normal. Over the West, cooler
than normal temperatures behind the front  are forecast for much
of the region this weekend into Monday. East of the Rockies, well
above normal temperatures are expected for the High Plains into
the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes (perhaps 15-20 degrees above
normal).

...Heavy rains, isolated flooding and Severe weather possible
across portions of the Central to Southern Plains Tuesday and
Wednesday.  Heavy rains and isolated flash flooding also possible
across portions of the Southeast Monday night into Tuesday...

...Fire weather threat for the Southern High Plains Tuesday into
Wednesday...

The strong mid to upper level low that brought the recent winter
storm to the Central Rockies and Central High Plains will continue
to weaken tonight into Tuesday across the mid sections of the
nation.  Wintry weather to the north of this system over the Upper
Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes will continue to weaken
overnight into Tuesday, with generally light snowfall and icing
amounts expected.  The most impactful weather remaining with this
system will be on its southeast edge across portions of the
Southeast where heavy rains and isolated flooding are possible
late tonight into Tuesday from north Georgia into Alabama.

Another strong mid to upper level low will be moving eastward
across the Southwest Monday night into Tuesday and into the
Southern High Plains Tuesday night and Wednesday.  This system
will not have as great a winter weather impact as the recent
strong system.  However, additional light to moderate snows are
possible across the mountains of Arizona and Utah, with locally
heavy snows for portions of the Southern to Central Rockies.  This
system will be more impactful with respect to heavy rains, flash
flooding and severe weather threats Tuesday into Wednesday across
portions of the Southern and Central Plains.  In addition, high
winds and low relative humidities late Tuesday night into
Wednesday will increase the fire weather threat across the
Southern High Plains from eastern New Mexico into West and
Southwest Texas.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon March 15 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 21 - 25 2021

Today's models are in good agreement on the longwave pattern across the domain
during the 6-10 day period. An amplified pattern is predicted, featuring
anomalous ridging over the Aleutians, in the Eastern Pacific and across the
eastern CONUS, with anomalous troughing forecast over Mainland Alaska and the
Alaskan Peninsula, and over the southwest CONUS.

A strong west-to-east mid-level flow over the Bering Sea and into southwest
Alaska is expected to support an active storm track across much of Alaska,
increasing chances of above normal precipitation south of the Brooks Range,
and
for the Aleutians and Peninsula. North of this storm track, negative height
anomalies are predicted, which, coupled with relatively cold easterly low-
level
flow from Canada, favor below normal temperatures across the state.

Downstream of ridging over the eastern Pacific, storm activity is forecast to
be suppressed, enhancing the likelihood of near to below normal precipitation
for western parts of the Lower 48. A trough is forecast to amplify downstream
of this ridge, favoring near to below normal temperatures for much of the
western CONUS. Within this trough a storm system is predicted to develop over
parts of the Four Corners region, amplifying and moving eastward during the
period. This leads to increased chances of above normal precipitation for the
Southwest and across the central U.S. Ahead of the trough, strong southerly
low-level flow favors above normal temperatures for most of the eastern half
of
the CONUS. Probabilities are especially high across the Great Lakes region and
Northeast, where forecast positive height anomalies are highest. The cold
front
predicted to move eastward during the period is expected to encounter
anomalous
ridging in the eastern U.S., which would help to suppress precipitation as it
approaches the coast. This increases chances of near to below normal
precipitation along the Eastern Seaboard.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to excellent model agreement on the large-scale pattern, combined with
good
agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 23 - 29 2021

Models remain in good agreement on the large-scale pattern forecast across the
domain during the week-2 period. The pattern over the CONUS is forecast to
shift eastward, compared to the 6-10 day period, as well as deamplify somewhat
(due to natural uncertainty in longer leads, coupled with a more progressive
pattern). The height pattern forecast over the Alaska region is very similar
to
the 6-10 day period.

The week-2 forecast temperature and precipitation probabilities across Alaska
align closely with the 6-10 day forecast, as the 500-hPa pattern is expected
to
persist into week-2. Ridging and positive height anomalies are forecast to
move
onshore over the western CONUS, leading to increased chances of above normal
temperatures in the West, and favoring above normal temperatures from the West
Coast, east to the Northern Plains. Troughing forecast in the central U.S.
enhances the likelihood of near to below normal temperatures from the Four
Corners region to the Central and Southern Plains. One or more storm systems
predicted to form near the trough, and expand east and north, favor above
normal precipitation for parts of the Southwest, Southern Plains, Lower and
Middle Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes region. Ridging is forecast to
persist along the Eastern Seaboard, leading to an increased chance of near to
below normal precipitation along the East Coast. Ahead of the trough in the
central U.S., southerly low-level flow favors above normal temperatures across
most of the eastern half of the CONUS.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered
on
Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to good agreement among the dynamical models with respect to the
large-scale pattern, and good agreement among the temperature and
precipitation
tools.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
327 PM EDT Mon Mar 15 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 18 2021 - 12Z Mon Mar 22 2021

19Z Update:  Similar to yesterday, the 12Z models are in very good
agreement across the continental U.S. through most of the medium
range period, and therefore a general multi-deterministic model
blend was used as a starting point in the forecast process.  For
the building western trough this weekend and into next Monday,
there are some modest timing differences with the shortwave
tracking across the Desert Southwest, with the 12Z GFS slightly
ahead of the consensus.  Greater differences are apparent on
Monday with the next shortwave trough approaching the Pacific
Northwest with the 12Z CMC/ECMWF more amplified and faster than
the GFS.  Otherwise the rest of the forecast remains on track and
the previous discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Upper ridging initially over the northern Rockies and southern
Canada will translate eastward through the period, allowing a
closed low to linger over the Southeast. Troughing in the
northeastern Pacific will move ashore through the West this
weekend, setting up another round of snow for parts of the central
Rockies.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance, a deterministic/consensus blend
sufficed for the Thu-Fri period as an area of low pressure moves
through the Ohio River/Tennessee valleys and off the Carolina
coast. By next weekend, guidance continues to indicate lingering
troughing over the Southeast, supporting surface wave development
along the front just offshore. Upper pattern (Rex block) would
allow for such a feature but its proximity to the coast and
strength remain unclear. For now, kept most of its associated
precipitation just offshore but strong northeast flow aided by
high pressure to the north could pose some marine hazards (see
products from OPC and TAFB).

Over the West, upper trough is poised to move inland a bit quicker
than forecast 24 hrs ago (ECMWF EPS trended quicker towards the
faster GEFS mean) but a blended solution between the GFS/GEFS and
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean was a good starting point as the 12Z
Canadian was on the quicker side of the spread (possible outcome
but not preferred at this time). Split between northern and
southern portions of the trough could allow for a close low in the
Great Basin/Four Corners region by early next week.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Rainfall will slip eastward to the Mid-Atlantic ahead of the warm
front on Thursday, perhaps with a bit of snow on the northern
fringe of the precipitation shield. Much of the region has seen
little to no precipitation the past 7-14 days. Rainfall may be
confined to coastal portions of the Southeast into Florida next
weekend as long as the offshore system stays far enough away. High
pressure over the Northeast will maintain cool temperatures this
weekend.

Approaching Pacific systems will spread low elevation rain and
higher elevation snow to the West Coast (NorCal and northern
Sierra into coastal OR/WA) Thu-Sat until the upper trough axis
moves inland. Another system may bring in light rain/snow late Sun
into early Mon. Farther east, light to modest snow is likely for
the terrain in the Great Basin to the central Rockies as the
southern portion of the upper trough slows the system progression.
Question will be how much moisture can be tapped from the Gulf
early next week as the system pulls into the Plains.

Mild temperatures over Florida (record highs in the upper 80s to
near 90 are possible) will give way to 60s/70s behind the cold
front over the Southeast/Florida Friday into the weekend.
Temperatures will moderate in the northern tier by Sunday into
Monday to about 5-10 degrees above normal. Over the West, cooler
than normal temperatures behind the front  are forecast for much
of the region this weekend into Monday. East of the Rockies, well
above normal temperatures are expected for the High Plains into
the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes (perhaps 15-20 degrees above
normal).

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 AM CDT Tue Mar 16 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND WEST
TEXAS....

...Synopsis...
A potent compact upper low and mid-level jet streak will rotate
across the southern Four Corners and eject eastward across the
southern High Plains through today. Strong pressure falls at the
surface are expected across the Texas panhandle as a lee low
develops rapidly this afternoon and evening. Strong winds and low
humidity across portions of the southern High plains will support
widespread critical fire weather conditions.

...Eastern New Mexico and west Texas...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions are expected across
portions of the Stacked Plains and west Texas as an area of low
pressure in the lee of the Rockies ejects eastward across the
southern Plains. Regional model soundings show a very dry airmass in
place with daytime humidity values as low 3 to 4% across southern
New Mexico. The extremely dry conditions will be accompanied by very
strong westerly winds of 30-40 mph, resulting from momentum
transport from an 80-90 kt mid-level jet streak aloft. Fuel dryness
remains above average thanks to little recent precipitation. This
suggests widespread critical fire weather conditions are likely. The
nature of the dry/windy conditions also indicates that locally
extremely critical conditions may develop for a couple hours where
fine fuels have cured further. Fuel dryness remains too low at this
time to introduce more widespread extremely critical conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 AM CDT Tue Mar 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
A deep mid-level low is forecast to move across Texoma toward the
ArkLaTex and become negatively tiled by early evening. At the
surface, a strong area of low pressure will move rapidly east
northeast, trailing a Pacific cold front across much of the southern
Plains. Gusty winds and dry conditions behind the low may support
elevated to local critical fire weather conditions through the day.


...Rio Grande Valley...
Behind the departing upper low, gusty northwesterly winds are likely
across much of southwestern Texas. The passage of the cold front
overnight and through the early morning hours will reduce surface RH
somewhat given cooler temps. However, widespread RH of 20-25% is
expected from diurnal mixing and the modified dry continental
airmass. Elevated fire weather conditions appear likely with the
possibility of locally critical conditions where terrain enhancement
may support stronger sustained winds.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
250 AM EDT Tue Mar 16 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 19 2021 - 12Z Tue Mar 23 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging initially over the High Plains and southern Canada
will translate eastward through the period into southeastern
Canada/Northeast by next week. A trough over the East Coast Friday
will lift northeastward but trailing energy will likely linger
move through the Southeast and off the coast, slowing the frontal
progression away from Florida. A Pacific system will move through
the Rockies this weekend and splitting into two pieces--the
southern portion slowly exiting the Four Corners and eventually
lifting northeastward next week toward the Upper Midwest.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance, a deterministic/consensus blend
sufficed for the Fri-Sun period for the low and trailing front off
the East Coast and the incoming western system. The 12Z Canadian
was just a bit slower in the East but no unreasonably so. Trend
off the Southeast continues to be a bit weaker and farther
southeast from Florida, but may still be close enough to yield
affects such as some showers and gusty northeast winds.

Over the West, GFS/GEFS were a bit deeper with the upper trough
than the ECMWF/ECMWF members, but within tolerance for the lead
time. As the system deepens its southern extent over the Four
Corners, 12Z Canadian/GFS became quicker than the ECMWF/18Z GFS
and ensemble means. With solid agreement in the means saw no
reason to deviate much from this pairing since the pattern remains
progressive enough to stay in the middle of the road. 18Z GFS and
12Z ECMWF painted viable solutions.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Exiting coastal system will maintain rain chances for the
Mid-Atlantic on Friday before a drier weekend. Subsequent rainfall
with the front may be confined to just coastal portions of the
Southeast into Florida over the weekend and maybe Monday (South
Florida) depending on how close the system may be. High pressure
over the Northeast will maintain cool temperatures this weekend
(especially the Mid-Atlantic into the Southeast) but then a
warm-up next week. Temperatures may be 5-15 degrees above normal
next week over the eastern Lakes into the Northeast (mid 50s to
mid 60s).

Western system will spread low elevation rain and higher elevation
snow to the Great Basin and central/northern Rockies as the
southern portion of the upper trough slows the system progression.
Precipitation will expand eastward as surface low pressure
organizes to the lee of the Rockies and lifts northeastward,
eventually drawing in Gulf moisture ahead of the front. Cooler
than normal temperatures behind the front are forecast for much of
the West through the period. East of the Rockies, well above
normal temperatures are expected for the High Plains into the
Upper Midwest and Great Lakes (perhaps 15-20 degrees above
normal). This could approach record highs near the Canadian
border.

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 19 2021 - 12Z Tue Mar 23 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging initially over the High Plains and southern Canada
will translate eastward through the period into southeastern
Canada/Northeast by next week. A trough over the East Coast Friday
will lift northeastward but trailing energy will likely linger
move through the Southeast and off the coast, slowing the frontal
progression away from Florida. A Pacific system will move through
the Rockies this weekend and splitting into two pieces--the
southern portion slowly exiting the Four Corners and eventually
lifting northeastward next week toward the Upper Midwest.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance, a deterministic/consensus blend
sufficed for the Fri-Sun period for the low and trailing front off
the East Coast and the incoming western system. The 12Z Canadian
was just a bit slower in the East but no unreasonably so. Trend
off the Southeast continues to be a bit weaker and farther
southeast from Florida, but may still be close enough to yield
affects such as some showers and gusty northeast winds.

Over the West, GFS/GEFS were a bit deeper with the upper trough
than the ECMWF/ECMWF members, but within tolerance for the lead
time. As the system deepens its southern extent over the Four
Corners, 12Z Canadian/GFS became quicker than the ECMWF/18Z GFS
and ensemble means. With solid agreement in the means saw no
reason to deviate much from this pairing since the pattern remains
progressive enough to stay in the middle of the road. 18Z GFS and
12Z ECMWF painted viable solutions.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Exiting coastal system will maintain rain chances for the
Mid-Atlantic on Friday before a drier weekend. Subsequent rainfall
with the front may be confined to just coastal portions of the
Southeast into Florida over the weekend and maybe Monday (South
Florida) depending on how close the system may be. High pressure
over the Northeast will maintain cool temperatures this weekend
(especially the Mid-Atlantic into the Southeast) but then a
warm-up next week. Temperatures may be 5-15 degrees above normal
next week over the eastern Lakes into the Northeast (mid 50s to
mid 60s).

Western system will spread low elevation rain and higher elevation
snow to the Great Basin and central/northern Rockies as the
southern portion of the upper trough slows the system progression.
Precipitation will expand eastward as surface low pressure
organizes to the lee of the Rockies and lifts northeastward,
eventually drawing in Gulf moisture ahead of the front. Cooler
than normal temperatures behind the front are forecast for much of
the West through the period. East of the Rockies, well above
normal temperatures are expected for the High Plains into the
Upper Midwest and Great Lakes (perhaps 15-20 degrees above
normal). This could approach record highs near the Canadian
border.

...Heavy rains, isolated flooding and severe weather possible from
portions of  central/southern Plains to the Deep South through
Wednesday night.

...Another round of mountain snow moving across the Southwest into
the central to southern Rockies tonight...

...Fire weather threat continues today across the Southern High
Plains...

An active and volatile weather pattern continues as another
compact but vigorous upper-level circulation moves across the
Southwest.  This feature will become the catalyst for yet another
strong low pressure system to intensify over the mid-section of
the nation during the next couple of days.  The predecessor storm
that brought the recent winter storm to the central Rockies and
central High Plains will continue to weaken as it moves across the
Ohio Valley this morning.  Some light light snowfall and icing
amounts are expected to move across the lower Great Lakes to
upstate New York today before the system dissipates while a new
low pressure center moves off the Mid-Atlantic coast tonight.
Farther south, the system will still carry some heavy rains and
thunderstorms across portions of the Southeast through tonight.

Meanwhile, mountain snows across the Southwest will spread into
the central to southern Rockies tonight as the associated compact
mid to upper level low moves toward the southern Plains.  This
system will not have as great a winter weather impact as its
predecessor.  However, 6 to 12 inches of snow can be expected
across the higher elevations of southern Colorado to northern New
Mexico through tonight.  This system will be more impactful with
respect to heavy rains, flash flooding and severe weather threats
today into Wednesday across portions of the central/southern
Plains and through the Deep South as another strong low pressure
system develops.

Lastly, high winds and low relative humidities will keep critical
fire weather threat across the Southern High Plains from eastern
New Mexico into western and southwestern Texas.

that two inches or more of rain can be expected across Alabama
into Georgia ahead of a strong cold front while another swath of
heavy rain is expected from Kansas to southern Iowa to the north
of the storm track.  The Storm Prediction Center now predicts a
Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms across the interior Deep
South on Wednesday.  Some wintry precipitation is also expected
across the north-central Plains early on Thursday along with
strengthening winds from the north.

Finally, high winds and low relative humidities will keep critical
fire weather threat across the Southern High Plains from eastern
New Mexico into western and southwestern Texas.

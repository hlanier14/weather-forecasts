Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 AM CDT Wed Jun 30 2021

Valid 301700Z - 011200Z

Locally Elevated conditions are likely from the lee of the Cascades
to central Montana given the passage of a thermally-induced surface
pressure trough. Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track,
with isolated thunderstorms supporting occasional dry strikes still
expected across portions of the northern Great Basin, northern
Rockies, and Pacific Northwest this afternoon and evening. Please
see the previous forecast below for more details on the dry
thunderstorm threat across the Interior West.

..Squitieri.. 06/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Wed Jun 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large mid-level anticyclone will remain stationary across the
northwestern CONUS bringing abnormally warm temperatures to much of
the West. To the south across the Great Basin, monsoonal moisture
will allow for scattered thunderstorms and isolated dry lightning
strikes to develop through the afternoon. Across the eastern US,
troughing will intensify over the Mid Atlantic, supporting
widespread showers and thunderstorms.

...Great Basin and Pacific Northwest...
On the southern fringes of the record mid-level ridge over western
Canada and the northwestern US, neutral to weak height falls will
overspread monsoonal moisture across portions of the Great Basin and
Pacific Northwest. Similar to the last several days, diurnal
thunderstorms should develop with the potential for isolated to
widely scattered lightning strikes. Fuels over much of the Great
Basin and Pacific Northwest are near record levels of dryness,
suggesting high susceptibility to lightning starts. Even with
several days of slowly accumulating precipitation and PWATS favoring
wetter storm modes, isolated dry lightning strikes appear likely
through the forecast period. The highest concentration of dry
strikes will likely be located across portions of northern Nevada,
into southeastern Oregon, and western Idaho. Here, along the
northern fringes of the plume of moisture, the greatest overlap of
steep low/mid-level lapse rates enhancing low-level drying and
favorable PWAT values (0.5-0.8 inches) will reside.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 30 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure favors the continuation of
anomalously warm temperatures and excessive heat concerns across the wester=
n
and north-central contiguous U.S. during week-2. Surface low pressure
development and frontal activity increases the potential for heavy
precipitation across parts of the Midwest and Tennessee Valley early in the
period. Enhanced monsoonal moisture and precipitation may result in localiz=
ed
flooding over parts of Desert Southwest. Over Alaska, mid-level low pressur=
e
is
likely to bring below (above) normal temperatures (precipitation) across mu=
ch
of the state.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Intermountain
region, Great Basin, Rockies, and the Northern and Central Plains, Thu-Sun,
Jul
8-11.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western CONUS, and the
north-central CONUS, Thu-Wed, Jul 8-14.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Mississippi, Tenness=
ee,
and Ohio Valleys, the Great Lakes, and the Appalachians, Thu-Sat, Jul 8-10.

Flooding possible across southeastern Arizona and southern New Mexico.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY JULY 03 - WEDNESDAY JULY 07:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!uNL5p1LWvwlEey9WkWwdCdkvBc44wveuF_yki-xOkck_HeDOHPgf4Q7QgcDgD=
QFIf7CKH7cM$

FOR THURSDAY JULY 08 - WEDNESDAY JULY 14: There is little change to the wee=
k-2
hazards perspective as dynamical models continue to advertise the weakening=
 of
an amplified 500-hPa ridge towards the end of week-1, followed by the
redevelopment of anomalous ridging overspreading the western and north-cent=
ral
CONUS to increase the potential for above-normal temperatures and possible
excessive heat during the early to middle portion of week-2. Similar to
previous ensemble runs, the 0z ECMWF favors the persistence of positive hei=
ght
departures across the northwestern CONUS by the start of week-2, which is t=
hen
forecast to gradually strengthen and expand throughout the western CONUS
through the middle portion of the period. The 0z GEFS remains comparatively
less amplified, featuring more of a zonal mid-level pattern than the ECMWF
during early week-2, with a slower transition of anomalously positive mid-
level
heights developing throughout the West.



Despite some of these disparities between the models, reforecast tool guida=
nce
remains supportive of the continued moderate risk for excessive heat, with =
at
least a 40% chance for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile
indicated across the higher elevations of the West and over portions of the
Central and High Plains. While the GEFS (ECMWF) reforecast tool focuses the
highest probabilities over the High Plains (Great Basin and Northern
Intermountain), a moderate risk remains highlighted inclusive of these regi=
ons
for Jul 8 to 11. A slight risk also remains issued for much of the western =
and
north-central CONUS, where both reforecast tools maintain at least a 20%
chance
for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 degrees F,
through the entirety of week-2. Triple digit temperatures are possible acro=

where combined with below normal precipitation predominately favored during
week-2, is likely to exacerbate ongoing moderate (D1) to extreme drought (D=

conditions being felt throughout this part of the country. Heat-driven impa=
cts
expected also include locally elevated fire weather conditions as well as
direct health risks for human and animal populations across the highlighted
regions. Towards the latter portion of week-2, dynamical models favor the
gradual weakening of the positive mid-level height departures which should
allow for a moderation of temperatures by mid-July.



For precipitation, the Weather Prediction Center's day 7 surface analysis
features surface troughing across the Great Plains with a frontal boundary
draped across the northeastern CONUS. Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
continue to favor return flow from the Gulf of Mexico, which would advect
ample
moisture into the Plains and Mississippi Valley. While the GEFS reforecast
tool
remains fairly weak regarding the potential for heavy precipitation, the EC=
MWF
reforecast tool depicts a region focused over the Middle Mississippi, Ohio,
and
Tennessee Valleys with at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall accumulation=
s
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch early in the period. As there is
also continued support from the raw ECMWF ensemble, a slight risk for heavy
precipitation is issued from Jul 8 to 10 for the region. Given the reductio=
n
of
heavy precipitation signals in the reforecast tools across the south-centra=
l
CONUS, the slight risk of heavy precipitation is removed from the Southern
Plains and the Lower Mississippi Valley in today's outlook. Over the
southwestern CONUS, the North American Monsoon looks to be kicking into gea=
r.
Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favor mid-level ridging (594 dam) centere=
d
over the Four Corners region conducive for the enhancement of monsoonal
moisture across Mexico and the Desert Southwest where reforecast tools
indicate
at least a 20% chance for 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th
percentile during the period. Although totals are not expected to exceed
pre-defined hazard thresholds, there is a continued risk of locally heavy,
convective rainfall over very dry soils to elevate the potential for enhanc=
ed
runoff across the higher elevations into the valleys, and a flooding possib=
le
hazard remains issued across parts of Arizona and New Mexico.



Across the tropics, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) continues to monito=
r
two tropical disturbances located at approximately 57W and 40W over the
tropical Atlantic. Since yesterday, the latter disturbance has shown signs =
of
organization with at least a 90% chance for formation during the next 5 day=

For week-1, however, there are significant differences between the dynamica=
l
models regarding the strength and longevity of this system. The last severa=
l
runs of the deterministic GFS strongly favor continued development as it
tracks
across the Caribbean and recurving into the eastern Gulf of Mexico before
coming ashore  over Florida by the start of week-2. Similarly, the 0z and 6=
z
GEFS show nearly all their ensemble members with deepening low centers
impacting Hispaniola. After which point, ensemble spread increases likely d=
ue
to land interaction, with several members tracking into the Gulf and other
members recurving out towards the Atlantic. On the other hand, both the lat=
est
ECMWF deterministic solutions and mean ensemble guidance remain far less
supportive of these realizations, as they both favor some strengthening of
this
low followed by its dissipation over the eastern Caribbean by this weekend.
Given these differences in the deterministic and ensemble guidance, as well=
 as
general uncertainty as to its track and strength at this lead, there is
insufficient confidence that this potential system will pose an impact to t=

CONUS at this time, and no corresponding hazards are issued. However, these
disturbances will continue to be monitored and addressed in upcoming outloo=
ks.



Over Alaska, anomalous mid-level troughing favored over the Bering Sea is
likely to bring below-normal temperatures and above-normal, but non hazardo=

precipitation throughout much of the state. The anomalously cool and wet
conditions during early July are also likely to quell ongoing wildfire
activity.

...Triple-digit heat continues over the interior Northwest while
spreading into portions of the northern Plains through the 4th of
July weekend...

...Threat of heavy rain lingers near the Gulf Coast through the
weekend into next week...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble guidance continues to show the large scale
pattern settling into a more typical summer regime after this
weekend, with the westerlies confined to southern Canada and
northern tier of the U.S., after an amplified upper trough over
the East Coast states on Saturday lifts away to the northeast.
Elsewhere, a seasonably strong upper ridge will prevail over the
Southwest through the period and a weakness with possible embedded
low should evolve over the southern Plains into northern Mexico
during Monday-Wednesday.  In the tropical Atlantic a leading wave
poised to enter the eastern Caribbean should eventually weaken.
However there appears to be increasing potential for a trailing
feature now near 40W to strengthen over the coming days and track
into or near the eastern Gulf of Mexico next week.

The updated forecast incorporated a composite of 00Z/06Z
operational models early in the period and then transitioned
toward somewhat more 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean input relative to the
past two ECMWF runs and 06Z GFS by day 7 Wednesday.  This cycle
furthered the recent model/ensemble mean trend toward faster
ejection of the East Coast upper trough, with the operational
model blend fitting well within the ensemble mean template.
Latest consensus including the new 12Z guidance suggests an upper
low should track near Maine/Nova Scotia by day 4 Sunday and into
the Canadian Maritimes thereafter.  Trends aloft support
associated low pressure tracking farther offshore and the trailing
cold front pushing farther southeast over the western Atlantic.
The low amplitude and moderately progressive nature of upper flow
along the U.S.-Canadian border still suggest low predictability
for specifics several days out in time.  The most common theme in
the guidance is a leading shortwave (12Z GFS possibly becoming too
amplified by Tuesday) that will bring a front across the northern
tier states while a modest mean trough sets up close to the
Pacific Northwest coast.  One or more shortwaves emerging from
this mean trough may support waviness along the northern tier
front next week.  The blended approach accounts for these ideas
while downplaying lower-confidence details.

Farther south, the model/mean blend has been fairly stable for the
upper weakness/low over the southern Plains/northern Mexico.  On
the other hand the tropical forecast for next week relative to the
wave initially near 40W has been rapidly evolving and very
uncertain.  At the time of forecast preparation only GFS runs and
the 00Z UKMET (reaching the southeast corner of the Gulf at the
end of its run) showed a defined surface feature reaching the
eastern Gulf.  ECMWF runs through 00Z have not shown even a hint
of a surface low.  Ensembles diverge considerably with the
resulting means not showing any system.  In the 12Z cycle the CMC
has joined the GFS/UKMET in depicting a system but the ECMWF still
has none.  Today's NHC-WPC coordination yielded a nod toward more
definition than continuity and this will be reflected in the
surface forecast update sent by 22Z.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest will be less
intense than it has been over recent days but triple-digit heat is
still likely each afternoon across some interior areas through the
holiday weekend and into early next week.  A portion of this heat
will spread into the northern Plains, continuing into next week to
the south of a front that reaches the northern tier.  Best
potential for afternoon temperatures to reach the century mark at
some locations in Montana and the Dakotas should be during the
weekend.  Also expect some scattered daily record highs/warm lows
over the Northwest-northern Plains on Saturday-Sunday.  The
moderating trend next week will gradually reduce the coverage of
high temperatures that are 10F or more above normal.  Some rain
showers over the northern Rockies may offer slight relief to the
heat but they will do little to ease the growing drought concern
in these areas.  One or more northern tier frontal waves could
help to focus areas of heavier rainfall next week but confidence
in specifics is below average at this time.  Farther south, some
late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are likely each
day over the central to southern Rockies through the medium range
period.

The cold front expected to reach near the Gulf Coast this weekend
and then stall/dissipate may be a focus for areas of moderate to
heavy rainfall.  With time the heaviest rainfall should gravitate
toward the western half of the Gulf Coast and nearby areas due to
the upper weakness/low likely to develop over/near Texas.
Meanwhile interests near the eastern Gulf should monitor the
latest National Hurricane Center products for the latest
information regarding the feature that could eventually affect the
region by next week.  Farther north, the upper trough near the
East Coast this weekend should tend to promote areas of
diurnally-favored rainfall, with recent faster trends for the
upper trough leading to lighter amounts and less coverage.  Clouds
and rainfall over the southern half of the Plains will keep that
region below normal for highs during the period with some minus
5-10F or so anomalies.  High pressure behind the Gulf Coast front
should provide moderately below normal morning lows to portions of
the eastern half of the country during the weekend.

30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR JULY 2021

The updated outlook of temperature and precipitation for July 2021 reflects
the
official outlooks from WPC, CPC, and NHC, latest model guidance, soil moist=
ure
conditions, and the status of well-known climate oscillations. Dry conditio=
ns
are forecast to continue across much of the western and northern CONUS,
further
supporting an outlook favoring above normal temperatures from the Southwest=
 to
the Northwest and eastward to the Great Lakes and Northeast. The highest od=
ds
are across the northern Intermountain West, where outlooks from the short-t=
erm
to Week 4 all highlight enhanced odds for below normal precipitation,
continuing to tip the feedback cycle toward above normal temperatures. Earl=
y
frontal activity, combined with favored above normal precipitation (as
indicated in many models), backed by recent above normal soil moisture, fav=
ors
below normal temperatures across the Southern Great Plains and portions of =
the
Southeast, except Florida.



Across the Southwest, an early moisture surge is likely to bring rains to
southern Arizona and New Mexico. The latest CFS runs indicate a push of
moisture into the Great Basin during the middle of the month, but that sign=
al
is weaker in recent ECMWF runs, so slightly enhanced odds of above normal
precipitation, or EC, is the resultant outlook for much of California, Neva=
da,
and portions of Utah. Below normal precipitation is favored to continue acr=
oss
the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, with the first two weeks likely=
 to
be dry.  Below normal precipitation is also favored for portions of the
Northeast as there is little chance for moisture to stream northward. Acros=
s
the Southeast, early frontal activity and the potential for tropical moistu=
re
favor above normal precipitation. An MJO signal moving into phases 3 and 4
would tend to reduce tropical activity across the Gulf of Mexico, so that
mitigates the odds across the Southeast and Gulf Coast. The Southern Great
Plains are likely to remain wet due to a combination of moisture from the
Southwest and the western end of a frontal boundary.





--------------  Previous discussion follows ----------------



The July 2021 outlook was prepared based on dynamical model and statistical
forecast guidance, current soil moisture/drought conditions, potential impa=
cts
from the MJO, and newly derived long term trends from the 1991-2020 base
period.



ENSO neutral is likely to continue through the outlooks period. The MJO may
also influence the climate pattern. Model predictions for MJO indicate a
strengthening over Africa and the western Indian Ocean, though there is
another
area of upper-level divergence over the Western Pacific. If the signal
emerges,
it would increase the variability throughout the month. That potential
resulted
in some lower probabilities for some regions, as explained below. Drought i=
s
largely entrenched over the western CONUS and Northern Plains, and the summ=
er
months are prime months when current soil moisture  values can impact
temperature and precipitation in following months.



Above normal temperatures are favored along the Rockies and across the West=
,
with the highest odds in the Great Basin and Four Corners region. The deepl=
y
entrenched drought, long-term trends, and numerical guidance (dynamical mod=
els
and statistical tools) all indicate above normal temperatures are most like=
ly.
For the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, an active MJO could result =
in
more variable conditions, so the odds are more modest in those regions. Sea
surface temperatures are also likely to be below normal near the California
coast, moderating odds there as well.  Equal chances for above, near, and
below
normal are indicated across the Southern Plains, Middle and Lower Mississip=
pi
Valleys, and portions of the Southeast. Temperature trends as indicated in =
the
OCN are not as strong there. The suite of dynamical model guidance from the
NMME, C3S, and CFS all indicate a relative relaxation of probabilities for
above normal temperatures, while some statistical tools favor below normal
temperatures, so the mixed indications from the tools result in EC. For the
Great Lakes and Northeast, trends, dynamical model guidance, and statistica=
l
tools are all largely in agreement for above normal temperatures. Across
Alaska, the signals are a bit more mixed as summer trends are not as strong=
 as
winter trends, and some NMME models indicate below normal temperatures. Mor=
e
recent model runs and some statistical tools (SST-CA and ENSO-OCN) support
higher odds over southern Mainland and eastern Alaska in the outlook.



Above normal precipitation is indicated from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio
Valley,
consistent with dynamical model guidance, though the guidance has shown
variability in recent runs for the Carolinas and Florida, so odds in those
places are low. Statistical tools and dynamical models show a consistent
signal
for below normal precipitation from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern
Plains, though an active MJO could introduce short-term wetness in mid to l=
ate
July (however this would be very atypical), so below-normal precipitation i=
s
still favored, but probabilities are lower along the coast. Some dynamical
models indicate wetness into the Four Corners region, but half of the
statistical tools (CCA and SST-CA) do not. The precipitation OCN shows a we=
ak
wet signal from Central California to Oklahoma in a broad swath, though
amounts
are low and the pattern is not similar to other tools, so equal chances is
indicated in the outlook.  NMME, C3S, and statistical tools support
above-normal precipitation for western mainland Alaska.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 06 - 10 2021

Model solutions remain consistent that the largest positive 500-hPa height
anomalies (more than 30 meters) expand eastward over the highest latitudes =
of
the CONUS during early July. Therefore, above normal temperatures are favor=
ed
throughout the West along with the Central and Northern Great Plains, Great
Lakes, and Northeast. A weakness in a subtropical ridge coupled with the
expectation of widespread precipitation elevates probabilities of below nor=
mal
temperatures across the Southern Great Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley, an=
d
parts of the Southeast.

A residual surface front along with the weakness in the subtropical ridge a=
re
likely to enhance diurnal convection from the Southern Plains northeast to =
the
Ohio Valley where above normal precipitation is favored. The elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation extend north to include the Gre=
at
Lakes and Northeast, since these areas are forecast to be located within th=
e
southern edge of westerlies and a favorable location for rounds of convecti=
on.
The amplified 500-hPa ridge aloft favors below normal precipitation across
much
of the West and the Northern to Central Great Plains. Model guidance is in
good
agreement for increased probabilities of above normal precipitation across
southeast Arizona and parts of New Mexico. This is related to enhanced
low-level moisture, associated with easterly waves and monsoonal flow.

A broad area of low pressure is currently located between Africa and the
Windward Islands. As of 2pm on June 30, the National Hurricane Center state=
s
that this system has a 90 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone dur=
ing
the next five days as it tracks west-northwest. Although large model spread
exists on its future strength and track, it is expected to further enhance

Forecast confidence remains high across Alaska as a high amplitude 500-hPa

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 08 - 14 2021

A large and relatively strong 500-hPa ridge for July is likely to persist o=
ver
much of North America through at least week-2. The largest probabilities of
above normal temperatures, forecast across the West and along the northern
tier
of the CONUS, correspond to where the ensemble means depict 500-hPa height
anomalies exceeding +30 meters. The core of largest positive 500-hPa anomal=
ies
(+60 meters or more) are forecast to be centered over southeast Canada and
northern New England. Low soil moisture (below the 5th percentile) througho=
ut
much of the western and north-central CONUS is also likely to contribute to
the
anomalous warmth. Near normal temperatures are favored for most of the
Southeast as model solutions indicate the onset of a warming trend early in
week-2 with increasing 500-hPa heights. Elevated probabilities of below nor=
mal
temperatures are favored to persist across much of  Texas due, in part, to
soil
moisture considerations.

Subtropical ridging, both aloft and at the surface, is forecast to strength=
en
and extend westward over the Gulf of Mexico during week-2. This evolving
pattern favors a suppression of seabreeze convection and below normal
precipitation across much of Florida and along the Gulf Coast. Also, anomal=
ous
upper-level convergence associated with the Madden Julian Oscillation is
forecast to shift east to the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea by week-2.
Ensemble means depict a 500-hPa ridge axis near the Four Corners region whi=
ch
favors near to above normal precipitation, associated with monsoonal moistu=
re,
for parts of Arizona and New Mexico. The expansive and strong ridge aloft
supports increased probabilities of below normal precipitation throughout t=
he
remainder of the West and north-central CONUS. Above normal precipitation
remains slightly favored across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys where the
500-hPa pattern is favorable for mesoscale convective systems.

The 500-hPa trough over Alaska is forecast to deamplify from early to mid-
July.
Despite its weakening, model solutions are in good agreement that below nor=
mal
temperatures are likely to persist with slightly elevated probabilities of
above normal precipitation for much of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 6z G=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CDT Wed Jun 30 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

Relatively minor adjustments were made to the isolated dry
thunderstorm delineation across portions of the Pacific Northwest
into the Northern Rockies based on the latest guidance. Otherwise,
the previous forecast for isolated dry thunderstorms across the
Northwest and dry/breezy conditions across eastern Montana remain
valid. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 06/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Wed Jun 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
The blocking high over the western US will gradually begin to move
east through the day, as weak southwesterly flow aloft develops over
the Pacific Northwest. As the ridge shifts to the east, warm and dry
conditions will migrate over the northern Rockies/High Plains,
supporting elevated fire weather concerns. To the east, troughing
over the northeastern US will intensify, keeping shower and
thunderstorm activity likely over much of the central and eastern
CONUS.

...Montana...
While the strong mid-level ridge pushes to the east, surface high
pressure will build over the northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Dry
and warm easterly flow will overspread much of Montana through the
afternoon. Surface humidity values of 20 to 30% are expected, with
winds of 10-15 mph. With little recent precipitation across the
region, fuels remain quite dry. Elevated fire weather conditions
will likely develop through the afternoon across portions of central
and eastern Montana.

...Pacific Northwest...
Scattered thunderstorms are again forecast to develop through the
day across portions of the northern Great Basin and Pacific
Northwest. As southwesterly flow aloft increases, total column
moisture will continue to increase with PWATS near 1 inch expected
by early afternoon. This should result in wet storms with the
potential for a few dry lightning strikes. However, given the
presence of exceptionally dry fuels, isolated dry thunder
probabilities will be maintained across the Northwest/Northern Great
Basin despite wetter storm modes. A dry strike or two may still
occur across portions of the Southwest and Four Corners, but wet
storms and several days of precipitation will reduce the threat for
lightning ignitions.

...Triple-digit heat continues over the interior Northwest while
spreading into portions of the northern Plains through the 4th of
July weekend...

...Threat of heavy rain lingers near the Gulf Coast through the
weekend into next week...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble guidance continues to show the large scale
pattern settling into a more typical summer regime after this
weekend, with the westerlies confined to southern Canada and
northern tier of the U.S., after an amplified upper trough over
the East Coast states on Saturday lifts away to the northeast.
Elsewhere, a seasonably strong upper ridge will prevail over the
Southwest through the period and a weakness with possible embedded
low should evolve over the southern Plains into northern Mexico
during Monday-Wednesday.  In the tropical Atlantic a leading wave
poised to enter the eastern Caribbean should eventually weaken.
However there appears to be increasing potential for a trailing
feature now near 40W to strengthen over the coming days and track
into or near the eastern Gulf of Mexico next week.

The updated forecast incorporated a composite of 00Z/06Z
operational models early in the period and then transitioned
toward somewhat more 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean input relative to the
past two ECMWF runs and 06Z GFS by day 7 Wednesday.  This cycle
furthered the recent model/ensemble mean trend toward faster
ejection of the East Coast upper trough, with the operational
model blend fitting well within the ensemble mean template.
Latest consensus including the new 12Z guidance suggests an upper
low should track near Maine/Nova Scotia by day 4 Sunday and into
the Canadian Maritimes thereafter.  Trends aloft support
associated low pressure tracking farther offshore and the trailing
cold front pushing farther southeast over the western Atlantic.
The low amplitude and moderately progressive nature of upper flow
along the U.S.-Canadian border still suggest low predictability
for specifics several days out in time.  The most common theme in
the guidance is a leading shortwave (12Z GFS possibly becoming too
amplified by Tuesday) that will bring a front across the northern
tier states while a modest mean trough sets up close to the
Pacific Northwest coast.  One or more shortwaves emerging from
this mean trough may support waviness along the northern tier
front next week.  The blended approach accounts for these ideas
while downplaying lower-confidence details.

Farther south, the model/mean blend has been fairly stable for the
upper weakness/low over the southern Plains/northern Mexico.  On
the other hand the tropical forecast for next week relative to the
wave initially near 40W has been rapidly evolving and very
uncertain.  At the time of forecast preparation only GFS runs and
the 00Z UKMET (reaching the southeast corner of the Gulf at the
end of its run) showed a defined surface feature reaching the
eastern Gulf.  ECMWF runs through 00Z have not shown even a hint
of a surface low.  Ensembles diverge considerably with the
resulting means not showing any system.  In the 12Z cycle the CMC
has joined the GFS/UKMET in depicting a system but the ECMWF still
has none.  Today's NHC-WPC coordination yielded a nod toward more
definition than continuity and this will be reflected in the
surface forecast update sent by 22Z.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest will be less
intense than it has been over recent days but triple-digit heat is
still likely each afternoon across some interior areas through the
holiday weekend and into early next week.  A portion of this heat
will spread into the northern Plains, continuing into next week to
the south of a front that reaches the northern tier.  Best
potential for afternoon temperatures to reach the century mark at
some locations in Montana and the Dakotas should be during the
weekend.  Also expect some scattered daily record highs/warm lows
over the Northwest-northern Plains on Saturday-Sunday.  The
moderating trend next week will gradually reduce the coverage of
high temperatures that are 10F or more above normal.  Some rain
showers over the northern Rockies may offer slight relief to the
heat but they will do little to ease the growing drought concern
in these areas.  One or more northern tier frontal waves could
help to focus areas of heavier rainfall next week but confidence
in specifics is below average at this time.  Farther south, some
late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are likely each
day over the central to southern Rockies through the medium range
period.

The cold front expected to reach near the Gulf Coast this weekend
and then stall/dissipate may be a focus for areas of moderate to
heavy rainfall.  With time the heaviest rainfall should gravitate
toward the western half of the Gulf Coast and nearby areas due to
the upper weakness/low likely to develop over/near Texas.
Meanwhile interests near the eastern Gulf should monitor the
latest National Hurricane Center products for the latest
information regarding the feature that could eventually affect the
region by next week.  Farther north, the upper trough near the
East Coast this weekend should tend to promote areas of
diurnally-favored rainfall, with recent faster trends for the
upper trough leading to lighter amounts and less coverage.  Clouds
and rainfall over the southern half of the Plains will keep that
region below normal for highs during the period with some minus
5-10F or so anomalies.  High pressure behind the Gulf Coast front
should provide moderately below normal morning lows to portions of
the eastern half of the country during the weekend.

latest National Hurricane Center products for the latest
information regarding the feature that could eventually affect the
region by next week.  Farther north, the upper trough near the
East Coast this weekend should tend to promote areas of
diurnally-favored rainfall, with recent faster trends for the
upper trough leading to lighter amounts and less coverage.  Clouds
and rainfall over the southern half of the Plains will keep that
region below normal for highs during the period with some minus
5-10F or so anomalies.  High pressure behind the Gulf Coast front
should provide moderately below normal morning lows to portions of
the eastern half of the country during the weekend.

...Prolonged heat wave continues across interior sections of the
Northwest and Northern Rockies, now extending into the Northern
High Plains...

...Cold front to bring the chance of severe weather, heavy rain,
and flooding to the East...

...Flood threat continues from the Ohio Valley to the Desert
Southwest...


The oppressive heat continues for interior sections of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies. While the temperatures are not
quite as high as earlier in the week, daily highs still in the
upper 90s to lower 100s after the recent extreme heat will be of
little relief. Excessive Heat Warnings remain in effect for
eastern Washington and Oregon as well as portions of northern and
western Idaho, with Heat Advisories extending into portions of
northern Nevada and California. The upper-level high that has
remained over the region will gradually shift to the east
throughout the period, bringing the hot temperatures further into
the Northern Rockies and Northern High Plains. Daily high
temperatures will peak over 100 starting on Thursday, with
Excessive Heat Warnings and Watches also in effect for eastern
Montana and Heat Advisories in effect along and east of the
Northern Rockies.

In the East, a cold front will being to slowly progress to the
southeast across the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast. While
this front will bring relief from the hot and particularly muggy
past few days, the moist and buoyant airmass will lead to the
chance for severe thunderstorms. The Storm Prediction Center has
issued an Enhanced Risk of severe weather through this evening for
portions of Southern New England as well as a Slight Risk
stretching from western Pennsylvania northeast to coastal Maine.
The main threat from these storms will be high winds. There is a
Slight Risk in effect for Thursday for eastern portions of the
Mid-Atlantic as the cold front continues to progress
southeastward. High winds will again be the main threat with these
storms. In addition to the severe weather, widespread showers and
thunderstorms are likely ahead of the front from coastal New
England to the Southeast throughout the forecast period. In
particular, there is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall from the
Mid-Atlantic southwest through the southern Appalachians and into
the Tennessee Valley for Thursday. Storms may produce rainfall in
excess of 1" per hour, leading to the risk for flash flooding. A
Marginal Risk is in effect for the Southeast on Friday for rain
totals in excess of 1".

From the Midwest to the Southwest, lingering surface boundaries
combined with a moist airmass, as well as the cold front
progressing south, will lead to continued chances of rain and
thunderstorms along with the risk for flash flooding. A Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall is in effect through Thursday morning
stretching from the Ohio Valley west through the Mid-Mississippi
valley to southeastern Kansas. Heavy rainfall rates greater than
1" per hour are possible with any storms. While the rain may not
be as heavy on Thursday, a Marginal Risk for excessive rainfall is
in effect from the Mid-Mississippi Valley west through Oklahoma
and into the Central High Plains due to the saturated soil
conditions in place from the prolonged daily rainfall. Meanwhile,
heavy rain will be possible with daily showers and thunderstorms
in the Desert Southwest as moisture from the remnants of Tropical
Storm Enrique continues northward into the region. A Marginal Risk
of excessive rainfall is in effect for both Wednesday night and
Thursday. Rain chances continue into Friday as the cold front
stalls along the Southern High Plains, with a Marginal Risk for
excessive rainfall in effect for most of eastern New Mexico and
portions of the western Texas.

Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms are possible over the Great
Basin and Central Rockies on Thursday and throughout the forecast
period along the Gulf Coast and in Florida.

remain at or below normal for this time of year across the
southern U.S., with daily highs mainly in the 80s.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CDT Thu Jul 01 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
Within a weak and nebulous mid-level flow pattern with persistent
mid-level ridging, minimal deep-layer flow will be maintained over
the western and central U.S. To the east, an upper trough will
deepen across the eastern third of the CONUS. Fire weather concerns
will be limited in area and scope, given the weak flow regime and
widespread precipitation cross the CONUS.

...Montana...
As surface high pressure over the Midwest intensifies, easterly
low-level pressure gradients are forecast to increase across the
northern Rockies/Plains. Surface winds of 10-20 mph are forecast to
develop across central and northern Montana. Warm temperatures
beneath the ridge axis will support surface humidity values of
20-30%. With dry fuels in place, elevated fire weather conditions
appear likely.

...Northwest and Northern Rockies...
Scattered thunderstorms will develop with a surge of monsoonal
moisture from the Southwest and Four Corners, into the Northwest and
northern Rockies. PWAT values will decrease with latitudinal extent,
with areas across the Great Basin and Southwest seeing the highest
values over 1 inch. The result will be a gradient in storm mode, as
wetter storms will be favored south, and drier storms to the north.
While a few dry strikes are possible in dry fuels with wetter
storms, the greatest risk for dry thunder appears to be across the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies. Dry thunder probabilities
have been shifted north to account for the threat of isolated dry
strikes in receptive fuels.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0148 AM CDT Thu Jul 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
An indistinct mid-level flow pattern driven by mid-level ridging
will continue across the western US, while a deepening upper low
becomes quasi stationary over the Northeast. At the surface, a cold
front will move south across the center of the country, enhancing
shower and thunderstorm activity while high pressure settles over
the Midwest.

...Northwest and Intermountain West...
With plentiful moisture over much of the western CONUS, scattered
thunderstorms are again forecast to develop diurnally. Lightning
strikes will be possible over areas with dry and receptive fuels.
Similar to the last several days, higher PWAT values across the
Southwest will likely limit the potential for dry strikes, though a
few may still occur outside the heaviest precipitation cores. To the
north along the gradient of the monsoonal surge across the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies, model soundings indicate much drier
low-level thermodynamic profiles favorable for isolated dry strikes.
Several days of lightning activity and dry/receptive fuels will
continue to pose a risk for lightning ignitions. Dry thunder
probabilities have been added where the greatest overlap in storm
coverage and dry surface conditions is forecast.

...Northern Rockies and High Plains...
Gusty easterly flow may linger across portions of Montana
Day2/Friday, as surface pressure gradients begin to weaken with the
passage of the mid-level ridge. Surface humidity values of 20-30%
and winds of 10-15 mph may support a few hours of locally elevated
fire weather conditions given dry fuels.

...Heat across the interior Northwest and northern Plains will
linger into next week but should further moderate...

...Threat of heavy rain lingers near the Gulf Coast into next week
as Tropical Storm Five could impact Florida by midweek...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The large scale pattern is forecast to evolve into a more typical
summer regime after this weekend as an amplified upper trough over
the northeastern states lifts away into the Canadian Maritimes,
and the westerlies in the wake remains confined to southern Canada
and northern tier of the U.S.  Elsewhere, a seasonably strong
upper ridge will prevail over the Southwest through the period and
a weakness with possible embedded low should evolve over the
southern Plains into northern Mexico during Monday-Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Tropical Depression Five in the tropical Atlantic is
forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm and could track
across the Florida Peninsula during the middle of next week.

Latest model and ensemble guidance continues with the recent trend
toward faster ejection of the East Coast upper trough through this
weekend.  There is now good model agreement on clearing skies
across the Mid-Atlantic states on Sunday as the departing trough
brings only some showers across new England.  Behind the upper
trough, there is rather good model agreement on the subsequent
synoptic evolution across the U.S. through the remainder of the
medium range period.  The general consensus calls for the upper
ridge to flatten out into a zonal flow across the northern tier
states as the next upper trough approaches the Pacific Northwest
during the early to middle of next week.

Farther south, the model/mean blend has been indicating the
presence of a subtle subtropical trough/upper weakness over the
southern Plains to northern Mexico.  This feature tends to focus
the heaviest rains to fall in the vicinity of the western Gulf
Coast through much of the medium range period.  Meanwhile, the
National Hurricane Center continues to monitor the future progress
of Tropical Depression (T.D.) Five currently over the tropical
Atlantic.  The latest forecast track calls for the possibility of
the T.D. to intensify and track across the Florida Peninsula
midweek as a tropical storm.

The WPC medium-range forecasts were based on a general compromise
of the 12Z EC mean, 18Z GEFS, the 12Z CMC mean, together with some
of their deterministic components.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest will be less
intense than it has been over recent days but triple-digit heat is
still likely on Sunday before moderating mostly into the 90s
further into next week.  A portion of this heat will spread into
the northern Plains on Sunday before slightly cooler air arrives
behind a cold front on Monday.  Some rain showers over the
northern Rockies may offer slight relief to the heat but they will
do little to ease the growing drought concern over much of the
western U.S.  During midweek, a low pressure wave developing near
the Montana-Canadian border could help to focus areas of heavier
rainfall across the northern Plains but confidence in the
specifics is relatively low at this time.  Farther south, some
late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are likely each
day over the central to southern Rockies through the medium range
period.

Across the Northeast into the Mid-Atlantic, clearing skies behind
the departing upper trough will help promote another heat wave to
build on Monday and continue through midweek ahead of a cold
front.  Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected to
develop ahead of the front across the Great Lakes before moving
into parts of the Northeast.

Farther south, the trailing cold front from the departing upper
trough is expected to stall near the Gulf Coast on Sunday with
areas of moderate to heavy rainfall to the south of the front.
With time the heaviest rainfall should gravitate toward the
western half of the Gulf Coast and nearby areas ahead of the upper
weakness/low forecast to develop over/near Texas.  Meanwhile,
interests near the eastern Gulf should monitor the latest National
Hurricane Center products for the future progress of Tropical
Depression Five into next week.  The latest forecast track calls
for the possibility of the T.D. to intensify and track across the
Florida Peninsula midweek as a tropical storm.

Temperature-wise, clouds and rainfall over the southern half of
the Plains will keep that region below normal for highs during the
period with some minus 5-10F or so anomalies.  High pressure
behind the Gulf Coast front should provide moderately below normal
morning lows to portions of the eastern half of the country during
the weekend.

...Heat across the interior Northwest and northern Plains will
linger into next week but should further moderate...

...Threat of heavy rain lingers near the Gulf Coast into next week
as Tropical Storm Five could impact Florida by midweek...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The large scale pattern is forecast to evolve into a more typical
summer regime after this weekend as an amplified upper trough over
the northeastern states lifts away into the Canadian Maritimes,
and the westerlies in the wake remains confined to southern Canada
and northern tier of the U.S.  Elsewhere, a seasonably strong
upper ridge will prevail over the Southwest through the period and
a weakness with possible embedded low should evolve over the
southern Plains into northern Mexico during Monday-Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Tropical Depression Five in the tropical Atlantic is
forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm and could track
across the Florida Peninsula during the middle of next week.

Latest model and ensemble guidance continues with the recent trend
toward faster ejection of the East Coast upper trough through this
weekend.  There is now good model agreement on clearing skies
across the Mid-Atlantic states on Sunday as the departing trough
brings only some showers across new England.  Behind the upper
trough, there is rather good model agreement on the subsequent
synoptic evolution across the U.S. through the remainder of the
medium range period.  The general consensus calls for the upper
ridge to flatten out into a zonal flow across the northern tier
states as the next upper trough approaches the Pacific Northwest
during the early to middle of next week.

Farther south, the model/mean blend has been indicating the
presence of a subtle subtropical trough/upper weakness over the
southern Plains to northern Mexico.  This feature tends to focus
the heaviest rains to fall in the vicinity of the western Gulf
Coast through much of the medium range period.  Meanwhile, the
National Hurricane Center continues to monitor the future progress
of Tropical Depression (T.D.) Five currently over the tropical
Atlantic.  The latest forecast track calls for the possibility of
the T.D. to intensify and track across the Florida Peninsula
midweek as a tropical storm.

The WPC medium-range forecasts were based on a general compromise
of the 12Z EC mean, 18Z GEFS, the 12Z CMC mean, together with some
of their deterministic components.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The historic heat wave over the Pacific Northwest will be less
intense than it has been over recent days but triple-digit heat is
still likely on Sunday before moderating mostly into the 90s
further into next week.  A portion of this heat will spread into
the northern Plains on Sunday before slightly cooler air arrives
behind a cold front on Monday.  Some rain showers over the
northern Rockies may offer slight relief to the heat but they will
do little to ease the growing drought concern over much of the
western U.S.  During midweek, a low pressure wave developing near
the Montana-Canadian border could help to focus areas of heavier
rainfall across the northern Plains but confidence in the
specifics is relatively low at this time.  Farther south, some
late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are likely each
day over the central to southern Rockies through the medium range
period.

Across the Northeast into the Mid-Atlantic, clearing skies behind
the departing upper trough will help promote another heat wave to
build on Monday and continue through midweek ahead of a cold
front.  Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected to
develop ahead of the front across the Great Lakes before moving
into parts of the Northeast.

Farther south, the trailing cold front from the departing upper
trough is expected to stall near the Gulf Coast on Sunday with
areas of moderate to heavy rainfall to the south of the front.
With time the heaviest rainfall should gravitate toward the
western half of the Gulf Coast and nearby areas ahead of the upper
weakness/low forecast to develop over/near Texas.  Meanwhile,
interests near the eastern Gulf should monitor the latest National
Hurricane Center products for the future progress of Tropical
Depression Five into next week.  The latest forecast track calls
for the possibility of the T.D. to intensify and track across the
Florida Peninsula midweek as a tropical storm.

Temperature-wise, clouds and rainfall over the southern half of
the Plains will keep that region below normal for highs during the
period with some minus 5-10F or so anomalies.  High pressure
behind the Gulf Coast front should provide moderately below normal
morning lows to portions of the eastern half of the country during
the weekend.

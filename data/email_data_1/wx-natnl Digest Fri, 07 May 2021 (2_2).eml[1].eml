...Unsettled weather is expected across the Northern Rockies and
Northern Plains...

...Scattered showers and thunderstorms across parts of the central
and eastern U.S. will begin to focus in the Central Plains and
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys over the weekend...

Over the next couple of days, an upper-level trough/low is
forecast to move eastward into the western U.S. and push a frontal
system across the West ahead of it. These features will lead to
precipitation for the Northern Rockies into the Northern Plains.
Several inches of snow is expected in higher elevations, and some
light snow amounts could even spread into lower elevations of the
Northern Plains, given cooler than average temperatures spreading
into the northwestern and north-central U.S. after a warm Friday
across the Rockies.

Farther east, scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected
today in the Great Lakes region and Mid-Atlantic and Northeast as
a couple of weak low pressure systems move across. Scattered
thunderstorms are also possible in portions of the Plains, and
some storms could be strong there. Then, as the western
upper-level low shifts into the Northern Rockies/Northern Plains
on Saturday, a low pressure system is forecast to consolidate in
the Central Plains and thunderstorms should develop near its
associated warm front. A Slight Risk of severe weather is in place
mainly in Kansas on Saturday for tornado, wind, and large hail
threats. Additionally, a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall has
been delineated in portions of the Central Plains and Middle
Mississippi Valley, where 1 to 2 inches of rain could cause flash
flooding concerns where thunderstorms train over the same areas on
Saturday and Saturday night.

In terms of temperatures, broad upper-level troughing over the
eastern part of the U.S. will lead to below normal temperatures
there, especially in terms of highs--highs in the 50s and 60s for
the Midwest to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic would be 10 to 20
degrees below normal through the weekend. As mentioned,
temperatures will be quite warm today for the Rockies as well as
the Desert Southwest, Four Corners states, and the High Plains,
with widespread 80s. Above normal temperatures should be pushed
southward and focus across the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles on
Saturday, as much colder air filters into the north-central U.S.
with the trough approaching.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to deepen and move eastward across the
interior West into the Plains on Saturday, as a surface low deepens
across portions of the central/southern High Plains during the day
and begins to move eastward Saturday night. An expansive surface
ridge is forecast to remain in place over the eastern Pacific, with
an extension of the ridge persisting into the Pacific Northwest and
Great Basin.

...Northern CA...
Northerly surface flow is forecast to increase across portions of
northern/central CA on Saturday, as the extension of the Pacific
surface ridge increases the Sacramento to Medford pressure gradient.
Sustained winds of 15-25 mph combined with minimum RH values of
8-15% will result in elevated to potentially critical fire weather
conditions. Based on current guidance, the strongest winds are
expected across western portions of the Sacramento Valley and
adjacent higher terrain, where a critical delineation has been
introduced. Today will be the first day of potentially a 2-3 day
stretch of elevated to critical conditions across the region.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Critical meteorological conditions are expected across much of NM
into portions of west TX on Saturday, as stronger southwesterly flow
spreads eastward on conjunction with the upper trough. Sustained
winds of 20-25 mph (locally higher) are expected concurrent with
minimum RH values of 5-15%. The primary uncertainty regarding the
fire weather threat is the state of fuels across the region. While
critical wind/RH conditions will likely spread into the southern
High Plains, greenup and recent rainfall should temper the threat
with eastward extent. A critical area has been introduced where
confidence is highest in the presence of at least modestly favorable
fuels, and some expansion of the critical area is possible depending
on precipitation (or lack thereof) on D1/Friday.

...Carolinas/Virginia into the Southeast...
Dry conditions are forecast to persist into Saturday from the FL
Peninsula northward into the Carolinas and Virginia, though wind
speeds from SC southward into GA/FL are expected to be somewhat
weaker compared to D1/Friday. Somewhat stronger flow may support
sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph across parts of NC and VA,
which would support the potential for elevated fire weather
conditions. However, due to the potential for substantial rainfall
over NC/VA on D1/Friday, no elevated delineation has been made at
this time.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook RESENT 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0320 AM CDT Fri May 07 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
An amplified upper-air pattern will persist across the today. A deep
upper trough over the eastern CONUS will shift slowly eastward
today. Likewise, an upper trough will move eastward across the
Pacific Northwest, as an downstream ridge shifts eastward over the
Plains. A surface ridge will build into portions of the Northwest
and Great Basin, as a surface low moves into the northern High
Plains and a lee trough develops southward into the southern High
Plains.

...Eastern AZ/UT into Western NM/CO...
Increasing low-level flow amidst a very warm/dry airmass will result
in elevated to locally critical conditions from northern/eastern AZ
into eastern UT and western NM/CO. Surface winds are expected to
increase to 15-25 mph during the afternoon as RH drops into the
8-15% range. Some dry thunderstorm activity cannot be ruled out from
western into central NM, though uncertainty regarding coverage and
fuel receptivity precludes adding an isolated dry thunderstorm
delineation at this time.

...Eastern MT into Western ND...
Relatively dry and breezy conditions to the north/northeast of a
developing surface low across WY will result in a threat of elevated
to locally critical conditions from eastern MT into western ND.
Given the very dry airmass observed over the region on Thursday,
greater weight was given to the drier guidance, which suggests the
potential for surface winds of 15-20 mph concurrent with minimum RH
values of 15-25%. There remains some uncertainty as to how far east
the stronger winds will develop across ND, but have expanded the
Elevated area somewhat eastward given ongoing extreme drought across
the area.

...FL/GA into the Carolinas...
Dry northwesterly flow is forecast to develop in the wake of a cold
front from FL/GA into portions of the Carolinas today. Sustained
winds of 15-18 mph across the Carolinas and 12-15 mph southward into
FL, combined with anomalously dry conditions (RH potentially
dropping below 30% across much of the region), will result in
elevated to locally critical meteorological conditions this
afternoon. Fuel conditions likely vary quite a bit across the region
due to recent rainfall and differing levels of long-term
precipitation/drought, but due to the unseasonably dry airmass and
potential for winds to approach critical criteria, have opted to
include an Elevated delineation for this region.

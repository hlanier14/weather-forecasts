...Arctic air remains entrenched across the Plains and MS Valley
but should gradually moderate by early to middle of next week...

...Back-to-back winter weather events possible for the
northeastern U.S. followed by the south-central U.S to the
Northeast...

...Unsettled weather returns to the Pacific Northwest and the
interior western U.S....

Models and ensemble are in general agreement that a large dome of
arctic air will remain entrenched across the northern and central
U.S. into the weekend as the center of a meandering polar vortex
begins to slide eastward across the Great Lakes.  Despite this
general agreement, models have continued to make further
adjustments to important shortwave energies that rotate around the
vortex.  The GFS has backed off on the amounts upper-level
vorticity ejecting across the central Plains, resulting in less
robust frontal wave development over the Great Lakes later in the
weekend.  The ECMWF on the other hand, has slowed down the
eastward progression of the polar vortex, resulting in a
better-defined surface inverted trough across the Great Lakes.
Thus, both models have come into better agreement with each other
as a winter weather event appears to be in the offing for the
northeastern U.S. through the weekend.  This is in response to
frontal wave developments across the Southeast where a decent rain
event can be expected near the coast.

Meanwhile, a couple of low pressure systems from the Pacific are
forecast to move steadily from northwest to southeast across the
western U.S. during the medium-range period.  They will likely
bring a couple of rounds of mountain snows and valley rains from
the Pacific Northwest toward the Great Basin and the central to
southern Rockies. The first 500 mb wave is forecast to weaken in a
confluent flow as it ejects onto the Plains.  The second wave
crossing the Southwest on Sunday will then move east across the
southern Plains on Monday and into the MS Valley on Tuesday, and
will likely lead to low pressure development in the Gulf of
Mexico.  There is considerable run-to-run model variability
regarding this system.  Nevertheless, model consensus has been
trending toward a faster northeastward motion of this system
across the Southeast early next week.  There continues to be good
model signals for a large swath of snow and/or ice to extend from
the south-central U.S. to the Northeast early next week as the
arctic high pressure system retreats into eastern Canada.

With the arctic high pressure system remains in firm control, many
cold temperature records will be likely down the Plains and into
the lower to mid MS Valley this weekend to early next week.
Record lows/low maxima should be most numerous on Sunday before
the airmass gradually moderates early next week.

Models continue to signal periods of snow through the weekend
across the ranges of WA/OR, southern ID, WY, northern CA, northern
NV and UT.
On Sunday, the southwest trough is forecast to produce snows in
the ranges of AZ/UT/NM/CO.  By early next week, snows should wind
down in the southern Rockies but will likely redevelop in the
mountains of western WA/OR as the next system approaches from the
northeast Pacific Ocean.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 18Z GFS/GEFS, together with a
smaller contribution from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean and the 01Z NBM.
Mostly ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7 given the
increasing model uncertainties.

...Significant ice storm likely today and Thursday from the
Mid-Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley...

...Heavy snow possible across the Pacific Northwest on Thursday
and may extend into the lowlands of Washington and Oregon...

...Bitter arctic air to remain entrenched across the central U.S.
through the rest of this week while slowing expanding southward...

A very cold and active weather pattern is set to continue across
the country to end the first full week of February. Two storm
systems swinging underneath a bitter arctic airmass will lead to a
plethora of winter weather hazards. The first system worth
mentioning is already producing freezing rain/drizzle across
portions of the Mid-Mississippi Valley. A stationary front draped
across the Tennessee Valley and Southern Plains, combined with a
strong, cold high pressure system located to the north will allow
for a significant widespread ice storm from northern Arkansas to
Kentucky. Throughout the day today, precipitation is expected to
expand in coverage and last through Thursday as waves of freezing
rain move parallel to the stalled frontal boundary. Total ice
accretion could exceed a quarter inch from the Ozarks to the I-64
corridor in eastern Kentucky. Ice accumulation exceeding a half
inch is possible in some locations. This amount of ice will likely
lead to hazardous travel conditions, power outages, and scattered
tree damage. As arctic air rushes in behind the winter storm,
residents in these areas will contend with bitterly cold
temperatures and wind chills. Further northeast, multiple rounds
of light snow will be found from the Ohio Valley and Central
Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic through Friday. The highest
snowfall totals of around 6 to 12 inches will be found across the
mountains of far western Maryland and West Virginia. Otherwise, a
general 3 to 6 inches of snow is expected across portions of
northern Virginia, much of Maryland, Washington D.C., and
Delaware. On the warm side of the system throughout the Southeast,
showers and thunderstorms could lead to an inch or two of rain
through Friday. Isolated flooding will be a concern across the
Southern Appalachians on Thursday and Friday.

Impactful winter weather is also a possibility across the Pacific
Northwest beginning on Thursday. A low pressure system is forecast
to enter southern Oregon Thursday evening while simultaneously
interacting with very cold air draining into the region. This
combination may lead to not only heavy snow across the typical
mountainous locations, but in the lowlands as well. Snowfall
accumulation will be possible in both Portland and Seattle, but
exact amounts are uncertain at this time. Winter Storm Watches
have been posted across the area.

Meanwhile, the arctic airmass located over the north-central U.S.
is not leaving anytime soon and is actually forecast to slowly
expand over the next few days. High temperatures 20 to 40 degrees
below average will cover a widespread area today from nearly the
entire Great Plains to the Great Lakes. By Friday these cold
temperatures could ooze southward to the Gulf Coast and as far
east as the Lower Mississippi Valley. Temperatures will also make
a nosedive across the Northwest, where several daily records could
fall. Wind Chill Advisories and Wind Chill Warnings remain in
effect and stretch from Montana to the U.P. of Michigan. Light
wind combined with subzero temperatures could make it feel as cold
as -50 degrees in some spots. This bitter cold can be dangerous
and lead to frostbite in less than 10 minutes. Be sure to plan
ahead and dress appropriately if spending time outdoors

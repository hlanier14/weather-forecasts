Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1156 AM CDT Wed Apr 28 2021

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

Modified the northeastern extent of the elevated area in West Texas
based on the current position of the cold front. Otherwise, no
additional changes.

..Bentley.. 04/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CDT Wed Apr 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
Scattered showers and thunderstorms have brought beneficial rainfall
to portions of the Southwest over the past 24 hours, and additional
rain chances are expected through the day today across most of New
Mexico and west Texas. However, a few areas of the southern High
Plains remain dry, particularly over the Trans Pecos region of
southwest Texas. Increasing winds this afternoon will support a
regional fire weather concern. Further north, surface high pressure
will continue to build over the Pacific Northwest, driving a weak
cold front southeastward across the northern Plains.

...Trans Pecos...
An upper-level trough remains in place over northwest Mexico and
will gradually translate east through the day. Strong mid and
upper-level flow will reside over the southern Plains today, and
surface pressure falls will maintain a weak low over central TX.
Westerly downslope winds will increase to 15-25 mph behind a dryline
draped to the south of the low. Frequent gusts up to 30 mph will be
possible, and RH reductions into the 10-20% range appear likely. A
few locations may see critical conditions, but a slight influx of
boundary-layer moisture will make widespread elevated conditions
more likely. The elevated risk area has been trimmed to exclude
regions that have recently received rainfall from early-morning
thunderstorms, and additional refinements may be needed if
convection develops further south towards the Fort Stockton, TX
area.

...Northern Plains...
A cold front is forecast to progress from eastern MT into the
western Dakotas this afternoon. Dry air moving in behind the front,
along with weak cold advection, will help relative humidity values
fall into the 20-25% range. Breezy post-frontal winds will be
sustained between 15-20 mph and should support a few hours of
elevated conditions. Scattered light showers are possible along the
front across south-central ND, which may limit the duration of the
fire weather concern. Recent reports from Montana indicate that
fuels are mainly receptive across the northeastern portion of the
state. As such, the risk area has been adjusted to highlight the
area with the highest probability of sustained elevated conditions
over receptive fuels.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 28 2021

SYNOPSIS: A low amplitude pattern is likely over the U.S. during week-2,
although there is significant model uncertainty regarding the timing and
strength of surface low pressure systems expected to impact the eastern CON=
US
during the week. Such uncertainty makes it difficult to forecast specific
hazards, but generally parts of the Southwest and Gulf Coast are expected t=
o
be
especially warm and there is increased potential for heavy rainfall through=
out
parts of the eastern U.S. associated with convection.



HAZARDS

No hazards are depicted in today's outlook as probabilities are not
anticipated
to reach pre-defined criteria during the forecast period at this time.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY MAY 01 - WEDNESDAY MAY 05:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=

FOR THURSDAY MAY 06 - WEDNESDAY MAY 12: The week-2 pattern is expected to
feature a weak amplitude trough/ridge pattern over the CONUS, with the
exception of a moderately strong shortwave that is forecast to move through
the
eastern U.S. during the middle of the week. There is significant model
discrepancy regarding the timing and amplitude of the shortwave during the
week. The 06Z GEFS has a higher amplitude trough over the eastern CONUS tha=

the 00Z ECMWF during the middle of week-2. Either way, there are likely be
localized pockets of heavy rainfall along the front that accompanies the
shortwave. However, there isn't enough confidence of rainfall exceeding 1 i=
nch
per 24 hour period to warrant an associated hazard on the map at this time.



The low amplitude pattern is forecast to return as soon as the shortwave
shifts
out to sea. Such low amplitude patterns are common during the warm season a=
s
the general circulation spins down, resulting in weak baroclinicity through=
out
the midlatitudes. Such an environment is conducive to convectively driven
precipitation, which is especially difficult to forecast on the Week-2
timescales due to its small spatial and temporal scales.



Above average temperatures are favored underneath the mid-level ridge for m=
ost
of the country. Some of these temperatures, particularly in Texas and the
southeastern U.S. will likely be above their 85th climatological percentile=
.
However, the temperatures are favored to remain below hazardous thresholds =
so
there is little concern for the potential of hazardous heat. Such warmth co=
uld
exacerbate the potential for wildfires in the Southwest, so interested part=
ies
are advised to follow their local NWS forecasts carefully.

...Weekend heavy rainfall/convection threat from southern Texas to
western/central Gulf Coast...
...North-central to east-central heavy rainfall/convection threat
early next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Models and ensembles have come into agreement since yesterday
regarding an upper low/trough forecast to exit northern Mexico
into the southern Plains during the weekend.  The GFS/GEFS
exhibited the most notable change by significantly pulling back
the eastward progression of this system in much better agreement
with the ECMWF and CMC, which raised confidence in a heavy
rain/thunderstorm threat from southern Texas to western/central
Gulf Coast through this weekend.  Meanwhile, confidence is also
increasing for an area of enhanced precipitation across the
northern to central High Plains Sunday and Monday with the arrival
of an upper trough from the Pacific Northwest.

Farther north, there continues to be a general model trend for a
more progressive northern stream flow across the northern tier
states.  This will tend to sharpen a wavy front which will likely
linger across the Midwest to the Northeast early next week as a
ridge will tend to remain in place over the Southeast.  Some of
the moisture from the western Gulf Coast region will likely be
drawn northeastward to merge with the sharp front in the North.

The WPC product suite was derived from a composite blend of the 00
UTC ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS and some contribution from the 00Z
Canadian/CMC mean, with increasing usage of the ensemble means
toward Day 7. Recent GFS/GEFS runs trended in this direction, but
were more progressive overall until finally the latest 00 UTC
runs.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The medium-range period will begin with subsiding strong winds
over the Northeast as a deep low moves further away into the
Canadian Maritimes.  Meanwhile, confidence is increasing for
slow-moving southern stream troughing to support heavy rainfall
and strong convection from Texas to the lower MS Valley this
weekend--fueled by deepening Gulf of Mexico moisture and
instability.  The system is expected to shear northeastward into
early next week but a swath of enhanced rainfall is possible
across the east-central and then eastern U.S. with lead return
flow toward a sharp and wavy front across the Midwest to the
Northeast.

Much above normal temperatures will overspread much of the central
Rockies to the northern and central Plains early this weekend.
Upstream, an approaching Pacific trough aloft and leading cold
front will start a pronounced cooling trend by later in the
weekend and focus generally modest precipitation from the Pacific
Northwest to north-central Rockies, with a threat of terrain
enhanced spring snows.  Steady system progression and lead impulse
ejections may combine with north-central Plains
cyclogenesis/frontogenesis and TX dryline formation to favor an
emerging pattern for ample Plains convection by early next week
that should shift eastward along the sharp and wavy front from the
east-central U.S. to the Northeast.  Expect above normal warm
sector temperatures for the East and the South as cooler air
envelops the northern to central Plains.  Meanwhile, a warming
trend is expected for the West Coast into the Desert Southwest.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Wed Apr 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

No changes. Light to moderate rainfall is expected tonight across a
large portion of the area which may see elevated to critical fire
weather conditions tomorrow. Therefore, no highlights will be added
at this time. Any areas which do not receive much precipitation will
still be susceptible to fire spread, but the exact details regarding
where that may be are not obvious at this time.

..Bentley.. 04/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CDT Wed Apr 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough currently residing over northwest Mexico is
forecast to gradually shift into the southern Plains by late
Thursday. As this occurs, a cold front will push southward along the
southern High Plains and usher in slightly cooler temperatures and
northerly winds. Additionally, this will bring rainfall chances to
portions of the Southwest, including the southern High Plains where
fuels have been dry. However, areas along the northeast New
Mexico/Texas border that do not see rainfall may experience a
localized fire weather concern within the post-frontal air mass.

...Northwest New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle...
Northerly winds are expected to increase into the 15-20 mph range
along the southern High Plains in the wake of an early-morning cold
frontal passage. Strong mid-level winds within the cold advection
may support wind gusts between 25-30 mph during the day. Although
there is some spread in guidance, dry air advecting into the region
and patchy clouds may support RH reductions down to 20% (and
elevated fire weather conditions) across northeast NM and the
western TX Panhandle. However, recent guidance has shown reasonable
agreement in wetting rainfall occurring over this region over the
next 24 hours, and possibly into Thursday morning. This would help
mitigate fuel readiness and limit any fire weather concerns. An
elevated fire weather concern may evolve by Thursday afternoon, but
this will be conditional on the coverage of wetting rainfall. An
elevated risk area may need to be introduced in subsequent updates.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed April 28 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 04 - 08 2021

Dynamical model solutions are in only fair agreement regarding a transient
500-hPa flow pattern across the forecast domain during the outlook period.
Troughing over Alaska extends down the west coast of North America. There i=
s
some uncertainty among ensemble members and between different model solutio=
ns
on the extent to which troughing extends to the northwestern CONUS. Both th=
e
ECMWF and Canadian ensembles depict ridging in the central Pacific, which
favors more amplified troughing downstream, compared to the GEFS. Ridging i=
s
predicted over the Southwest and central CONUS by most model solutions. Wea=
k
troughing is centered over the Great Lakes region in the latest ECMWF ensem=
ble
mean and ECMWF high resolution operational model run, while a deeper trough=
 is
forecast over the eastern CONUS in the latest GEFS ensemble mean. The Canad=
ian
ensemble mean is similar to the ECMWF ensemble mean over the western CONUS =
and
Alaska, while predicting weaker anomalies over the eastern CONUS. The ECMWF
ensemble mean was given the greatest weight in the 500-hPa manual blend, du=
e
to
good agreement with the 0Z ECMWF and 6Z GFS high resolution runs, and
consistent with yesterdays forecast.

The low amplitude pattern featuring mean Pacific flow and positive height
anomalies over much of the western CONUS favors increased probabilities for
near to above normal temperatures across most of the CONUS, outside of part=
s
of
the Pacific Northwest. This is consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecas=
t
tools. Probabilities for below normal temperatures are increased across muc=
h
of
southern Alaska, and extending into the Pacific Northwest underneath the
influence of troughing. Near normal temperatures are favored for much of th=
e
northeastern CONUS, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast temperature tools a=
re
inconsistent.

Probabilities of below normal precipitation are elevated for much of the
south-central and western CONUS due to weak mid-level flow. Weaker troughin=
g
along the west coast compared to yesterdays model forecasts leads to a
forecast of enhanced near normal precipitation probabilities for parts of t=
he
Pacific Northwest and northern tier. Increased troughing over the east lead=
s
to
a more active downstream pattern, favoring above normal precipitation acros=
s
much of the eastern CONUS, from the Great Lakes region into the Northeast a=
nd
extending southward to the central Gulf Coast. Across Alaska, enhanced
westerly
flow resulting from troughing over the Bering Sea favors increased chances =
for
above normal precipitation across the southern Mainland, the Aleutians, and
the
Panhandle, as depicted in the consolidation forecast tool. Near normal
precipitation chances are favored for the remainder of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 25% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to fa=
ir
model height forecast and temperature and precipitation tool agreement, off=
set
by a transient, low amplitude pattern across much of the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 06 - 12 2021

Weak, transient mid-level flow is predicted across North America throughout
the
week-2 period resulting in a somewhat uncertain forecast. The ECMWF and
Canadian ensembles depict weakly positive height anomalies across much of t=
he
interior CONUS, while the GEFS predicts negative height anomalies over the
northeastern CONUS. Continued ridging in the Central Pacific in the ECMWF a=
nd
Canadian ensemble means, leads to more troughing near to the West Coast of =
the
CONUS. The manual height blend for the 8-14 day period depicts near normal
heights for the northwestern CONUS and most of Alaska, with positive height
anomalies over the east-central CONUS and some negative height anomalies ne=
ar
the west coast of the Alaska Mainland.

Increased probabilities for above normal temperatures are predicted for mos=
t
of
the CONUS from Southern California eastward across the Central and Southern
Plains to the mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. Troughing is predicted to
shift eastward into the Pacific Northwest compared to the 6-10 day period,
resulting in enhanced probabilities for below normal temperatures. Continue=
d
enhanced troughing across Alaska favors increased probabilities for near to
below normal temperatures across most of the state. Above normal temperatur=
es
are likely over the Aleutians due to a greater influence from the ridging t=
o
the south, and across the northeastern Mainland, consistent with the GEFS a=
nd
ECMWF reforecast tools.

The 8-14 day precipitation forecast indicates increased probabilities for n=
ear
to below normal precipitation across the southern half of the CONUS, and
enhanced chances for near to above normal precipitation across much of the
northern tier. Increased troughing in the West favors the development of on=
e
or
more surface low pressure systems to track across the northern CONUS, bring=
ing
enhanced above normal precipitation probabilities across portions of the
Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast.
Probabilities for above normal precipitation are elevated across much of
southern Mainland Alaska, the Panhandle, and the Aleutians, consistent with
continued westerly to southwesterly mid-level flow.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered=
 on
Day 11, 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 25=
%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
fair agreement among the model circulation and precipitation forecasts, off=
set
by large differences among model temperature forecasts and increasing
uncertainty.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...Severe thunderstorms and excessive rain likely for the Southern
Plains and portions of the Mississippi Valley through at least
Friday, strong to severe thunderstorms also possible from the
Tennessee Valley to the Mid-Atlantic...

...There is a chance for record-breaking high minimum temperatures
over the East and below-average temperatures over the Southern
Rockies/Southwest into the Central High Plains...

A slow-moving front, spanning from the northern Mid-Atlantic
westward to Michigan and then southwest to the Central/Southern
Plains, will be the focus for organized thunderstorms through the
end of the week. SPC has identified portions of the Texas/Oklahoma
to southern Illinois/western Kentucky, as well as areas adjacent
to Lake Erie, as having at least a Slight Risk for severe storms.
The main hazards with the severe thunderstorms will be frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes. Much of this same area will likely have excessive rain
and increasing flooding potential - WPC has a Moderate Risk area
for extreme northeast Texas to northwest Arkansas with a broad
Slight Risk from south-central Texas to southern Indiana. The
heavy rain associated with the thunderstorms will produce numerous
areas of flash flooding over this region. Many streams may flood,
potentially affecting larger rivers. The risk for sever storms and
excessive rainfall will carry over to Friday as the front
continues to progress eastward.

In the warm sector, south of the front, there is a chance for
record-breaking high minimum temperatures over the East into
Thursday. Meanwhile, under the upper-level low over the Four
Corners Region, rain and higher elevation snow will develop over
parts of the Central/Southern Rockies and the Southwest ending on
Thursday morning.  Additionally, under the upper low, temperatures
will be 10 to 15 degrees below average on Wednesday.

...Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall possible from Central Gulf
Coast to Tennessee Valley...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue to come into better agreement
regarding an initial closed low/shortwave energy forecast to
weaken as it lifts from the southern Plains on Sunday into the
Northeast by Tuesday. As has been the case for a few days now, the
GFS/GEFS continue to be just a hair faster than the rest of the
guidance, however a general model compromise for this system
presents a good starting point.

The next system drops through the Western U.S. Sunday-Monday and
should continue east/northeastward through the Plains into the
Eastern U.S. Tuesday-Thursday. Models show good consensus the
first half of the period, but begin to diverge on the details and
timing by mid week. The ECMWF/CMC are more amplified both with
this trough and western U.S. ridging, while the GFS/GEFS favor
amplification of the trough a day or so later as additional
northern stream energy drops in from the northern Rockies. WPC
favored a blend more towards the ECMWF/CMC/ECENS which also fits
well with WPC continuity.

By day 6-7, a deep closed low should move into the northeast
Pacific sending a cyclone towards the Pacific Northwest coast.
Models generally agree on the presence of such a system, but
disagree on evolution/timing at later time frames. As such, prefer
a blend towards the ensemble means by the end of the forecast
period.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Gulf of Mexico moisture and instability ahead of the initial
trough/closed low over the Southern Plains on Sunday will fuel
numerous showers and thunderstorms across parts of the central
Gulf Coast states and into the Tennessee Valley Sunday-Monday.
Confidence is increasing in heavy rainfall potential in this
region, some of which has already seen above normal precipitation
over the past few weeks. This would likely increase the flooding
threat as well. The system is expected to shear northeastward into
early/mid next week with a swath of enhanced rainfall possible
farther northern into the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.

The next system into the Western U.S. should support mountain
snows across the Colorado Rockies and organized rain into the
central High Plains Sunday-Monday. As the troughing amplifies
across the Plains on Tuesday, moderate to heavy rainfall should
develop along and ahead of a cold front. Again, the threat seems
to be centered over much of the same region as the previous system
-- central Gulf Coast/Tennessee Valley/lower Ohio Valley Tuesday
into Wednesday.

The Eastern U.S. should stay above normal in terms of temperatures
much of the period ahead and south of a wavy frontal boundary. The
Western U.S. system will spread below to much below normal
temperatures from the Rockies into the Plains Monday and Tuesday,
moderating as the system moves eastward. Meanwhile, much of the
Western Coast to Desert Southwest will see a warming trend
Monday-Thursday as upper level ridging builds aloft.

...Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall possible from Central Gulf
Coast to Tennessee Valley...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue to come into better agreement
regarding an initial closed low/shortwave energy forecast to
weaken as it lifts from the southern Plains on Sunday into the
Northeast by Tuesday. As has been the case for a few days now, the
GFS/GEFS continue to be just a hair faster than the rest of the
guidance, however a general model compromise for this system
presents a good starting point.

The next system drops through the Western U.S. Sunday-Monday and
should continue east/northeastward through the Plains into the
Eastern U.S. Tuesday-Thursday. Models show good consensus the
first half of the period, but begin to diverge on the details and
timing by mid week. The ECMWF/CMC are more amplified both with
this trough and western U.S. ridging, while the GFS/GEFS favor
amplification of the trough a day or so later as additional
northern stream energy drops in from the northern Rockies. WPC
favored a blend more towards the ECMWF/CMC/ECENS which also fits
well with WPC continuity.

By day 6-7, a deep closed low should move into the northeast
Pacific sending a cyclone towards the Pacific Northwest coast.
Models generally agree on the presence of such a system, but
disagree on evolution/timing at later time frames. As such, prefer
a blend towards the ensemble means by the end of the forecast
period.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Gulf of Mexico moisture and instability ahead of the initial
trough/closed low over the Southern Plains on Sunday will fuel
numerous showers and thunderstorms across parts of the central
Gulf Coast states and into the Tennessee Valley Sunday-Monday.
Confidence is increasing in heavy rainfall potential in this
region, some of which has already seen above normal precipitation
over the past few weeks. This would likely increase the flooding
threat as well. The system is expected to shear northeastward into
early/mid next week with a swath of enhanced rainfall possible
farther northern into the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.

The next system into the Western U.S. should support mountain
snows across the Colorado Rockies and organized rain into the
central High Plains Sunday-Monday. As the troughing amplifies
across the Plains on Tuesday, moderate to heavy rainfall should
develop along and ahead of a cold front. Again, the threat seems
to be centered over much of the same region as the previous system
-- central Gulf Coast/Tennessee Valley/lower Ohio Valley Tuesday
into Wednesday.

The Eastern U.S. should stay above normal in terms of temperatures
much of the period ahead and south of a wavy frontal boundary. The
Western U.S. system will spread below to much below normal
temperatures from the Rockies into the Plains Monday and Tuesday,
moderating as the system moves eastward. Meanwhile, much of the
Western Coast to Desert Southwest will see a warming trend
Monday-Thursday as upper level ridging builds aloft.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0105 AM CDT Thu Apr 29 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
A cold front currently draped over the Plains into northern Mexico
will continue to slowly push south and east through the day. In its
wake, dry and breezy northwesterly flow will overspread most of the
Plains. This may introduce a few localized fire weather concerns,
but recent rainfall will mitigate most concerns over the Southwest
and the central and southern Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Recent radar precipitation estimates suggest that portions of the
western OK/TX Panhandles and far northeast NM received little
rainfall over the past 24 hours. Only light and isolated rain is
expected through mid-day for this region, so antecedent dry fuels
may not be overly influenced by recent precipitation. North to
northeasterly winds are forecast to increase by late afternoon to
15-20 mph and may see occasional gusts upwards of 30-35 mph as
mid-level flow strengthens in response to an increasing pressure
gradient. Clearing skies will help drive boundary-layer mixing and
RH reductions into the 20-25% range. As such, elevated fire weather
conditions are expected where fuels remain dry (though elevated
wind/RH combinations may occur where fuels have received wetting
rains). Further refinements are possible as additional precipitation
reports come in through mid-morning and guidance comes into better
agreement regarding the spatial extent of the threat.

...Central Plains...
Breezy northwesterly winds at 15-20 mph are expected to overspread
the central Plains this afternoon. Wind gusts up to 25-30 mph are
possible, and mostly clear skies will help drive diurnal heating as
well as RH reductions down to 30% for most locations. A few more
aggressive solutions suggest RH values may fall to around 25% across
southeast NE and northeast KS where fuels have been drying after
several days of limited rainfall. This could lead to a few hours of
elevated fire weather conditions, though confidence in the duration
and coverage of the threat remains too low to introduce a risk area.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge over the West Coast is forecast to shift
eastward over the next 24 hours, and should be over the Rockies by
Friday morning. Most guidance indicates a mid-level perturbation
will propagate from southwest Canada into the northern Rockies
within the mean northwesterly flow. This feature will augment low
and mid-level pressure gradients and yield strong winds across much
of Montana and into the western Dakotas. Elsewhere, recent rainfall
will limit additional fire weather concerns. A regional fire weather
threat may evolve over the Carolinas, but this will be conditional
on rainfall over the next 24 hours.

...Northeast Montana...
Limited precipitation over the past two weeks has allowed 1-hour and
10-hour fuels to cure across much of northeast MT and into the
western Dakotas. These fuels will support a fire weather threat as
west/northwest winds increase to near 20 mph across the northern
High Plains. Although high cloud cover may limit diurnal heating to
some degree, downslope warming and drying will support sufficient
boundary-layer mixing to allow frequent 30-40 mph wind gusts.
Relative-humidity reductions into the teens are likely, and may fall
into the single digits across northeast MT. These conditions should
support a considerable fire weather threat, and critical conditions
may extent further west to the lee of the Rockies (though improving
fuel conditions with westward extent will limit the fire weather
potential).

...Carolinas...
Many locations across eastern NC and SC remain very dry with ERC
values beginning to climb above seasonal normals. A cold front is
forecast to push through the region late Thursday into early Friday,
which should allow for breezy and dry northwesterly winds by the
afternoon hours.  Relative humidity values are expected to fall near
30%, but may fall into the 20s where sufficient daytime heating and
mixing can occur. While elevated fire weather conditions are
possible, rain chances associated with the frontal passage may
mitigate fuel readiness. A risk area may need to be introduced in
future updates if little to no rainfall occurs and fuels remain dry
by Friday morning.

...There is a Slight risk of severe thunderstorms from parts of
the northern Mid-Atlantic to the Tennessee Valley/Southern
Appalachians through Friday morning...

...There is a Slight risk of excessive rainfall over the ArkLaTex
region through Friday morning.

...There is a chance for record-breaking high minimum temperatures
over the East and below-average temperatures over the Southern
Rockies/Southern High Plains...

A slow-moving front, spanning from the Northeast westward to the
Ohio Valley and then southwest to the Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley and the Southern Plains will move off the East and Gulf
Coast by Saturday.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along
and ahead of the boundary from the Northeast to the lower
Mississippi Valley through early Friday morning.  The SPC has
issued a Slight risk of severe thunderstorms from parts of the
northern Mid-Atlantic to the Tennessee Valley/Southern
Appalachians through Friday morning.  The main hazards with the
severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, high wind gusts,
hail, and possible tornadoes.  The thunderstorms will have heavy
rain associated with them. The WPC has issued a Slight risk of
excessive rainfall over the ArkLaTex region through Friday
morning.  The heavy rain will produce scattered areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams being the
most vulnerable.

Rain will develop over the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic on Friday
morning, extending into parts of the Ohio Valley during the
afternoon on Friday. The rain will end over the Mid-Atlantic/Ohio
Valley by Friday evening.  Wet snow will develop over parts of
Upstate New York on Friday night. The rain will taper off over New
England by Saturday morning as light snow moves into the higher
elevations of Northern New England.  Also, on Friday, the showers
and thunderstorms will continue over parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley and the Southern Plains through Saturday
morning.  In the warm sector, south of the front, there is a
chance for record-breaking high minimum temperatures over the
Mid-Atlantic/Ohio Valley on Thursday morning.

Meanwhile, an upper-level low over the Southern Rockies will move
into Northern Mexico on Thursday.  The cold air associated with
the upper-level low will allow temperatures to be 10 to 20 degrees
below average over parts of the Southern Rockies/Southern High
Plains.  Elsewhere, a front moving onshore over the Pacific
Northwest on Friday afternoon will produce light rain over parts
of the Northwest overnight Friday.

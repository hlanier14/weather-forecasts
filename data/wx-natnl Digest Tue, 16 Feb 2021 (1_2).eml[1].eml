Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0948 AM CST Mon Feb 15 2021

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Morning surface observations show
the driest relative humidity values around 25-45% across portions of
the lower CO river valley where winds are weak. Guidance continues
to suggest that winds will struggle to remain sustained above 15 mph
over this region, which will limit the fire weather potential.

..Moore.. 02/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1221 AM CST Mon Feb 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
Cold air will be in place across much of the U.S. as broad
upper-level troughing develops throughout the period. A few areas of
dry conditions are possible in the Southwest, but winds should
remain weak given the nebulous surface pressure gradient. Across the
U.S. fire weather concerns will remain quite low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1221 PM CST Mon Feb 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are necessary. Recent guidance continues to show
the potential for elevated wind and RH combinations across the lower
CO river valley and into southern AZ (as outlined in the previous
discussion below). Locally stronger winds up to 25 mph are possible
and may briefly support critical wind/RH thresholds. However, these
conditions remain most likely over desert terrain where fuels are
sparse. Furthermore, recent fuel analyses suggests that the fuels
that are in place are largely unreceptive with ERC values near
seasonal normal.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1224 AM CST Mon Feb 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad upper-level troughing across the U.S. will amplify slightly
within the Southwest and southern High Plains. A strong belt of
mid-level winds will persist across the West Coast into the lower
Colorado River Valley. At the surface, high pressure will continue
to remain situated in the Plains. With the approach of a shortwave
trough, weak surface low development in the Southwest and eventually
the southern High Plains will help to enhance surface winds. Dry and
windy conditions are possible in the lower Colorado River Valley
ahead of a southeastward-moving cold front. RH may fall as low as
15% with winds increasing to 15-20 mph during the afternoon. With
the conditions mostly occurring within the desert areas, only
locally elevated fire weather concerns are expected.

...Much Below Normal Temperatures Across the Central U.S. Continue
This Week...
...Another Storm System Expected for Deep South to Northeast and
New England Later This Week...
...Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies Becoming Unsettled Later
This Week and This Weekend...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...
A highly amplified upper level pattern across the CONUS to start
the period will gradually flatten into this weekend though with
shortwave energy coming in from the Pacific at times, some form of
troughing is expected over the central U.S. during the whole
period. Overall though, the Arctic blast and much below normal
temperatures are forecast to moderate while attention turns to yet
another deepening low forecast to track from the Gulf Coast toward
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast late this week, which could bring a
variety of hazards including heavy rain, wintry mix, and heavy
snow. Finally, a series of frontal passages and Pacific moisture
for the Northwest into the Northern Rockies will keep the weather
active with several opportunities for heavy mountain snow and
lower elevation rain.

In the large scale sense, the latest guidance showed very good
agreement at 500 mb through the period with some of the typical
timing differences evolving by day 5 through day 7. The exception
was the UKMET which was a bit displaced with the Pacific Northwest
to Northern Plains energy and also flatter compared to the
slightly more amplified ECMWF/CMC/GFS. The GFS looked to be a bit
too fast/ahead of the consensus and more agreeable CMC/ECMWF (tied
closer to the ECENS mean) so for this cycle, the WPC blend
incorporated mostly a ECMWF/GFS/CMC blend early on followed by a
higher amount of the ECENS for day 6/7 to handle some of the
forecast uncertainty. But overall forecast agreement was average
to slightly above average for the synoptic pattern.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...
A storm system is expected to evolve near the Gulf Coast then
track up through the East Coast toward New England Thursday into
Friday, bringing with it a variety of hazards including potential
severe weather and heavy rainfall to portions of the Southeast. On
the northern side of the system, interactions with a cold airmass
in place and Canadian high pressure to the north will present a
threat of snow and wintry mix from portions of the Arklatex
through the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and much of the Northeast
and New England. Details on the transition zones between
rain/wintry mix/snow will be fine-tuned as the event draws near
but widespread travel impacts and hazardous conditions are
possible.

Behind this system, another couple fronts reaching the Northwest
between Thursday and Saturday should bring the potential for
additional focused rainfall along coastal portions of
Washington/Oregon with heavy mountain snows in the
Washington/Oregon Cascades and northern Rockies. Meaningful
rain/high elevation snow may extend into parts of northern
California as well.

Temperatures will remain much below normal at the start of the
period (Thursday) through about Saturday for much of the central
U.S. and portions of the East Coast in the wake of the late week
system. Departures from normal as much as 20-35F will be possible
for some areas. Meanwhile, out West, slightly above normal
temperatures are forecast for portions of the Southwest this
weekend into early next week. South Florida and southern Arizona
will be the warm spots throughout the whole period for the CONUS
with daytime highs in the 70s to lower 80s.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 15 2021

SYNOPSIS: Hazardous weather looks to be largely Biden its time during Week-2,
as an evolution towards a warmer and quieter pattern for the Lower-48 looks to
Trump the Arctic outbreak experienced by much of the country during early to
mid-February. Despite the shift to warmer conditions, some cold air may Pierce
the Pacific Northwest late in the period tied to the development of mid-level
low pressure. Mid-level low pressure is also forecast across Alaska during the
first portion of the period, thus unlikely to Grant a reprieve from the cold.
Particular concern for much below-normal temperatures in Alaska exists for
portions of the Bush and interior early in the period, where -40 degree
temperatures appear likely.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of interior
mainland Alaska, Tue-Wed, Feb 23-24.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for much of mainland Alaska,
Tue-Sat, Feb 23-27.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Northern California, Fri-Mon,
Feb
26-Mar 1.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY FEBRUARY 18 - MONDAY FEBRUARY 22:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!ueTkAjy4aL0FREhAjhKmkH5E4shFotUdBIui3HuKSAIM8Wb-7t2QSOQKmrGI49jFRvpuLYmC$

FOR TUESDAY FEBRUARY 23 - MONDAY MARCH 01: Recovery from the outbreak of
Arctic
air experienced by much of the country during early to mid February looks to
be
well underway as Week-2 begins. Forecast minimum and maximum temperature
anomalies on the 22nd from the Weather Prediction Center are generally near-
to
above-normal across the CONUS, with some areas warming up 20 degrees F or more
from four days prior. This warmer evolution across the Lower 48 states aligns
closely with expectations from the extratropical wavetrain emanating from deep
convection shifting from the West Pacific back toward the Maritime Continent.
This evolution appears tied to equatorial Rossby wave activity in the tropics
and what could be a new Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) event. Should the MJO
form and propagate toward the Date Line, this could see a resumption of a
cooler pattern over the CONUS begin to materialize as cooler air spills out of
the Canadian Prairies into the Plains during Week-3.



This westward shift in tropical convection historically favors more mid-level
troughing potential over the northeast Pacific, which is also supported by
model guidance as late February approaches. This setup yields a slight risk of
much below-normal temperatures building eastward with time from the Pacific
Northwest and Northern California into the Great Basin and Northern Rockies
during Feb 26-Mar 1. The GEFS brings this cold in more rapidly than the ECMWF
ensembles, although neither exhibit bitterly cold signals like much of the
country saw during February. Greatest concern is likely for the Northern
Rockies, as the Pacific air limits variability closer to the coastline but
climatological variances grow as one moves inland. Also worth mentioning is
that the pattern for the northern half of the West Coast appears relatively
wet
throughout Week-2, but more in a sense of persistent onshore flow versus one
or
more discrete heavy precipitation events. This is borne out in the lack of
signals in atmospheric river-based guidance and reforecast guidance not
supporting anywhere seeing 2 inches or more of liquid equivalent precipitation
over a 3-day period.



With mid-level high pressure building across the southeastern CONUS during
Week-2, temperature-related concerns are nonexistent outside of the West. With
mid-level heights building over the Lower-48, the storm track is likely to be
fairly close to the Canadian border, limiting heavy precipitation potential
due
to the zonal nature of the storm track and separation from any Gulf moisture.
Similarly, wind concerns appear limited. Models hint at the possibility of lee
cyclogenesis late in the period further to the south, which could possibly tap
into Gulf moisture while crossing the eastern half of the country early in
Week-3.



Alaska is forecast to be beneath mid-level troughing at the start of the
period, with easterly winds out of the Yukon. GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
guidance show a 40-60% chance of temperatures falling below -40 across
portions
of the interior. As a result, a moderate risk of much below-normal
temperatures
is forecast across portions of the Brooks Range and immediately to its south
on
the 23rd and 24th. A broader slight risk of much below-normal temperatures is
posted across much of the interior through the 27th. Model guidance has signs
of surface cyclones in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska during the period,
but
these suffer from typical predictability concerns at the high latitudes from
run-to-run, limiting the opportunity to introduce any high wind or heavy
precipitation hazards for coastal regions. While not on the forecast map, cold
air pooling over the higher terrain could introduce some localized gap wind
potential in climatologically favorable regions (e.g Yakutat, near Kodiak
Island).

weather across parts of the southern CONUS. A major winter storm
will spread heavy snow across parts of the Midwest and interior
Northeast tonight before receding into the Northeast on Tuesday. A
wide swath of 4-8 inches of snow will fall from the Ohio Valley to
Maine while some isolated areas, particularly points downwind of
Lakes Eerie and Ontario, may get up to a foot of snow by
Wednesday. Freezing rain will be a concern for parts of the Ohio
Valley through parts of the coastal Northeast. An area of 0.1
inches of ice may accumulate from central Pennsylvania up to
southern New England and eastern Maine. Heavy rain is expected to
spread across the eastern seaboard through tomorrow afternoon.
Rainfall totals around an inch are possible across the Carolina
Piedmont and Northeast.

Troughing in the west will lead to significant snowfall over the
mountains of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies. Between
1-2 feet of snow is likely to fall over this area with the highest
peaks likely to receive 2-4 feet of snow through Wednesday.

Another system, currently in the Rockies, will move into the
Southern Plains tomorrow. This system will spread heavy snow from
the Rockies today into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday. Freezing rain will impact a swath
of land extending from eastern Texas to southwestern Tennessee
late Tuesday. Snow totals for the Central/Southern Rockies may
range between 8-12 inches with 1-2 feet possible over the highest
peaks through Tuesday. Between 4-8 inches of snow are likely to
fall over much of Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri
starting Tuesday night and extending through Wednesday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon February 15 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 21 - 25 2021

Today's model solutions depict a transitional 500-hPa pattern across much of
North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period. The AO
index,
which has been negative for most of the winter thus far, is forecast to
dramatically rise above zero prior to this outlook period. The resulting mean
500-hPa pattern reflects below normal heights across most of the higher
latitudes of the Western Hemisphere (including most of Alaska), allowing
heights to rise farther to the south across much of the southern CONUS.
Today's
manual 500-hPa height blend favors the GEFS-based solutions, due primarily to
considerations of recent skill. The resultant pattern features cyclonic 500-
hPa
flow across most of the forecast domain with an enhanced height gradient
between the high and middle latitudes.

Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are enhanced across much of Alaska
as  a lobe of the Polar Vortex and associated below normal heights are
forecast
to extend across most of the state. As troughing and below normal heights
retreat northward to higher latitudes, a dramatic warmup from current levels
is
likely across much of the north-central CONUS as the flow pattern becomes more
zonal. Farther to the south, below normal temperatures are favored for parts
of
the Southern Plains as well as parts of the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys due,
in large part, to the potential for lingering snow cover (especially early in
the period). Elsewhere, across the Southern Tier, near to above normal
temperatures are likely underneath predicted above normal heights. Conversely,
as surface high pressure builds into the Great Basin, cold air inversions are
possible, leading to slightly elevated chances of below normal temperatures
across parts of the region. Elsewhere, near normal temperatures are likely
across the northwestern CONUS underneath a moist, Pacific flow regime.

An increased pressure gradient is expected to promote enhanced Pacific flow
across the northwestern CONUS, leading to elevated chances of above normal
precipitation. Farther to the south, surface high pressure and rising 500-hPa
heights favor drier than normal conditions across the southwestern CONUS
extending eastward to the Southern and Central Plains. Conversely, above
normal
precipitation is likely across much of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, Great
Lakes, and Northeast, underneath predicted cyclonic flow. Ridging and
associated surface high pressure are expected farther to the south and east,
favoring drier than normal conditions for southern portions of the Eastern
Seaboard. Near to below normal precipitation is also favored for much of
Mainland Alaska, as cold, surface high pressure is forecast to dominate.
However, models are in good agreement in predicting mean surface low pressure
over the eastern Gulf of Alaska, leading to elevated chances of above normal
precipitation across the Panhandle and parts of the eastern Mainland.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered on
Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 25% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
a predicted transitional pattern across much of the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 23 - MAR 01, 2021

During the week-2 period, a significant 500-hPa pattern shift is forecast to
take shape across southwestern Alaska as ridging builds northward from the
Pacific and heights rise. Downstream, mean troughing is forecast to continue
to
dominate eastern Alaska and extend southward to the northwestern CONUS. In
response to this trough, ridging is forecast to develop across the
south-central and much of the eastern CONUS. However, most models are
forecasting another mean trough to be centered across the Canadian Atlantic
Provinces, which may limit the northern extent of the ridge for parts of New
England. The week-2 manual 500-hPa height blend favors the GEFS-based
solutions, consistent with the preceding 6-10 day period.

Forecast height rises lead to increased chances of above normal temperatures
across the Aleutians, Alaska Peninsula, and coastal southwestern Mainland
Alaska. Downstream troughing favors below normal temperatures for the
remainder
of Alaska extending southward across the western CONUS. Above normal
temperatures are likely for much of the remainder of the CONUS as a mean ridge
gains strength over the Southeastern CONUS. However, probabilities are
tempered
across parts of the northeastern CONUS due to the nearby mean trough predicted
over the Atlantic Provinces of Canada.

As a mean trough progresses from eastern Siberia to the western Aleutians,
increased moisture flow is likely to overspread much of western Alaska,
leading
to elevated chances of above normal precipitation. Above normal precipitation
is also likely for parts of the northwestern CONUS as well as for much of the
Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and parts of the Mississippi Valley. This is
consistent with both dynamical model guidance as well as La Nina composites.
Drier than normal conditions are likely for much of the southwestern CONUS,
the
Southern and Central High Plains, and the Southeast, as a combination of above
normal heights and surface high pressure are forecast to influence much of
these regions.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered on
Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
a forecast transitional pattern across much of the forecast domain.

FORECASTER: Scott H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

...Millions of Americans are currently under Winter Storm
Warnings, Ice Storm Warnings, Winter Storm Watches, or Winter
Weather Advisories as impactful winter weather continues from
coast-to-coast...

...Major winter storm to spread heavy snow and significant ice
accumulations from Tennessee/Ohio Valleys to the Northeast...

...Frigid Arctic air and dangerously cold wind chills to persist
in the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley through midweek...

...Severe thunderstorms, heavy rain, and warm temperatures are
expected for southern Georgia and Florida...

An active weather pattern will continue produce unprecedented
winter weather across parts of the southern CONUS. Winter Storm
Warnings/Advisories and Ice Warnings extend from eastern/southern
Texas through the Mississippi/Ohio/Tennessee Valley, Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast. A major winter storm will continue to spread heavy
snow across parts of the Midwest and interior Northeast tonight
before receding into the Northeast on Tuesday. A wide swath of 4-8
inches of snow will fall from the Ohio Valley to Maine while some
isolated areas, particularly points downwind of Lakes Eerie and
Ontario, may get up to a foot of snow by Wednesday. Freezing rain
will be a concern for parts of the Ohio Valley through parts of
the coastal Northeast. An area of 0.1 inches of ice may accumulate
from central Pennsylvania up to southern New England and eastern
Maine. Heavy rain is expected to spread across the eastern
seaboard through tomorrow afternoon. Rainfall totals around an
inch are possible across the Carolina Piedmont and Northeast.
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are likely to occur over much
of the southeast tonight. Severe thunderstorms are concern over
parts of southern Georgia and northern Florida, where a tornado
watch is in effect.

Another system, currently in the Rockies, will move into the
Southern Plains tomorrow. This system will spread heavy snow from
the Rockies today into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday. Freezing rain will impact an
aerial swath extending from eastern Texas to southwestern
Tennessee late Tuesday. Snow totals for the Central/Southern
Rockies may range between 8-12 inches with 1-2 feet possible over
the highest peaks through Tuesday. Between 4-8 inches of snow are
likely to fall over much of Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern
Missouri starting Tuesday night and extending through Wednesday.
An area of 0.25 inches of freezing rain may develop across the
eastern Texas/northern Louisiana region tomorrow. Windy conditions
will continue across the Northern/Central Plains as the pressure
gradient tightens out ahead of the aforementioned system.

Troughing in the west will lead to significant snowfall over the
mountains of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies. Between
1-2 feet of snow is likely to fall over this area with the highest
peaks likely to receive between 2-4 feet of snow through
Wednesday. Anomalously cold air will sit over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley through Wednesday before high pressure begins
to move east. Widespread hi/lo records are expected to be broken
tomorrow and Wednesday across the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley where highs and lows may reach between 40-50
degrees below average.

...Much Below Normal Temperatures Across the Central U.S. Continue
This Week...
...Another Storm System Expected for Deep South to Northeast and
New England Later This Week...
...Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies Becoming Unsettled Later
This Week and This Weekend...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...
A highly amplified upper level pattern across the CONUS to start
the period will gradually flatten into this weekend though with
shortwave energy coming in from the Pacific at times, some form of
troughing is expected over the central U.S. during the whole
period. Overall though, the Arctic blast and much below normal
temperatures are forecast to moderate while attention turns to yet
another deepening low forecast to track from the Gulf Coast toward
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast late this week, which could bring a
variety of hazards including heavy rain, wintry mix, and heavy
snow. Finally, a series of frontal passages and Pacific moisture
for the Northwest into the Northern Rockies will keep the weather
active with several opportunities for heavy mountain snow and
lower elevation rain.

In the large scale sense, the latest guidance showed very good
agreement at 500 mb through the period with some of the typical
timing differences evolving by day 5 through day 7. The exception
was the UKMET which was a bit displaced with the Pacific Northwest
to Northern Plains energy and also flatter compared to the
slightly more amplified ECMWF/CMC/GFS. The GFS looked to be a bit
too fast/ahead of the consensus and more agreeable CMC/ECMWF (tied
closer to the ECENS mean) so for this cycle, the WPC blend
incorporated mostly a ECMWF/GFS/CMC blend early on followed by a
higher amount of the ECENS for day 6/7 to handle some of the
forecast uncertainty. But overall forecast agreement was average
to slightly above average for the synoptic pattern.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...
A storm system is expected to evolve near the Gulf Coast then
track up through the East Coast toward New England Thursday into
Friday, bringing with it a variety of hazards including potential
severe weather and heavy rainfall to portions of the Southeast. On
the northern side of the system, interactions with a cold airmass
in place and Canadian high pressure to the north will present a
threat of snow and wintry mix from portions of the Arklatex
through the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and much of the Northeast
and New England. Details on the transition zones between
rain/wintry mix/snow will be fine-tuned as the event draws near
but widespread travel impacts and hazardous conditions are
possible.

Behind this system, another couple fronts reaching the Northwest
between Thursday and Saturday should bring the potential for
additional focused rainfall along coastal portions of
Washington/Oregon with heavy mountain snows in the
Washington/Oregon Cascades and northern Rockies. Meaningful
rain/high elevation snow may extend into parts of northern
California as well.

Temperatures will remain much below normal at the start of the
period (Thursday) through about Saturday for much of the central
U.S. and portions of the East Coast in the wake of the late week
system. Departures from normal as much as 20-35F will be possible
for some areas. Meanwhile, out West, slightly above normal
temperatures are forecast for portions of the Southwest this
weekend into early next week. South Florida and southern Arizona
will be the warm spots throughout the whole period for the CONUS
with daytime highs in the 70s to lower 80s.

shortwave energy coming in from the Pacific at times, some form of
troughing is expected over the central U.S. during the whole
period. Overall though, the Arctic blast and much below normal
temperatures are forecast to moderate while attention turns to yet
another deepening low forecast to track from the Gulf Coast toward
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast late this week, which could bring a
variety of hazards including heavy rain, wintry mix, and heavy
snow. Finally, a series of frontal passages and Pacific moisture
for the Northwest into the Northern Rockies will keep the weather
active with several opportunities for heavy mountain snow and
lower elevation rain.

In the large scale sense, the latest guidance showed very good
agreement at 500 mb through the period with some of the typical
timing differences evolving by day 5 through day 7. The exception
was the UKMET which was a bit displaced with the Pacific Northwest
to Northern Plains energy and also flatter compared to the
slightly more amplified ECMWF/CMC/GFS. The GFS looked to be a bit
too fast/ahead of the consensus and more agreeable CMC/ECMWF (tied
closer to the ECENS mean) so for this cycle, the WPC blend
incorporated mostly a ECMWF/GFS/CMC blend early on followed by a
higher amount of the ECENS for day 6/7 to handle some of the
forecast uncertainty. But overall forecast agreement was average
to slightly above average for the synoptic pattern.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...
A storm system is expected to evolve near the Gulf Coast then
track up through the East Coast toward New England Thursday into
Friday, bringing with it a variety of hazards including potential
severe weather and heavy rainfall to portions of the Southeast. On
the northern side of the system, interactions with a cold airmass
in place and Canadian high pressure to the north will present a
threat of snow and wintry mix from portions of the Arklatex
through the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and much of the Northeast
and New England. Details on the transition zones between
rain/wintry mix/snow will be fine-tuned as the event draws near
but widespread travel impacts and hazardous conditions are
possible.

Behind this system, another couple fronts reaching the Northwest
between Thursday and Saturday should bring the potential for
additional focused rainfall along coastal portions of
Washington/Oregon with heavy mountain snows in the
Washington/Oregon Cascades and northern Rockies. Meaningful
rain/high elevation snow may extend into parts of northern
California as well.

Temperatures will remain much below normal at the start of the
period (Thursday) through about Saturday for much of the central
U.S. and portions of the East Coast in the wake of the late week
system. Departures from normal as much as 20-35F will be possible
for some areas. Meanwhile, out West, slightly above normal
temperatures are forecast for portions of the Southwest this
weekend into early next week. South Florida and southern Arizona
will be the warm spots throughout the whole period for the CONUS
with daytime highs in the 70s to lower 80s.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CDT Thu Aug 19 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
A deep upper low and cold front over the Great Basin are forecast to
move eastward into the Rockies this afternoon, bringing widespread
cloud cover and precipitation. To the west, lingering mid-level flow
along the backside of the upper low will continue across northern
California where dry and breezy surface conditions will support
elevated fire weather potential.

...Northern California...
Warm and dry surface conditions are expected to remain in place
across the northern Sacramento Valley today in the wake of a dry
cold front. As the upper low slowly moves east out of the Great
Basin, surface winds should gradually weaken as northerly mid-level
flow along the backside of the trough wanes. Despite the decreasing
upper-level support, a few hours of sustained surface winds near 15
mph are possible. With warm temperatures, surface RH of 15-20% and
very dry fuels in place, a few hours of elevated fire weather
conditions may occur.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CDT Thu Aug 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to move
south-southeastward across western Canada and eventually into the
Pacific Northwest, while another shortwave trough will exit the
Rockies and shift quickly northeastward toward the upper Midwest. At
the surface, low pressure associated with the Rockies trough will
move east with scattered showers and thunderstorm expected across
the Great Plains. To the west, onshore flow ahead of the second
trough will bring a cool and moist airmass inland across California.
With widespread precipitation and poor overlap between dry and windy
surface conditions, fire weather concerns will be low through the
forecast period.

...Heavy rain and possible flash flooding lingers today in the
East as Post-Tropical Cyclone Fred moves offshore...

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding are possible as a
potent cold front moves through the north-central U.S. and the
Intermountain West...

Post-Tropical Cyclone Fred is currently moving into the
northeastern U.S., and will continue to track northeastward across
New England today and tonight before shifting offshore on Friday.
Tropical moisture with Fred will continue to cause heavy rain
today along its track. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall and
Flash Flood Watches are in effect today into tonight for the
Northeast, as heavy downpours could cause scattered flash floods
there. Additional showers and thunderstorms are also likely
farther south across the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio
Valleys into the Mid-Atlantic region over the next couple of days
with the moist environment. While storms are not likely to be
severe in these areas, isolated flash flooding is possible. More
rain today across eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, and
southern West Virginia could be particularly problematic, as that
area has seen ample rainfall due to Fred's passage over the last
couple of days, so there is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall in
place there. More focused rainfall along a front/trough in the
eastern Mid-Atlantic tomorrow could create scattered flash
flooding issues as well.

A strong upper-level trough/low (for August) will continue moving
through the Intermountain West today and into central/northern
portions of the High Plains on Friday. This feature is forecast to
push a potent cold front across these regions, leading to cooler
than average temperatures in the western third of the CONUS. High
temperatures in particular should be 10 to 20 degrees below normal
for the Central Great Basin into the Northern Rockies and Northern
High Plains, while ahead of the front, highs will be in the 90s
for portions of the Dakotas into Minnesota today. Additionally,
the weather pattern and monsoonal moisture inflow will provide
support for widespread rain and thunderstorms in portions of the
western and central U.S., some of which could be severe. The
Central High Plains in particular could see severe weather today
and tonight, with a Slight Risk of severe weather in place and
tornadoes, wind, and hail all possible. Meanwhile, the better
chance for flash flooding today is expected for southwestern Utah
into western Colorado today where the Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall is delineated, but a Marginal Risk for isolated flash
floods stretches north and eastward as well. For Friday, the
surface low pressure system deepening in the Northern Plains
should lead to a threat for severe storms and flash flooding once
again. Slight Risks of both severe weather and flash flooding are
in place for portions of the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
Additionally, given the deep upper-level low, the highest
elevations of the West could even see light snow with the
precipitation. Unfortunately, poor air quality persists in
portions of the West despite the cooldown, and an Elevated Risk of
fire weather and Red Flag Warnings are in effect today for
portions of northern California.

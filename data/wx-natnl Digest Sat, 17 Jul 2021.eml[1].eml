Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1155 AM CDT Fri Jul 16 2021

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

An area indicating the potential for scattered dry thunderstorms was
added across portions of southwest into south-central Montana.
High-resolution guidance has shown relative consistency in scattered
dry thunderstorm potential for this region, where PWAT values should
range from 0.5 - 0.75 inches amid extremely dry/receptive fuels. To
the east of this area, across eastern Montana, some reduction was
made to the area delineating potential for isolated dry
thunderstorms, as PWAT values have been trending higher in this
region.

Otherwise, a small expansion of the elevated area was made into
portions of southeast Oregon and vicinity, based on morning
guidance. The balance of the previous forecast remains on track. See
the discussion below for more details.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0217 AM CDT Fri Jul 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad upper ridging will prevail across the Rockies as a mid-level
trough impinges on the Pacific Northwest. Surface troughing across
the Great Basin will encourage some dry and breezy conditions
supporting wildfire-spread potential. Meanwhile, modest mid-level
moisture along the periphery of the upper-ridge is expected to
support isolated thunderstorms across portions of the northern
Rockies, a few of which may be dry.

...Portions of the Pacific Northwest into the Great Basin...
Surface lee-troughing will encourage dry downslope flow along the
lee of the Cascades and Sierra this afternoon. By peak
boundary-layer mixing/heating, RH is expected to dip into the 15-20%
range, as suggested by the latest guidance consensus. Widespread 15+
mph sustained westerly winds will be most likely across portions of
northern Nevada, where Elevated highlights have been introduced.
While overall weaker wind fields are expected, at least locally
Elevated conditions are expected across the Columbia and Harney
Basins in eastern Washington/Oregon, as well as central into
southern Nevada. Elevated highlights may be needed in the Day 1
update should guidance trend windier across portions of the southern
Great Basin or Pacific Northwest.

...Portions of the northern Rockies into the Great Basin...
At least isolated to potentially scattered thunderstorms are
expected to initiate by early afternoon along the periphery of the
upper ridge, from the Great Basin into the Northern Rockies. Modest
upper flow through a deeper layer is expected to foster relatively
faster storm motions across portions of Idaho into Montana compared
to areas farther south, with a relatively higher concentration of
dry strikes/strike ignitions likely given the aforementioned storm
speeds, deep/dry boundary layer, 0.50-0.75 precipitable water
values, and the presence of near-critical to critically dry fuels.
Portions of the northern Rockies will need to be considered for a
scattered dry thunderstorm delineation in the Day 1 update. Portions
of the Great Basin will experience slower storm motions overall and
a higher ratio of wet strikes. Nonetheless, high-based storms
developing atop a deep, dry boundary layer and critically receptive
fuels warranted the introduction of isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights.

300 PM EDT July 16 2021

SYNOPSIS: Models continue to favor mid-level high pressure across the western
lower 48 during week-2, although there is disagreement regarding how far east
this feature will shift over the period. Despite these model differences,
excessive heat continues to be the primary hazards concern for week-2 across
parts of the Central Great Basin and North-Central lower 48. There may be
episodes of active North American Monsoon circulation during week-2, which
could support above-normal precipitation and possible flooding over the Desert
Southwest. Mid-level height anomalies are predicted to be near to slightly
above normal across Alaska. No hazards are anticipated for the state during
the
period.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota,
Sat-Sun, Jul 24-25.

Slight risk of excessive heat for the Great Basin, Northern and Central
Rockies, Northern and Central Plains, and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley,
Sat-Fri, Jul 24-30.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across coastal parts of California,
Sat-Mon, Jul 24-26.

Possible flooding for portions of the Southwest and southern portions of the
Central Great Basin.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY JULY 19 - FRIDAY JULY 23:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!p7dQ9vHXvMULfhTWqZCMhDQo96HnqCEgnU-dTkM5BG3afdmKV4h1qMHZxBuNLQzhR_mP9M5s$

FOR SATURDAY JULY 24 - FRIDAY JULY 30: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles depict amplified ridging returning across the western CONUS during
week-1 with positive mid-level height anomalies building across the
north-central CONUS. By the beginning of week-2, the magnitude of the mid-
level
height anomalies begin to wane compared to late in week-1, with models
indicating the potential of positive height anomalies increasing by the middle
of week-2. A moderate risk is posted for parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota,
July 24 to 25, where there is at least a 40% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 Deg F based on latest reforecast tools.
The area highlighted for slight risk of excessive heat is maintained across
parts of the Great Basin, Northern and Central Rockies, Northern and Central
Plains, and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley during week-2. Similar to
yesterday, the GEFS reforecast tool favors elevated chances of excessive heat
expanding eastward to the Eastern Seaboard over the period with higher spatial
coverage, whereas the ECMWF reforecast tool limits this signal to the Northern
Great Basin into North-Central CONUS. However, this signal in the GEFS
reforecast tool is noticeably weaker than yesterday. Additionally, recent
model
runs, such as the 12Z GEFS indicate temperature anomalies that would not reach
hazards criteria. The aforementioned model ensemble means generally favor
mid-level troughing developing across the Eastern Seaboard, which would also
lower chances for excessive heat compared to yesterday. Therefore, an
excessive
heat risk is not included for areas east of the Mississippi Valley.
Anomalously
warm overnight temperatures are possible for parts of the highlighted
excessive
heat risk areas. Uncalibrated 0Z ECMWF and GEFS ensemble means indicate
minimum
temperatures of at least 10 Deg F above normal across the Northern Plains,
with
the 6Z deterministic GFS indicating nighttime temperatures reaching the upper
70s to low 80s Deg F. Of additional concern is the increased humidity forecast
across some regions, particularly across the Upper Mississippi Valley and
Northern and Central Rockies, which could yield heat index values greater than
105 Deg F.



There is fairly large variation in the models regarding the location of the
mid-level ridge center, its orientation across the West, and its temporal
evolution throughout the period. Models generally show the center being in a
favorable location for enhanced monsoonal moisture at various times during
week-2, with the potential for precipitation decreasing toward the end of the
period.  Although accumulated precipitation amounts in the model guidance are
not supportive of a heavy precipitation hazard, the localized convective
nature
of the precipitation could result in flash flooding across the valleys. A
possible flood risk area is maintained across parts of the Southwest and
southern portions of the Central Great Basin, based on the ECMWF reforecast
tool, where there is at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding
the 85th percentile and half an inch (the GEFS reforecast tool does not
indicate this enhanced wet signal). Flash flooding can occur even in areas
that
do not receive any rain, and be a direct result of runoff from precipitation
upstream.



Surface high pressure remains forecast across the northeastern Pacific, into
parts of the Pacific Northwest, while thermal low pressure is anticipated over
the Great Basin and Desert Southwest during week-2, related to the
aforementioned anomalous mid-level ridging predicted. The strong mean pressure
gradient situated over coastal California increases chances for episodic high
winds in the region. A slight risk of high winds is posted across coastal
portions of northern and central California for July 24 to 26, where both
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of sustained wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph during the early and middle portion
of
week-2. Increased wind speeds combined with anticipated dry conditions could
promote the spread of wildfires due to the ongoing hot and dry conditions in
the area.



A low amplitude mid-level pattern is favored for Alaska during week-2 with
troughing in the Bering Sea and across most of Alaska, favoring increased
chances for above normal precipitation across many parts of the Mainland and
the Aleutians. Precipitation totals over a 3-day period are forecast to be
under an inch for most areas in both reforecast tools, precluding a related
hazard from being designated. Generally seasonable temperatures are forecast
across the state, with a slight tilt toward above normal temperatures across
the northeastern Mainland, and near to below normal temperatures elsewhere
across Alaska.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 PM CDT Fri Jul 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

Some refinements were made to the area delineating potential for
isolated dry thunderstorms. A southward extension was made into
portions of southeast Idaho, northeast Nevada, and northwest Utah,
based on the most recent CAM guidance. Some reduction was made
across portions of south-central/southeast Montana and north-central
Wyoming where PWAT values may exceed 0.75 inches and favor wetter
thunderstorms.

Otherwise, the balance of the previous forecast remains on track.
See the discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 07/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0240 AM CDT Fri Jul 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will continue to amplify across the Interior West as
mid-level troughing persists across the Pacific Northwest through
tomorrow. Surface troughing across portions of the Great Basin into
the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies will encourage at least
locally dry and breezy surface conditions in spots. Isolated
thunderstorms (some potentially dry) are also likely along the upper
ridge axis across parts of the northern Rockies.

...Portions of the Pacific Northwest into the Great Basin...
Dry downslope flow is expected along the lee of the Cascades and
Sierra as surface troughing prevails tomorrow afternoon across the
Great Basin. Latest guidance consensus suggests that 15 mph
sustained westerly surface winds will overlap 15-20% RH for several
hours tomorrow to the lee of the northern Sierra, into the Harney
and northern Great Basins, warranting the introduction of Elevated
highlights.

...Portions of the Northern Rockies...
The latest guidance consensus depicts the greatest chance of
high-based thunderstorms supporting dry strikes along the northern
periphery of the upper ridge across portions of eastern Idaho into
southern Montana and northwest Wyoming. While storm motions will be
modest, the deep sub-cloud layer and presence of very receptive
fuels suggest that at least a few dry strikes will occur, with an
appreciable chance of ignitions given the aforementioned receptive
fuels. An isolated dry thunderstorm area has been introduced to
account for this scenario.

...Heat continues from the northern Great Basin to the northern
Rockies/northern Plains...

...Overview...

A strong upper high anchored over northern/central Rockies will
support much above normal temperatures from the northern Great
Basin through the northern Plains well into next week before
spreading farther east into the Upper Midwest late next week.
Meanwhile, downstream upper troughing will bring a series of
fronts into the East along with near to moderately below normal
temperatures.  Vorticity breaking off on the western side of the
trough would increase the chance of locally enhanced rainfall
across portions of the southern Plains together with below average
high temperatures.  An upper low off the coast of British Columbia
should lift into western Canada during the latter half of the week
as an offshore trough edges closer toward the Northwest against
the strong upper high well inland.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The relative agreement and continuity of models/ensembles for the
overall pattern indicate better than average predictability with
uncertainty expected regarding the specifics of smaller-scale
shortwaves toward the end of the forecast period.  Models have
generally agreed better with the placement of an upper vorticity
centered over the central Plains that is forecast to break off
from the positively-tilted trough across the Northeast.  This has
led to better definition for a heavy rain area to develop in the
models over the southern Plains between the upper vorticity and
the cold front.  A general model compromise among the 06Z
GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, and smaller contribution from the 00Z
CMC/CMC mean was used to compose the morning WPC medium range
package.  A greater weight toward the ensemble means was used for
Days 6-7 to handle the uncertainty.  The results only deviated
slightly in details compared with the previous forecast package.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The potent upper ridge likely to be centered near southern Wyoming
for much of next week will sustain very warm to hot temperatures
from the northern Great Basin through the northern Rockies/Plains
with highs in the 90s up to at least lower 100s at lower
elevations, which are 10-20 degrees above normal.  Such readings
may approach or exceed daily records especially early in the week.
In less extreme fashion some of this heat will extend eastward
into Minnesota and Wisconsin.  On the other hand daytime highs in
the Southern Tier/Southwest will be somewhat below normal (by up
to 5-10F on one or more days) due to increased cloud cover and
higher rainfall chances.  The combination of a wavy front and
possible upper low reaching the southern Plains and vicinity could
produce some areas of locally heavy rainfall.  Monsoon activity
over Arizona and some neighboring areas should continue, with an
increase in rainfall amounts possible late in the week depending
on how far southern Plains moisture and upper level energy
retrograde.

A leading wavy and slow-moving front will extend from near the New
England coast through the Mid-Atlantic into the South early in the
week, accompanied by scattered to numerous showers and
thunderstorms with locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms
locally train.  Additional fronts should reach the Great
Lakes/Northeast around Tuesday-Wednesday and then Thursday-Friday.
 In both cases lower-predictability shortwave specifics and
frontal waves will play a role in the existence/placement of any
locally heavier rainfall.  The mean trough aloft and series of
fronts will keep temperatures over the East near to somewhat below
normal next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri July 16 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 22 - 26 2021

Today's model solutions are in relatively good agreement on the predicted
500-hPa circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions
during
the 6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a  ridge over the
southwestern Aleutians with above normal 500-hPa heights, and a trough over
the
eastern North Pacific centered near the coast of western North America. A
ridge
is predicted over the western and central CONUS with positive height anomalies
from the Northern Rockies eastward to Northern Plains and western Great Lakes.
Downstream, an amplified trough is predicted over the eastern CONUS with below
normal 500-hPa heights for much of the Eastern Seaboard.

Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over parts of eastern
Mainland Alaska underneath predicted above normal heights, while below normal
temperatures are favored for parts of western Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Below normal
temperatures are likely over parts of the Pacific Northwest due to forecast
northerly flow. Above normal temperatures are favored for parts of the
interior
western CONUS and Great Basin as well as much of the Northern Plains and
Midwest due to the persistent ridging. A predicted trough over the eastern
CONUS, as well as a weakness in the ridge over parts of the Southwest, favors
enhanced probabilities of near to below normal temperatures from parts of the
Southwest eastward to parts of the Southern Plains and Northeast. Above normal
temperatures are slightly favored over parts of the Southeast consistent with
the consolidation forecast tool.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the Aleutians and
Alaska Panhandle due to forecast westerly surface flow and potential storm
system development. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over the
Northwest eastward to much of the northern and central CONUS due to forecast
ridging over the region. The positively tilted trough forecast in the eastern
U.S. increases the likelihood of above normal precipitation for parts of the
Southern Plains and eastern Great Lakes region, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool. The position of the predicted 500-hPa ridge and
low-level flow is favorable for increased monsoonal moisture and above normal
precipitation in the Southwest, extending into much of the Great Basin.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 24 - 30 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to shift eastward and deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. The
temperature probability forecast during the week-2 period is very similar to
the 6-10 day period, with a couple of exceptions. Near normal temperatures are
favored over western Alaska and above normal temperature probabilities are
increased over parts of the Southeast due to forecast eastward progression of
the mean troughs. The precipitation probability forecast is also generally
similar to the 6-10 day period with the probabilities slightly reduced.
However, below normal precipitation is favored over much of the Southern
Plains
and above normal precipitation is likely over parts of the Tennessee Valley
and
Southeast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Showers, thunderstorms, and the potential for flooding across
the central and eastern U.S....

...Additional rounds of heavy rain and thunderstorms for the
Southwest...

...Excessive heat builds into the Northern Plains and
Intermountain West this weekend...

A slow moving frontal system continues to the east across the
central and eastern U.S. Showers and thunderstorms are expected to
continue along and ahead of the front in the presence of a
seasonably moist airmass. Widespread rainfall of 1-2 inches is
likely over the weekend from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
southwestward through the Southern Plain. A Slight Risk for
Excessive Rainfall remains in effect through tomorrow morning for
portions of the Lower Great Lakes and Ohio Valley where locally
higher amounts of 3-5 inches of rain are possible. The greatest
risk for flooding will be further east on Saturday where a
Moderate Risk is now in effect for southern New England, southern
New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, and northern New Jersey. A
broader Slight Risk is in place for the northern Mid-Atlantic, New
York, and southern New England. Locally heavy rainfall amounts of
2-3 inches and higher are possible. Attention is focused on the
Moderate Risk area due to the consistent heavy rainfall seen over
the region recently leading to already saturated soils. Some areas
have seen rainfall between 300 to 500% above normal in the last
week. Heavy rainfall and the potential for flooding will be a
concern elsewhere further south and west along the front from the
Carolinas west through the Southern Appalachians, Tennessee
Valley, Mid-South, and Southern Plains. Broad Marginal Risks for
excessive rainfall are in effect for these areas on both Saturday
and Sunday.

In the Southwest, daily showers and thunderstorms sparked by the
continued influx of Monsoonal moisture will lead to the potential
for flooding. Marginal Risks for excessive rainfall are in effect
for both Saturday and Sunday across portions of the Desert
Southwest and Southern Rockies. Heavy downpours look to remain
somewhat isolated, but slow moving storms with instances of 1-2
inches of rain may pose a risk for flash flooding, especially over
any burn scars or in more urban areas.

Besides the heavy rainfall, a heatwave across the Northern Tier of
the country will become an increasing concern into the weekend as
a ridge builds in over the West. High temperatures will begin to
peak first and foremost in eastern Montana, where an Excessive
Heat Warning will take effect Saturday afternoon. Highs in the
lower 100s Saturday may approach the mid 100s on Sunday. The heat
will continue to expand on Sunday to include the northern
Intermountain West, Plains, and Midwest. Highs in the low 100s are
forecast for Idaho, northern Utah, and northern Nevada, with highs
in the mid to upper 90s expected elsewhere across the region. An
Excessive Heat Watch is in effect for the eastern Snake River
Valley in Idaho.

Elsewhere, thunderstorm chances will increase on Saturday and
Sunday across the High and Central Plains as the western end of
the front remains stationary to the east of the Front Range of the
Rockies and a shortwave moves southward across the region. Some
instances of heavy rain with rates of up to 1.5 inches are
possible on Sunday, and a Marginal Risk is in effect for portions
of the Central Plains.  The cold front and associated showers and
storms will bring a cool down to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast,
with high temperatures dropping into the 70s for New England and
the 80s further South. Below normal temperatures for mid-July are
also expected behind the front across most of the eastern U.S. and
Plains.

...Heat continues from the northern Great Basin to the northern
Rockies/northern Plains...

...Overview...

A strong upper high anchored over northern/central Rockies will
support much above normal temperatures from the northern Great
Basin through the northern Plains well into next week before
spreading farther east into the Upper Midwest late next week.
Meanwhile, downstream upper troughing will bring a series of
fronts into the East along with near to moderately below normal
temperatures.  Vorticity breaking off on the western side of the
trough would increase the chance of locally enhanced rainfall
across portions of the southern Plains together with below average
high temperatures.  An upper low off the coast of British Columbia
should lift into western Canada during the latter half of the week
as an offshore trough edges closer toward the Northwest against
the strong upper high well inland.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The relative agreement and continuity of models/ensembles for the
overall pattern indicate better than average predictability with
uncertainty expected regarding the specifics of smaller-scale
shortwaves toward the end of the forecast period.  Models have
generally agreed better with the placement of an upper vorticity
centered over the central Plains that is forecast to break off
from the positively-tilted trough across the Northeast.  This has
led to better definition for a heavy rain area to develop in the
models over the southern Plains between the upper vorticity and
the cold front.  A general model compromise among the 06Z
GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, and smaller contribution from the 00Z
CMC/CMC mean was used to compose the morning WPC medium range
package.  A greater weight toward the ensemble means was used for
Days 6-7 to handle the uncertainty.  The results only deviated
slightly in details compared with the previous forecast package.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The potent upper ridge likely to be centered near southern Wyoming
for much of next week will sustain very warm to hot temperatures
from the northern Great Basin through the northern Rockies/Plains
with highs in the 90s up to at least lower 100s at lower
elevations, which are 10-20 degrees above normal.  Such readings
may approach or exceed daily records especially early in the week.
In less extreme fashion some of this heat will extend eastward
into Minnesota and Wisconsin.  On the other hand daytime highs in
the Southern Tier/Southwest will be somewhat below normal (by up
to 5-10F on one or more days) due to increased cloud cover and
higher rainfall chances.  The combination of a wavy front and
possible upper low reaching the southern Plains and vicinity could
produce some areas of locally heavy rainfall.  Monsoon activity
over Arizona and some neighboring areas should continue, with an
increase in rainfall amounts possible late in the week depending
on how far southern Plains moisture and upper level energy
retrograde.

A leading wavy and slow-moving front will extend from near the New
England coast through the Mid-Atlantic into the South early in the
week, accompanied by scattered to numerous showers and
thunderstorms with locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms
locally train.  Additional fronts should reach the Great
Lakes/Northeast around Tuesday-Wednesday and then Thursday-Friday.
 In both cases lower-predictability shortwave specifics and
frontal waves will play a role in the existence/placement of any
locally heavier rainfall.  The mean trough aloft and series of
fronts will keep temperatures over the East near to somewhat below
normal next week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 AM CDT Sat Jul 17 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-ridging will persist across the Inter-mountain West as
mid-level troughing continues over the Pacific Northwest. Beneath
modest mid-level flow, in proximity to the Cascades, boundary layer
mixing and downslope flow will support dry and breezy conditions.
Meanwhile, a mid-level moisture plume will continue to pivot around
the periphery of the upper-ridge, promoting thunderstorm
development, with dry strikes possible in the northern Rockies.

...Portions of the Northern Rockies...
While upper ridging will continue to slowly amplify through the
period, widespread strong diurnal heating/boundary-layer mixing and
associated upslope flow along the higher terrain will support
thunderstorm development by afternoon. Weak low and mid-level flow
suggests that storms will be relatively slow moving overall, and
isolated on the large-scale given the presence of the upper ridge.
Nonetheless, enough coverage warranting a broader isolated dry
thunderstorm delineation is expected across northern parts of the
Great Basin into the Northern Rockies. These high-based storms will
develop atop a deep sub-cloud layer, with around 0.75 inch
precipitable water values. In addition, critically to extremely
critically dry fuels will be in place, with record high ERCs and
100/1000 hr fuel dryness noted in spots.

...Southern parts of the Pacific Northwest/Northwest Great Basin...
Modest mid-level flow will overspread the Northwest given the
presence of an upper trough. Beneath the modest mid-level flow will
reside a deep, dry boundary layer, where downslope flow to the lee
of the southern Cascades/northern Sierra will promote widespread 15
mph sustained westerly surface winds with 15-20% RH. Elevated
highlights have been introduced for the dry and breezy conditions
within proximity/to the lee of the higher terrain.

Valid 12Z Tue Jul 20 2021 - 12Z Sat Jul 24 2021

...Heat continues from the northern Great Basin to the northern
Rockies/northern Plains...

...Overview...

The strong upper high forecast to be centered near the central
Rockies will maintain well above normal temperatures over the
northern Rockies/Plains, with some of this heat extending into the
Upper Midwest and less extreme anomalies reaching back into the
Great Basin.  An upper low forecast to track from offshore British
Columbia toward central Canada should gradually flatten the ridge
to the north of the upper high, with a cold front beginning to
erode the western side of the heat by next Saturday.  Downstream
mean troughing will prevail over the East, with the northern
portion likely to trend a little deeper with time.  The trough
will support a series of fronts and accompanying episodes of
showers/thunderstorms along with near to moderately below normal
temperatures.  Meanwhile energy pulling away from the trough by
the start of the period early Tuesday should form a southern
Plains upper low that may weaken some later in the week but still
linger over the southern Rockies/High Plains.  This feature could
support some areas of locally enhanced rainfall in its vicinity,
with clouds/rain from this system and monsoon activity farther
west keeping high temperatures below normal from the southern
Plains into the Southwest.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Most guidance continues to offer similar ideas for the large scale
pattern along with embedded uncertainties.  Within the eastern
trough aloft, at the start of the period early Tuesday the 12Z/18Z
GFS runs were somewhat faster than most other guidance with a
leading shortwave ejecting from the East Coast.  The new 00Z GFS
has adjusted somewhat closer to consensus.  Solutions cluster well
for a trailing midweek shortwave while some spread and variability
continue for northern Canada energy that reinforces the upper
trough later in the week.  The southern Plains weakness/upper low
clusters fairly well in latest guidance and there is also decent
agreement into at least Thursday for the upper low that tracks
from offshore British Columbia into Canada.  How much eastward
progression occurs after Thursday is somewhat of a question mark.
Faster trend of the 18Z GFS versus the 12Z run (and maintained in
the new 00Z run) has led to similar solutions in the GFS/ECMWF and
the ensemble means though the 00Z CMC is a bit slower by Saturday.
 Toward the end of the period there is now a more pronounced
consensus advertising development of a new upper trough south of
Alaska, which should help to erode/eject the initial trough off
the West Coast to a greater degree than seen in the GEFS mean.  An
operational model composite from the 12Z/18Z cycles trending to a
model/mean blend later in the period (a little more ECens relative
to GEFS) reflected the most common elements of guidance while
downplaying uncertain smaller-scale details and less confident
aspects of one solution or another depending on the feature.  This
approach maintained reasonable continuity with only typical
run-to-run adjustments.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The greatest northern tier temperature anomalies (plus 10-20F)
associated with the central Rockies upper high should extend from
the eastern half or more of Montana into the Dakotas and parts of
the Upper Midwest.  Some locations in Montana and the Dakotas may
see one or more days with highs reaching at least 100F.  Best
potential for daily records will be in the short-range period but
a few isolated records could extend into at least Tuesday.  A cold
front expected to reach the northern Plains by Saturday should
bring some moderation to Montana at that time.  Southern Plains
upper low/wavy front may produce some areas of heavy rainfall
Tuesday-Wednesday followed by a lighter trend as these features
weaken.  Rain and thunderstorms should continue within an area of
monsoon moisture over parts of the Four Corners states, possibly
extending into parts of California/Nevada after midweek.  Coverage
and intensity of rainfall will likely increase somewhat with time,
and with a potential contribution from the southern Plains
moisture/upper level energy.  The unsettled pattern over the
southern Plains/Southwest will lead to highs up to 5-10F or so
below normal for one or more days.

Expect lingering rain/thunderstorms with a leading front that
settles over the Mid-Atlantic and South by Tuesday.  Two trailing
fronts dropping southeastward from Canada will bring rainfall of
varying intensity, mainly to the Great Lakes/Northeast but
possibly farther southward at times.  Temperatures over the East
will likely be near to moderately below normal through the period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 AM CDT Sat Jul 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
Similar to Day 1, upper ridging will continue to very gradually
amplify across the Interior West as upper troughing is maintained
across the Pacific Northwest. Modest southwesterly flow aloft will
overspread the Cascades and northern Sierra, promoting dry downslope
flow favorable for supporting some wildfire-spread threat. Mid-level
monsoonal moisture will also continue to pivot around the periphery
of the upper ridge, with isolated thunderstorm development likely
from the Sierra to the Montana/Canadian border.

...Far northeast California, southeast Oregon, extreme northwest
Nevada...
By afternoon peak heating, downslope flow across the northern Sierra
and southern Cascades will promote 15 mph sustained westerly surface
winds and 15-20% RH for several hours. These Elevated surface
conditions will begin in the higher terrain and develop eastward
into the Harney Basin and extreme northwest Nevada, as also
supported by the latest guidance consensus.

...Lee of the Sierra to northern Montana...
With afternoon heating and the development of adequate buoyancy in
the -20 to -30C layer, at least isolated thunderstorm development is
expected in the higher terrain areas of the Sierra into northern
Montana. While winds aloft are expected to be weak overall, the
storms are expected to be high-based, occurring atop critically to
record dry fuels. Some of the latest guidance shows a low-level
impulse emanating from southern California, and moving northwestward
through the day. This low-level feature may potentially foster
greater thunderstorm coverage. Given the very receptive fuels in
place, conditions will be monitored for isolated dry thunderstorm
highlight expansions and possibly the introduction of a scattered
dry thunderstorm area for parts of far east-northeast California
into central Nevada in future outlooks.

...Severe thunderstorms and numerous instances of flash flooding
possible across the Northeast today...

...Excessive heat found throughout the Northern Plains and
Intermountain West...

...Potential for dry lightning over central and northern
California on Sunday could lead to conditions capable of producing
new wildfires...

A slow moving cold front is continuing to meander eastward between
the Lower Great Lakes and Southern Plains this morning, while
producing scattered showers and thunderstorms. As it reaches the
Northeast today it is expected to run into a very warm and humid
airmass, sparking numerous thunderstorms. Much of the Northeast
has experienced a waterlogged first half of July, leaving many
low-lying areas extremely susceptible to flash flooding.
Thunderstorms will be capable of producing 1 to 3 inches of rain,
with locally higher amounts across areas that have seen triple
their normal rainfall so far this month. A Moderate Risk (level
3/4) of Excessive Rainfall has been issued for portions of
southern New England and the Northeast, where the combination of
wet soil and heavy rain is most likely to cause flash flooding.
Additionally, a few storms may turn severe between western
Connecticut and northeast Maryland with damaging wind gusts and
isolated tornadoes possible. For the most part, the heavy rain
threat is expected to come to an end on Sunday for the Northeast
as the system reaches the coastline. Isolated downpours and flash
flooding are expected to remain possible further south across the
Southeast, Lower Mississippi Valley, and Southern Plains through
the end of the weekend. For the Southwest, additional showers and
thunderstorms associated with the summer monsoon could produce an
isolated flash flood threat this weekend, but activity is forecast
to be slightly weaker than earlier this week.

A building upper-level ridge over the western U.S. will lead to
temperatures soaring well above average across the Northern Plains
and Northern Great Basin for the next several days. Highs into the
triple digits can be expected throughout eastern Montana and lower
elevations of the Intermountain West. Excessive Heat
Warnings/Watches and Heat Advisories have been issued. Meanwhile,
high temperatures into the low-to-mid 90s are forecast throughout
the Northern Plains and into parts of northern/central Minnesota.
This heat wave will exacerbate the severe to exceptional drought
currently found across the region, which in combination can make
for an environment ripe for wildfires to spread uncontrollably.

Speaking of wildfires, dry lightning could be a concern for parts
of northern and central California on Sunday as monsoonal moisture
enters from the south, but produces very little rain. If
thunderstorms do form, extremely dry fuels struck by lightning
could produce new fires. Fire Weather Watches have been issued.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1138 AM CDT Wed Jul 28 2021

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

Slight expansions were made to the Elevated area across portions of
the northern Plains to account for the latest guidance consensus.
Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track. Please see the
previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 07/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1224 AM CDT Wed Jul 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
The pattern on Wednesday will remain mostly stagnant with an
upper-level ridge centered across eastern Colorado. Monsoon moisture
continues to advect northward around the westward edge of this
ridge. At the surface, a weak area of low pressure will move through
the Dakotas with a trailing cold front extending back into eastern
Montana and eastern Wyoming.

...IsoDryT - Northwest and northern Rockies...
Cloud cover which has limited instability the past few days will
move northward into Canada leaving mostly clear skies across the
Northwest. This should allow significant heating and instability to
develop by the afternoon. Other than a weak shortwave forecast to
move through western Oregon, forcing is forecast to be nebulous.
However, at least isolated storm development is expected, especially
over the higher terrain in central Idaho and western Montana. PWAT
values are on the higher side in the region (0.8 to 1.0 inches), but
fuels remain extremely dry with ERC values above the 95th
percentile.

...Portions of the northern Plains...
A cold front is forecast to move southward across the northern
Plains this afternoon. In its wake, dry and breezy conditions are
forecast with winds of 15 to 20 mph and RH values around 20 to 30
percent. Fuels are very dry in this region with near-record ERC
values in many spots. Therefore, elevated fire weather conditions
are expected.

...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern over the
West...
...Heavy Convection/Rainfall Threat for the
South/Southeast/Southern Mid-Atlantic...

18Z Update:  The western U.S. ridge and the downstream trough over
the central/eastern U.S. is expected to remain anchored in place
through the medium range period, with the Atlantic upper ridge
blocking eastward progression.  There is some hint in the guidance
that an upper low could develop over portions of the Ohio Valley
by the middle of next week, mainly with the operational GFS and
ECMWF, as some flow separation in the trough could develop.  This
could have some ramifications on the extent of the potential heavy
rainfall across the Southeast and the southern Appalachians.  One
of the main changes with the QPF is for higher totals across
portions of the Carolinas, owing to the block pattern developing
and a quasi-stationary front over this region.  Otherwise, the
guidance is in above average agreement on most of the synoptic
scale aspects, with the greatest differences evident across the
northeast Pacific and the Hudson Bay region by the end of the
forecast period.  The previous discussion is appended below for
reference. /Hamrick

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A closed upper high slid over the south-central U.S. will
gradually weaken this weekend as ridging builds over the Rockies,
Intermountain West and western Canada into next week. Ridge
amplitude will support an unseasonably deep and persistent eastern
Canada/U.S. upper trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting around the ridge and on the eastern
periphery of eastern Pacific upper troughing will present
widespread monsoonal rainfall with local runoff issues. Best
chances are from the Southwest/CA to the central Great
Basin/Rockies where there will also be increasing coverage of
daytime highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand, the Pacific
Northwest may see up to 10-15F above normal highs Saturday, before
a gradual moderating trend as heights aloft decline. Record warm
minimum temperature records will be possible west of the Rockies
over the Northwest Saturday and elsewhere with monsoonal
clouds/moisture.

Meanwhile, shortwaves rounding the upper ridge will periodically
dig downstream to reinforce an eastern U.S. upper trough.
Favorable support aloft may help to produce strong convection and
locally heavy downpours as moisture/instability pool near wavy
fronts slowing on the southern trough periphery. Rainfall chances
shift through the south-central Plains, mid/lower MS and TN
Valleys and southern Mid-Atlantic/Southeast. The pattern favors
below normal temperatures from the Midwest/Northeast to the
Mid-Atlantic where spotty/modest record lows are possible. The
Deep South will be steamy with record warm lows possible along and
south of a main and wavy front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability. The
WPC medium range product suite was derived from best clustered
guidance of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble
mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Transitioned
WPC blend weights increasingly from the models to the ensemble
means over time consistent with gradually growing forecast spread.
This maintains good WPC product continuity that seems in line with
newer 00 UTC guidance.

...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern over the
West...
...Heavy Convection/Rainfall Threat for the
South/Southeast/Southern Mid-Atlantic...

18Z Update:  The western U.S. ridge and the downstream trough over
the central/eastern U.S. is expected to remain anchored in place
through the medium range period, with the Atlantic upper ridge
blocking eastward progression.  There is some hint in the guidance
that an upper low could develop over portions of the Ohio Valley
by the middle of next week, mainly with the operational GFS and
ECMWF, as some flow separation in the trough could develop.  This
could have some ramifications on the extent of the potential heavy
rainfall across the Southeast and the southern Appalachians.  One
of the main changes with the QPF is for higher totals across
portions of the Carolinas, owing to the block pattern developing
and a quasi-stationary front over this region.  Otherwise, the
guidance is in above average agreement on most of the synoptic
scale aspects, with the greatest differences evident across the
northeast Pacific and the Hudson Bay region by the end of the
forecast period.  The previous discussion is appended below for
reference. /Hamrick

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A closed upper high slid over the south-central U.S. will
gradually weaken this weekend as ridging builds over the Rockies,
Intermountain West and western Canada into next week. Ridge
amplitude will support an unseasonably deep and persistent eastern
Canada/U.S. upper trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting around the ridge and on the eastern
periphery of eastern Pacific upper troughing will present
widespread monsoonal rainfall with local runoff issues. Best
chances are from the Southwest/CA to the central Great
Basin/Rockies where there will also be increasing coverage of
daytime highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand, the Pacific
Northwest may see up to 10-15F above normal highs Saturday, before
a gradual moderating trend as heights aloft decline. Record warm
minimum temperature records will be possible west of the Rockies
over the Northwest Saturday and elsewhere with monsoonal
clouds/moisture.

Meanwhile, shortwaves rounding the upper ridge will periodically
dig downstream to reinforce an eastern U.S. upper trough.
Favorable support aloft may help to produce strong convection and
locally heavy downpours as moisture/instability pool near wavy
fronts slowing on the southern trough periphery. Rainfall chances
shift through the south-central Plains, mid/lower MS and TN
Valleys and southern Mid-Atlantic/Southeast. The pattern favors
below normal temperatures from the Midwest/Northeast to the
Mid-Atlantic where spotty/modest record lows are possible. The
Deep South will be steamy with record warm lows possible along and
south of a main and wavy front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability. The
WPC medium range product suite was derived from best clustered
guidance of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble

300 PM EDT July 28 2021

SYNOPSIS: Persistent mid-level high pressure favored by multiple models
supports an elevated risk of excessive heat across the north-central and
southwestern contiguous U.S.during week-2. A frontal boundary and possible
surface low formation which is expected to trigger heavy rainfall late in
week-1 may persist into early week-2 over coastal portions of the Southeast
and
Mid-Atlantic. Mid-level low pressure over the Bering Sea is likely to resul=
t
in
a wet pattern for western Mainland Alaska, which may adversely affect
saturated
grounds from heavy precipitation forecast during week-1.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for the Northern Great Plains and the Upper
Mississippi Valley, Thu-Sat, Aug 5-7.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern and Central Plai=
ns,
and the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Thu-Wed, Aug 5-11.

FOR THURSDAY AUGUST 05 - WEDNESDAY AUGUST 11: During late week-1, dynamical
models continue to feature an amplified 500-hPa height pattern with anomalo=
us
ridging centered over western North America and downstream troughing
prevailing
across eastern Canada and the northeastern CONUS. This mid-level pattern is
favored to deamplify before the start of the outlook period, however both t=
he
GEFS and ECMWF depict the persistence of positive height departures over th=
e
northern tier of the CONUS early in the period, with increasing mid-level
heights overspreading the eastern CONUS with time. As a result, there remai=
ns
an elevated potential for excessive heat focused across the Northern Plains=
,
as
this potential may expand eastward later in week-2. Upstream, there are als=
o
stronger indications in the ensembles with the development of anomalous
troughing over the eastern Pacific which is expected to lessen the potentia=
l
for excessive heat throughout the northwestern CONUS. However, anomalous
subtropical ridging favored to the south may not spare many parts of the
southwestern CONUS from experiencing anomalously warm temperatures and
possible
excessive heat during the period.



Following a large cold front that remains forecast to bring anomalously col=
der
air for many areas east of the Rockies late in week-1, both the raw GEFS an=
d
ECMWF ensembles suggest that temperatures will rebound fairly quickly over =
the
north-central CONUS, with increased 850-hPa positive temperature departures
centered over the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley early in the
period. Across this region, reforecast tools indicate at least a 40% chance=
 of
maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 degrees F,
supporting
the maintaining of a moderate risk of excessive heat early in the period (A=
ug
5
to Aug 7). A broader slight risk area for excessive heat is also posted acr=
oss
much of the Northern and Central Plains and Mississippi Valley for the
entirety
of week-2 where both the GEFS and the ECMWF reforecast tools depict at leas=
t a
20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile. Relative =
to
yesterday's outlook, the slight risk for excessive heat is discontinued
throughout the higher elevations of the West due to decreased support from =
the
ECMWF reforecast tool. However, both reforecast tools are in agreement with=
 at
least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile an=
d
100 degrees F for parts of the Central California Valley and neighboring ar=
eas
of the Great Basin and Desert Southwest, supporting a slight risk of excess=
ive
heat across parts of these areas from Aug 5 to Aug 8. Although there is les=
s
spatial coverage for excessive heat risk across the western CONUS in today'=
s
outlook, the continuation of above-normal temperatures during week-2 is
anticipated to worsen ongoing moderate (D1) to extreme drought (D4)
conditions,
as well as further dry fuels and sustain an elevated wildfire risk across m=
any
portions of the West. Over the northeastern CONUS, both reforecast tools sh=
ow
increased probabilities of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percenti=
le,
tied to the increased mid-level heights forecast later in the period. Howev=
er
there is insufficient confidence that these temperatures will reach hazard
thresholds, thus no corresponding hazards are posted at this time.



For precipitation, the aforementioned frontal boundary is expected to stall
across parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic during late week-1 and into =
the
beginning of week-2. This is reflected in the Weather Prediction Center's
(WPC)
day-7 surface analysis, where a surface low is favored to develop offshore =
of
the Delmarva Peninsula. While the heaviest precipitation amounts are expect=
ed
to occur prior to the start of the outlook period, elevated mean precipitat=
ion
totals exist in the raw GEFS and ECMWF ensembles during days 8 and 9, with =
the
ECMWF reforecast tool depicting an area extending from the coastal South
Carolina to the Delmarva Peninsula with at least a 20% chance of 3-day
rainfall
totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch early in the period. Thus=
, a
slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for coastal portions of the
Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic from Aug 5 to Aug 6. Across the Desert
Southwest, ensemble means feature mid-level ridging becoming more centered
over
the Four Corners region conducive for the return of enhanced monsoonal
moisture
later in week-2. If model solutions maintain continuity, a flooding possibl=
e
hazard may be introduced for the Southwest in the subsequent outlooks.



Across Alaska, models depict well above-average rainfall (with at least 2
inches in the deterministic GFS over a 24-hour period) over parts of the
western and northern Mainland during week-1. By the outset of the period, b=
oth
the GEFS and GFS show the formation of a  surface cyclone in the Bering Sea
bringing another period of increased rainfall to parts of the western
Mainland.
With mid-level troughing favored over the Bering Sea, the continued wet
pattern
may adversely affect saturated grounds. Therefore a slight risk of heavy
rainfall remains posted for parts of the western Mainland during early week=
-2.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed July 28 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 03 - 07 2021

Todays numerical model solutions from the GEFS and ECMWF forecast suites
depict fairly substantial differences relative to yesterday on the mean 500=
-
hPa
height pattern across much of the forecast domain, particularly over the
eastern and southern CONUS. A persistent and anomalously strong closed 500-=
hPa
low is predicted over the western Bering Sea. A split-flow pattern, and a w=
eak
closed low, is predicted downstream of the closed low over the Bering Sea,
leading to favored 500-hPa ridging across central and eastern Alaska and
troughing forecast farther to the south off the coast of the Pacific
Northwest.
The long-wave pattern over the CONUS shows a continued retrogression today,
relative to yesterday's forecast. Subtropical ridging is expected to domina=
te
much of the west-central CONUS during the 6-10 day period. An anomalously
strong trough is expected across the eastern CONUS. The southern extent of
this
trough is forecast to continue to push farther southward into the Southeast=
 in
todays model solutions, relative to yesterdays. The manual 500-hPa height
blend, based on the ensemble means from the GEFS and ECMWF models, supports
below-normal heights across much of the eastern CONUS, the southeastern Ala=
ska
Panhandle, the Aleutians, and near the west coast of Mainland Alaska. Near =
to
above-normal 500-hPa heights are expected elsewhere across the forecast
domain.

Above normal temperatures are generally favored across much of Mainland Ala=
ska
and the Alaska Peninsula, associated with a mean mid-level ridge ahead of a
closed low forecast over the western Bering Sea. With subtropical ridging
expected to dominate much of the western CONUS, above-normal temperatures a=
re
favored across the West Coast, Great Basin, and the Northern Rockies,
extending
eastward to the Great Lakes, with enhanced probabilities over the Northern
Plains. Over the eastern CONUS and Southern Plains, enhanced probabilities =
of
below-normal temperatures are forecast, associated with a deepened mean
trough,
relative to yesterday's 6-10 day forecast. Over the southern Florida
Peninsula,
above-normal temperatures are favored ahead of a mean frontal boundary.

Ahead of the closed upper level low predicted over the western Bering Sea,
above normal precipitation is favored over southwestern Mainland Alaska and
the
eastern Aleutians. Over eastern Mainland Alaska and the central and northwe=
st
Panhandle, ridging to the north of the split mid-level flow over the Northe=
ast
Pacific increases odds of below-normal precipitation. Troughing to the sout=
h
of
the split mid-level flow favors above-normal precipitation in the Pacific
Northwest. Surface high pressure is expected to dominate across much of the
eastern two-thirds of the CONUS, leading to below-normal precipitation
probabilities across the Eastern Rockies, Northern and Central Plains, much=
 of
the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, the Great Lakes, and Northeast. Along a m=
ean
frontal boundary across the Southeast and Gulf Coast, above-normal
precipitation is favored. Over the Desert Southwest and Four Corners Region=
,
the retrogression of the long-wave pattern shifts the mean ridge axis into =
a
more favorable position for an enhanced Southwest Monsoon. However, the cen=
ter
of the mean mid-level high pressure is predicted to be shifted farther
southward, suppressing any major northward moisture surges in the Southwest
and
Great Basin. This favors a weak tilt toward below-normal precipitation for
parts of the Southwest, with near-normal precipitation favored south of the
highest mean mid-level height center.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below normal, 2 out of 5 due t=
o
large inconsistencies among the model guidance and forecast tools with resp=
ect
to the temperature and precipitation fields across much of the forecast
domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 05 - 11 2021

During the Week-2 period, numerical model guidance depicts a generally simi=
lar
500-hPa flow pattern to that predicted for the 6-10 day period in terms of
phasing, but having a lower amplitude. A strong upper low is forecast to
persist well into Week-2 over the Bering Sea continuing an active pattern f=
or
western  and interior Alaska. Downstream, ridging is forecast to continue o=
ver
eastern Alaska and a weak trough is forecast farther to the south off the
coast
of the Pacific Northwest. Subtropical ridging close to climatological stren=
gth
is predicted across much of the CONUS. A trough is forecast to persist earl=
y
in
Week-2 across the Great Lakes and Northeast and weaken as time progresses.
Despite mean troughing in the East, mean 500-hPa heights are forecast to be
near to above-normal over the CONUS. Above-normal heights are favored for
eastern Alaska while below-normal heights are likely over southwestern Alas=
ka
and the Aleutians near the persistent upper level low over the Bering Sea.

In Alaska, enhanced onshore flow to the east of the mean mid-level low over
the
Bering Sea favors increased odds for below-normal temperatures over the
Southwest Mainland and eastern Aleutians. Above-normal temperatures are
favored
for the eastern Mainland, associated with mid-level ridging ahead of the me=
an
trough forecast over the Bering Sea. Above-normal temperatures are favored =
for
the western and northern CONUS, with enhanced above-normal temperature
probabilities over the Northern Plains, exacerbated by ongoing drought. Ove=
r
the Southeast, westward to the Southern Plains, increased probabilities of
below-normal temperatures are predicted behind a mean frontal boundary. Ahe=
ad
of the mean front, above-normal temperatures are weakly favored over the
southern Florida Peninsula, as there is some uncertainty regarding the
southward progression of the front during the Week-2 period.

With the persistent upper level low forecast over the Bering Sea, an active
wetter-than-normal pattern is forecast to continue well into Week-2 across
western Alaska, interior Mainland, and eastern Aleutians. Above-normal
precipitation probabilities extend southeastward to the Pacific Northwest,
ahead of a mean trough to the south of mean split mid-level flow. Below-nor=
mal
precipitation is favored for much of the interior West, extending eastward =
to
the Mississippi River, associated with the mean subtropical ridging across =
the
west-central CONUS. In the Great Lakes, odds tilt toward above-normal
precipitation, in favor of decent model agreement in the potential for
short-wave energy to propagate through the region during Week-2. Above-norm=
al
precipitation is also favored over parts of the Southeast and Gulf Coast,
along
a mean frontal boundary. Similar to the 6-10 day period, the positive mid-
level
height anomaly center over the Four Corners Region is favored to be shifted
farther southward, which would tend to suppress any major northward surges =
of
monsoonal moisture, increasing odds for below-normal precipitation northwar=

In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=

that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=

"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0238 PM CDT Wed Jul 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

Locally Elevated dry and breezy conditions may be observed by
afternoon peak heating to the lee of the Cascades in Oregon to the
Snake River Plain in southern Idaho. Similarly, locally dry and
breezy conditions may briefly manifest across portions of the
northern High Plains. In both areas, the threat is expected to be
too sparse and short-lived to warrant Elevated highlights.

Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track. Please see the
previous forecast below for details on the lightning threat in the
Northwest.

..Squitieri.. 07/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1226 AM CDT Wed Jul 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge centered across the Plains will remain in place
on Thursday. Heights are forecast to rise across the Northwest on
Friday, but there should be enough heating and instability for at
least isolated thunderstorm activity from northern California to
central Idaho. PWAT values should be similar to Wednesday (around
0.8 to 1 inches) across the region. However, with only isolated
storm coverage expected on Wednesday, there should be little if any
change to fuel dryness, and thus fuels should remain susceptible to
ignitions from any lightning on Thursday.

...Severe thunderstorms likely from the Upper Midwest to the
Mid-Atlantic through Friday morning...

...Excessive rainfall with isolated flash flooding possible over
parts of the Upper Midwest through Thursday morning...

...Potentially heavy rainfall fueled by monsoonal moisture could
produce scattered flash flooding in the Southwest through Friday...

...Widespread Heat Advisories and Excessive Heat Warnings are in
effect throughout the central US...

A long, slow moving frontal boundary extending from the Central
High Plains through the Upper Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic will be
the focus for much of the activity over the CONUS during the
short-range period. A low pressure wave set up over the Upper
Midwest is expected to interact with upper-level shortwave energy
and surface instability to produce both heavy rain and
thunderstorms over the region. Taking into consideration the
antecedent saturated soils and the potential for rainfall
accumulations up to and exceeding 2" in 24 hours, which could lead
to localized flash flooding, the Weather Prediction Center has
issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of
Wisconsin and Michigan through Thursday morning. As afternoon
vertical wind profiles become more favorable, severe thunderstorms
and supercells will likely develop throughout the Upper Midwest
that hold the potential to produce damaging winds, large hail, and
a few tornadoes. Much of Wisconsin and the surrounding areas have
the greatest likelihood of experiencing these conditions,
therefore, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Moderate Risk
of severe thunderstorms for portions of Wisconsin through Thursday
morning.

The low pressure wave and its associated frontal boundary are
forecast to move from the Great Lakes area overnight and into the
Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic by Thursday morning. Though rainfall
totals are expected to be a bit lower than the previous day's,
saturated soils throughout the regions due to 150-400% above
normal precipitation will still make isolated flash flooding a
concern. Additionally, a moist, unstable airmass extending from
the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic could interact with the
advancing cold front to produce linear thunderstorm clusters and
supercells. Due to the potential for this storms to produce
damaging gusts and possibly a tornado or two, the Storm Prediction
Center has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms for the
Ohio Valley, Central Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic from Thursday
through Friday morning.

Shifting focus to the Southwest and Central Great Basin, showers
and thunderstorms are expected to continue throughout the period
as high pressure aloft aids the transport of monsoonal moisture
into the region. Anomalously high precipitable water values are
expected to combine with surface instability due to diurnal
heating to produce hourly rain rates between 0.5 and 1 inches,
with isolated higher amounts possible. Given these high rain
rates, antecedent wet conditions, and scattered burn scars
throughout the regions, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of Arizona, Nevada,
Utah, and Colorado from Thursday through Friday due to the
potential for localized flash flooding to occur.

Widespread Heat Advisories are currently in effect from the
Northern Plains/Upper Midwest to the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Southeast as hot afternoon temperatures and high humidity
are expected to produce heat index values between 100 and 110
degrees, with isolated higher values possible. The main concern
with heat index values this high is the onset of heat related
illness if the proper precautions aren't taken. Residents of these
regions are urged to drink plenty of fluids, stay in air
conditioned rooms, stay out of the sun, and reschedule strenuous
activities to the early morning or evening. Excessive Heat
Warnings are also in effect for portions of Minnesota, Kansas,
Missouri, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. In Northern California and
the Pacific Northwest, Excessive Heat Watches and Warnings as well
as Heat Advisories are in effect for areas where temperatures on
Friday are expected to be above average, with highs reaching the
high 90s and low 100s.

The Storm Prediction Center has issued an Elevated Risk of Fire
Weather for portions of the Northern Plains through Thursday
morning due to prevalent dry fuels throughout the region, low
relative humidity values, and winds between 15 and 20 mph. Air
Quality Alerts are in effect for portions of Washington, Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado due to wildfire smoke from ongoing
wildfires.

...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern over the
West...
...Heavy Convection/Rainfall Threat for the
South/Southeast/Southern Mid-Atlantic...

18Z Update:  The western U.S. ridge and the downstream trough over
the central/eastern U.S. is expected to remain anchored in place
through the medium range period, with the Atlantic upper ridge
blocking eastward progression.  There is some hint in the guidance
that an upper low could develop over portions of the Ohio Valley
by the middle of next week, mainly with the operational GFS and
ECMWF, as some flow separation in the trough could develop.  This
could have some ramifications on the extent of the potential heavy
rainfall across the Southeast and the southern Appalachians.  One
of the main changes with the QPF is for higher totals across
portions of the Carolinas, owing to the block pattern developing
and a quasi-stationary front over this region.  Otherwise, the
guidance is in above average agreement on most of the synoptic
scale aspects, with the greatest differences evident across the
northeast Pacific and the Hudson Bay region by the end of the
forecast period.  The previous discussion is appended below for
reference. /Hamrick

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A closed upper high slid over the south-central U.S. will
gradually weaken this weekend as ridging builds over the Rockies,
Intermountain West and western Canada into next week. Ridge
amplitude will support an unseasonably deep and persistent eastern
Canada/U.S. upper trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting around the ridge and on the eastern
periphery of eastern Pacific upper troughing will present
widespread monsoonal rainfall with local runoff issues. Best
chances are from the Southwest/CA to the central Great
Basin/Rockies where there will also be increasing coverage of
daytime highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand, the Pacific
Northwest may see up to 10-15F above normal highs Saturday, before
a gradual moderating trend as heights aloft decline. Record warm
minimum temperature records will be possible west of the Rockies
over the Northwest Saturday and elsewhere with monsoonal
clouds/moisture.

Meanwhile, shortwaves rounding the upper ridge will periodically
dig downstream to reinforce an eastern U.S. upper trough.
Favorable support aloft may help to produce strong convection and
locally heavy downpours as moisture/instability pool near wavy
fronts slowing on the southern trough periphery. Rainfall chances
shift through the south-central Plains, mid/lower MS and TN
Valleys and southern Mid-Atlantic/Southeast. The pattern favors
below normal temperatures from the Midwest/Northeast to the
Mid-Atlantic where spotty/modest record lows are possible. The
Deep South will be steamy with record warm lows possible along and
south of a main and wavy front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability. The
WPC medium range product suite was derived from best clustered
guidance of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble
mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Transitioned
WPC blend weights increasingly from the models to the ensemble
means over time consistent with gradually growing forecast spread.
This maintains good WPC product continuity that seems in line with
newer 00 UTC guidance.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1240 AM CDT Thu Jul 29 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
A large upper-level ridge will remain nearly stationary across the
Central Plains on Thursday. A weak shortwave is forecast to move
through the flow on the western extent of this upper level ridge
across northern California and central Oregon Thursday afternoon.
Ascent associated with this shortwave trough, combined with
significant surface heating and destabilization will be sufficient
for isolated to widely scattered thunderstorm development. LCLs are
forecast to be above 3km with PWAT values around 0.7. This should
result in mostly dry storms over areas with near record ERC values,
which will support an isolated dry thunderstorm threat. Otherwise,
winds will be mostly light and therefore, no elevated delineations
are warranted.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1241 AM CDT Thu Jul 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
Monsoon moisture will continue to stream northward across the
western CONUS on Friday. This moisture combined with significant
surface heating is forecast to bring weak destabilization across
portions of the Northwest. This destabilization should be sufficient
for at least isolated thunderstorm development from northern
California across Oregon and Idaho and into southwest Montana. PWAT
values in this area will be around 0.75 to 1 inch which should
result in a mix of wet and dry storms. However, near-record dry
fuels are present and thus even wetter storms could result in new
starts, especially along the periphery of cores. Therefore, an
isolated dry thunderstorm delineation is warranted. Elsewhere, winds
are forecast to remain light and thus, no elevated areas are
justified.

OBSERVATIONS OF TSUNAMI ACTIVITY
--------------------------------
 * No tsunami observations are available to report.


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
-------------------
Actions to protect human life and property will
vary within tsunami warning areas and within tsunami
advisory areas.

If you are in a tsunami warning area;

 * Evacuate inland or to higher ground above and beyond
   designated tsunami hazard zones or move to an upper floor
   of a multi-story building depending on your situation.

If you are in a tsunami warning or advisory area;

 * Move out of the water, off the beach, and away from
   harbors, marinas, breakwaters, bays and inlets.

 * Be alert to and follow instructions from your local
   emergency officials because they may have more detailed or
   specific information for your location.

 * If you feel a strong earthquake or extended ground rolling
   take immediate protective actions such as moving inland
   and/or uphill preferably by foot.

 * Boat operators,
     * Where time and conditions permit, move your boat out to
       sea to a depth of at least 180 feet.

     * If at sea avoid entering shallow water, harbors,
       marinas, bays, and inlets to avoid floating and
       submerged debris and strong currents.

 * Do not go to the shore to observe the tsunami.

 * Do not return to the coast until local emergency officials
   indicate it is safe to do so.


IMPACTS
-------
Impacts will vary at different locations in the warning and
in the advisory areas.

If you are in a tsunami warning area;

 * A tsunami with damaging waves and powerful currents is
   possible.

 * Repeated coastal flooding is possible as waves arrive
   onshore, move inland, and drain back into the ocean.

 * Strong and unusual waves, currents and inland flooding
   can drown or injure people and weaken or destroy structures
   on land and in water.

 * Water filled with floating or submerged debris that can
   injure or kill people and weaken or destroy buildings and
   bridges is possible.

 * Strong and unusual currents and waves in harbors,
   marinas, bays, and inlets may be especially
   destructive.

If you are in a tsunami advisory area;

 * A tsunami with strong waves and currents is possible.

 * Waves and currents can drown or injure people who are
   in the water.

 * Currents at beaches and in harbors, marinas,
   bays, and inlets may be especially dangerous.

If you are in a tsunami warning or advisory area;

 * Some impacts may continue for many hours to days after
   arrival of the first wave.

 * The first wave may not be the largest so later waves may
   be larger.

 * Each wave may last 5 to 45 minutes as a wave encroaches
   and recedes.

 * Coasts facing all directions are threatened because the
   waves can wrap around islands and headlands and into bays.

 * Strong shaking or rolling of the ground indicates an
   earthquake has occurred and a tsunami may be imminent.

 * A rapidly receding or receded shoreline, unusual waves and
   sounds, and strong currents are signs of a tsunami.

 * The tsunami may appear as water moving rapidly out to sea,
   a gentle rising tide like flood with no breaking wave,
   as a series of breaking waves, or a frothy wall of water.

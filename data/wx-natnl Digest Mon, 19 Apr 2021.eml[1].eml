Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1127 AM CDT Sun Apr 18 2021

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. See the discussion below for
more details.

..Karstens.. 04/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Sun Apr 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
...Southern California...
High pressure centered over the Intermountain West is strengthening
tonight as the desert cools. This will lead to a tightening LAX/TPH
gradient to around -10 mb by morning. Winds of 20 to 30 mph with
gusts 35 to 50 mph are expected with relative humidity of 15 to 20
percent in the morning dropping to 10 to 15 percent by afternoon. A
disconnect between the strongest winds (morning), and lowest RH
(afternoon) combined with only marginally dry fuels, precludes the
need for a critical delineation. Winds should gradually weaken
through the afternoon as the gradient weakens.

...Pacific Northwest...
Cyclogenesis is expected in the Columbia Basin during the day Sunday
as a mid level shortwave trough digs south out of British Columbia.
Winds of 15 to 25 mph are expected as the gradient strengthens with
relative humidity around 20 percent. Lack of appreciable rainfall
for the past 2-3 weeks has started to stress fuels with several
fires observed in the last few days.

...Northern Plains...
A strong cold front will move southward through the northern Plains
through the day today. Some elevated to critical conditions are
expected immediately following the frontal passage, but rapidly
falling temperatures and the potential for snow/rain behind the
front will limit the overall threat. Some increase in initial attack
is possible given the dry fuels and strong winds expected.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 PM CDT Sun Apr 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. Locally critical conditions
may also occur across portions of southeast Utah into far western
Colorado, where RH values may fall below 15% during the afternoon.
However, such conditions appear too localized/transient to warrant
the inclusion of a critical area at this time.

..Karstens.. 04/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Sun Apr 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted upper-level trough will move southeastward
through the Northwest and into the Great Basin during the day on
Monday. At the surface, low pressure will develop in the southern
Great Basin and Southwest. The surface pressure gradient will
tighten in response to the cyclogenesis and winds are expected to
increase above 20 mph in a broad region from Nevada into Northern
New Mexico. These stronger winds will also be aided by a strong
mid-level jet and deep mixing bringing some of these winds to the
surface. Much of this area will be dry and thus elevated
meteorological conditions will be present. However, some portions of
this area have fuels which are not cured and thus the elevated
delineation was drawn where the most burnable fuel exists within the
broader region of elevated threat.

252 PM EDT Sun Apr 18 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Apr 21 2021 - 12Z Sun Apr 25 2021

...Record cold likely for parts of the central U.S. Wednesday and
Thursday morning...

19Z Update:  The 12Z deterministic guidance is in above average
agreement for the middle to end of next week regarding the overall
synoptic scale pattern.  One of the first differences to emerge is

...Overview...

Strong upper ridging is forecast to drift west-northwestward out
of northwestern Canada and through Alaska as an upper low in the
northeastern Pacific wobbles its way toward the Pacific Northwest
next weekend. This favors troughing over most of the CONUS next
week and generally cooler than normal temperatures to all but the
West. A system moving into the Northeast on Wednesday will bring
light rain and snow into the eastern Great Lakes region into the
Northeast/New England as it winds up over southeastern Canada.
Another system exiting the Southwest by Friday may tap the Gulf
for moisture and bring widespread rainfall to the lower
Mississippi Valley into the Southeast (perhaps locally heavy) next
Fri-Sun.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The amplified/closed pattern so typical of April continues to
challenge the guidance. Ensembles generally agree on the evolution
but the ECMWF ensembles continued to be favored due to ongoing
better performance over the past week or so (from the Pacific
across North America). However, the Canadian ensembles, typically
more amplified like the ECMWF ensembles, were notably closer to
the GEFS ensembles. Thus, incorporated a minority weighting of the
GFS/Canadian to start the forecast but a majority of the ECMWF. By
next Fri-Sun, ECMWF became rather suspect out of the Pacific (much
quicker than its ensemble mean) but was still a plausible
solution, as was its depiction of an East Coast system. Favored
the ECMWF and GEFS mean by next weekend amid lowering certainty.
It is a pattern more reminiscent of winter than spring over the
CONUS. Way farther upstream, Super Typhoon Surigae will recurve
east of the Philippines and lift into the westerlies, but may
enter on the back side of a trough off Japan late in the week with
little direct influence on the CONUS at that point.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Generally light precipitation is expected along a frontal system
and on the north/northwest side of the surface low as it moves
into the Northeast Wednesday. As the system deepens through the
Northeast, rain/snow could increase over New England where
temperatures may be cold enough for snow especially at higher
elevations and overnight. The next system of interest would be out
of the southern Rockies around Fri and through the Plains.
Rainfall should expand over Texas and points eastward with at
least some heavy rainfall quite probable over the lower
Mississippi Valley next Fri-Sat and into the Southeast by Sunday.

Warmer than normal temperatures are expected for the West Coast
closer to or underneath upper ridging, with much milder air just
ahead of the Pacific system late in the period. The region between
the Rockies and Appalachians will see the coldest readings
relative to normal for late April on Wednesday, perhaps 10-25
degrees below normal. This will lead to record cold low
temperatures from Texas northward toward the Corn Belt. That cold
air mass will push eastward but moderate Thu-Fri into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic. Another cooler shot of air may arrive from
Canada through the northern Plains/Upper Midwest Fri-Sat.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun April 18 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...Snow to spread across Rockies, Plains and Middle Mississippi
Valley over the next couple of days...

...Heavy showers and thunderstorms continue across
northern/central Florida...

A surge of cold air from Canada entered Montana early this
morning. The cold surge will bring rapidly falling temperatures as
well as a quick burst of snow down across portions of the northern
Rockies to the High Plains tonight and into Monday, followed by
the central Rockies and central High Plains by Monday evening. The
highest snowfall amounts are forecast to occur along the Bighorn
Mountains of north-central Wyoming, where over a foot of snow is
possible. Other mountain peaks from northwest Montana to Wyoming,
as well as the Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota, could see
snowfall accumulations of over 6 inches. Winter Storm Warnings and
Winter Weather Advisories have been issued. Light snow could
extend as far east as the Middle Mississippi Valley and Midwest as
a low pressure wave develops along the front and moves across the
region.

Meanwhile, active weather is expected to linger across northern to
central Florida where a front will become nearly stationary.
Occasional showers, heavy at times, together with embedded
thunderstorms can be expected to continue through Tuesday. A few
storms could turn severe. In addition, flash flooding will be a
concern due to upwards of 5 inches of rain forecast to fall across
northern/central Florida during the next few days. A Marginal Risk
of Excessive Rainfall has been issued to highlight the potential
hazard.

Much of the lower 48 will experience below average temperatures
over the next few days. The only exceptions will be found across
southern Florida, New England, and along the West Coast where
above normal temperatures remain locked in place. A freeze watch
is in effect for much of Kansas, Oklahoma as well as northwestern
Arkansas due to the unusual cold surge forecast to arrive on
Tuesday. Finally, residents in parts of the interior western U.S.
as well as southern California should beware of an elevated risk
of wildfire during the next couple of days. Red Flag Warnings were
issued for parts of central/southern Utah into western Colorado.

...Record cold likely for parts of the central U.S. Thursday
morning...

...Overview...

Upper ridging is forecast over Alaska and Greenland across the
high latitudes and over the Greater Antilles in lower latitudes,
favoring troughing over much of the CONUS. As an upper low south
of Alaska splits off its southern portion toward the West Coast
this weekend, additional troughing will sink southward out of
Canada through the Great Lakes. Ridging will build in between
these two systems next week across the Plains. The pattern is
rather chilly for late April with precipitation chances focused
over the Southeast, East Coast, and West.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The blocky pattern has proven tough to forecast for the
models/ensembles, but especially the GFS/GEFS which again was
generally quicker with the western trough this weekend into next
week compared to the ECMWF/Canadian and their ensembles. In the
interim, the GFS was slower than the rest with an upper low or
sharp trough through the Southwest Thu/Fri though it has varied
between quicker and slower over the past few days of runs.
Preferred to stay closer to the more consistent ECMWF/Canadian
consensus with their ensemble means. This system may wrap up into
the Northeast/New England around next Monday as another robust
surface low in a similar location as the Thursday system. By next
week, uncertainty in how the closed low approaches California
increases, and thusly favored the ECMWF ensemble mean as a better
starting point than the quicker GEFS mean.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

System coming out of the Southwest/southern Rockies late Thu/early
Fri will push into the Southern Plains where rainfall will expand
along and ahead of a warm front. Heavy rainfall is quite probable
over the lower Mississippi Valley through the Southeast Fri-Sat.
As the system moves just offshore and perhaps up the coast, it may
combine with a northern stream system over the Great Lakes and
bring enhanced rainfall to at least New England late Sun into next
Mon. Off the West Coast, the upper low and occluded surface front
will wobble closer to the coast through the period, eventually
bringing lower elevation rain and mountain snow to northern CA
northward.

Warmer than normal temperatures are expected for the West Coast
closer to or underneath upper ridging, with much milder air just
ahead of the Pacific system late in the period.

Areas east of the Rockies will see below normal temperatures
Thursday, perhaps by 10-20 degrees which would support record cold
low temperatures from Texas northeastward toward the Corn
Belt/Midwest. That cold air mass will push eastward but moderate
into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic. With troughing nosing southward
out of Canada, areas along the border will see below normal
temperatures as well. The only sustained area of above normal
temperatures will be over parts of the West/Great Basin ahead of
the upper low offshore. As that moves closer, the milder air will
move eastward across the Rockies to the Plains next week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CDT Mon Apr 19 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted mid-level shortwave trough will dig from the
Northwest into the Great Basin today. As it moves southeastward,
cyclogenesis is expected in portions of the Southwest. A
strengthening pressure gradient as a result of this cyclogenesis and
deep mixing bringing stronger mid-level flow to the surface will
combine for gusty winds from the northern Great Basin into the
Southwest. Dry conditions will be present across this region and
therefore, some fire weather concerns are expected. The primary
concern will be across portions of eastern Nevada, Utah, northern
Arizona, and western Colorado where some dry fuels are present and
the strongest winds are expected.

Additionally, some dry and breezy conditions are expected in the
Texas Panhandle as cyclogenesis strengthens across New Mexico.
However, the longevity and strength of the winds preclude the need
for an elevated delineation at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CDT Mon Apr 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
A compact mid-level shortwave trough will move southeastward across
California through the day Tuesday. This will lead to lee
cyclogenesis across southern Nevada. The strengthening low-level
flow field in response to the tightening pressure gradient will
overlap dry surface conditions and dry fuels across portions of
central and north-central Arizona. There may still be some pockets
of moist fuels, especially at higher elevations, but most guidance
indicates critical or near critical fuels in the region with ERCs
near the maximum value recorded this time of year.

...Snow continues to spread south into central Rockies/High Plains
this eveving before swinging out into the central Plains, Midwest,
and the lower Great Lakes on Tuesday...

...Heavy showers and thunderstorms continue across central
Florida...

An upslope snow event is in progress from the northern Rockies to
the northern High Plains as a surge of cold air from Canada
continues to plunge southward. The cold surge will bring rapidly
falling temperatures as well as a quick burst of snow through the
northern Rockies/High Plains today before overspreading the
central Rockies into the High Plains later today.  As a low
pressure wave forms along the sharp cold front, the snow will then
swing eastward through the central Plains tonight and then across
the Midwest and the lower Great Lakes on Tuesday.  The highest
snowfall amounts are expected to occur along the Bighorn Mountains
of north-central Wyoming and along the Front Range of Colorado
where over a foot of snow is predicted.  Other mountain peaks such
as the Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota, could see snowfall
accumulations of over 6 inches.  Winter Storm Warnings and Winter
Weather Advisories have been issued.  As the low pressure wave
moves across the central Plains towards to Great Lakes on Tuesday,
a few inches of wet snow can be expected to accumulate in these
areas.  Unseasonably cold air behind the low will plunge southward
through the southern Plains.  Numerous daily record low
temperatures are forecast to be tied or broken by Wednesday
morning especially over the southern Plains.

Meanwhile, active weather is expected to linger across central
Florida as low pressure waves develop along a slow-moving front
through.  Occasional showers, heavy at times, together with
embedded thunderstorms can be expected to continue through
Tuesday.  A few storms could turn severe. In addition, flash
flooding will be a concern due to upwards of 5 inches of rain
forecast to fall across central Florida during the next few days.
By Wednesday morning, the rain should slowly edge into southern
Florida.

Much of the lower 48 will experience below average temperatures
over the next few days. The only exceptions will be found across
southern Florida, New England, and along the West Coast where
above normal temperatures remain locked in place.  Avalanche
Warnings are in effect for the Washington Cascades as a result of
the recent warm spell.  In contrast, Freeze Watches and Warnings
across much of the central Plains to the Midwest. Finally,
residents in parts of the interior western U.S. should beware of
an elevated risk of wildfire during the next couple of days.  Red
Flag Warnings were issued for parts of central/southern Utah into
western Colorado.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1135 AM CDT Thu Jul 08 2021

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA INTO SOUTHERN
IDAHO...

Expanded the elevated farther north in Oregon to account for gusty
winds expected through the Columbia River Gorge which may lead to
some elevated fire weather conditions.

Considered a scattered dry thunderstorm area for northeast Oregon
across northern Idaho and into western Montana. There is still some
uncertainty as to the coverage of lightning and the exact location
which precluded the addition of a scattered dry thunderstorm area.
However, there may be a region from northeast Oregon across Idaho
and into western Montana where scattered lightning coverage occurs
with little to no surface precipitation.

..Bentley.. 07/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0127 AM CDT Thu Jul 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A series of shortwave troughs will continue propagating along the
northern periphery of an upper-level ridge and across the Pacific
Northwest/northern Rockies today and into tonight. This will lead to
another round of isolated to scattered thunderstorms along the
international border and into the northern and central Rockies.
Additionally, increasing mid and low-level winds associated with the
passage of a shortwave this afternoon will support fire weather
concerns for parts of the northern Great Basin.

...Great Basin and central Rockies...
Surface pressure falls across the inter-mountain West and central
High Plains will help strengthen winds across the northern Great
Basin and southern WY through the day. Sustained winds near 15 mph
are expected, and a corridor of stronger winds near 20 mph remains
likely under a mid-level jet axis. Per recent ensemble guidance,
this axis will most likely reside from northwest NV into parts of
southern ID (though brief periods of critical wind speeds will be
possible elsewhere within the elevated risk area). Deep
boundary-layer mixing by late afternoon may support wind gusts up to
25-35 mph in this corridor. Little to no moisture recovery is
expected at the surface, yielding another day of RH values generally
in the teens. With dry conditions in place across the region,
elevated to critical fire weather conditions remain likely.

...Southern Montana...
The passage of a weak surface trough/cold front will shift winds to
the west/northwest through the day. Increasing downslope winds
coupled with diurnal warming will allow temperatures to climb into
the 90s and RH values fall into the teens and low 20s. Sustained
winds between 15-20 mph over dry fine fuels will support areas of
elevated fire weather conditions this afternoon.

...Pacific Northwest...
Lift is forecast to increase ahead of a progressive shortwave trough
across the Pacific Northwest and southwest Canada this afternoon. An
influx of mid-level moisture into the region will support the
potential for convection this afternoon and late tonight, and PWAT
values between 0.6 to 0.8 inches hint at a possible mixture of dry
and wet storms. Thunderstorm chances are highest on the Canadian
side of the border, but fuels across the Northwest are very
receptive with several fires recently started by lightning strikes
in the past 24 hours. Given the fuel status and potential for at
least a few dry thunderstorms, the risk area remains warranted.

...Central Rockies - Dry Thunderstorm...
Mid-level moisture currently in place over WY/northern CO (sampled
by the 00z RIW sounding) is on the fringe of monsoonal moisture that
is moving northward on the western edge of a mid-level high. While
moisture quality may degrade through the day, it should be
sufficient to support at least isolated convection this afternoon.
Fuels across this region are generally receptive, and forecast PWAT
values near 0.5-0.7 inches with dry boundary layers will favor dry
thunderstorms.

...California/Nevada...
Early morning GOES precipitable water imagery shows a plume of
monsoonal moisture gradually shifting northward through southern CA.
This moisture plume was sampled by the NKX and VEF 00z soundings,
which will remain over the region over the next 24 hours. Strong
diurnal heating through the day will result in profiles featuring
deep, well-mixed boundary layers with 200-300 J/kg MUCAPE by late
afternoon. Although synoptic forcing for ascent will be weak,
boundary-layer heating and orographic ascent may allow for one or
two isolated dry thunderstorms.

...Excessive Western Heat Persists into Next Week...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave under upper ridging will continue for the
Great Basin to the Coastal Ranges and lower CO River Basin into
next week with temperatures 10-20F above normal through Tuesday
with locally higher readings possible. Several daily high
temperature records are likely through Tuesday, primarily over the
Great Basin through interior California to Arizona. There is a
growing guidance signal suggesting slow moderation of the
anomalous pattern through next week as flatter/more progressive
flow increasingly emerges across southern Canada and the entire
U.S. northern tier. There is also some rainfall relief potential
over the Southwest/Southern Rockies with gradual moisture return
next week.

Meanwhile, expect a heavy rainfall threat to persist over the
Midwest and focus over the lower MS Valley on Sunday as fueled by
return/pooling Gulf Moisture and instability along with lingering
upper trough support and surface frontal system passages. Then, by
the middle of next week the next Midwest system looks to bring
heavy rainfall potential back to the Upper Midwest which has been
rather wet over the past few weeks.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread into next week are low in a
slowly evolving pattern with mean Midwest trough/low and the
western ridge gradually suppressing into southern Cal and vicinity
early next week. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a blend of well clustered guidance from the 06 UTC
GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF/NAEFS ensembles
along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. This broad
composite maintains good WPC continuity and acts to mitigate
smaller scale guidance differences, especially over time with
convective focus and for shortwave activity over the Northwest
coming into the mean Midwest trough. Newer 12 UTC guidance overall
maintains this medium range solution so far.

300 PM EDT July 08 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure is expected to sustain the risk =
for
excessive heat across western lower 48 at the beginning of the period, with
this risk shifting eastward over the north-central contiguous U.S. by the
middle of week-2. Surface low pressure development increases the potential =
for
heavy precipitation across the Midwest, with possible hydrological impacts
focused over Illinois. An active North American Monsoon circulation is
expected
to promote above-normal precipitation and possible flooding over the Desert
Southwest. Over Alaska, increased chances for above normal temperatures are
forecast over parts of the Mainland which may help to dry fuels for ongoing
wildfire activity.

ZyvbuGsOXEB$

FOR FRIDAY JULY 16 - THURSDAY JULY 22: Dynamical models continue to predict
the
deamplification of the 500-hPa pattern over western North America by the
middle
of July, which is expected to provide a period of relief to the anomalous w=
arm
pattern and excessive heat that has impacted many parts of the western CONU=
S
since June. At the start of the period, positive mid-level height departure=
s
featured in the models remain focused across southern Canada and the
Northeast.
By days 9 and 10 (Jul 17-18), both the GEFS and the ECMWF ensembles favor t=
he
weakening of an anomalous mid-level trough over western Canada, allowing fo=
r
the return of positive mid-level height departures overspreading the wester=
n
and north-central CONUS. Compared to yesterday's guidance, the 0z GEFS
features
a stronger anomalous ridge axis centered to the south of Hudson Bay whereas
the
0z ECMWF is slightly less pronounced than the GEFS in regards to amplifying
this mid-level feature. Regardless, excessive heat potential is likely to
shift
further east across portions of the north-central and northeastern CONUS
during
the early to mid-portion of the period.



Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools maintain a broad coverage of eleva=
ted
chances (>20%) for daily maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile
and
95 degrees F extending from California to the Northern Plains. Thus, a slig=
ht
risk of excessive heat remains issued for much of western and north-central
CONUS for week-2. Higher probabilities for maximum temperatures exceeding t=
he
85th percentile and 95 degrees F exist in the reforecast guidance over
portions
of the Northern Plains to support the addition of a moderate risk in today'=
s
outlook from Jul 17-19. Combined with below-normal precipitation anticipate=
d
through the middle of July, the continuation of above-normal temperatures a=
nd
possible excessive heat is likely to worsen ongoing moderate (D1) to extrem=
e
drought (D4) conditions being felt throughout this part of the country.
Farther
east, elevated chances (>20%) for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile also exist in the reforecast tools further east across parts of =
the
Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast early in the period. Maximum
temperatures along the I-95 corridor from New York to Boston may reach 90
degrees F with corresponding heat index values approaching excessive heat
criteria, and a slight risk for excessive heat is added for Jul 16-18 in
today's outlook.



The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble guidance continues to favor surface low formati=
on
and frontal activity tied to shortwave troughing aloft early in week-2.
Surface
high pressure is also favored over the Southeast to advect Gulf moisture in=
to
the central and eastern CONUS, which supports increased chances for
above-normal and possible heavy precipitation across the Midwest. The GEFS
reforecast tool remains fairly weak regarding the potential for heavy
precipitation, however, the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts an area from the
Middle Mississippi Valley to the eastern Great Lakes with at least a 20%
chance
3-day rainfall accumulations exceed the 85th percentile and 1 inch. Given
support from the raw 0z ECMWF ensemble, which also shows increased chances
(40%) for 3-day amounts exceeding an inch early in the period, a slight ris=
k
of
heavy precipitation remains issued for the region from Jul 16 to 18.
Above-average precipitation favored across the Midwest during week-1 (the
Weather Prediction Center forecasts over 4 inches over parts of Iowa and
northern Illinois) supports a possible flooding hazard along the Illinois
River, where ongoing minor to moderate flooding conditions may persist into
the
week-2 period.



There is good agreement in GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favoring mid-level ridg=
ing
centered over the Four Corners region to support an active North American
Monsoon circulation with enhanced moist, easterly flow underneath the ridge
axis. The combination of easterly disturbances propagating across Mexico, a=
s
well as tropical cyclone activity favored in the eastern Pacific during wee=
k-2
is likely to trigger Gulf of California moisture surges and promote
above-normal rainfall over the Southwest. There is good support from the
reforecast guidance, particularly the ECMWF reforecast tool, depicting
increased chances for 3-day accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile fro=
m
eastern Arizona to the Rio Grande basin. Although totals are not expected t=
o
exceed pre-defined hazard thresholds, there is a continued risk of locally
heavy, convective rainfall over areas that are experiencing extreme drought=
 to
elevate the potential for enhanced runoff across the higher elevations into
the
valleys. A possible flood risk area remains issued over northeastern Arizon=
a
and northwestern New Mexico.



Over western North America, mean surface high pressure remains forecast acr=
oss
the northeastern Pacific, into parts of the Pacific Northwest, while mean
surface low pressure is anticipated over the Great Basin and Desert Southwe=
st
during week-2. The strong mean pressure gradient situated over coastal
California increases chances for episodic high winds in the region, where b=
oth
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of sustained wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile during the early to middle portion of week-2.=
 A
slight risk of high winds remains posted across coastal portions of Califor=
nia
for Jul 16-20. Across Alaska, anomalous mid-level ridging favors slightly
elevated chances for above normal temperatures for parts of the southern
Mainland during week-2. This pattern may help to dry fuels for ongoing
wildfire
activity, where over 164,000 acres have been burned since the beginning of =
the
year statewide.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 PM CDT Thu Jul 08 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST
IDAHO...SOUTHERN WYOMING...FAR NORTHEAST UTAH AND FAR NORTHWEST
COLORADO...

Added an isolated dry thunderstorm area for portions of western
Montana. Expect elevated convection to be ongoing at the beginning
of the period with isolated lightning. This activity will likely
have very little surface precipitation given the high cloud bases
and a dry surface airmass. More surface based storm development is
expected during the afternoon. Initially these storms may be dry
before moving east to a higher PWAT airmass and becoming mostly wet.

..Bentley.. 07/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Thu Jul 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave trough currently moving onshore across the
Pacific Northwest is forecast to dig southeastward into the central
Rockies/central High Plains through the day Friday. As this occurs,
mid and upper-level flow will increase over the inter-mountain West,
which should result in strengthening winds at the surface amid deep
boundary-layer mixing. This will introduce a fire weather threat to
the region given the dry, receptive fuels in place. The trough
passage will also support dry thunderstorm concerns for parts of the
central Rockies.

...Inter-mountain West...
Increasing west to northwest winds in the 850-600 mb layer are
forecast to increase to 25-45 mph across eastern ID into southern WY
through the day Friday. Deep mixing will help transport these winds
to the surface and aid in sustaining winds between 15-25 mph across
the northeastern Great Basin into parts of the central High Plains.
Despite an influx of monsoonal moisture aloft, dry boundary layers
and diurnal heating will yield RH values in the single digits to low
teens. Critical conditions appear most likely within the Snake River
Valley in eastern ID and across southern WY where terrain influences
(overlapping with the axis of stronger winds aloft) will result in
the driest/windiest conditions. Frequent wind gusts up to 35-40 mph
are expected in these areas, though gusts upwards of 45-50 mph
appear possible given sufficiently deep boundary-layer mixing.

...Colorado...
The approach of the shortwave trough will not only provide synoptic
lift across the central Rockies, but will also allow for cooling
aloft and steepen mid-level lapse rates. While CO will be on the
fringe of the better monsoonal moisture, modest moisture and
steepening lapse rates will be sufficient to support 250-500 J/kg
MUCAPE over the state. PWAT values between 0.4-0.6 inches suggest
dry thunderstorms are likely. While thunderstorms are expected
across much of the central Rockies, the risk area is confined to
locations with more receptive fuels. Additional dry thunderstorm
chances exist further southwest across AZ and into the Sierra
Nevada, but confidence in the propensity of dry thunderstorms
(versus wetting storms) is too low for additional risk areas in this
outlook.

...Tropical Storm Elsa to produce gusty winds, heavy rain, and
isolated tornadoes from parts of the Mid-Atlantic to New England
through Friday...

...Significant rainfall and flash flooding continues for portions
of the middle and lower Texas Coast...

...Dangerous heat found throughout much of the West, worsening by
the weekend...

...Severe weather and heavy rain to spread from the Northern
Plains this evening into the Central Plains and Middle Mississippi
Valley by Friday and Saturday...

Tropical Storm Elsa, currently moving through eastern North
Carolina this afternoon, will continue to bring tropical storm
force winds and heavy rainfall to portions of the Mid-Atlantic
tonight and parts of the Northeast into Friday. From eastern North
Carolina northward into New England, rainfall totals of 2 to 4
inches, with locally higher amounts, are possible and could lead
to numerous instances of flash and urban flooding. A couple of
tornadoes cannot be ruled out as well, especially for regions
along the coastal Mid-Atlantic and southern New England. Elsa is
expected to race northeastward and into the Canadian Maritimes by
Saturday. Please refer to the National Hurricane Center for the
latest information regarding Tropical Storm Elsa.

Meanwhile, an abundance of tropical moisture and very little
upper-level steering flow has once again produced an environment
ripe for significant rainfall this evening throughout parts of the
western Gulf Coast, which will continue through at least Friday.
As much as 5 to 7 inches of additional rainfall is possible across
this region, with a Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall continuing
along the middle and lower Texas Coast through Friday. Some areas
have already received 8+ inches of rain over the last few days,
which has severely compromised soils and low-lying areas prone to
flooding. Widespread flash flooding is likely, with significant
flooding also possible. Rain chances are expected slowly dwindle
by Saturday.

Farther north, a frontal boundary is expected to situate between
the Ohio Valley and Central Plains through the beginning of the
weekend. This boundary, combined with an impulse of upper-level
energy swinging into the Northern Plains tonight, is forecast to
spark numerous rounds of showers and thunderstorms throughout the
Northern Plains this evening before shifting southeastward and
into the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley on Friday and
Saturday. For tonight, the greatest chances for severe weather are
expected to be found across northeast Montana and the western
Dakotas. By Friday, the severe thunderstorm threat shifts into the
Central Plains and Midwest, with isolated tornadoes, damaging
winds, and large hail most likely to impact areas between Des
Moines, Iowa and Saint Louis, Missouri. Flash flooding is also a
possible hazard that may impact the aforementioned regions, due to
the possibility of multiple rounds of thunderstorms traversing
over the same location.

Excessive heat will continue across much of the Western U.S. as
daytime highs soar well into the upper 90s and triple digits
through the end of this week, with heat worsening across the
Southwest by this weekend. Widespread Excessive Heat Warnings, and
some heat advisories, remain in effect across much of California
(minus coastal regions), the Southwest, and parts of the central
Great Basin. Dozens of daily high temperature records could fall
over the next few days, with Las Vegas, Nevada forecast to come
within one degree of their all-time high temperature on Saturday.
Even though this section of the country is used to extreme heat,
temperatures of this magnitude can be potentially deadly if proper
precautions are not taken. Residents are urged to stay hydrated
and avoid strenuous outdoor activities if possible. Much above
normal temperatures will also shift into the Rockies and Central
Plains on Friday, with some record high values possible. For parts
of the Great Basin and Northern/Central Rockies, the combined hot
and dry conditions may lead to a critical risk for fire weather
through the end of the week, particularly where Red Flag Warnings
remain in effect between northern California and Wyoming.

the southwestern and southeastern CONUS, with a trough centered near the
western Great Lakes. Ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are like=

for the northeastern CONUS ahead of this trough. Ensemble means from the GE=

ECMWF, and Canadian models show a persistent trough or closed low near the
Alaska Panhandle. Above normal heights are generally forecast farther to th=

Enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures are indicated across mu=

est
as a trough is forecast to develop near the coast, favoring above normal
temperatures along coastal Washington and Oregon. Below normal temperatures
are
favored from the Southern Plains to parts of the Southwest underneath a
predicted weakness in subtropical ridging. Above normal temperatures are
likely
across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states ahead of a mean trough forecas=

favored
for the Alaska Panhandle associated with a persistent mid-level trough or

elevated
across parts of southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians underneath
predicted above normal heights, while relatively cool surface high pressure
forecast over parts of northern Alaska increase chances of below normal
temperatures over much of the North Slope.

Below normal precipitation is favored for the eastern Aleutians and across

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 16 - 22 2021

During the week-2 period, 500-hPa ridging across the West is forecast to bu=
ild
northeastward over the Northern Plains. A mean trough is forecast to shift
eastward across the Great Lakes while a slight weakness in the subtropical
ridge is forecast to continue across the Rio Grande Valley. A trough and
associated below normal heights are forecast to persist near the Alaska
Panhandle throughout most of week-2. Near to slightly above normal heights =
are
favored across Mainland Alaska ahead of a developing trough forecast near t=
he
Bering Strait.

Above normal temperatures are favored to persist across much of the West.
However, the greatest confidence for increased heat shifts eastward to the
Northern Plains with time as the ridge is forecast to progress eastward dur=
ing
the week-2 period. A predicted slight weakness in subtropical ridging,
particularly earlier in the week-2 period, leads to increased odds of below
normal temperatures for much of the Southern Plains as well as parts of the
Southwest and Lower Mississippi Valley. Above normal temperatures remain
likely
across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic ahead of a trough predicted over the
Great Lakes. Near to above normal temperatures are favored for much of
Mainland
Alaska as southerly low level flow is forecast to increase throughout the
period. Below normal temperatures are favored for the Alaska Panhandle near=
 a
predicted trough.

Below normal precipitation is likely for much of the northwestern and centr=
al
CONUS as an expansive ridge is forecast to shift eastward. Mean troughing
predicted ahead of this ridge leads to elevated probabilities of above norm=
al
precipitation from the Middle and Upper Mississippi Valleys to the Northeas=
t.
Below normal precipitation is slightly favored farther to the south, across
parts of the Gulf Coast, Southeast coast, and Florida Peninsula, due to mea=
n
surface high pressure. Probabilities of above normal precipitation are
elevated
for much of the Southwest and the Rio Grande Valley due to the potential
advection of monsoonal moisture. Above normal precipitation remains favored
for
much of the Alaska Panhandle near persistent troughing. As a separate troug=
h
is
forecast to develop near the Bering Strait during week-2, a trend toward a
wetter pattern is likely across much of Mainland Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's
operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensem=
ble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
fairly good agreement among dynamical model guidance.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Excessive Western Heat Persists into Next Week...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave under upper ridging will continue for the
Great Basin to the Coastal Ranges and lower CO River Basin into
next week with temperatures 10-20F above normal through Tuesday
with locally higher readings possible. Several daily high
temperature records are likely through Tuesday, primarily over the
Great Basin through interior California to Arizona. There is a
growing guidance signal suggesting slow moderation of the
anomalous pattern through next week as flatter/more progressive
flow increasingly emerges across southern Canada and the entire
U.S. northern tier. There is also some rainfall relief potential
over the Southwest/Southern Rockies with gradual moisture return
next week.

Meanwhile, expect a heavy rainfall threat to persist over the
Midwest and focus over the lower MS Valley on Sunday as fueled by
return/pooling Gulf Moisture and instability along with lingering
upper trough support and surface frontal system passages. Then, by
the middle of next week the next Midwest system looks to bring
heavy rainfall potential back to the Upper Midwest which has been
rather wet over the past few weeks.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread into next week are low in a
slowly evolving pattern with mean Midwest trough/low and the
western ridge gradually suppressing into southern Cal and vicinity
early next week. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a blend of well clustered guidance from the 06 UTC
GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF/NAEFS ensembles
along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. This broad
composite maintains good WPC continuity and acts to mitigate
smaller scale guidance differences, especially over time with
convective focus and for shortwave activity over the Northwest
coming into the mean Midwest trough. Newer 12 UTC guidance overall
maintains this medium range solution so far.

...Excessive Western Heat Persists into Next Week...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave under upper ridging will continue for the
Great Basin to the Coastal Ranges and lower CO River Basin into
next week with temperatures 10-20F above normal through Tuesday
with locally higher readings possible. Several daily high
temperature records are likely through Tuesday, primarily over the
Great Basin through interior California to Arizona. There is a
growing guidance signal suggesting slow moderation of the
anomalous pattern through next week as flatter/more progressive
flow increasingly emerges across southern Canada and the entire
U.S. northern tier. There is also some rainfall relief potential
over the Southwest/Southern Rockies with gradual moisture return
next week.

Meanwhile, expect a heavy rainfall threat to persist over the
Midwest and focus over the lower MS Valley on Sunday as fueled by
return/pooling Gulf Moisture and instability along with lingering
upper trough support and surface frontal system passages. Then, by
the middle of next week the next Midwest system looks to bring
heavy rainfall potential back to the Upper Midwest which has been
rather wet over the past few weeks.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread into next week are low in a
slowly evolving pattern with mean Midwest trough/low and the
western ridge gradually suppressing into southern Cal and vicinity
early next week. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a blend of well clustered guidance from the 06 UTC
GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF/NAEFS ensembles
along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. This broad
composite maintains good WPC continuity and acts to mitigate
smaller scale guidance differences, especially over time with
convective focus and for shortwave activity over the Northwest
coming into the mean Midwest trough. Newer 12 UTC guidance overall
maintains this medium range solution so far.

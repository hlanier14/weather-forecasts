Valid 00Z Fri Mar 05 2021 - 00Z Sun Mar 07 2021

...Rain and thunderstorms are likely in the Central/Southern
Plains...

...A Critical Risk of fire weather is in place for the Southern
High Plains today...

...Precipitation will increase for the Pacific Northwest today and
in Northern California Friday...

A low pressure system is expected to move southeast through the
Southern Plains Friday and into the Gulf of Mexico early Saturday,
while spreading precipitation across the Central U.S. and then the
Gulf Coast states. Modest high elevation snow is forecast in the
Rockies, where 4-6 inches could fall by tonight. Farther east,
rain showers and thunderstorms are forecast across the
Central/Southern High Plains. There is a chance some thunderstorms
may be on the strong side today; the Storm Prediction center has
issued a marginal risk of severe weather in the area for wind and
hail threats through tomorrow. Showers and thunderstorms will then
spread across central and eastern portions of the Gulf Coast and
into Florida later Friday into Saturday; no severe weather is
anticipated with these storms.

Behind the dryline and cold front associated with the low pressure
system, fire weather will be a threat today with dry conditions
and gusty winds. A Critical Risk of fire weather is delineated by
the Storm Prediction Center over the Southern High Plains today,
along with Red Flag Warnings through this evening.

Meanwhile, rounds of upper-level energy spinning in the eastern
Pacific and approaching frontal systems will lead to increasing
precipitation chances in the Pacific Northwest today, spreading
into Northern California on Friday. Rain is expected along the
coast and further inland, while higher elevations should see snow.
Snowfall up to 6 inches is forecast for the Sierra Nevada and
Shasta ranges though Saturday morning. Gusty winds are also
possible in these areas, and Wind Advisories and High Wind
Warnings are scattered into Oregon and Northern California.

Elsewhere, rounds of fairly light snow are possible across the
interior Northeast over the next couple of days, which could end
up accumulating to a few inches in the Green Mountains and
Adirondacks. This will be in conjunction with cooler than normal
temperatures there over the next couple of days, which is forecast
to spread southward toward the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas Friday
as a cold front passes through. Meanwhile, the Northern and
Central Plains can expect unseasonably warm temperature 20 to 35
degrees over the next couple days, where highs could exceed 60
degrees.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensembles this morning show decent agreement that
slow-moving upper troughing will dominate the western U.S. as
upper ridging builds across the Plains into the eastern U.S.
during the medium-range forecast period.  Much of the uncertainty
will be focused across the northern Plains as upper-level energy
is forecast to lift across the central Plains and then interact
with the northern stream by midweek, but the amount of model
spread is quite reasonable for a Day 6 and 7 forecast.

The feature of interest will be an amplified eastern Pacific mean
trough aloft that gradually makes its way into the western U.S.
from Sunday through most of next week.  This trough will support a
broad area of rain and higher elevation snow across the West along
with below normal temperatures.  Meanwhile by Tuesday-Wednesday, a
fairly vigorous shortwave expected to eject from the trough is
likely to produce a significant northern Plains storm system that
should spread a broad area of precipitation across the
central/east-central U.S.  Ahead of this evolution, an amplified
East Coast upper trough will depart after Sunday and eastern U.S.
heights will continue to rise through the period as ridging moves
in from the central U.S. and an upper high builds from Mexico into
the Gulf around midweek.

There is decent consensus for the overall evolution within the
East Pacific into western U.S. upper trough.  The most likely
scenario has an upper low drifting southward off the Pacific
Northwest while energy flowing around the western/southern side of
this low reaches the West by Tuesday and then continues
northeastward to provide the dynamic support for the midweek
Northern Plains storm.  The primary forecast challenges involve
the timing and evolution of the ejecting energy as well as the
overall amplitude of flow to the southeast--affecting specifics of
the surface system and how far southeastward the trailing front
extends.  Overall preference is to stay closest to the ensemble
means for timing later in the period, given reasonable continuity
thus far and intermediate position between faster GFS runs and
slower ECMWF runs.  The 00Z CMC offers a faster solution than the
GFS but its ensemble mean compares well with the GEFS and the EC
mean.  Meanwhile, energy from the upper low off the Northwest
should drop southeastward and possibly combine with upstream flow
to yield an upper trough that reaches near the Great
Basin/Southwest by day 7 Thursday.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived based on
multi-model consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z
GFS/GEFS with smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.
Beginning on Day 5, more of the 06Z GEFS together with the 00Z EC
mean were used to account for the increasing
forecast uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect a large portion of the West to see at least some
rain/higher elevation snow during the period.  Heavier
precipitation should extend from southwestern Oregon through
favored terrain in California, with highest amounts most likely
along the Sierra Nevada.  Meaningful though more moderate
precipitation is likely across the Interior West and Rockies.
Energy ejecting into the Plains should produce a fairly strong
storm system that tracks across northern tier locations Tuesday
onward, with a broad area of precipitation extending across the
northern/eastern Plains and into the east-central U.S.  Some
wintry weather may be possible over extreme northern locations
depending on exactly how the storm evolves.  Farther south there
may be locally moderate to heavy rainfall with the mid-Mississippi
Valley and lower Ohio Valley currently the most likely areas to
see highest rainfall totals.  Check future outlooks as the
system's details come into clearer focus.  Around the end of the
period and beyond, the cold front anchored by the surface low
could stall with continued Gulf inflow helping to add to the
rainfall potential.  There is currently enough spread to temper
confidence in this scenario somewhat but it requires monitoring.

Much above normal temperatures will persist over the northern
Plains/Midwest and expand into the Great Lakes through the first
part of next week with readings generally 10-25F above normal.
Daily records should be more numerous for warm lows than daytime
highs.  Development/progression of the northern Plains low
pressure system and trailing front Tuesday onward will finally
push this warmth more into the eastern half of the country by
mid-late week.  At that time, morning lows should remain as warm
as 15-25F above normal while highs will likely be somewhat less
extreme.  The West will see a cooling trend spreading across the
region from west to east during the period with highs tending to
drop to 5-10F or so below normal.  The East Coast states will
start out chilly with similar negative anomalies on Sunday
followed by a steady warming trend.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu March 04 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 10 - 14 2021

Today's model forecasts are in very good agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation pattern across most of North America during the 6-10 day period=
.
However, differences emerge upstream over the Pacific where today's GEFS
solutions depict the placement of a ridge farther to the east, relative to =
the
0z ECMWF Ensemble Mean. To the north of this ridge, the GEFS predicts that =
a
lobe of the Polar Vortex will overspread much of western Alaska, while the
ECMWF ensemble mean is much less bullish with this feature. Since the
placement
of the Pacific ridge from the GEFS teleconnects the best with the downstrea=
m
pattern forecast over the CONUS (where models are in better agreement), the
GEFS was the preferred solution in today's manual 500-hPa height blend. The
resultant manual blend depicts an amplified mean trough and associated
negative
500-hPa height anomalies over northwestern Alaska. Farther to the south, an
amplified trough forecast over the southwestern CONUS supports below normal
heights across most of the CONUS, from the West Coast eastward to the Centr=
al
and Northern Great Plains. Ridging and above normal heights are expected ea=
st
of the Mississippi and extending southwestward across much of the Southern
Plains.

Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures in the western CONUS ar=
e
associated with a forecast amplified mean trough and below normal mid-level
heights. Probabilities exceed 80 percent for Southern California, near the
base
of the trough. Conversely, amplified ridging favors enhanced probabilities =
of
above normal temperatures across the eastern CONUS and most of the Southern
Plains, with the highest probabilities (greater than 70 percent) over parts=
 of
the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Northeast. Below normal temperatures are
favored for southwestern Mainland Alaska where the GEFS solution depicts a
very
strong cold signal near the end of next week. As low pressure systems move
along the northeastern periphery of the North Pacific ridge, below normal
temperatures are favored to extend eastward across much of the South Coast =
of
Alaska.

There is a potential for multiple surface low pressure systems to affect
southern Alaska, favoring above-normal precipitation across southwestern
Mainland Alaska and most of the South Coast. However, odds tilt toward belo=
w
normal precipitation for the southern Alaska Panhandle, southward to parts =
of
the northwestern CONUS, associated with forecast ridging over western Canad=
a.
Mean troughing centered over the Southwestern CONUS increases probabilities=
 of
above normal precipitation from central and southern California, eastward t=
o
the central Rockies. Enhanced above normal precipitation probabilities are
indicated for much of the Great Plains, Mississippi and Ohio valleys, Great
Lakes, and Northeast. The potential for enhanced moisture advection from th=
e
Gulf of Mexico increases the likelihood of above normal precipitation acros=
s
much of the east-central CONUS. Conversely, ridging anticipated across the
southeastern CONUS leads to drier than normal conditions across southern
portions of the Eastern Seaboard.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 25% of Today's 0=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement across most of the CONUS offset slightly by disagreeme=
nts
upstream over the Pacific and much of Alaska.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 12 - 18 2021

During the week-2 period, a transitional period is likely as the overall
pattern is forecast to de-amplify and model spread and uncertainty increase=
.
The most anomalous features predicted by the models across the Northern
Hemisphere include a ridge over the North Pacific, a closed mid-level low
north
of Siberia, and a trough southeast of Greenland. Teleconnections from these
features were relied upon to resolve model differences across much of North
America. The week-2 official 500-hPa height blend, composed of roughly an e=
ven
split of the GEFS, Canadian, and ECMWF ensemble means, depicts persistent
below
normal heights across the western CONUS, but with reduced amplitude compare=
d
to
the 6-10 day period. Weak cyclonic flow is forecast near the Great Lakes, a=
nd
ridging is anticipated farther to the south across the Southeast and Gulf
Coast. Above normal heights are anticipated across the Aleutians and Alaska
Peninsula, in association with the predicted North Pacific Ridge. Near to
below
normal heights are likely for the remainder of the state, associated with t=
he
trough forecast north of Siberia and a second trough predicted near the Ala=
ska
Panhandle.

Persistent negative height anomalies anticipated over the western CONUS fav=
or
enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures from the West Coast to =
the
Central Plains. Conversely, ridging enhances odds of above normal temperatu=
res
across the Southeast and Gulf Coast. Elevated above normal temperature
probabilities extend northward over much of the eastern CONUS, ahead of a w=
eak
trough predicted over the Great Lakes. Below normal temperatures are favore=
d
for most of Alaska, consistent with a strong cold signal forecast by the GE=
FS
Ensemble Mean late next week into the weekend.

Above normal precipitation is favored from parts of the Central Plains, acr=
oss
the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, Great Lakes, and northern portions of the
Eastern Seaboard, underneath predicted weakly cyclonic flow. Near to below
normal precipitation is favored farther to the south across much of the
south-central CONUS and parts of the Southeast, underneath predicted ridgin=
g
and associated above normal heights. Predicted weakly enhanced Pacific flow
slightly favors above normal precipitation across parts of the West Coast.
Conversely, weak ridging forecast over the Northern Rockies leads to a slig=
ht
tilt toward drier than normal conditions for much of the Northern Plains.
Above
normal precipitation is likely for much of Alaska, consistent with statisti=
cal
guidance derived for the manual 500-hPa height blend.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 6z G=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

  * A TSUNAMI IS A SERIES OF WAVES. THE TIME BETWEEN WAVE CRESTS
    CAN VARY FROM 5 MINUTES TO AN HOUR. THE HAZARD MAY PERSIST
    FOR MANY HOURS OR LONGER AFTER THE INITIAL WAVE.

  * IMPACTS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE SECTION OF COAST TO
    THE NEXT DUE TO LOCAL BATHYMETRY AND THE SHAPE AND ELEVATION
    OF THE SHORELINE.

  * IMPACTS CAN ALSO VARY DEPENDING UPON THE STATE OF THE TIDE AT
    THE TIME OF THE MAXIMUM TSUNAMI WAVES.

  * PERSONS CAUGHT IN THE WATER OF A TSUNAMI MAY DROWN... BE
    CRUSHED BY DEBRIS IN THE WATER... OR BE SWEPT OUT TO SEA.


NEXT UPDATE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------

  * THE NEXT MESSAGE WILL BE ISSUED IN ONE HOUR... OR SOONER IF

...Rain and thunderstorms are likely in the Central/Southern
Plains...

...A Critical Risk of fire weather is in place for the Southern
High Plains today...

...Precipitation will increase for the Pacific Northwest today and
in Northern California Friday...

A low pressure system is expected to move southeast through the
Southern Plains Friday and into the Gulf of Mexico early Saturday,
while spreading precipitation across the Central U.S. and then the
Gulf Coast states. Modest high elevation snow is forecast in the
Rockies, where 4-6 inches could fall by tonight. Farther east,
rain showers and thunderstorms are forecast across the
Central/Southern High Plains. There is a chance some thunderstorms
may be on the strong side today; the Storm Prediction center has
issued a marginal risk of severe weather in the area for wind and
hail threats through tomorrow. Showers and thunderstorms will then
spread across central and eastern portions of the Gulf Coast and
into Florida later Friday into Saturday; no severe weather is
anticipated with these storms.

Behind the dryline and cold front associated with the low pressure
system, fire weather will be a threat today with dry conditions
and gusty winds. A Critical Risk of fire weather is delineated by
the Storm Prediction Center over the Southern High Plains today,
along with Red Flag Warnings through this evening.

Meanwhile, rounds of upper-level energy spinning in the eastern
Pacific and approaching frontal systems will lead to increasing
precipitation chances in the Pacific Northwest today, spreading
into Northern California on Friday. Rain is expected along the
coast and further inland, while higher elevations should see snow.
Snowfall up to 6 inches is forecast for the Sierra Nevada and
Shasta ranges though Saturday morning. Gusty winds are also
possible in these areas, and Wind Advisories and High Wind
Warnings are scattered into Oregon and Northern California.

Elsewhere, rounds of fairly light snow are possible across the
interior Northeast over the next couple of days, which could end
up accumulating to a few inches in the Green Mountains and
Adirondacks. This will be in conjunction with cooler than normal
temperatures there over the next couple of days, which is forecast
to spread southward toward the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas Friday
as a cold front passes through. Meanwhile, the Northern and
Central Plains can expect unseasonably warm temperature 20 to 35
degrees over the next couple days, where highs could exceed 60
degrees.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

  * A TSUNAMI IS A SERIES OF WAVES. THE TIME BETWEEN WAVE CRESTS
    CAN VARY FROM 5 MINUTES TO AN HOUR. THE HAZARD MAY PERSIST
    FOR MANY HOURS OR LONGER AFTER THE INITIAL WAVE.

  * IMPACTS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE SECTION OF COAST TO
    THE NEXT DUE TO LOCAL BATHYMETRY AND THE SHAPE AND ELEVATION
    OF THE SHORELINE.

  * IMPACTS CAN ALSO VARY DEPENDING UPON THE STATE OF THE TIDE AT
    THE TIME OF THE MAXIMUM TSUNAMI WAVES.

  * PERSONS CAUGHT IN THE WATER OF A TSUNAMI MAY DROWN... BE
    CRUSHED BY DEBRIS IN THE WATER... OR BE SWEPT OUT TO SEA.


TSUNAMI OBSERVATIONS
--------------------

  * THE FOLLOWING ARE TSUNAMI WAVE OBSERVATIONS FROM COASTAL
    AND/OR DEEP-OCEAN SEA LEVEL GAUGES AT THE INDICATED
    LOCATIONS. THE MAXIMUM TSUNAMI HEIGHT IS MEASURED WITH

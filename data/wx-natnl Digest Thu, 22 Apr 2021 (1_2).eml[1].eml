1145 AM CDT Wed Apr 21 2021

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE LOWER COLORADO
RIVER VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF SOUTH CAROLINA INTO
EXTREME SOUTHERN NORTH CAROLINA...

Widespread 15-20 mph sustained westerly surface winds are in place
across much of the Carolinas spanning into central and eastern
Georgia per latest METAR observations. Visible satellite depicts
clear skies along the Atlantic coastline, where additional
heating/boundary-layer mixing will encourage RH to drop into the
20-30% range, as supported by the latest guidance consensus. With 20
mph sustained winds still expected across South Carolina, the lower
RH later this afternoon is expected to promote multiple hours of
Critical conditions, with at least Elevated conditions still likely
across much of Georgia and North Carolina.

Meanwhile, METAR observations and visible satellite show mostly
clear skies and sustained 20+ mph winds across portions of central
Arizona into far western New Mexico, where RH has already dropped
below 15% across several locales. These critical conditions are
expected to intensify and become more widespread through the
afternoon based on the latest model guidance, with surface winds
peaking in the 25-30 mph range and RH dipping below 10% in a few
spots.

The forecast remains on track for portions of the Northern
Sacramento Valley in California. Please see the previous forecast
for more details.

..Squitieri.. 04/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0227 AM CDT Wed Apr 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will move from central California into the
southern Great Basin through the day today. Moderate mid-level
southwesterly flow will round the base of this trough and overspread
much of the Southwest. At the surface, lee cyclogenesis is expected
in the southern Great Basin with a ~1000mb surface low forecast in
southern Utah by 00Z Thursday. Farther east, a strong mid-level jet
across the Missouri Valley this morning is forecast to strengthen as
it shifts eastward into the Tennessee Valley and Mid-Atlantic by
this evening. A surface low is expected to deepen across the
Appalachians and continue to deepen as it shifts northeastward into
Maine by early Thursday morning. A cold front will extend from this
surface low and exist the East Coast during the period.

...Southwest...
A deeply mixed boundary layer is expected across much of the
Southwest today as temperatures warm into the 70s. Very dry surface
conditions are anticipated with relative humidity in the 10 to 15
percent range. Deep mixing will help bring stronger mid-level flow
to the surface. This deep mixing combined with the tightening
pressure gradient will bring 25 to 30 mph sustained winds across
much of the Southwest. Critical fire weather conditions are expected
across most of Arizona and for the western half of New Mexico. Some
extremely critical meteorological conditions (with winds in excess
of 30 mph) are likely, but extremely critical fuels are not present
and thus an extremely critical area is not warranted.

...Northern Sacramento Valley...
A few hours of dry and breezy conditions are expected this afternoon
in the northern Central Valley. Down-valley mid-level flow will
provide upper level support for stronger winds than the surface
pressure gradient alone might suggest. Winds of 15 to 25 mph are
expected with relative humidity around 20 percent.

...Georgia into the Carolinas...
Dry-continental westerly flow is expected in the Carolinas today.
Forecast guidance suggests relative humidity drops into the 25 to 30
percent range across much of the region with winds in the 15 to 20
mph range. However, forecast guidance commonly overestimates
low-level moisture in these setups and sub 20 percent relative
humidity is certainly possible. ERCs above the 90th percentile
(above the 97th percentile in some locations) are common across much
of the Carolinas yielding fuels capable of large-fire spread. Fuels
are less favorable across Georgia, but meteorological conditions
would support elevated to low-end critical threat. Therefore, given
more marginal fuel dryness, and elevated is sufficient for this
region.

...Heavy Rainfall across parts of the Southeast Saturday...

...Overview...

Progressive upper level flow is expected to evolve over the course
of the period with the main systems of interest being shortwave
energy deepening over the Northeast/New England late this weekend
and early next week while a deeper longwave trough pushes onshore
the West Coast. As it reaches the Central Plains by day 7, a more
significant storm system could bring a variety of weather hazards
to the central U.S. by the middle of next week. Temperatures will
be variable during the period, modulated by frontal passages.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The 21.00Z and 21.06Z guidance showed fairly good clustering at
the starting point of the medium range. A multi-model blend of the
deterministic guidance was sufficient for the low pressure system
tracking from the mid-Mississippi Valley on day 3 /Saturday/ to
New England on day 5 /Monday/. The 06Z GFS was less favored
though, as it was showing a faster bias compared to the other
deterministic global models and the 00Z GFS was more agreeable and
therefore was included more in the blend. Elsewhere, the ECMWF
continued to be a slower solution with the next trough coming
through the West U.S. and the CMC (and to some degree the UKMET)
offered a more consensus approach. Either way, once the trough
ejects into the Plains and cyclogenesis takes place, all of the
models actually come together for a reasonable solution for day
6/7 in what may evolve into a more amplified flow pattern. The
ECENS/GEFS means were used more for day 6/7 and this resulted in a
blend that trended well with continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Low pressure in the Tennessee Valley early Saturday will promote
shower and storms, possibly severe (see SPC), with locally heavy
rain especially over parts of Georgia and through the Carolinas.
The system should then lift up the East Coast as trailing northern
stream energy from the Great Lakes region merges into the coastal
system and possibly closes an upper low. Enhanced rainfall is
possible from parts of the Mid-Atlantic into New England with
windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens.

In the West, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will work into the West during the weekend into early next
week. This system will spread lower elevation rain/mountain snow
focused from the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies southward
into California and the Great Basin/central Rockies. The highest
totals with this system will likely be from the Pacific Northwest
into the Sierra Nevada. The majority of precipitation should be
light to moderate though parts of the central West Coast and
Sierra Nevada could see a period of locally enhanced activity.
Once the system moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will
increase for convectively-driven rainfall over parts of the Plains
and Mississippi Valley. See SPC for details on the potential
severe weather threat.

In the wake of the eastern system, cooler than normal temperatures
will be prevalent over the Ohio Valley and southern Mid-Atlantic
into the Northeast. An area of above normal temperatures over
parts of the West/Great Basin ahead of the Pacific upper
trough/low will shift eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains by early next week and into the Northeastern 1/4 of the
CONUS by midweek. Best potential for one or more days with
temperatures 10F or more above normal will extend from near the
Great Basin through the central-southern Rockies into the
Plains/Midwest where temperatures may climb well into the 80s/70s,
respectively. Trailing the front that crosses the West,
temperatures over the region will decline to 5-15F colder than
normal by next Monday-Tuesday and the back to near or slightly
above normal Wednesday.

New England on day 5 /Monday/. The 06Z GFS was less favored
though, as it was showing a faster bias compared to the other
deterministic global models and the 00Z GFS was more agreeable and
therefore was included more in the blend. Elsewhere, the ECMWF
continued to be a slower solution with the next trough coming
through the West U.S. and the CMC (and to some degree the UKMET)
offered a more consensus approach. Either way, once the trough
ejects into the Plains and cyclogenesis takes place, all of the
models actually come together for a reasonable solution for day
6/7 in what may evolve into a more amplified flow pattern. The
ECENS/GEFS means were used more for day 6/7 and this resulted in a
blend that trended well with continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Low pressure in the Tennessee Valley early Saturday will promote
shower and storms, possibly severe (see SPC), with locally heavy
rain especially over parts of Georgia and through the Carolinas.
The system should then lift up the East Coast as trailing northern
stream energy from the Great Lakes region merges into the coastal
system and possibly closes an upper low. Enhanced rainfall is
possible from parts of the Mid-Atlantic into New England with
windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens.

In the West, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will work into the West during the weekend into early next
week. This system will spread lower elevation rain/mountain snow
focused from the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies southward
into California and the Great Basin/central Rockies. The highest
totals with this system will likely be from the Pacific Northwest
into the Sierra Nevada. The majority of precipitation should be
light to moderate though parts of the central West Coast and
Sierra Nevada could see a period of locally enhanced activity.
Once the system moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will
increase for convectively-driven rainfall over parts of the Plains
and Mississippi Valley. See SPC for details on the potential
severe weather threat.

In the wake of the eastern system, cooler than normal temperatures
will be prevalent over the Ohio Valley and southern Mid-Atlantic
into the Northeast. An area of above normal temperatures over
parts of the West/Great Basin ahead of the Pacific upper
trough/low will shift eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains by early next week and into the Northeastern 1/4 of the
CONUS by midweek. Best potential for one or more days with
temperatures 10F or more above normal will extend from near the
Great Basin through the central-southern Rockies into the
Plains/Midwest where temperatures may climb well into the 80s/70s,
respectively. Trailing the front that crosses the West,
temperatures over the region will decline to 5-15F colder than
normal by next Monday-Tuesday and the back to near or slightly
above normal Wednesday.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 21 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level low pressure is anticipated to elevate the
potential for heavy precipitation over the southeastern and south-central U.S.
during the early and middle portion of the outlook period, respectively. Much
of the western U.S. looks to be hazards free with slightly elevated odds for
above-normal temperatures for much of southwestern U.S and over Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Southeast, Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys, the Appalachians, and the Mid-Atlantic, Thu, Apr 29.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Central and Southern
Plains, and the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Sat-Tue, May 1-4.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 24 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 28:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vbbKPD-bPAqT4H1RRMNntBsNY1pPLaYgZmnc5B99VWEbtBMqPZ7ayjyN3djT4bMhretZPbOZ$

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 29 - WEDNESDAY MAY 05: As advertised by the dynamical
models
over the past few days, anomalous mid-level ridging continues to be featured
across the southwestern U.S. with a downstream shortwave trough forecast to
move through the central CONUS by the outset of the week-2 period.  Compared
to
the GEFS, the ECMWF ensemble continues to favor a more amplified pattern with
larger coverage of positive (negative) 500-hPa height departures throughout
the
western (central) CONUS. Trends in the ECMWF ensemble regarding this shortwave
trough are of interest for hazard potential, as the today's 0z run depicts
552-dam heights reaching as far south as the Midwest on day 8 (Apr 29), which
would bring another shot of unseasonably cold temperatures and maintain heavy
precipitation potential to portions of the central and eastern U.S early in
the
outlook period. By the start of May, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble guidance
are beginning to favor the development of anomalous troughing over the western
U.S. The 0z and 6z GEFS are particularly aggressive with this development,
favoring a trough axis extending as far south as northern Mexico, which would
help induce the return of surface low development over the Great Plains and
increase heavy precipitation potential by the middle portion of the outlook
period.



During late week-1 and into the start of the outlook period, surface low
pressure is anticipated to track across the upper Midwest and Great Lakes.
Surface high pressure remains forecast throughout much of the western
Atlantic,
which favors enhanced lower-level southerly flow to advect Gulf moisture, and
elevate chances for heavy precipitation over portions of the southeastern
CONUS. Based on the ensemble mean precipitation totals from the GEFS and
ECMWF,
the highest precipitation amounts are expected over the Mississippi Valley
prior to the start of week-2, however, elevated probabilities for 24-hour
precipitation totals exceeding an inch are still depicted over parts of the
Southeast, the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and the Appalachians on day 8.
Although there is modest support in the reforecast guidance, a slight risk of
heavy precipitation remains issued for the region for Apr 29. As the frontal
system is forecast to track across the Eastern Seaboard, below normal
temperatures are likely to prevail over the Mississippi Valley, with the
potential for frost over portions of the Midwest early in the period. Farther
south, increased wind speeds are also possible, mainly across the Southeast.
Reforecast tools indicate elevated probabilities for sustained winds exceeding
the 85th percentile in the region, however wind speeds are not expected to
exceed hazard thresholds, and no wind-related hazards are issued in today's
outlook.



Later in the outlook period, the 0z and 6z GEFS feature a broad area of
surface
low pressure deepening over the southern High Plains tied to the
aforementioned
troughing aloft by day 10 (May 1). Deterministic solutions feature an enhanced
low-level jet setting up over the Plains to help advect Gulf moisture, and
ensemble members in the 0z GEFS show a good convergence of solutions at this
lead (day 11) for daily precipitation amounts exceeding a half of inch focused
over the Lower Mississippi Valley. Although the ECMWF favors a slightly later
arrival of surface low pressure and enhanced precipitation across the
south-central CONUS, there is agreement in the reforecast tools indicating at
least a 20% chance that 3-day rainfall accumulations exceed the 85th
percentile
and 1 inch extending from portions of the Southern and Central Plains eastward
to the Mississippi Valley. Thus, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is added
to today's outlook from May 1 to 4. The continuation of enhanced precipitation
over the Lower Mississippi Valley into early May is likely to exacerbate
anomalously wet antecedent conditions (streamflow and soil moisture anomalies
remain well above-average) and may trigger localized flooding in the region.



Elsewhere across North America, there is more disagreement between today's
GEFS
and ECMWF ensembles regarding potential atmospheric river activity to increase
chances of heavy precipitation over the Pacific Northwest. While the ECMWF
maintains some of this potential early in week-2, the GEFS favors much of the
higher precipitation amounts to occur prior to the start of week-2. Across
Alaska, weak mid-level flow is favored and is likely to result in a fairly dry
and warm pattern throughout the week-2 period. The continuation of above-
normal
temperatures may affect river ice breakup conditions heading into early May.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed April 21 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 27 - MAY 01, 2021

Todays model solutions are in fair agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern forecast across North America and adjacent ocean
areas during the 6-10 day period. A trough is predicted south of the
Aleutians,
while anomalous ridging with positive 500-hPa anomalies is forecast over the
Bering Sea. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF and GEFS
ensemble means slightly greater than the Canadian ensemble mean, due to recent
model skill. The resultant manual blend features near normal 500-hPa heights
across much of the CONUS. Above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over
northwestern Mainland Alaska, while below normal 500-hPa heights are expected
over the remainder of Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians, and the Alaska
Panhandle.

Probabilities for below normal temperatures are elevated across the Pacific
Northwest,the Northern Great Basin, and parts of Northern Rockies, while above
normal temperature probabilities are increased over most of the eastern CONUS
and parts of the Central and Southern Plains, supported by most of the
dynamical tools. Above normal temperature probabilities are increased across
western Alaska, while below normal temperatures are favored over eastern
Alaska, consistent with ECMWF Calibrated Reforecast tool.

Above normal precipitation is favored over the Pacific Northwest and the
Northern Great Basin due to the potential emergence of shortwave troughs ahead
of a longwave trough south of the Gulf of Alaska. Chances of below normal
precipitation are enhanced across parts of the Southern Rockies and the
Southern Plains, while above normal precipitation is more likely over the
Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and the
Southeast, consistent with operational Autoblend and ERF Consolidation tools.
Also, a shortwave trough and associated surface low pressure system are
forecast to track through these areas during the 6-10 day period. Below normal
precipitation is favored across Alaska, supported by the GEFS and ECMWF
Calibrated Reforecast tools.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
fair model agreement with some disagreement among the the temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 29 - MAY 05, 2021

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in fair agreement on the
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
Anomalous troughing with below normal 500-hPa heights is forecast south of the
Gulf of Alaska, while progressive flow is expected throughout the CONUS.
Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF ensemble mean greater
than the GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to recent model skill. The
resultant manual blend features near normal 500-hPa heights over much of the
CONUS and Alaska.

The progressive flow results in a variable temperature pattern that favors
near
or above normal temperatures for much of the CONUS. Probabilities for below
normal temperatures are slightly elevated across parts of the Central Plains,
supported by the GEFS Calibrated reforecast tool. Near to above normal
temperatures are favored over Alaska, consistent with GEFS and ECMWF
Calibrated
refrecast tools.

Chances of below normal precipitation are enhanced across northern California,
parts of the Southern Plains, and the Southern Rockies, while above normal
precipitation is favored over parts of the eastern and southeastern CONUS,
consistent with ERF consolidation and ECMWF calibrated reforecast tools.
Transient mid-level flow favors near normal precipitation for the remainder of
the CONUS. Below normal precipitation is more likely across Alaska, supported
by most dynamical tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
fair model agreement with some disagreement among the the temperature and
precipitation tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Widespread Critical conditions are still expected across parts of
the Southwest into the southern High Plains tomorrow. Latest
guidance consensus depicts 10-20% RH overlapping with widespread 20+
mph sustained westerly winds for multiple hours during the
afternoon. Green-up has reduced fuel receptiveness to a small
degree, with ERCs remaining around average across several locales.
However, fuels remain dry enough to support some fire-spread
potential.

Widespread high-end Elevated conditions also remain a concern across
portions of North Dakota, with 15-20 mph sustained southwesterly
winds overlapping 20-25% RH by afternoon peak heating. Consideration
was given to a Critical area addition across central into eastern
North Dakota, however, surface winds appear too weak on a widespread
basis in the latest guidance to support an upgrade at this time.

Elevated conditions are still forecast in the vicinity of the Harney
Basin in southeast Oregon tomorrow, supported by downslope flow
along the lee of the southern Cascades. Latest guidance consensus
still shows 15-20% RH coinciding with 15-25 mph westerly surface
winds during the afternoon.

Brief, low-end Elevated conditions are possible across portions of
central into eastern North Carolina and far southeast Virginia by
afternoon peak heating tomorrow. However, green-up and Day 1
precipitation accumulations may hinder fuel receptiveness,
precluding an Elevated delineation at this time. An Elevated area
may be added in future Day 1 outlooks if drier, windier conditions
appear more likely.

..Squitieri.. 04/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0228 AM CDT Wed Apr 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Thursday, an upper-level trough will shift slowly east across the
Rockies. This will lead to lee cyclogenesis in eastern Colorado and
critical fire weather conditions across a large portion of the
Southwest and Southern High Plains.

...Southeast Arizona into the southern High Plains...
Strong southwesterly flow aloft is expected to extend to the surface
across much of the Southwest as the boundary layer deepens through
deep vertical mixing. In addition, the surface pressure gradient
will tighten in response to the lee cyclogenesis in eastern
Colorado. This will combine for broad 25 mph winds across much of
southeast Arizona and New Mexico with relative humidity ranging from
8 to 15 percent.

...Northern Plains...
A tightening pressure gradient across the Plains will bring an
increase in surface winds likely to the 15 to 20 mph range across
the northern Plains. Cloud cover will limit surface heating and thus
keep relative humidity higher in the vicinity of a weak mid-level
shortwave trough moving through South Dakota. However, north of this
cloud shield, very dry surface conditions are expected with relative
humidity of 10 to 20 percent. These dry and windy conditions coupled
with ongoing drought conditions will lead to an elevated threat for
large fires on Thursday.

...Eastern Oregon into southwest Idaho and northern Nevada...
Dry and breezy northwesterly flow is expected in eastern Oregon as a
mid-level shortwave trough digs into the Pacific Northwest. These
winds will increase in response to a strengthening surface pressure
gradient and partly due to vertical mixing transporting stronger
mid-level flow to the surface. Fuels vary in this region with some
snowcover still present on higher peaks, but several smoke plumes in
this area in recent days show there are critical fuels in the area
and thus an elevated threat for large fires.

...Heavy Rainfall across parts of the Southeast Saturday...

...Overview...

Progressive upper level flow is expected to evolve over the course
of the period with the main systems of interest being shortwave
energy deepening over the Northeast/New England late this weekend
and early next week while a deeper longwave trough pushes onshore
the West Coast. As it reaches the Central Plains by day 7, a more
significant storm system could bring a variety of weather hazards
to the central U.S. by the middle of next week. Temperatures will
be variable during the period, modulated by frontal passages.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The 21.00Z and 21.06Z guidance showed fairly good clustering at
the starting point of the medium range. A multi-model blend of the
deterministic guidance was sufficient for the low pressure system
tracking from the mid-Mississippi Valley on day 3 /Saturday/ to
New England on day 5 /Monday/. The 06Z GFS was less favored
though, as it was showing a faster bias compared to the other
deterministic global models and the 00Z GFS was more agreeable and
therefore was included more in the blend. Elsewhere, the ECMWF
continued to be a slower solution with the next trough coming
through the West U.S. and the CMC (and to some degree the UKMET)
offered a more consensus approach. Either way, once the trough
ejects into the Plains and cyclogenesis takes place, all of the
models actually come together for a reasonable solution for day
6/7 in what may evolve into a more amplified flow pattern. The
ECENS/GEFS means were used more for day 6/7 and this resulted in a
blend that trended well with continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Low pressure in the Tennessee Valley early Saturday will promote
shower and storms, possibly severe (see SPC), with locally heavy
rain especially over parts of Georgia and through the Carolinas.
The system should then lift up the East Coast as trailing northern
stream energy from the Great Lakes region merges into the coastal
system and possibly closes an upper low. Enhanced rainfall is
possible from parts of the Mid-Atlantic into New England with
windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens.

In the West, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will work into the West during the weekend into early next
week. This system will spread lower elevation rain/mountain snow
focused from the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies southward
into California and the Great Basin/central Rockies. The highest
totals with this system will likely be from the Pacific Northwest
into the Sierra Nevada. The majority of precipitation should be
light to moderate though parts of the central West Coast and
Sierra Nevada could see a period of locally enhanced activity.
Once the system moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will
increase for convectively-driven rainfall over parts of the Plains
and Mississippi Valley. See SPC for details on the potential
severe weather threat.

In the wake of the eastern system, cooler than normal temperatures
will be prevalent over the Ohio Valley and southern Mid-Atlantic
into the Northeast. An area of above normal temperatures over
parts of the West/Great Basin ahead of the Pacific upper
trough/low will shift eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains by early next week and into the Northeastern 1/4 of the
CONUS by midweek. Best potential for one or more days with
temperatures 10F or more above normal will extend from near the
Great Basin through the central-southern Rockies into the
Plains/Midwest where temperatures may climb well into the 80s/70s,
respectively. Trailing the front that crosses the West,
temperatures over the region will decline to 5-15F colder than
normal by next Monday-Tuesday and the back to near or slightly
above normal Wednesday.

...More winter weather forecast over northern New England through
Friday, and another shot of snow expected in the Mountain West...

...Record cold temperatures will expand eastward into the Ohio
Valley and Mid-Atlantic Thursday morning...

...Fire weather threat increasing over the Desert Southwest
through tomorrow, as well as over the Southeast U.S. coast today...

Much of the active weather today will be associated with an
intensifying low pressure system currently lifting northeast into
New England, with snow showers and mixed rain/snow moving through
the Adirondacks and Green ranges. By tonight, a swath of wet snow
is expected to expand northeastward near the Canadian border from
New York into far northern New England through Friday morning as
the storm center passes just to the south. Total snowfall amounts
of 4 to 6 inches are forecast in these areas with 8 to 12 inches
possible near the northern tip of Maine and New Hampshire. As
such, Winter Weather Advisories are in effect for portions of
northern New York extending toward the northern tip of Maine.
Meanwhile in the Midwest, cold air flowing over the Great Lakes
will bring chances of lake-enhanced snow to the region, with 2 to
3 inches forecast downwind of the lakes. Precipitation will fall
as liquid in the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England, with quick
moving showers and thunderstorms anticipated this afternoon as a
cold front sweeps through the region. Some storms may be strong to
severe ahead of the front; the Storm Prediction Center has issued
a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms for the Mid-Atlantic coast
to southern New England through this evening, primarily for a
threat of damaging wind and hail.

Unseasonably cold air is still on track to linger over the central
U.S., before expanding toward the eastern U.S Thursday, leading to
widespread Freeze Watches and Warnings that cover these respective
regions. Numerous daily record low temperatures are forecast to be
tied or broken Thursday morning as temperatures dip to below
freezing--around 20-25 degrees below average for late April.
Residents in these areas are encouraged to take preventative
measures to mitigate the impacts of sub-freezing temperatures on
vulnerable vegetation if possible.  By Friday, the cold airmass
will moderate as it drifts east, although low temperatures will
remain around 10 degrees below normal in the Central U.S., with
lows hovering in the mid-30's to 40's. Some record lows may be
threatened in the Mid-Atlantic Friday morning, but temperatures
are forecast to remain above freezing. In the western U.S., a low
pressure system will bring lingering light snow across the central
Rockies for the next few days while another surge of cold air from
western Canada reaches the northern Rockies/High Plains on
Thursday. Temperatures will once again tumble, along with a quick
burst of snow, as the cold front passes through much of Montana by
Thursday evening.  The snow should move further south into Wyoming
by Friday morning. 3 to 4 inches (up to 6 in the mountains) is
possible with this activity.

Meanwhile, active weather across southern Florida is expected to
gradually move offshore as drier air arrives behind a front.  The
dry, windy conditions behind the front are forecast to increase
the fire weather threat over the Carolinas today with a Critical
risk of fire weather in place over the region per the Storm
Prediction Center. Little improvement of fire weather conditions
has occurred over Desert Southwest since yesterday; another
Critical fire weather risk is in place over the region. The main
area of concern will shift east tomorrow into far eastern Arizona,
expanding through New Mexico, and into the Texas Panhandle.
Deepening low pressure will couple with dry conditions to promote
another Critical risk of fire weather in the region. Moreover, an
Elevated risk of fire weather is in effect tomorrow over portions
of North Dakota into Minnesota, and over Southern Washington
running through Idaho and Nevada.

Attention turns to the southern Plains and Southeast Friday
morning as a moisture-laden frontal system develops over the area.
Widespread showers and thunderstorms are likely as a warm front
lifts north. The unstable airmass may be problematic for heavy
rain and severe weather. Accordingly, a Slight risk of excessive
rainfall and severe weather have been issued by the Weather
Prediction Center and Storm Prediction Center, respectively.
Stormy conditions will abate late this weekend as the system exits
to the east.

and Mississippi Valley. See SPC for details on the potential
severe weather threat.

In the wake of the eastern system, cooler than normal temperatures
will be prevalent over the Ohio Valley and southern Mid-Atlantic
into the Northeast. An area of above normal temperatures over
parts of the West/Great Basin ahead of the Pacific upper
trough/low will shift eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains by early next week and into the Northeastern 1/4 of the
CONUS by midweek. Best potential for one or more days with
temperatures 10F or more above normal will extend from near the
Great Basin through the central-southern Rockies into the
Plains/Midwest where temperatures may climb well into the 80s/70s,
respectively. Trailing the front that crosses the West,
temperatures over the region will decline to 5-15F colder than
normal by next Monday-Tuesday and the back to near or slightly
above normal Wednesday.

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 24 2021 - 12Z Wed Apr 28 2021

...Heavy Rainfall across parts of the Southeast Saturday...

...Overview...

Progressive upper level flow is expected to evolve over the course
of the period with the main systems of interest being shortwave
energy deepening over the Northeast/New England late this weekend
and early next week while a deeper longwave trough pushes onshore
the West Coast. As it reaches the Central Plains by day 7, a more
significant storm system could bring a variety of weather hazards
to the central U.S. by the middle of next week. Temperatures will
be variable during the period, modulated by frontal passages.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The 21.00Z and 21.06Z guidance showed fairly good clustering at
the starting point of the medium range. A multi-model blend of the
deterministic guidance was sufficient for the low pressure system
tracking from the mid-Mississippi Valley on day 3 /Saturday/ to
New England on day 5 /Monday/. The 06Z GFS was less favored
though, as it was showing a faster bias compared to the other
deterministic global models and the 00Z GFS was more agreeable and
therefore was included more in the blend. Elsewhere, the ECMWF
continued to be a slower solution with the next trough coming
through the West U.S. and the CMC (and to some degree the UKMET)
offered a more consensus approach. Either way, once the trough
ejects into the Plains and cyclogenesis takes place, all of the
models actually come together for a reasonable solution for day
6/7 in what may evolve into a more amplified flow pattern. The
ECENS/GEFS means were used more for day 6/7 and this resulted in a
blend that trended well with continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Low pressure in the Tennessee Valley early Saturday will promote
shower and storms, possibly severe (see SPC), with locally heavy
rain especially over parts of Georgia and through the Carolinas.
The system should then lift up the East Coast as trailing northern
stream energy from the Great Lakes region merges into the coastal
system and possibly closes an upper low. Enhanced rainfall is
possible from parts of the Mid-Atlantic into New England with
windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens.

In the West, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will work into the West during the weekend into early next
week. This system will spread lower elevation rain/mountain snow
focused from the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies southward
into California and the Great Basin/central Rockies. The highest
totals with this system will likely be from the Pacific Northwest
into the Sierra Nevada. The majority of precipitation should be
light to moderate though parts of the central West Coast and
Sierra Nevada could see a period of locally enhanced activity.
Once the system moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will
increase for convectively-driven rainfall over parts of the Plains
and Mississippi Valley. See SPC for details on the potential
severe weather threat.

In the wake of the eastern system, cooler than normal temperatures
will be prevalent over the Ohio Valley and southern Mid-Atlantic
into the Northeast. An area of above normal temperatures over
parts of the West/Great Basin ahead of the Pacific upper
trough/low will shift eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains by early next week and into the Northeastern 1/4 of the
CONUS by midweek. Best potential for one or more days with
temperatures 10F or more above normal will extend from near the
Great Basin through the central-southern Rockies into the
Plains/Midwest where temperatures may climb well into the 80s/70s,
respectively. Trailing the front that crosses the West,
temperatures over the region will decline to 5-15F colder than
normal by next Monday-Tuesday and the back to near or slightly
above normal Wednesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1153 PM CDT Wed Apr 21 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NORTH DAKOTA...

...Synopsis...
...Southern High Plains...
Strong lee cyclogenesis is forecast in southeastern Colorado through
the day as a mid-level shortwave trough traverses the Rockies.
Moderate to strong mid-level southwesterly flow will accompany this
mid-level trough and overspread portions of the Southwest and
Southern Plains. Surface winds are expected to increase through the
day as the pressure gradient tightens. Deep mixing in excess of 3km
will help to transport some of the stronger mid-level flow to the
surface where relative humidity of 8 to 13 percent is forecast.

...Northern Plains...
Very dry and breezy conditions are expected in the northern Plains
this afternoon. Sustained winds are expected to be around 15 mph
across much of north Dakota and northwest Minnesota, but some
sustained winds may exceed 20 mph, especially across eastern North
Dakota. Forecast wind speeds are borderline for critical conditions,
but relative humidity is forecast to be between 10 and 15 percent
and this specific region has seen very little precipitation in the
past month with record low fuel moisture observed. Therefore, the
extreme dryness from fuels and relative humidity supports the need
for a critical delineation.

...Southeast Oregon into southwest Idaho and northern Nevada...
A mid-level shortwave trough will dig southeastward through the
Pacific Northwest today. Some surface cyclogenesis is expected in
the Columbia Basin and northern Great Basin. This will strengthen
the pressure gradient across Oregon. Surface winds will increase as
a result of the tightening pressure gradient. In addition, deep
mixing in excess of 3 km will transport stronger mid-level flow
downward and aid in strengthening northwesterly surface flow.
Critical meteorological conditions will likely be met across a large
portion of the elevated area, but fuels in this region are currently
only marginally dry. Therefore, no critical delineation has been
added.

...Mid Atlantic into the Carolinas...
Dry and breezy conditions are expected in the post frontal airmass
along the East Coast. However, the large-fire threat should be
mitigated as the strongest winds and lowest relative humidity are
expected in areas which received precipitation today with weaker
winds expected farther south across the Carolinas where fuels remain
more dry.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN ARIZONA ACROSS NEW MEXICO
AND INTO SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
On Friday, a surface low is forecast to slowly drift from southeast
Colorado into the Texas Panhandle while slowly deepening. This will
tighten the pressure gradient and increase wind speeds across much
of the Southwest and southern Plains. The strongest winds are
forecast from northern Arizona across New Mexico and into Southwest
Texas where deep mixing is forecast to bring stronger mid-level flow
to the surface. Wind speeds in this region are expected to be 20 to
30 mph with relative humidity from 10 to 15 percent. Fuel dryness
will vary across the region with more moist fuels at higher
elevations. However, at least some fuels are cured sufficiently to
carry fire as seen by numerous smoke plumes observed on visible
satellite over the past week.

...Heavy snow possible for the Sierra Sunday...

...Heavy rain threat for parts of the southern Plains into the
South next week...

...Overview...

Progressive yet modestly amplified/blocky upper level flow will
favor a couple robust systems across the lower 48 next week. The
first will be through the West where an incoming longwave trough
and surface cold front will deliver enough moisture into the
Sierra for appreciable to perhaps significant snow to higher
elevations with light to modest rain for the lowlands. A healthy
amount of moisture should expand across the Great Basin as well.
As this trough reaches the Plains, southerly flow out of the Gulf
may add moisture to an unstable environment where severe weather
is possible, which may lead to local areas of heavy rain. This
system will track toward the Great Lakes with a continued threat
of modest to perhaps locally heavy rain across the lower
Mississippi Valley next Wed-Thu. Temperatures will be variable
during the period, modulated by frontal passages.

 ...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/21 and 18Z/21 guidance cycles, the deterministic
models offered a reasonably well-clustered consensus for the
exiting system off New England and the incoming western trough.
However, as in previous days, the GFS/GEFS were quicker than the
ECMWF/Canadian (and their ensembles) as well as the UKMET and
continuity as it moves through the Great Basin/Southwest. This may
be tied to a lack of definition of trailing energy out of western
Canada/eastern Alaska on the east side of an upper high that would
act to slow the trough progression. Again favored the slower
solutions near the ECMWF for the Tue-Thu period, though there was
actually a bit closer agreement by next Thu as the system lifts
toward the Great Lakes. Increased the ensemble weighting of the
ECMWF ensemble mean as the UKMET then Canadian were dropped from
the blend and incorporated a small minority weighting of the GEFS
mean since even though the ECMWF ensemble mean has been quite
consistent, the pattern does allow for a somewhat quicker pace.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Exiting system in the Northeast will wrap around showers (some
snow in higher elevations) on Sunday into Monday. Some enhanced
rainfall is possible over New England with windy conditions
region-wide as the low deepens. Temperatures will be cool behind
the front before warming up Tue-Thu.

In the West, the incoming Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will push through California Sunday and the Great Basin
Monday. This system will spread lower elevation rain/mountain snow
focused over southwestern Oregon down into northern and central
California, especially in the Sierra. Modest rain/snow will also
fall across the Great Basin/central Rockies with lowering snow
levels behind the front. The highest totals with this system will
be into the Sierra where over a foot is possible. Once the system
moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will increase for severe
weather (see SPC for details) and the potential for locally heavy
rainfall. This system will continue eastward where a continued
supply of Gulf moisture ahead of the boundary will sustain the
chance for modest to locally heavy rain through the lower
Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee and perhaps Ohio Valley as
well.

An area of above normal temperatures over parts of the Rockies and
into the Plains by early next week will shift into the
northeastern 1/4 of the CONUS by midweek. Temperatures may rise
well into the 70s and low 80s. Trailing the front that crosses the
West, temperatures over the region will decline to 5-15F colder
than normal by next Mon-Tue and the back to near and slightly
above normal Wed-Thu.

Monday. This system will spread lower elevation rain/mountain snow
focused over southwestern Oregon down into northern and central
California, especially in the Sierra. Modest rain/snow will also
fall across the Great Basin/central Rockies with lowering snow
levels behind the front. The highest totals with this system will
be into the Sierra where over a foot is possible. Once the system
moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will increase for severe
weather (see SPC for details) and the potential for locally heavy
rainfall. This system will continue eastward where a continued
supply of Gulf moisture ahead of the boundary will sustain the
chance for modest to locally heavy rain through the lower
Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee and perhaps Ohio Valley as
well.

An area of above normal temperatures over parts of the Rockies and
into the Plains by early next week will shift into the
northeastern 1/4 of the CONUS by midweek. Temperatures may rise
well into the 70s and low 80s. Trailing the front that crosses the
West, temperatures over the region will decline to 5-15F colder
than normal by next Mon-Tue and the back to near and slightly
above normal Wed-Thu.

...Snow lingers over northern Maine into Friday as another shot of
cold air and snow moves into the northern Rockies and High
Plains...

...Record cold temperatures today across the central to eastern
U.S. will moderate on Friday...

...A complex low pressure system will begin to bring a threat of
heavy rain and severe thunderstorms across the Deep South on
Friday...

...Fire weather threat increasing over the Desert Southwest
through tomorrow, as well as over the Southeast U.S. coast today...

The intensifying low pressure system that recently brought wet
snow across the Ohio Valley to the interior Northeast is beginning
to move into southeastern Canada.  However, it forward motion is
being slowed down by a blocky weather pattern across much of
Canada.  The system will continue to intensify over the Canadian
Maritimes today as it rotates snow back toward northern Maine
where a foot of accumulation is still possible near the Canadian
border.  The circulation of the low will also expand in size as it
pulls more cold air across the Great Lakes and down into the East
Coast.  In fact, some lake-enhanced snow is expected today
downwind of the Great Lakes.  Winds will remain strong and gusty
across much of the Northeast into the Mid-Atlantic today and they
will be slow to subside on Saturday.

A large dome of unseasonably cold air will expand eastward into
much of the eastern U.S. under a large area of high pressure
centered over the Mid-Mississippi Valley.  Freeze Warnings and
Frost Advisories remain in effect across multiple states from the
central Plains eastward to the Appalachians and northern
Mid-Atlantic where numerous daily record low temperatures are
forecast to be tied or broken.  By Friday, the cold airmass will
moderate as it drifts east, although low temperatures will still
be around 10 degrees below normal in the Central U.S., with lows
hovering in the mid-30's to 40's.

In the western U.S., a low pressure system will bring lingering
light snow across the central Rockies for the next few days as
another dome of cold air from western Canada is poised to surge
into the northern Rockies/High Plains. Temperatures will once
again tumble, along with a quick burst of snow, as the associated
cold front passes through much of Montana by this evening.  The
higher elevations will once again receive the heaviest snowfall
amounts, with 6 to 12 inches possible.  The snow should then move
further south into Wyoming by Friday morning where 3 to 4 inches,
with up to 6 in the mountains, is forecast.

Meanwhile, little improvement of fire weather conditions is
forecast for the Desert Southwest as another Critical fire weather
risk is in place over the region. The main area of concern will
shift east tomorrow into far eastern Arizona, expanding through
New Mexico, and into the Texas Panhandle. Deepening low pressure
will couple with dry conditions to promote another Critical risk
of fire weather in the region. Moreover, an Elevated risk of fire
weather is in effect tomorrow over portions of North Dakota into
Minnesota, and over Southern Washington running through Idaho and
Nevada.

Attention turns to the southern Plains and Southeast Friday
morning as a moisture-laden frontal system develops over the area.
Widespread showers and thunderstorms are likely as a warm front
lifts north. The unstable airmass may be problematic for heavy
rain and severe weather. Accordingly, a Slight risk of excessive
rainfall and severe weather have been issued by the Weather
Prediction Center and Storm Prediction Center, respectively.
Stormy conditions will abate late this weekend as the system exits
to the east.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1232 AM CDT Thu Sep 23 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
Early morning surface observations show a cold front along the
US/Canada border. This feature will begin to shift southward through
the day as the parent surface low shifts eastward into the Canadian
Prairies in tandem with a passing upper-level trough. The passage of
this dry cold front, along with weak surface pressure falls
along/ahead of the boundary, will support increasing winds and
heightened fire weather concerns across parts of the Plains. Further
west where fuels are somewhat drier, weak surface flow will limit
most fire weather threats, though localized concerns may evolve in
northern California.

...Southern Plains...
Modest zonal flow across the central Rockies will yield some lee
troughing across the central High Plains ahead of the approaching
cold front. Weak surface pressure falls are already noted in morning
observations and support this general idea. The resulting mass
response will yield increasing southerly winds from northwest TX
into KS. An unseasonably dry air mass in place across TX and OK
(where dewpoint values are near the 10th percentile for this time of
year) and offshore flow along the Gulf Coast will support little
moisture return and RH values in the teens and low 20s this
afternoon. With ERC values continuing to climb close to the 90th
percentile, elevated conditions appear likely.

...Central High Plains...
Winds are forecast to increase to 15-20 mph in the wake of the cold
frontal passage this afternoon. While temperatures will see some
moderation, dry air advection from the north and a slight downslope
component will support RH reductions into the teens and low 20s.
While wind gusts up to 20-30 mph are possible during peak heating,
the potential for sustained 20+ mph winds appears low. Recent fuel
reports from the field suggest that fuels are generally receptive
and should support a elevated fire weather conditions.

...Northern California...
Building surface high pressure over the Pacific Northwest will
induce northerly downslope winds through the northern Sacramento
Valley. Winds may reach up to 15 mph by late afternoon, and RH
values in the teens are expected. While elevated conditions are
possible, the spatial extent and duration of this threat appears too
limited for highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Thu Sep 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
A cold front/surface trough is forecast to stall across the central
Plains Friday afternoon as the synoptic low shifts into southeastern
Canada. Flanking surface high pressure to the northwest and
southeast will support increasing pressure-gradient winds across the
northern and southern Plains. This will introduce at least low-end
fire weather concerns for parts of the Plains where fuels are dry.
Elsewhere, nebulous surface patterns with weak flow or rain chances
will result in low fire weather potential.

...Dakotas...
Although surface high pressure will be settling into the region
through the day, pressure-gradient winds are forecast to reach
around 15 mph and will likely be augmented by 20-25 mph gusts during
peak daytime heating. Dry air advecting into the region and modest
diurnal warming will likely support RH reductions into the low 20s.
While areas of elevated conditions appear probable, confidence in
the coverage of such conditions remains somewhat uncertain due to
spread in guidance. The current risk area delineates where favorable
overlap of winds, low RH, and dry fuels is most likely, but elevated
conditions may extend further east into ND.

...Oklahoma...
Breezy conditions are expected Friday afternoon as southwest
pressure-gradient winds increase to 15-20 mph. While RH values
should improve compared to Thursday, limited moisture recovery will
likely support another day of relative humidity values in the 20s.
Fuels remain receptive after a prolonged period of limited rainfall,
and should support a fire weather concern. Elevated conditions
appear most likely across north-central portions of the state, but
may evolve from western OK to southeast KS.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
223 AM EDT Thu Sep 23 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Sep 26 2021 - 12Z Thu Sep 30 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging over far eastern Canada and initially over
south-central Canada/Northern Plains will favor troughing/closed
upper low over the Great Lakes/Northeast and a small closed low
over the Southwest.  Another trough and cold front over the
northeast Pacific on Sunday will track southeastward early next
week toward British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest, and
encompass much of the Intermountain West by midweek.  This favors
amplification of the downstream ridge over the Midwest and western
Great Lakes.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

There are still some differences in the models with the rather
complex interaction of several upper level features over the Great
Lakes/southern Canada late this weekend, with the CMC most
amplified and the GFS quickest to lift the trough out.  Part of
this is tied to the movement of a Southwestern upper low that will
likely only slowly move eastward as it eventually becomes absorbed
by the next trough over the Rockies by mid week.  A blended
solution continued to serve as a good starting point in the
forecast process.

For the western U.S., a pattern change is expected to evolve as
the upper ridge initially over the region is shunted eastward
across the Plains as a strong Pacific storm system reaches the
Pacific Northwest by Tuesday.  Recent GFS runs have been ahead of
the ensemble means, particularly the 18Z GFS.  The 12Z and 00Z
runs were a bit closer to the model consensus and thus more
weighting was applied to the 12Z versus 18Z run for
fronts/pressures, along with some of the ECMWF and the EC/GEFS
mean.  The CMC remains more amplified across the eastern U.S. for
the end of the forecast period.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Rainfall from the exiting storm system in the short range forecast
period should be primarily gone by early Sunday, with perhaps some
lingering showers across Maine.  Meanwhile, a stationary/stalled
frontal boundary draped across the Florida peninsula will bring
daily chances of diurnally-driven thunderstorms.  Return flow
moisture will bring increasing chances of storms to Texas by the
middle of next week, where some models indicate some heavier
amounts.  For the Pacific Northwest, some orographically enhanced
rainfall is likely for western Washington and Oregon for early in
the week as the next Pacific storm system moves inland, and high
elevation snow for the Cascades after the cold front moves
through.  Much of the rest of the nation will be relatively dry,
though some isolated showers and storms will be possible across
portions of the Desert Southwest and the Four Corners region
associated with the weak closed upper level low late this weekend
into early next week.

Near normal temperatures will prevail across the eastern third of
the nation this weekend in the wake of the cold front passage,
along with pleasant humidity levels.  Meanwhile, as ridging aloft
develops across the central U.S. and troughing develops over the
West Coast region, above normal readings are likely across the
central/northern Plains with daily highs 10 to 20 degrees above
normal Sunday into next week.  Meanwhile, the cold front crossing
the West Coast region will likely bring below normal readings in
its wake, with highs running 5 to 15 degrees below normal.

There are still some differences in the models with the rather
complex interaction of several upper level features over the Great
Lakes/southern Canada late this weekend, with the CMC most
amplified and the GFS quickest to lift the trough out.  Part of
this is tied to the movement of a Southwestern upper low that will
likely only slowly move eastward as it eventually becomes absorbed
by the next trough over the Rockies by mid week.  A blended
solution continued to serve as a good starting point in the
forecast process.

For the western U.S., a pattern change is expected to evolve as
the upper ridge initially over the region is shunted eastward
across the Plains as a strong Pacific storm system reaches the
Pacific Northwest by Tuesday.  Recent GFS runs have been ahead of
the ensemble means, particularly the 18Z GFS.  The 12Z and 00Z
runs were a bit closer to the model consensus and thus more
weighting was applied to the 12Z versus 18Z run for
fronts/pressures, along with some of the ECMWF and the EC/GEFS
mean.  The CMC remains more amplified across the eastern U.S. for
the end of the forecast period.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Rainfall from the exiting storm system in the short range forecast
period should be primarily gone by early Sunday, with perhaps some
lingering showers across Maine.  Meanwhile, a stationary/stalled
frontal boundary draped across the Florida peninsula will bring
daily chances of diurnally-driven thunderstorms.  Return flow
moisture will bring increasing chances of storms to Texas by the
middle of next week, where some models indicate some heavier
amounts.  For the Pacific Northwest, some orographically enhanced
rainfall is likely for western Washington and Oregon for early in
the week as the next Pacific storm system moves inland, and high
elevation snow for the Cascades after the cold front moves
through.  Much of the rest of the nation will be relatively dry,
though some isolated showers and storms will be possible across
portions of the Desert Southwest and the Four Corners region
associated with the weak closed upper level low late this weekend
into early next week.

Near normal temperatures will prevail across the eastern third of
the nation this weekend in the wake of the cold front passage,
along with pleasant humidity levels.  Meanwhile, as ridging aloft
develops across the central U.S. and troughing develops over the
West Coast region, above normal readings are likely across the
central/northern Plains with daily highs 10 to 20 degrees above
normal Sunday into next week.  Meanwhile, the cold front crossing
the West Coast region will likely bring below normal readings in
its wake, with highs running 5 to 15 degrees below normal.

...A strong, slow-moving cold front will bring additional heavy
rains and possibly strong to severe thunderstorms to the
Mid-Atlantic on Thursday, before moving into New England on
Friday...

...Strong winds and hazardous beach conditions are expected across
portions of the Great Lakes on Thursday...

Showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop along a strong,
slow-moving cold front as it moves across the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast on Thursday.  A very moist airmass surging north along
the front, along with its slow movement will support redeveloping
storms, with locally heavy rainfall accumulations likely. Flash
flood watches are in effect for at least parts of Thursday from
northern Virginia to southern New York.  In addition to the heavy
rains, there is a risk for strong thunderstorms producing damaging
winds to develop across portions of the central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic on Thursday as well.

The front will continue to move slowly east on Friday, shifting
the focus for heavy rain and possible flash flooding into New
England.  Conditions will remain favorable for a few severe
thunderstorms to develop as well -- producing damaging winds and
even a few tornadoes across portions of New England on Friday.

Across South Florida, the front is expected to remain, supporting
shower and thunderstorms for the new few days, with heavy rainfall
and localized flooding possible.

Across the Great Lakes, an area of low pressure associated with
the front will move slowly north across Lake Huron today --
producing additional rains across the upper Great Lakes region,
along with strong winds and hazardous beach conditions along the
shores of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan on Thursday.

A few thunderstorms are possible over the Southwest beginning late
Thursday and cold front will bring showers and thunderstorms back
into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes on Friday.  Elsewhere,
mostly dry conditions are expected through Friday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1113 AM CDT Thu Sep 23 2021

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

Only minor modifications were made to the outlook in the central
High Plains based on observational and model trends. See the
previous discussion for more details.

..Wendt.. 09/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1232 AM CDT Thu Sep 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning surface observations show a cold front along the
US/Canada border. This feature will begin to shift southward through
the day as the parent surface low shifts eastward into the Canadian
Prairies in tandem with a passing upper-level trough. The passage of
this dry cold front, along with weak surface pressure falls
along/ahead of the boundary, will support increasing winds and
heightened fire weather concerns across parts of the Plains. Further
west where fuels are somewhat drier, weak surface flow will limit
most fire weather threats, though localized concerns may evolve in
northern California.

...Southern Plains...
Modest zonal flow across the central Rockies will yield some lee
troughing across the central High Plains ahead of the approaching
cold front. Weak surface pressure falls are already noted in morning
observations and support this general idea. The resulting mass
response will yield increasing southerly winds from northwest TX
into KS. An unseasonably dry air mass in place across TX and OK
(where dewpoint values are near the 10th percentile for this time of
year) and offshore flow along the Gulf Coast will support little
moisture return and RH values in the teens and low 20s this
afternoon. With ERC values continuing to climb close to the 90th
percentile, elevated conditions appear likely.

...Central High Plains...
Winds are forecast to increase to 15-20 mph in the wake of the cold
frontal passage this afternoon. While temperatures will see some
moderation, dry air advection from the north and a slight downslope
component will support RH reductions into the teens and low 20s.
While wind gusts up to 20-30 mph are possible during peak heating,
the potential for sustained 20+ mph winds appears low. Recent fuel
reports from the field suggest that fuels are generally receptive
and should support a elevated fire weather conditions.

...Northern California...
Building surface high pressure over the Pacific Northwest will
induce northerly downslope winds through the northern Sacramento
Valley. Winds may reach up to 15 mph by late afternoon, and RH
values in the teens are expected. While elevated conditions are
possible, the spatial extent and duration of this threat appears too
limited for highlights.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
207 PM EDT Thu Sep 23 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Sep 26 2021 - 12Z Thu Sep 30 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period starts Sunday with amplified troughing (or
a possible closed upper low) over the Great Lakes/Northeast and a
compact upper low moving across the Southwest. A closed low over
the Northeast Pacific will send a trough into the Western U.S. by
mid-week which should amplify ridging over the center of the
country. This general trough-ridge-trough pattern should maintain
itself through the rest of the period as another trough moves into
the West on Thursday and amplified troughing also becomes
re-established over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Models struggle with the evolution of a closed low/upper trough
over the Great Lakes/Northeast even as early as day 3. The 06z GFS
was quite a bit south with the upper low bringing it across the
Northeast U.S. while the remainder kept the core of the low
farther north in eastern Canada (the CMC was also farther south,
but not as far south as the GFS). After the low moves through, the
GFS remains much faster to lift the troughing out of the East,
likely a result of weaker/faster ridging across the central U.S..
It quickly becomes out of phase with the rest of the guidance by
day 6-7 which all show a more amplified ridge and renewed
troughing hanging around across the East through much of the week.

Out West, the guidance shows good agreement the first half of the
period with initial troughing into the West with some
timing/strength differences later on as a shortwave lifts through
the northern High Plains and the next deep trough reaches the West
Coast by Thursday.

The WPC blend relied on a non-GFS compromise of the deterministic
solutions with WPC continuity through day 4. After that, began to
increase the ensemble means in the blend while still favoring the
more consistent ECMWF with previous shift continuity.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Rainfall from the exiting storm system in the short range forecast
period should be primarily gone by early Sunday, with perhaps some
lingering showers across Maine and back into the lower Great
Lakes. Meanwhile, a weakening and stalled frontal boundary draped
just south of the Florida peninsula will bring daily chances of
diurnally-driven thunderstorms. Return flow moisture will bring
increasing chances of storms to Texas by the middle of next week,
where some models indicate some heavier amounts along portions of
the western Gulf Coast. For the Pacific Northwest, some
orographically enhanced rainfall is likely for western Washington
and Oregon for early in the week as the next Pacific storm system
moves inland, and high elevation snow for the Cascades after the
cold front moves through. Some of this moisture should also spill
out into parts of the Northern Rockies. The next round of
potentially heavy precipiatation should reach the West Coast by
Thursday. Much of the rest of the nation will be relatively dry,
though some isolated showers and storms will be possible across
portions of the Desert Southwest and the Four Corners region
associated with the weak closed upper level low late this weekend
into early next week.

Near normal temperatures will prevail across the eastern third of
the nation this weekend in the wake of the cold front passage,
bringing a more fall like feel. Meanwhile, as ridging amplifies
across the central U.S., above normal readings are likely across
the central/northern Plains with daily highs 10 to 20 degrees
above normal (and locally higher in some spots) Sunday into next
week. The cold front crossing the West Coast region will likely
bring below normal readings in its wake, with highs running 5 to
15 degrees below normal.

the Northeast Pacific will send a trough into the Western U.S. by
mid-week which should amplify ridging over the center of the
country. This general trough-ridge-trough pattern should maintain
itself through the rest of the period as another trough moves into
the West on Thursday and amplified troughing also becomes
re-established over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Models struggle with the evolution of a closed low/upper trough
over the Great Lakes/Northeast even as early as day 3. The 06z GFS
was quite a bit south with the upper low bringing it across the
Northeast U.S. while the remainder kept the core of the low
farther north in eastern Canada (the CMC was also farther south,
but not as far south as the GFS). After the low moves through, the
GFS remains much faster to lift the troughing out of the East,
likely a result of weaker/faster ridging across the central U.S..
It quickly becomes out of phase with the rest of the guidance by
day 6-7 which all show a more amplified ridge and renewed
troughing hanging around across the East through much of the week.

Out West, the guidance shows good agreement the first half of the
period with initial troughing into the West with some
timing/strength differences later on as a shortwave lifts through
the northern High Plains and the next deep trough reaches the West
Coast by Thursday.

The WPC blend relied on a non-GFS compromise of the deterministic
solutions with WPC continuity through day 4. After that, began to
increase the ensemble means in the blend while still favoring the
more consistent ECMWF with previous shift continuity.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Rainfall from the exiting storm system in the short range forecast
period should be primarily gone by early Sunday, with perhaps some
lingering showers across Maine and back into the lower Great
Lakes. Meanwhile, a weakening and stalled frontal boundary draped
just south of the Florida peninsula will bring daily chances of
diurnally-driven thunderstorms. Return flow moisture will bring
increasing chances of storms to Texas by the middle of next week,
where some models indicate some heavier amounts along portions of
the western Gulf Coast. For the Pacific Northwest, some
orographically enhanced rainfall is likely for western Washington
and Oregon for early in the week as the next Pacific storm system
moves inland, and high elevation snow for the Cascades after the
cold front moves through. Some of this moisture should also spill
out into parts of the Northern Rockies. The next round of
potentially heavy precipiatation should reach the West Coast by
Thursday. Much of the rest of the nation will be relatively dry,
though some isolated showers and storms will be possible across
portions of the Desert Southwest and the Four Corners region
associated with the weak closed upper level low late this weekend
into early next week.

Near normal temperatures will prevail across the eastern third of
the nation this weekend in the wake of the cold front passage,
bringing a more fall like feel. Meanwhile, as ridging amplifies
across the central U.S., above normal readings are likely across
the central/northern Plains with daily highs 10 to 20 degrees
above normal (and locally higher in some spots) Sunday into next
week. The cold front crossing the West Coast region will likely
bring below normal readings in its wake, with highs running 5 to
15 degrees below normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 PM CDT Thu Sep 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

The northern Plains elevated area was shifted slightly eastward
based on the latest guidance. Gusty winds are possible farther east,
but RH value still appear too high to warrant and expansion of
highlights.

For the northern Oklahoma, 850 mb winds will be maximized right
along the front in northern Oklahoma into far southern Kansas.
However, these winds be weakening through the day. The surface
gradient near the front along with above normal temperatures still
appears that it will promote around 3 hours of elevated fire
weather.

..Wendt.. 09/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Thu Sep 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
A cold front/surface trough is forecast to stall across the central
Plains Friday afternoon as the synoptic low shifts into southeastern
Canada. Flanking surface high pressure to the northwest and
southeast will support increasing pressure-gradient winds across the
northern and southern Plains. This will introduce at least low-end
fire weather concerns for parts of the Plains where fuels are dry.
Elsewhere, nebulous surface patterns with weak flow or rain chances
will result in low fire weather potential.

...Dakotas...
Although surface high pressure will be settling into the region
through the day, pressure-gradient winds are forecast to reach
around 15 mph and will likely be augmented by 20-25 mph gusts during
peak daytime heating. Dry air advecting into the region and modest
diurnal warming will likely support RH reductions into the low 20s.
While areas of elevated conditions appear probable, confidence in
the coverage of such conditions remains somewhat uncertain due to
spread in guidance. The current risk area delineates where favorable
overlap of winds, low RH, and dry fuels is most likely, but elevated
conditions may extend further east into ND.

...Oklahoma...
Breezy conditions are expected Friday afternoon as southwest
pressure-gradient winds increase to 15-20 mph. While RH values
should improve compared to Thursday, limited moisture recovery will
likely support another day of relative humidity values in the 20s.
Fuels remain receptive after a prolonged period of limited rainfall,
and should support a fire weather concern. Elevated conditions
appear most likely across north-central portions of the state, but
may evolve from western OK to southeast KS.

FOR FRIDAY OCTOBER 01 - THURSDAY OCTOBER 07: Early in Week-2, an amplified
500-hPa trough continues to result in an increased risk of much below norma=

temperatures across parts of interior Mainland Alaska. Despite better skill
from the GEFS recently, the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble have come into better
agreement with respect to the 500-hPa height anomalies across Alaska, with =
the
ECMWF being more aggressive in its depiction of below normal temperature
probabilities, particularly in interior and southwestern portions of the
Mainland. However, both models are less confident in hazardous minimum
temperatures along the North Slope and the northeastern Mainland. As such, =
a
slight risk for much below normal temperatures remains for much of interior
Mainland Alaska for the very beginning of the period (Oct 1), south of the
Brooks Range.



Ensemble means depict a high amplitude 500-hPa ridge axis located east of t=

Mississippi River during Week-2, which is likely to result in the most
anomalous warmth shifting to the higher latitudes of the north-central CONU=
S.
Despite the potential for large positive anomalies early in Week-2, forecas=

high temperatures are not expected to reach hazardous thresholds. Both GEFS
and
ECMWF ensemble guidance depict cooler than normal conditions throughout Wee=
k-2
across the southern tier of the CONUS. The ECMWF ensemble has greater
confidence in the potential for below normal temperatures across the
southwestern and southeastern CONUS, with increased probabilities for
sub-freezing minimum temperatures for parts of the Great Basin and higher
elevations of the Southwest. However, with median first-freeze dates that a=

in
these areas during Week-2 and an increased likelihood of temperatures
remaining
above 40=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF in the Southeast, no minimum temperature hazard=

the
CONUS.



Ensemble model guidance is in good agreement predicting an active storm tra=
ck
across Alaska, with precipitation amounts favored to generally remain near
normal across much of the state for Week-2. Across the CONUS, although
above-normal precipitation is favored across portions of the Central and
Southern High Plains early in the period, precipitation is expected to be

should be welcomed relief in areas in and around the Texas and Oklahoma

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu September 23 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 29 - OCT 03, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. All models put a strong 500-hPa ridge from northern Canada
southward into the eastern half of the CONUS, with the largest positive hei=
ght
anomaly centered south of Hudson Bay. A few models depicted an area of
moderate
negative 500-hPa anomalies in the Southeast, but no model has shown this
consistently. More likely, an area of slightly below-normal 500-hPa heights
will be established off the coast. Farther west, most dynamical models feat=
ure
a mid-level trough stretching from a closed 500-hPa low over eastern Siberi=
a
through northwestern North America into the Pacific Northwest. The largest
negative 500-hPa height anomalies should be centered off the western coast =
of
Canada and south of Alaska.

Below normal temperatures are favored over the western CONUS due to the
forecast trough near or off the coast, though uncertainties about its
magnitude
and position keep the enhanced likelihoods relatively low. Colder weather i=
s
somewhat more likely across Alaska in conjunction with negative 500-hPa hei=
ght
anomalies. Over most of the CONUS, however, there are enhanced odds for
above-normal temperatures associated with the potent 500-hPa ridge, with th=
e
greatest chances for anomalous warmth over the north-central CONUS.

Near to above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over most of
CONUS from the Plains westward, in the area between the western trough and =
the
strong eastern North American ridge. Drier than normal weather is more like=
ly
through most of the eastern half of the CONUS in association with the upper
ridge axis. Enhanced chances decline along and near the Atlantic seaboard,
removed from the largest 500-hPa height anomalies. The trough over western
North America leaves significant uncertainties in surface storm tracks near
Alaska, resulting in few areas of non-climatological probabilities. There i=
s a
small increase in the chances for below-normal precipitation across the
Alaskan
interior, with a bit of an increase in chances for unusually wet weather in
southwest Alaska east of the closed Siberian 500-hPa low.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 3=
0%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offse=
t
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 01 - 07 2021

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement on th=
e
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
All feature de-amplification in the 500-hPa pattern across North America,
although a strong positive height anomaly will remain over the middle and h=
igh
latitudes as the ridge broadly flattens. Some slightly below-normal 500-hPa
heights may evolve over the Southeast, but the rest of central and eastern
North America will continue with anomalously high 500-hPa heights. Farther
west, more marked de-amplification of the 500-hPa trough will leave only mi=
ld
negative height anomalies from Alaska to the CONUS west coast while the
anomalous ridging over the western Aleutians declines.

The broad, flattening ridge should bring above-normal temperatures to most =
of
the CONUS, save the northwestern and southeastern fringes. The potential fo=
r
below-normal heights slightly increases the likelihood of cooler than norma=
l
conditions in Florida. Meanwhile, the weakening trough remaining over Alask=
a
favors below-normal temperatures there.

Chances for surplus precipitation remain over the Northwest to the east sid=
e
of
the decaying trough, and to the southwest of the flattening ridge over the
southern half of the Plains. Meanwhile, subnormal precipitation is favored =
in
part of the interior West and Rockies, and along the broad ridge axis over
most
of the eastern half of the CONUS.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Da=
y
11, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offse=
t
by
some differences among the precipitation tools and the evolution of the
decaying trough near the West Coast..

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic through Friday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over parts
of the Northeast through Saturday...

A front extending from the Lower Great Lakes to the Mid-Atlantic
Coast will move very slowly, almost stationary moving to Northeast
Coast by Saturday.  Moisture streaming off the Atlantic will pool
along the boundary through Friday morning when the moisture flow
weakens slightly.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along
ahead of the front through Saturday morning.  Some of the storms
will produce heavy rain.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over parts of
the Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic through Friday morning.  The
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable.  The excessive rainfall threat weakens slightly on
Friday and continues over parts of the Northeast through Saturday.

Furthermore, upper-level ridging and warm moist air flowing into
the Northeast will allow temperatures to be 10 to 20 degrees above
average over parts of the Northeast through Saturday when the
front moves to the coast.  In addition, the trailing front will
linger over parts of the Florida Peninsula through Saturday,
aiding in the development of showers and thunderstorms over the
region.

Meanwhile, another front over the Upper Midwest to the Great Basin
will move into the Great Lakes overnight Friday and into the Lower
Great Lakes by Saturday.  On Friday, showers and thunderstorms
will develop along and ahead of the boundary over parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes, moving into the Great
Lakes/Ohio Valley on Saturday.

Elsewhere, upper-level energy and moisture over the Southwest will
aid in producing widely scattered showers and thunderstorms over
the area through Saturday. Additionally, upper-level ridging just
off the West Coast and weak high pressure at the surface will
create light wind over the San Joaquin Valley provide stagnant
airflow. Therefore, Air Quality alerts are over parts of
California due to smoke from wildfires.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic through Friday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over parts
of New England through Saturday...

A cold front extending from Lake Ontario to along the Mid-Atlantic
Coast will move slowly into New England through Friday before
stalling over Maine Friday night. The same cold front is also over
central Florida and will slowly move down the peninsula through
this weekend. A narrow ribbon of Atlantic moisture streaming ahead
of the boundary will spread into New England tonight and then
linger over eastern Mass and much of Maine Friday night through
Saturday. Showers and thunderstorms, with embedded heavy rain,
will continue develop along ahead of the front through Saturday.
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms over parts of the Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic
through Friday morning. The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable. The excessive rainfall
threat is Marginal for portions of New England on Friday and
Saturday.

Upper-level ridging and warm moist air flowing into the Northeast
ahead of the cold front will allow temperatures to be 10 to 20
degrees above average over parts of the New England through
Saturday when the front should reach Down East Maine. In addition,
the trailing front drifting down the Florida Peninsula through
Saturday will aid in the further development of showers and
thunderstorms.

Meanwhile, another front over the Upper Midwest to the Great Basin
will move into the Great Lakes overnight Friday and into the Lower
Great Lakes by Saturday. On Friday, showers and thunderstorms will
develop along and ahead of the boundary over parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes, moving into the Great

...Overview...

The medium range period starts Sunday with amplified troughing (or
a possible closed upper low) over the Great Lakes/Northeast and a
compact upper low moving across the Southwest. A closed low over
the Northeast Pacific will send a trough into the Western U.S. by
mid-week which should amplify ridging over the center of the
country. This general trough-ridge-trough pattern should maintain
itself through the rest of the period as another trough moves into
the West on Thursday and amplified troughing also becomes
re-established over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Models struggle with the evolution of a closed low/upper trough
over the Great Lakes/Northeast even as early as day 3. The 06z GFS
was quite a bit south with the upper low bringing it across the
Northeast U.S. while the remainder kept the core of the low
farther north in eastern Canada (the CMC was also farther south,
but not as far south as the GFS). After the low moves through, the
GFS remains much faster to lift the troughing out of the East,
likely a result of weaker/faster ridging across the central U.S..
It quickly becomes out of phase with the rest of the guidance by
day 6-7 which all show a more amplified ridge and renewed
troughing hanging around across the East through much of the week.

Out West, the guidance shows good agreement the first half of the
period with initial troughing into the West with some
timing/strength differences later on as a shortwave lifts through
the northern High Plains and the next deep trough reaches the West
Coast by Thursday.

The WPC blend relied on a non-GFS compromise of the deterministic
solutions with WPC continuity through day 4. After that, began to
increase the ensemble means in the blend while still favoring the
more consistent ECMWF with previous shift continuity.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Rainfall from the exiting storm system in the short range forecast
period should be primarily gone by early Sunday, with perhaps some
lingering showers across Maine and back into the lower Great
Lakes. Meanwhile, a weakening and stalled frontal boundary draped
just south of the Florida peninsula will bring daily chances of
diurnally-driven thunderstorms. Return flow moisture will bring
increasing chances of storms to Texas by the middle of next week,
where some models indicate some heavier amounts along portions of
the western Gulf Coast. For the Pacific Northwest, some
orographically enhanced rainfall is likely for western Washington
and Oregon for early in the week as the next Pacific storm system
moves inland, and high elevation snow for the Cascades after the
cold front moves through. Some of this moisture should also spill
out into parts of the Northern Rockies. The next round of
potentially heavy precipiatation should reach the West Coast by
Thursday. Much of the rest of the nation will be relatively dry,
though some isolated showers and storms will be possible across
portions of the Desert Southwest and the Four Corners region
associated with the weak closed upper level low late this weekend
into early next week.

Near normal temperatures will prevail across the eastern third of
the nation this weekend in the wake of the cold front passage,
bringing a more fall like feel. Meanwhile, as ridging amplifies
across the central U.S., above normal readings are likely across
the central/northern Plains with daily highs 10 to 20 degrees
above normal (and locally higher in some spots) Sunday into next
week. The cold front crossing the West Coast region will likely
bring below normal readings in its wake, with highs running 5 to
15 degrees below normal.

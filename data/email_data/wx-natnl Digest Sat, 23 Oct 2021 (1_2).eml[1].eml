Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1153 AM CDT Fri Oct 22 2021

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...East-central NM...
A small elevated area has been added for portions of east-central
NM, where the latest short-term guidance shows somewhat greater
confidence in the potential for sustained winds of 15-20 mph this
afternoon, in conjunction with minimum RH values of 10-20%. A
broader region of eastern NM into the TX Panhandle will see locally
elevated conditions within a warm and dry environment, but surface
winds outside of the Elevated area are expected to be somewhat
lighter.

..Dean.. 10/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CDT Fri Oct 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level ridge will cross the High Plains as an upper trough,
with multiple embedded impulses, traverses the interior West today.
The low-level mass response will be surface low development across
the Great Basin, with modest surface lee troughing occurring across
the southern High Plains. In both locations, at least locally dry
and breezy conditions are expected by afternoon peak heating. Fuel
receptiveness to significant fire spread across portions of the
Great Basin is relatively poor, with no fire weather highlights
introduced for this area. Finer fuels are relatively more receptive
to fire spread (albeit modestly) across the southern High Plains,
but the spatial and temporal extent of Elevated conditions will
likely remain limited, precluding fire weather highlights this
outlook.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 PM CDT Fri Oct 22 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

No changes have been made to the Elevated area across the southern
High Plains. Some uncertainty remains regarding the northeastward
extent of the threat, which will be determined by the placement of a
slow-moving surface boundary, but otherwise portions of eastern
NM/southeast CO into the TX/OK Panhandles are expected to experience
elevated conditions for several hours during the afternoon. See the
previous discussion below for more information.

..Dean.. 10/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Fri Oct 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
The first in a series of mid-level troughs will impinge on the
central CONUS tomorrow, with a surface low expected to develop and
intensify across the central/southern Plains. Downslope/gradient
southwesterly surface flow will encourage dry and breezy conditions
across the southern High Plains, where multiple preceding days of
dry conditions will support modest priming of the finer (mainly
grass-based) fuels. Up to 15 mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds will coincide with 15-20% RH by afternoon peak heating,
supporting some grass-fire potential and warranting the introduction
of Elevated highlights.

...A Stormy Pattern Continues Next Week for the Nation...


...Overview...

It will be quite the stormy weather pattern for the nation next
week. A lead Midwest upper trough/low and uncertain phasing with
northern stream trough energies digging to the lee of an amplified
central Canadian upper ridge Monday may forge a closed low to work
slowly across the Northeast to the Canadian Maritimes
Tuesday-Thursday with a main low/frontal system whose deep low and
enhanced moisture/rainfall now seems likely to focus further
organizing with development of a deepening coastal low. Well
upstream, multiple rounds of impactful weather for the West Coast
this weekend/Monday will work inland across the Intermountain
West/Rockies and then force Plains cyclo/frontogenesis by midweek
as an amplified upper trough tracks eastward. Flow amplification
from the Pacific to the West should also meanwhile refocus
enhanced periods of precipitation back into the Pacific Northwest
and also quite an amplified and slowing downstream upper trough
over the central to eastern U.S. into later next week, along with
a deepening low and an increasingly active/wet wrapping frontal
system.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of the 00 UTC ECMWF and ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC
National Blend of Models days 3-7 with a focus increasingly on the
ensemble mean over time amid growing run to run model variance due
to phasing and system evolution uncertainties/increasing forecast
spread. These guidance pieces seemed to best cluster with WPC
continuity and be best in line with guidance trends toward
amplification during this forecast period, but still in a pattern
with average to below normal predictability. The 12 UTC GFS/GEFS
have trended more amplified with time over the lower 48 than prior
runs whose uptream flow over the upstream Pacific also tended to
be an outlier solution vs the multi-model ensemble guidance
envelope. However, the 12 UTC ECMWF does still does offer some
less than stellar run to run variance in an albeit still
reasonably similar larger scale flow pattern evolution with a
trend twoard slowing the flow.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A lead Midwest upper trough/low and uncertain phasing with
northern stream trough energies digging to the lee of an amplified
central Canadian upper ridge Monday may forge a closed low to work
slowly across the Northeast to the Canadian Maritimes
Tuesday-Thursday with a main low/frontal system whose deep low and
enhanced moisture/rainfall threat now seems likely to focus
further organizing with development of a deepening coastal low.
Meanwhile across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of
enhanced rains are expected from the Pacific Northwest through
especially California that will likely be heavy at times with
breezy conditions as well. This will especially hold true into
Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume (Atmospheric River)
shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest into California.
Several inches of rain are possible over the multi-day period
(which begins during the short range/this weekend), particularly
across favored windward terrain which may result in some instances
of runoff issues and/or flooding especially over already
vulnerable burn scar areas. Heavy snows are likely for the higher
elevations of the Cascades and especially Sierra, with multiple
feet possible at the highest elevations. Snow levels are expected
to lower Sunday into Monday as the core of the upper trough moves
inland along with the surface cold front. Strong winds are also
possible for the coast and inland along mountain ridges. Some of
this moisture is expected to reach the Intermountain West and the
central/northern Rockies with significant snowfall. The main
associated cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward
across the east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to
present an emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus
with an influx of Gulf moisture. Closed upper trough development
and slowed frontal system progression and rainfall/moisture focus
then suggests a later period enhanced qpf/weather potential over
the East and perhaps in particular the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.
Meanwhile, additional upstream Pacific systems are forecast to
maintain the active pattern out West with periods with enhanced
precipitation chances going into the Pacific Northwest well into
next week.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region. High
temperatures are forecast to be 10-15 degrees above normal ahead
of the cold front and possibly near record temperatures over parts
of Texas and Louisiana. Cooler than normal temperatures are
forecast for much of the West, influenced by the upper trough and
mainly overcast skies. High temperatures may be 10-20+ degrees
below normal early in the week but will moderate by the middle of
next week. These may challenge daily record cool max values over
parts of California into early next week.

It will be quite the stormy weather pattern for the nation next
week. A lead Midwest upper trough/low and uncertain phasing with

central Canadian upper ridge Monday may forge a closed low to work
slowly across the Northeast to the Canadian Maritimes
Tuesday-Thursday with a main low/frontal system whose deep low and
enhanced moisture/rainfall now seems likely to focus further
organizing with development of a deepening coastal low. Well
upstream, multiple rounds of impactful weather for the West Coast
this weekend/Monday will work inland across the Intermountain
West/Rockies and then force Plains cyclo/frontogenesis by midweek
as an amplified upper trough tracks eastward. Flow amplification
from the Pacific to the West should also meanwhile refocus
enhanced periods of precipitation back into the Pacific Northwest

over the central to eastern U.S. into later next week, along with

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 22 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure forecast over the northeastern Pacific is
anticipated to weaken and move further offshore from the West Coast of the
contiguous U.S. during week-2, lessening the potential for hazardous heavy
precipitation and high winds affecting portions of California and the Pacific
Northwest. The mid-level height pattern is anticipated to deamplify throughout
week-2 across the lower 48, decreasing chances for widespread hazards. Surface
cyclone activity favored in the Gulf of Alaska is expected to bring
above-normal precipitation to southern portions of Alaska (excluding the
Aleutians), and increased chances for heavy snow across high elevation areas
of
the southern Alaska Range and Kenai Peninsula from the beginning to middle of
the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Alaska Range and
the
Kenai Peninsula, Sat-Mon, Oct 30-Nov 1.



DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY OCTOBER 25 - FRIDAY OCTOBER 29:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!rxG2m2Z239zvZdCk4I_4H-Hqo2exMNRvteqHUTlhUBpLgwBxuZxDIpRVmydQ_dmjdpZpIgD4$

FOR SATURDAY OCTOBER 30 - FRIDAY NOVEMBER 05: In general, the 0Z ECMWF and
Canadian dynamical models continue to advertise anomalous 500-hPa troughing
overspreading much of the northeastern Pacific during week-1, supporting a
series of storm systems from the Pacific, bringing copious amounts of
precipitation, strong winds, and high elevation snow to many parts of the West
Coast. However, these hazards look to diminish during week-2, as both the GEFS
and ECMWF ensembles favor much of the anomalous troughing to retrograde and
gradually weaken throughout the course of the period. The 0z GEFS continues to
be slower than the 0Z ECMWF and Canadian with this pattern transition, in part
due to its absence of anomalous mid-level ridging over the western CONUS. In
contrast, ridging is predominantly featured in the ECMWF and Canadian over the
western CONUS, which keeps much of the negative mid-level height departures
mostly offshore during early week-2.



The retrograding of this mid-level trough is anticipated to shift the focus of
potential heavy precipitation to Alaska, supporting a potentially strong
surface low over the Aleutians and Gulf of Alaska at the beginning of the
period. The orientation of this storm is predicted to support strong onshore
flow to southern portions of the state. The reforecast tools indicate at least
a 20% chance of 3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentile
and one inch primarily over the Kenai and Chugach mountains. The deterministic
0Z GFS keeps 24-hour snowfall totals across most of the highlighted areas
below
2 feet, although the 6Z GFS indicates many of these areas exceeding 2 feet,
extending across the western portion of the Alaska Range. A broad area of
slight risk of heavy snow is posted for higher elevation areas of the southern
Alaska Range and Kenai Peninsula, Oct 30 to Nov 1, taking into account the
reforecast tools, uncalibrated model ensemble means, and deterministic models.
Should the active and cold pattern continue over Alaska, the potential for
heavy snow may also extend over locations closer to sea level in the upcoming
days. The orientation of this storm may be favorable for elevated chances for
high winds extending from parts of the Kenai Peninsula and southeastern
Mainland Alaska to the Alaska Panhandle, including possible high gap winds
across the Alaska Panhandle. The reforecast tools do not indicate wind speeds
reaching hazards criteria in the region at this time, although there is
inherent difficulty in model guidance capturing high wind speed events.



The Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT) analysis tool suggests much of the
enhanced onshore flow to weaken across the West during week-2. The highest IVT
probabilities are now favored during the week-1 period, though this tool
features a secondary signal predicted by both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
which may support another period of increased precipitation over the
northwestern CONUS by the beginning of November. Reforecast tools show a clear
reduction in the potential for heavy precipitation compared to previous
guidance, but both maintain at least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulations
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch over the Pacific Northwest and
parts
of northern California during the middle of week-2 (Nov 1 to Nov 3). However,
due to precipitation amounts from the raw ensemble guidance not reaching
hazards criteria and reforecast tool 3-day totals generally remaining below 2
inches, slight risk of heavy precipitation is not included for this region.
Although localized flooding cannot be ruled out, particularly for burn scarred
areas of the West, the continued above-normal precipitation is expected to
benefit many drought-stricken areas and help replenish water resources
throughout the West.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri October 22 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 28 - NOV 01, 2021

Most dynamical models today generally agree on the major circulation features
over the North American region. Models continue to deepen the mid-level trough
or cut-off low circulation  forming over the eastern CONUS, especially south
of
New England. Models are also in reasonable agreement on other major features,
specifically the continuing ridge with anomalously high 500-hPa heights
centered in northeastern Canada, a weaker mid-level ridge centered over the
western CONUS, and a moderate to strong trough stretching from Siberia into
the
north-central Pacific, with an axis along the western tier of Alaska. Negative
500-hPa height anomalies are predicted to retrograde to or off the
northwestern
CONUS coast during the period. Models are in less agreement regarding the
magnitude and position of the eastern CONUS trough, and the extent to which
positive height anomalies in the southwestern CONUS and northeastern Canada
are
phased (that is, whether height anomalies in south-central Canada will end up
slightly positive or slightly negative). Based on teleconnections with a
negative 500-hPa height anomaly centered in the eastern CONUS, a more
meridional flow pattern is favored, which increases the magnitude of the
negative anomalies in the northern Pacific and the eastern CONUS, as well as
the positive anomalies in the southwestern CONUS and northeastern Canada.

The trend for the trough off the West Coast to have a decreasing impact on the
Pacific Northwest continues, but above-normal precipitation is still slightly
favored in the region, with below-normal temperatures expected to linger in
western Washington. The positive 500-hPa anomalies forecast over the West
increases the likelihood of above-normal temperatures over a broad part of the
CONUS, from the Southwest through most of the Plains and into the Northeast,
with the greatest chances located near the two 500-hPa positive height anomaly
maxima, specifically in the southwestern and northeastern CONUS. Unusually low
precipitation is favored from the Four Corners States to the Mississippi
Valley
and northward into eastern parts of the Canadian Prairies, with the most
enhanced chances covering the Southwest and the southern half of the Plains,
directly downstream from the southwestern CONUS ridge. With the deepening
trough predicted to drop from Canada into the eastern CONUS, a potent surface
storm should form and transport deep moisture and heavy precipitation into the
Northeast, especially New England.

With troughing expected to continue at the mid-levels across Alaska, an active
storm track should keep south-central and southeastern Alaska wetter than
normal, with subnormal amounts slightly favored farther to the north across
western and central Alaska. The prevailing mid-level trough argues for
continued enhanced chances of below-normal temperatures over most of the
state,
but the storm track should push southerly surface winds from the Gulf of
Alaska
into central and western parts of the state, keeping temperatures closer to
normal in those regions. The latest observations in this region further argue
for moderation, as models have been consistently too cold recently.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, given
overall good model agreement, offset by model diversity in the depth,
position,
and timing of both the developing eastern CONUS trough and the ridging
centered
in the southwestern or west-central CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 30 - NOV 05, 2021

Dynamical model guidance shows a pattern similar to the 6-10 day period, but
there are significant differences in the forecast evolution of the deep
mid-level trough or cut-off low pressure circulation in the East. Models
basically fall into two camps: One shows the eastern U.S. mid-level trough or
cut-off low pushing off to the northeast, keeping mean week-2 height anomalies
only slightly negative in the region, while other models favor keeping a deep
trough and pronounced negative height anomalies across the eastern CONUS. The
evolution of the protracted, amplified ridge in northeastern Canada seems to
drive these two possibilities. Some models start eroding the ridge quickly
during the week-2 period while the decreasing anomaly center moves off to the
northeast. The others keep the ridge roughly in place with only a slight
decrease in magnitude during the period. Neither the progressive nor the
more-amplified solution is favored by a preponderance of the models, but the
more amplified solution is favored based on recent trends and teleconnections
which favor keeping a strong mid-level ridge essentially intact across
northeast Canada. This supports higher chances of below-normal temperatures in
the Southeast and continued abundant precipitation in New England, north of
the
mid-level negative anomaly center and to the left of the storm track.

The more amplified solution, with more pronounced ridges and troughs, would
force the deep trough along and south of Alaska to remain essentially intact
while the southern end of the trough drifts slowly eastward, bringing enhanced
chances of surplus precipitation back into a large part of the Pacific
Northwest. Meanwhile the mid-level ridge stretching from the southwestern
CONUS
into eastern Canada favors abnormally warm and dry weather over most of the
CONUS, except for the wetness in the Northeast, to the north of the negative
mid-level anomaly center, and for odds tilting toward subnormal temperatures
in
the Southeast near the bottom of the trough axis.

In Alaska, the mean upper-level circulation features are similar to the 6-10
day period, with a strong trough along the western tier of the state and
below-normal 500-hPa heights over most of the state. Models are in better
agreement on these features than yesterday. The resultant storm track just
south of the coast should keep enhanced chances of surplus precipitation
across
the south-central and southeastern parts of the state while dryness is
slightly
favored farther to the north. Once again, the implied subnormal temperatures
statewide are reduced, and above-normal temperatures may start filtering into
eastern parts of the state near the end of week-2, increasing chances of mean
near normal temperatures there.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 10% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered on Day 11, 10%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
decent
model agreement, offset by uncertainty in the specific  amplitude and
configuration of the mid-level flow pattern across the CONUS, especially in
the
East.


FORECASTER: Rich Tinker

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 22 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure forecast over the northeastern Pacific is
anticipated to weaken and move further offshore from the West Coast of the
contiguous U.S. during week-2, lessening the potential for hazardous heavy
precipitation and high winds affecting portions of California and the Pacific
Northwest. The mid-level height pattern is anticipated to deamplify throughout
week-2 across the lower 48, decreasing chances for widespread hazards. Surface
cyclone activity favored in the Gulf of Alaska is expected to bring
above-normal precipitation to southern portions of Alaska (excluding the
Aleutians), and increased chances for heavy snow across high elevation areas
of
the southern Alaska Range and Kenai Peninsula from the beginning to middle of
the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Alaska Range and
the
Kenai Peninsula, Sat-Mon, Oct 30-Nov 1.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY OCTOBER 25 - FRIDAY OCTOBER 29:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vmWpCRDyVgxjRUxbNcgPgmxE79z0iXg3fTHNW_6DFgzG9vtnCu-TYilY7GSnpM0pbpsSWOpv$

FOR SATURDAY OCTOBER 30 - FRIDAY NOVEMBER 05: In general, the 0Z ECMWF and
Canadian dynamical models continue to advertise anomalous 500-hPa troughing
overspreading much of the northeastern Pacific during week-1, supporting a
series of storm systems from the Pacific, bringing copious amounts of
precipitation, strong winds, and high elevation snow to many parts of the West
Coast. However, these hazards look to diminish during week-2, as both the GEFS
and ECMWF ensembles favor much of the anomalous troughing to retrograde and
gradually weaken throughout the course of the period. The 0z GEFS continues to
be slower than the 0Z ECMWF and Canadian with this pattern transition, in part
due to its absence of anomalous mid-level ridging over the western CONUS. In
contrast, ridging is predominantly featured in the ECMWF and Canadian over the
western CONUS, which keeps much of the negative mid-level height departures
mostly offshore during early week-2.



The retrograding of this mid-level trough is anticipated to shift the focus of
potential heavy precipitation to Alaska, supporting a potentially strong
surface low over the Aleutians and Gulf of Alaska at the beginning of the
period. The orientation of this storm is predicted to support strong onshore
flow to southern portions of the state. The reforecast tools indicate at least
a 20% chance of 3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentile
and one inch primarily over the Kenai and Chugach mountains. The deterministic
0Z GFS keeps 24-hour snowfall totals across most of the highlighted areas
below
2 feet, although the 6Z GFS indicates many of these areas exceeding 2 feet,
extending across the western portion of the Alaska Range. A broad area of
slight risk of heavy snow is posted for higher elevation areas of the southern
Alaska Range and Kenai Peninsula, Oct 30 to Nov 1, taking into account the
reforecast tools, uncalibrated model ensemble means, and deterministic models.
Should the active and cold pattern continue over Alaska, the potential for
heavy snow may also extend over locations closer to sea level in the upcoming
days. The orientation of this storm may be favorable for elevated chances for
high winds extending from parts of the Kenai Peninsula and southeastern
Mainland Alaska to the Alaska Panhandle, including possible high gap winds
across the Alaska Panhandle. The reforecast tools do not indicate wind speeds
reaching hazards criteria in the region at this time, although there is
inherent difficulty in model guidance capturing high wind speed events.



The Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT) analysis tool suggests much of the
enhanced onshore flow to weaken across the West during week-2. The highest IVT
probabilities are now favored during the week-1 period, though this tool
features a secondary signal predicted by both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
which may support another period of increased precipitation over the
northwestern CONUS by the beginning of November. Reforecast tools show a clear
reduction in the potential for heavy precipitation compared to previous
guidance, but both maintain at least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulations
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch over the Pacific Northwest and
parts
of northern California during the middle of week-2 (Nov 1 to Nov 3). However,
due to precipitation amounts from the raw ensemble guidance not reaching
hazards criteria and reforecast tool 3-day totals generally remaining below 2
inches, slight risk of heavy precipitation is not included for this region.
Although localized flooding cannot be ruled out, particularly for burn scarred
areas of the West, the continued above-normal precipitation is expected to
benefit many drought-stricken areas and help replenish water resources
throughout the West.

...A parade of Pacific storm systems to produce copious amounts of
rain and isolated heavy mountain snow in the Northwest and
California...

...Developing low pressure system in the Central Plains to bring
heavy rain and severe weather to the region over the weekend...

...Above normal temperatures will continue in the Central and
Southern Plains; more seasonal temperatures to return to the
Intermountain West and East Coast; cooler than average
temperatures hang over the Midwest and along the West Coast...

...Elevated fire weather risk issued for portions of the Southern
Plains...

A series of Pacific storms moving onshore over northern California
and the Pacific Northwest will serve to continue the recent trend
of wet weather over the regions. As the remaining cold front from
yesterday's system moves further inland an additional 1 to 2
inches of rain are expected to fall over burn scar affected areas
of northern California. Given the continued potential for rapid
runoff and debris flows in these areas a Marginal Risk of
Excessive Rainfall has been maintained for the northern Sierra
Nevada. Continued eastward progression of the frontal boundary
will spread moderate rain and high elevation snow into the
Intermountain West and Northern/Central Rockies overnight. Before
the memory of the first Pacific storm is able to fade the second
system is forecast to make its approach on the West Coast Saturday
morning. Relatively weaker than the previous system, this storm is
expected to dissipate quickly after landfall, but not before
bringing an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain and to northern
California and southern Oregon. Due to the numerous burn scars in
these areas as well as the general sensitivity of the soils from
the previous days' rain a Marginal Risk has been maintained on
Saturday for the northern Sierra Nevada and expanded to encompass
coastal northern California and extreme southwestern Oregon. Not
to be outdone, the third and strongest of the forecasted Pacific
storms will slam into the West Coast Sunday morning. Exceptionally
high levels of atmospheric moisture embedded within this system in
the form of a very powerful Atmospheric River are expected to slam
into northern California. With snow levels at the time sitting
around 10000-11000 ft, most of the precipitation associated with
this system will fall as rain except for at this highest mountain
peaks. Such an intense influx of moisture will inundate northern
California in as much as 3 to 5+ inches of rain in 24 hours,
exacerbating concerns for flash flooding, rapid runoff, and debris
flows. As such, the Weather Prediction Center has upgraded its
Excessive Rainfall Outlook to a Moderate Risk on Sunday for
portions of northern Sierra Nevada, while a Slight Risk remains in
place for the surrounding areas.

Farther east, a developing low pressure system is forecast to
bring showers and thunderstorms to the Central Plains and Middle
Mississippi Valley overnight ahead of a lifting warm front. As the
system progressively deepens on Saturday it's attendant warm front
will continue its northward track and begin encroaching on a
quasi-stationary boundary over Missouri Saturday afternoon. With
ample surface instability and moisture available between these two
fronts, any thunderstorms that develop may become severe. Given
the potential for these thunderstorms to produce damaging wind,
large hail, and an isolated tornado or two, the Storm Prediction
Center has issued a Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms for
portions of northeastern Kansas and far western Missouri effective
Saturday morning to Sunday morning. Further strengthening of the
system overnight will lead to the continuation of the severe
weather threat over the Middle Mississippi Valley in the form of
an Enhanced Risk of Severe Weather. Forecasted environmental
conditions appear favorable for the development of supercells with
the potential to produce damaging wind gusts, large hail, and
tornadoes. In addition to the severe weather threat, there will
also be the risk of flash flooding as heavy rainfall could lead to
accumulations of 2 to 3 inches of rain in a 24 hour period over
portions of the Middle Mississippi Valley, prompting the issuance
of a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for Sunday. Meanwhile, a
cold front passing slowly through the Eastern Seaboard will move
offshore overnight tonight, but not before triggering more showers
and thunderstorms over eastern North Carolina, some of which may
become severe with isolated wind damage and moderate sized hail.

Temperatures will generally remain near or above normal in the
south-central part of the country during the short range period.
These warm temperatures, lack of recent precipitation, and
sustained dry and breezy conditions will support modest priming of
grass-based fuels. As such, the Storm Prediction Center has issued
an Elevated Risk of fire weather for portions of New Mexico
through Sunday morning and the northern Texas Panhandle Saturday
morning to Sunday morning. To the north, cold air ushered in by
surface high pressure situated over central Canada and the Midwest
will set the stage for modest temperature drops from the Upper
Midwest to the Northeast. While daily highs will remain generally
in the low to mid 50s, which is just a few degrees below average,
some isolated areas could experience temperature anomalies as
large as 10 degrees below normal. As for the West Coast,
persistent cloud cover from the series of systems moving onshore
will keep the region around 10 to 15 degrees cooler than average
for this time of year. However, in areas of higher elevation such
as the Sierra Nevada, temperature departures are expected to be
more extreme at 20 to 25 degrees below normal.

...A Stormy Pattern Continues Next Week for the Nation...


...Overview...

It will be quite the stormy weather pattern for the nation next
week. A lead Midwest upper trough/low and uncertain phasing with
northern stream trough energies digging to the lee of an amplified
central Canadian upper ridge Monday may forge a closed low to work
slowly across the Northeast to the Canadian Maritimes
Tuesday-Thursday with a main low/frontal system whose deep low and
enhanced moisture/rainfall now seems likely to focus further
organizing with development of a deepening coastal low. Well
upstream, multiple rounds of impactful weather for the West Coast
this weekend/Monday will work inland across the Intermountain
West/Rockies and then force Plains cyclo/frontogenesis by midweek
as an amplified upper trough tracks eastward. Flow amplification
from the Pacific to the West should also meanwhile refocus
enhanced periods of precipitation back into the Pacific Northwest
and also quite an amplified and slowing downstream upper trough
over the central to eastern U.S. into later next week, along with
a deepening low and an increasingly active/wet wrapping frontal
system.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of the 00 UTC ECMWF and ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC
National Blend of Models days 3-7 with a focus increasingly on the
ensemble mean over time amid growing run to run model variance due
to phasing and system evolution uncertainties/increasing forecast
spread. These guidance pieces seemed to best cluster with WPC
continuity and be best in line with guidance trends toward
amplification during this forecast period, but still in a pattern
with average to below normal predictability. The 12 UTC GFS/GEFS
have trended more amplified with time over the lower 48 than prior
runs whose uptream flow over the upstream Pacific also tended to
be an outlier solution vs the multi-model ensemble guidance
envelope. However, the 12 UTC ECMWF does still does offer some
less than stellar run to run variance in an albeit still
reasonably similar larger scale flow pattern evolution with a
trend twoard slowing the flow.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A lead Midwest upper trough/low and uncertain phasing with
northern stream trough energies digging to the lee of an amplified
central Canadian upper ridge Monday may forge a closed low to work
slowly across the Northeast to the Canadian Maritimes
Tuesday-Thursday with a main low/frontal system whose deep low and
enhanced moisture/rainfall threat now seems likely to focus
further organizing with development of a deepening coastal low.
Meanwhile across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of
enhanced rains are expected from the Pacific Northwest through
especially California that will likely be heavy at times with
breezy conditions as well. This will especially hold true into
Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume (Atmospheric River)
shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest into California.
Several inches of rain are possible over the multi-day period
(which begins during the short range/this weekend), particularly
across favored windward terrain which may result in some instances
of runoff issues and/or flooding especially over already
vulnerable burn scar areas. Heavy snows are likely for the higher
elevations of the Cascades and especially Sierra, with multiple
feet possible at the highest elevations. Snow levels are expected
to lower Sunday into Monday as the core of the upper trough moves
inland along with the surface cold front. Strong winds are also
possible for the coast and inland along mountain ridges. Some of
this moisture is expected to reach the Intermountain West and the
central/northern Rockies with significant snowfall. The main
associated cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward
across the east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to
present an emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus
with an influx of Gulf moisture. Closed upper trough development
and slowed frontal system progression and rainfall/moisture focus
then suggests a later period enhanced qpf/weather potential over
the East and perhaps in particular the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.
Meanwhile, additional upstream Pacific systems are forecast to
maintain the active pattern out West with periods with enhanced
precipitation chances going into the Pacific Northwest well into
next week.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region. High
temperatures are forecast to be 10-15 degrees above normal ahead
of the cold front and possibly near record temperatures over parts
of Texas and Louisiana. Cooler than normal temperatures are
forecast for much of the West, influenced by the upper trough and
mainly overcast skies. High temperatures may be 10-20+ degrees
below normal early in the week but will moderate by the middle of
next week. These may challenge daily record cool max values over
parts of California into early next week.

...A Stormy Pattern Continues Next Week for the Nation...


...Overview...

It will be quite the stormy weather pattern for the nation next
week. A lead Midwest upper trough/low and uncertain phasing with
northern stream trough energies digging to the lee of an amplified
central Canadian upper ridge Monday may forge a closed low to work
slowly across the Northeast to the Canadian Maritimes
Tuesday-Thursday with a main low/frontal system whose deep low and
enhanced moisture/rainfall now seems likely to focus further
organizing with development of a deepening coastal low. Well
upstream, multiple rounds of impactful weather for the West Coast
this weekend/Monday will work inland across the Intermountain
West/Rockies and then force Plains cyclo/frontogenesis by midweek
as an amplified upper trough tracks eastward. Flow amplification
from the Pacific to the West should also meanwhile refocus
enhanced periods of precipitation back into the Pacific Northwest
and also quite an amplified and slowing downstream upper trough
over the central to eastern U.S. into later next week, along with
a deepening low and an increasingly active/wet wrapping frontal
system.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of the 00 UTC ECMWF and ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC
National Blend of Models days 3-7 with a focus increasingly on the
ensemble mean over time amid growing run to run model variance due
to phasing and system evolution uncertainties/increasing forecast
spread. These guidance pieces seemed to best cluster with WPC
continuity and be best in line with guidance trends toward
amplification during this forecast period, but still in a pattern
with average to below normal predictability. The 12 UTC GFS/GEFS
have trended more amplified with time over the lower 48 than prior
runs whose uptream flow over the upstream Pacific also tended to
be an outlier solution vs the multi-model ensemble guidance
envelope. However, the 12 UTC ECMWF does still does offer some
less than stellar run to run variance in an albeit still
reasonably similar larger scale flow pattern evolution with a
trend twoard slowing the flow.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A lead Midwest upper trough/low and uncertain phasing with
northern stream trough energies digging to the lee of an amplified
central Canadian upper ridge Monday may forge a closed low to work
slowly across the Northeast to the Canadian Maritimes
Tuesday-Thursday with a main low/frontal system whose deep low and
enhanced moisture/rainfall threat now seems likely to focus
further organizing with development of a deepening coastal low.
Meanwhile across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of
enhanced rains are expected from the Pacific Northwest through
especially California that will likely be heavy at times with
breezy conditions as well. This will especially hold true into
Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume (Atmospheric River)
shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest into California.
Several inches of rain are possible over the multi-day period
(which begins during the short range/this weekend), particularly
across favored windward terrain which may result in some instances
of runoff issues and/or flooding especially over already
vulnerable burn scar areas. Heavy snows are likely for the higher
elevations of the Cascades and especially Sierra, with multiple
feet possible at the highest elevations. Snow levels are expected
to lower Sunday into Monday as the core of the upper trough moves
inland along with the surface cold front. Strong winds are also
possible for the coast and inland along mountain ridges. Some of
this moisture is expected to reach the Intermountain West and the
central/northern Rockies with significant snowfall. The main
associated cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward
across the east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to
present an emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus
with an influx of Gulf moisture. Closed upper trough development
and slowed frontal system progression and rainfall/moisture focus
then suggests a later period enhanced qpf/weather potential over
the East and perhaps in particular the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.
Meanwhile, additional upstream Pacific systems are forecast to
maintain the active pattern out West with periods with enhanced
precipitation chances going into the Pacific Northwest well into
next week.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region. High
temperatures are forecast to be 10-15 degrees above normal ahead
of the cold front and possibly near record temperatures over parts
of Texas and Louisiana. Cooler than normal temperatures are
forecast for much of the West, influenced by the upper trough and
mainly overcast skies. High temperatures may be 10-20+ degrees
below normal early in the week but will moderate by the middle of
next week. These may challenge daily record cool max values over
parts of California into early next week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Sat Oct 23 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will approach the Plains states today, fostering
the intensification of a surface low and associated strong, dry
westerly winds across the southern High Plains. 15-20 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds will coincide with 15-25% RH across
portions of eastern New Mexico into extreme southern Colorado and
portions of the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles this afternoon. Given
preceding dry conditions across the southern High Plains,
grass-based fuels should be at least marginally receptive to fire
spread, warranting the maintenance of Elevated highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Sat Oct 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
As a coupled mid-level trough and surface low progress to the east
towards the Missouri Valley tomorrow afternoon, dry and breezy
conditions are expected to accompany the post-dryline environment
across the southern High Plains. Several guidance members depict
15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds amid 15-20% RH
immediately behind the dryline, likely lasting for at least a few
hours around afternoon peak heating. Given the lack of recent or
forecast precipitation, along with multiple preceding days of
dry/breezy conditions, finer fuels should remain at least marginally
receptive to fire spread. Elevated highlights have been introduced
where guidance agreement is strongest in placing the dry/windy
post-dryline environment, and where the greatest fuels receptiveness
is expected.

...A stormy pattern continues across the nation next week...


...Overview...

The weather pattern during the medium range period should remain
quite active and amplified as a couple of systems impact the CONUS
next week. An upper low initially over the lower Great Lakes on
Tuesday will induce a deepening cyclone with heavy rainfall over
the Northeast U.S. which should lift north and east into the
Canadian maritimes by Thursday. Meanwhile upstream, the next
trough will be ejecting out of the Rockies Tuesday-Wednesday with
another possible closed upper low/deep surface cyclone likely to
form and track from the north-central Plains into the Ohio Valley
and eventually the Northeast by late week/early next weekend.
Organized rainfall will accompany the cold front as it traverses
the eastern half of the nation with rounds of heavy rainfall
possible. A couple of shortwaves may also move into the Pacific
Northwest during the period bringing more heavy rain/mountain
snows to parts of the Northwest.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

For the most part, the guidance continues to show good agreement
on the overall longwave pattern evolution, but significant
uncertainties in the details regarding strength and track of
individual systems. For the intial Northeast closed low on
Tuesday-Wednesday, there remains some subtle differences in
placement but a general model blend should give a good starting
point. The biggest uncertainties surround the amplified trough
exiting the Rockies into the Plains at the beginning of the
period. By late Wednesday/early Thursday, much of the guidance has
been trending towards closed upper low development, but rather
significant differences in placement and track of the low. The
notable outlier at least right now seems to be the 12z (yesterday)
ECMWF as well as the new 00z run both of which are displaced well
south of the better consensus with the low moving through the
Southern Plains/Tennessee Valley into the Mid-Atlantic. The latest
runs of the GFS and CMC suggest the low center farther north (into
the Midwest/Ohio Valley and Northeast) which is also consistent
with the latest ensemble means as well. The WPC blend leaned more
towards the GFS/CMC along with the ensemble means, which also
maintained fairly good continuity with the previous WPC forecast
as well. Out West, some late period timing differences arise with
another trough moving towards the Pacific Northwest later next
week, so a blend of the ensemble means was preferred.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The leading closed low into the Northeast on Tuesday will allow
for heavy rainfall potential to continue from the end of the short
range period into much of New England early next week. Deepening
coastal low development may induce pockets of enhanced rainfall on
the backside of the low as it lifts northward towards the Canadian
Maritimes but there remains some uncertainty in exact low
placement which will impact where the heaviest rains fall.

The cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward into the
east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to present an
emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus as ample
Gulf of Mexico moisture streams northward ahead of the system. The
latest guidance suggests the best potential for heavy rainfall
will be across portions of the Gulf Coast states and inland on
Wednesday and then into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Thursday-Friday
with closed upper low development and a slowed frontal system
progression. The Storm Prediction Center also is highlighting the
potential for severe weather across parts of the central/southern
Plains on Tuesday, and the central Gulf Coast on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, out west, a sustained moisture plume from the short
range period will continue into the Northwest U.S. on Tuesday
bringing a continued threat for heavy rainfall and mountain snows
to especially the Pacific Northwest/northern California but also
farther inland across the northern Rockies. Another system moving
towards the coast mid next week will continue the active weather
with another round of heavy rainfall and mountain snow impacting
parts of the Pacific Northwest Wednesday into Friday.

In terms of temperature highlights, the southern/central Plains
should be above normal to start, but quickly trend back towards
normal following the passage of the cold front. Daytime highs
could be 10 to 15 degrees above normal on Tuesday for parts of
Texas, Oklahoma, and western Kansas. Successive closed
lows/troughs into the east-central U.S. will keep temperatures
near or below normal through the entire week. Out West,
temperatures may initially begin cold (minus 10 to 15F anomalies),
but should trend warmer and back to normal values as some weak
upper ridging moves through. The Central U.S. may again warm to
slightly above normal by late week as the ridging reaches the
Plains.

...Series of low pressure systems to produce heavy rainfall and
mountain snow to northern California...

...Potent system to produce heavy rain and thunderstorms across
Mississippi Valley and Midwest...

...Warm pattern continues for the South while East Coast warms up
and West cools...

...Elevated fire weather risk issued for portions of the Southern
Plains...

Much needed precipitation is on its way to northern California as
a series of low pressure systems bring an influx of Pacific
moisture to the region over the next few days. Heavy rain is
likely across the lower elevations of northern California, while
many of the western mountain ranges will receive heavy snowfall
through Monday. This atmospheric river event will generate
multiple inches of rainfall for the aforementioned lowlands and
several inches of snow for the Northern Rockies, Sierra and
Cascades. The Sierra could see snowfall totals in excess of 2 feet
at its highest peaks. Flooding and secondary hazards associated
with flooding are a concern for the next few days as precipitation
ramps up. Moderate Risks of Excessive Rainfall leading to flash
flooding are in effect over parts of Northern California. This AR
event should last until Tuesday when the powerful area of low
pressure will have moved into the Great Plains.

A quasi-stationary boundary draped across the Plains and Midwest
will be the focus for heavy precipitation heading into the work
week. An area of low pressure will develop along this boundary
tomorrow as an upper-trough interacts with this front. Heavy rain
and thunderstorms will then spread across the Midwest and into the
Northeast. Thunderstorm activity will also kick off out ahead of
this system's cold front over the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley.
Some thunderstorms may be severe as indicated by the Storm
Prediction Center's Slight Risk areas for the Midwest and
Mississippi Valley over the next few days.

The Deep South will continue to experience above average warm high
temperatures over the next few days as troughing in the West
continues to pull warm air into the southern states. Temperatures
will fall precipitously across the West Coast on the backside of
the powerful Pacific system. Warm air will eventually creep into
the East Coast by Monday due to the approaching low pressure
system and its ascendant warm front. The Rocky foothills will also
experience a warm up on Monday thanks to the approaching Pacific
system. Elevated fire weather risks continue across portions of
the Southern Plains over the next couple of days due to warm and
dry conditions.

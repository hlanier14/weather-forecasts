...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NORTHERN MONTANA INTO
EXTREME NORTHWEST NORTH DAKOTA...

Much of the previous forecast remains on track. Current visible
satellite imagery depicts predominantly cloud free skies, allowing
for adequate surface heating to mix the boundary layer despite the
presence of smoke across the Interior West. RH has already dropped
below 20% across much of Montana, with some areas seeing 15 mph
sustained southwesterly surface winds and gusts exceeding 20 mph.
Continued surface heating should support a further lowering of RH
across much of the northern Rockies to the northern Great Basin this
afternoon, with at least 15 mph widespread southwesterly winds
expected (20-25 mph in Montana).

The primary change to this outlook was to expand Elevated highlights
into portions of the Sacramento Valley in northern California. The
latest guidance shows a small impulse pivoting around the main
mid-level trough and traversing northern California by afternoon
peak heating. Regionally stronger mid-level flow is expected to mix
downward through a deep, dry boundary layer to support 15 mph
sustained west-northwesterly surface winds amid 15-20% RH,
warranting Elevated highlights.

Consideration was given to adding Critical highlights to the lee of
the northern Sierra, but the lack of agreement for a stronger
surface wind field among regional model guidance rendered confidence
too low for a Critical delineation. Nonetheless, at least locally
Critical conditions are expected, especially in western Nevada.
Scattered dry thunderstorm highlights were also considered for parts
of southern Montana, as a relatively greater concentration of
high-based, fast moving dry storms over critically dry fuels is
expected to support efficient lightning-induced ignitions. However,
there is some potential for storms to produce more wetting rains.
Given the brief, very localized coverage of scattered, classic dry
thunderstorms over receptive fuels, scattered dry thunderstorm
highlights were not added.

..Squitieri.. 08/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Mon Aug 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave mid/upper-level trough is forecast to move from the
interior Northwest into parts of the Canadian Prairies and northern
Great Plains through the day and evening, as a stronger upper trough
begins to amplify over the Pacific Northwest and an upper ridge over
the Great Basin begins to weaken. A surface low is forecast to move
eastward across parts of SK/MB, as a trailing surface trough moves
through the northern Plains. A cold front will move into the
Northwest in conjunction with the amplifying upper trough.

...Montana/North Dakota - Wind/RH conditions...
While afternoon heating may be somewhat muted due to widespread
smoke, downslope flow and mixing/drying in the wake of the surface
trough will likely be sufficient to support critically low RH across
much of MT into the northern High Plains. Meanwhile, a belt of
modestly enhanced low-level westerly flow will support sustained
winds of 15-20 mph with higher gusts from northern MT into northwest
ND. This combination of wind/RH will result in a threat of critical
fire-weather conditions during the afternoon and early evening.

Further eastward across ND into northwest MN, there is greater
uncertainty regarding the eastward extent of RH reductions during
the afternoon, as a narrow low-level moist plume moves northward
ahead of the surface trough, but there is some potential for
elevated conditions to develop should sufficient heating/mixing
occur this afternoon.

...Interior Northwest into the Great Basin - Wind/RH conditions...
A general increase in low/midlevel flow is expected across a broad
area from the interior Northwest into parts of the Great Basin.
Elevated to locally critical conditions will be possible in
downslope-favored areas, where sustained winds of 15-20 mph (with
higher gusts) are possible concurrent with minimum RH values of
10-20%.

...Dry Thunderstorm Potential...
As the upper ridge breaks down, isolated thunderstorms will be
possible across a broad region from Nevada northeastward into
Montana. Thunderstorm coverage may be suppressed to some extent due
to negative impacts on heating/destabilization from widespread
smoke, but any thunderstorm activity will likely be rather dry and
pose a threat of ignitions due to very receptive fuel conditions. At
this time, the greatest relative coverage of thunderstorms is
expected from southwest into central MT, but uncertainty regarding
coverage to the west and rainfall potential to the east preclude an
upgrade to the dry-thunderstorm outlook at this time. Gusty and
erratic outflow winds will also be a threat from thunderstorms,
especially across parts of MT.

...Emerging North-Central U.S. Heavy Rain Threat ahead of cold
front and upper trough...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A well defined upper level trough with potential for a cut-off low
should be in place across the Intermountain West and Northern
Rockies to begin the forecast period Thursday, and an upper level
ridge situated over the Southeast U.S. in the wake of Tropical
Storm Fred. The upper trough then reaches the northern Plains and
drives a cold front and surface low eastward, with a building
ridge across the Northeast states. A couple of systems shifting
through should maintain troughing across the Northwest through
much of the medium range.


...Model Analysis and preferences...

Latest guidance continues to show some timing uncertainties with
the northern Plains trough/cold front. The 06z GFS is much faster
than most of the other models, and while the 00z run was still a
little fast, it's slower than the 06z run so more in line with the
ECMWF, UKMET, and CMC. A general model blend between the
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and the 00z GFS gives a good middle ground
solution. Another deeper trough should enter the Pacific Northwest
around next Sunday-Monday. Guidance has trended towards a more
amplified system (possible closed low) but some uncertainty
remaining around timing and details. A blend towards the ensemble
means for later in the period should help mitigate the differences
until details can be further resolved. Finally, the guidance shows
good agreement that a more robust ridge axis developing over the
Gulf Coast region should tend to steer what should be Tropical
Storm Grace by Thursday farther south and westward over the far
southern Gulf. This should pull the most significant impacts
farther south into central Mexico.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

Residual tropical moisture from what will become the remnants of
Tropical Storm Fred will fuel scattered to numerous showers and
thunderstorms across the Northeast U.S. on Thursday prior to
exiting the region, along with some lingering showers on Friday.
Some instances of flooding may be possible, particularly across
areas that have received above average rainfall already. Moderate
to heavy rainfall is also becoming more likely across portions of
the central/northern Plains Thursday and Friday. Exact amounts and
location will be dependent on developing mesoscale convective
complexes. Another corridor of enhanced showers and storms may
materialize across portions of the mid-Mississippi Valley to
Tennessee/lower Ohio Valleys owing to a slow moving front
lingering into the weekend.

For temperatures, daytime highs up to 20 degrees below normal are
likely across portions of the northern Rockies and northern High
Plains for the end of the week, with some snow possible for the
highest elevations. Temperatures trend a little warmer this
weekend into early next week out west, but still should be below
normal as mean upper troughing is maintained across the region.
Elsewhere, above normal temperatures from the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes into portions of the northeast are likely ahead of the cold
front Thursday-Friday, but much of the rest of the country should
be near normal through the entire medium range period.

...Tropical Storm Fred to make landfall over the western/central
Florida Panhandle this evening and bring heavy rain, gusty winds,
and dangerous storm surge...

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding are expected along a
slow-moving frontal system over the eastern Ohio Valley,
Appalachians, and the Mid-Atlantic this evening before moisture
associated with Fred enters the region on Tuesday...

...Oppressive heat, poor air quality, and fire weather concerns
continue for parts of the West and Northern Plains ahead of a
potent cold front set to swing across the Northwest and Northern
Rockies on Tuesday...

Tropical Storm Fred is forecast to continue tracking northward and
make landfall this evening along the western/central Florida
Panhandle. Heavy rainfall and gusty winds can be expected along
its track, as well as potentially dangerous storm surge for
coastal regions near and to the east of landfall. Flash flooding
is a threat with the heavy rain, with a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall in effect for portions of the Florida Panhandle and
southeastern Alabama/southwestern Georgia tonight and a Slight
Risk stretching farther inland. Flash Flood Watches have also been
issued. Trailing bands of rain could affect the Florida Big Bend
again on Tuesday and cause flash flooding issues, even after
Fred's center has moved north. Tropical Storm Fred is currently
forecast to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday morning
and dissipate by Wednesday morning over the eastern Ohio Valley.

As tropical moisture from Fred streams northward, it will feed
into a frontal system lifting slowly northward across the Ohio
Valley and Mid-Atlantic. While much of the eastern third of the
U.S. should see rain and thunderstorms through midweek, the front
will provide an additional place for the moisture to focus,
enhancing rainfall totals and the possibility of flash flooding. A
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in place through tonight from
eastern portions of the Ohio Valley through the Central
Appalachians and portions of the Mid-Atlantic, where scattered
flash floods are possible. Then on Tuesday, as Fred moves farther
inland along with its associated moisture plume, a large Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall stretches from the Southeast to New
York State. In addition, a small Moderate Risk area is delineated
for parts of the Southern Appalachians Tuesday into Tuesday night,
as several inches of rain could occur in mountainous areas that
are particularly sensitive to heavy rainfall. Another day of heavy
rain is possible on Wednesday from the Mid-Atlantic to the
Southern Appalachians as the tropical airmass in place refuses to
exit.

Another day of hotter than normal temperatures is forecast for
much of the West into the Northern Plains today. Highs topping
100F across much of California, the Central Great Basin, and into
the Northern High Plains have led to the issuance of Excessive
Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories for portions of these areas, and
some daily records have the potential to be set once again. The
heat will not be the only threat for these areas, as Elevated to
Critical Risks of fire weather are in place today and Tuesday,
along with the potential for additional fire ignitions from dry
thunderstorms. Air quality is already an issue over much of the
Northwest given smoke from fires and high ozone levels. However,
cooler temperatures creeping into the Pacific Northwest tonight is
a sign of what is to come on Tuesday and Wednesday--a potent cold
front pushed by an upper-level low that will bring cooler and
refreshing air to the Northwest, as well as increasing rain
chances especially for the Northern Rockies on Tuesday. Meanwhile
farther south, cooler temperatures are expected over portions of
the Southwest into the Southern High Plains, along with the chance
for rain and thunderstorms as monsoonal moisture continues to
stream into the region. Flash floods are possible over the next
couple days, with Flash Flood Watches remaining in effect today
over southern Arizona and New Mexico, as well as into far western
Texas. A few strong to severe thunderstorms are also possible.
Meanwhile, above average temperatures with highs into the
upper-90s and low triple digits are expected to remain across the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest through at least Wednesday.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 16 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is anticipated across the southern half o=
f
the lower 48, with a fairly weak pattern across the northern tier. This
pattern
increases the likelihood for above normal temperatures across parts of the
western and southeastern contiguous U.S., with the greatest possibility of
excessive heat for some areas across the Central Valley of California and
Desert Southwest from the beginning to middle of week-2 and southeastern lo=
wer
48 at the beginning of the period. Mid-level high pressure is favored for
southwestern mainland Alaska, the Aleutians, and Alaska Panhandle, with
mid-level low pressure predicted elsewhere across the state. The anticipate=
d
pattern for Alaska is not expected to support widespread hazards.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of the Central Valley of Califor=
nia
and Desert Southwest, Tue-Sat, Aug 24-28.

Slight risk of excessive heat across the Lower Mississippi Valley, Southeas=
t,
and eastern portions of the Southern Plains, Tue-Wed, Aug 24-25.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY AUGUST 19 - MONDAY AUGUST 23:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!o9BsUUKadGMmtmb_ouzrP1Zy9RypU0BEu4mizUQk5ZmIUzSB0h98_n2AVHnec=
OhWf1x0j2QM$

FOR TUESDAY AUGUST 24 - MONDAY AUGUST 30: There is relatively good agreemen=
t
amongst the 0Z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensemble means favoring mid-level
ridging across the southern half of the CONUS during the beginning to middl=
e
of
the period, with mid-level troughing developing across parts of the eastern
third of the CONUS toward the latter part of the period. The 0Z ECMWF favor=
s a
more amplified trough centered over the Ohio Valley by day 10 (Aug 26),
whereas
the 0Z GEFS and Canadian favors a more gradual formation of the trough by d=
ay
11 (Aug 27). Despite these model differences, there is relatively good
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicating an elevate=
d
potential for excessive heat across parts of California and southwestern CO=
NUS
from the beginning to middle of the period. Therefore, a slight risk of
excessive heat is highlighted for parts the Central Valley of California an=
d
Desert Southwest, Aug 24 to 28, where both reforecast tools indicate at lea=
st
a
20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 100 De=
g
F.
The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) indicates a moderate risk of fi=
re
potential across parts of California. Anticipated triple digit temperatures
combined with predominately dry conditions favored during week-2, is likely=
 to
elevate the risk for wildfires across parts of California, especially the
Central Valley area as well as exacerbate ongoing moderate (D1) to extreme
drought (D4) conditions being felt throughout

this part of the country.



The aforementioned mid-level ridging across the southern CONUS may also
support
increased chances for excessive heat across parts of the south-central and
southeastern CONUS at the beginning of the period, prior to transitioning t=
o
mid-level troughing across the East. A slight risk of excessive heat is pos=
ted
for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Southeast, and eastern portions =
of
the Southern Plains, Aug 24 to 25, where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools indicates at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the
85th percentile, with temperatures greater than 100 Deg F across the Centra=
l
and Southern Plains and exceeding 95 Deg F across the Middle and Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southeast. Multiple models also show dewpoints
exceeding
70 Deg F across this region, which could support higher heat index values.
Nighttime temperatures may exceed 80 Deg F in the highlighted heat risk are=
a.



Multiple model ensemble means favor the mid-level ridge centered further so=
uth
across the Four Corners region during week-2, which would limit the amount =
of
moisture into the region. Recent runs of the deterministic GFS show potenti=
al
for a tropical cyclone forming in the East Pacific tracking closer to the
mouth
of the Gulf of California which could enhance moisture flow into the Four
Corners region. The deterministic 0Z ECMWF, however, favors a weaker tropic=
al
disturbance  tracking further south, which would be less favorable for
enhancing moisture into the southwestern CONUS. The ECMWF reforecast tool
indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the
85th percentile and half an inch across eastern New Mexico, whereas the GEF=
S
does not show any areas in the region reaching this criteria. Despite model
guidance being less favorable for heavy precipitation across the Four Corne=
rs
region, thunderstorms may lead to localized flash flooding.



Above normal 500-hPa heights are predicted across the Alaska Panhandle and
southwestern Alaska including the Aleutians, with near to below normal heig=
hts
favored elsewhere across the state. A relatively weak mid-level pattern is
predicted for Alaska, resulting in less favorable conditions for supporting
hazards.

FOR TUESDAY AUGUST 24 - MONDAY AUGUST 30: There is relatively good agreemen=
t
amongst the 0Z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensemble means favoring mid-level
ridging across the southern half of the CONUS during the beginning to middl=
e
of
the period, with mid-level troughing developing across parts of the eastern
third of the CONUS toward the latter part of the period. The 0Z ECMWF favor=
s a
more amplified trough centered over the Ohio Valley by day 10 (Aug 26),
whereas
the 0Z GEFS and Canadian favors a more gradual formation of the trough by d=
ay
11 (Aug 27). Despite these model differences, there is relatively good
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicating an elevate=
d
potential for excessive heat across parts of California and southwestern CO=
NUS
from the beginning to middle of the period. Therefore, a slight risk of
excessive heat is highlighted for parts the Central Valley of California an=
d
Desert Southwest, Aug 24 to 28, where both reforecast tools indicate at lea=
st
a
20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 100 De=
g
F.
The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) indicates a moderate risk of fi=
re
potential across parts of California. Anticipated triple digit temperatures
combined with predominately dry conditions favored during week-2, is likely=
 to
elevate the risk for wildfires across parts of California, especially the
Central Valley area as well as exacerbate ongoing moderate (D1) to extreme
drought (D4) conditions being felt throughout this part of the country.



The aforementioned mid-level ridging across the southern CONUS may also
support
increased chances for excessive heat across parts of the south-central and
southeastern CONUS at the beginning of the period, prior to transitioning t=
o
mid-level troughing across the East. A slight risk of excessive heat is pos=
ted
for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Southeast, and eastern portions =
of
the Southern Plains, Aug 24 to 25, where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools indicates at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the
85th percentile, with temperatures greater than 100 Deg F across the Centra=
l
and Southern Plains and exceeding 95 Deg F across the Middle and Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southeast. Multiple models also show dewpoints
exceeding
70 Deg F across this region, which could support higher heat index values.
Nighttime temperatures may exceed 80 Deg F in the highlighted heat risk are=
a.



Multiple model ensemble means favor the mid-level ridge centered further so=
uth
across the Four Corners region during week-2, which would limit the amount =
of
moisture into the region. Recent runs of the deterministic GFS show potenti=
al
for a tropical cyclone forming in the East Pacific tracking closer to the
mouth
of the Gulf of California which could enhance moisture flow into the Four
Corners region. The deterministic 0Z ECMWF, however, favors a weaker tropic=
al
disturbance  tracking further south, which would be less favorable for
enhancing moisture into the southwestern CONUS. The ECMWF reforecast tool
indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the
85th percentile and half an inch across eastern New Mexico, whereas the GEF=
S
does not show any areas in the region reaching this criteria. Despite model
guidance being less favorable for heavy precipitation across the Four Corne=
rs
region, thunderstorms may lead to localized flash flooding.



Above normal 500-hPa heights are predicted across the Alaska Panhandle and
southwestern Alaska including the Aleutians, with near to below normal heig=
hts
favored elsewhere across the state. A relatively weak mid-level pattern is
predicted for Alaska, resulting in less favorable conditions for supporting
hazards.

Valid 00Z Tue Aug 17 2021 - 00Z Thu Aug 19 2021

...Tropical Storm Fred to bring heavy rain, gusty winds, and
dangerous storm surge to portions of the Florida Panhandle this
evening...

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding are expected along a
slow-moving frontal system over the eastern Ohio Valley,
Appalachians, and the Mid-Atlantic this evening before moisture
associated with Fred enters the region on Tuesday...

...Oppressive heat, poor air quality, and fire weather concerns
continue for parts of the West and Northern Plains ahead of a
potent cold front set to swing across the Northwest and Northern
Rockies on Tuesday...

Tropical Storm Fred is forecast to continue tracking northward and
push inland across the western/central Florida Panhandle tonight
and eventually into the Southeast. Heavy rainfall and gusty winds
can be expected along its track, as well as potentially dangerous
storm surge for coastal regions near and to the east of the center
of Fred. Flash flooding is a threat with the heavy rain, with a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall in effect for portions of the
Florida Panhandle and southeastern Alabama/southwestern Georgia
tonight and a Slight Risk stretching farther inland. Flash Flood
Watches have also been issued. Trailing bands of rain could affect
the Florida Big Bend again on Tuesday and cause flash flooding
issues, even after Fred's center has moved north. Tropical Storm
Fred is currently forecast to weaken into a tropical depression by
Tuesday morning and dissipate by Wednesday morning over the
eastern Ohio Valley.

As tropical moisture from Fred streams northward, it will feed
into a frontal system lifting slowly northward across the Ohio
Valley and Mid-Atlantic. While much of the eastern third of the
U.S. should see rain and thunderstorms through midweek, the front
will provide an additional place for the moisture to focus,
enhancing rainfall totals and the possibility of flash flooding. A
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in place through tonight from
eastern portions of the Ohio Valley through the Central
Appalachians and portions of the Mid-Atlantic, where scattered
flash floods are possible. Then on Tuesday, as Fred moves farther
inland along with its associated moisture plume, a large Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall stretches from the Southeast to New
York State. In addition, a small Moderate Risk area is delineated
for parts of the Southern Appalachians Tuesday into Tuesday night,
as several inches of rain could occur in mountainous areas that
are particularly sensitive to heavy rainfall. Another day of heavy
rain is possible on Wednesday from the Mid-Atlantic to the
Southern Appalachians as the tropical airmass in place refuses to
exit.

Another day of hotter than normal temperatures is forecast for
much of the West into the Northern Plains today. Highs topping
100F across much of California, the Central Great Basin, and into
the Northern High Plains have led to the issuance of Excessive
Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories for portions of these areas, and
some daily records have the potential to be set once again. The
heat will not be the only threat for these areas, as Elevated to
Critical Risks of fire weather are in place today and Tuesday,
along with the potential for additional fire ignitions from dry
thunderstorms. Air quality is already an issue over much of the
Northwest given smoke from fires and high ozone levels. However,
cooler temperatures creeping into the Pacific Northwest tonight is
a sign of what is to come on Tuesday and Wednesday--a potent cold
front pushed by an upper-level low that will bring cooler and
refreshing air to the Northwest, as well as increasing rain
chances especially for the Northern Rockies on Tuesday. Meanwhile
farther south, cooler temperatures are expected over portions of
the Southwest into the Southern High Plains, along with the chance
for rain and thunderstorms as monsoonal moisture continues to
stream into the region. Flash floods are possible over the next
couple days, with Flash Flood Watches remaining in effect today
over southern Arizona and New Mexico, as well as into far western
Texas. A few strong to severe thunderstorms are also possible.
Meanwhile, above average temperatures with highs into the
upper-90s and low triple digits are expected to remain across the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest through at least Wednesday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon August 16 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 22 - 26 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
Bering Sea, extending to the Aleutians with below normal 500-hPa heights ov=
er
northern Mainland Alaska. A ridge is predicted over the eastern North Pacif=
ic,
with above normal heights over southern Mainland Alaska and the coast of
western North America. A trough is predicted over the Northern Rockies and
Plains, associated with below normal heights. A subtropical ridge is predic=
ted
over the southern tier of the CONUS with above normal 500-hPa heights over
much
of the South and East.
Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated across Alaska, influenc=
ed
by nearby forecast troughing. Above normal temperatures are favored for par=
ts
of the western CONUS, southern Rockies, Central and Southern Plains, and
eastern CONUS due to predicted 500-hPa ridging and above normal heights. A
predicted trough over the Northern Rockies and Plains favors enhanced
probabilities of below normal temperatures there.
Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over much of Mainland
Alaska due to forecast westerly surface flow and storm system development.
Below normal precipitation chances are increased over the Aleutians,
associated
with above normal heights. The positively tilted trough forecast in the
Northern Rockies and Plains supports an increasing likelihood of above norm=
al
precipitation for the Northern Plains and Western Great Lakes with an activ=
e
storm track.  Below normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over th=
e
rest of the CONUS, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=

Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=
set
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 24 - 30 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is similar to the
6-10 day period, but generally forecast to shift eastward and deamplify.

500-hPa troughing forecast over Alaska favors below normal temperatures for
the
state. Above normal temperatures are favored across most of the CONUS,
consistent with the consolidation tool and slightly above normal 500-hPa
heights over most of the country. Enhanced probabilities of below-normal
temperatures are favored over parts of the Northern and Southern Plains,
associated with negative 10m temperature anomalies early in the period and
potential cloudiness.

Troughing over the Bering Sea, with below normal heights, increases the
chances
of above-normal precipitation over central and northern Mainland Alaska.
Below-normal precipitation is predicted for the Aluetians and parts of
southwestern Alaska under the influence of the Northeast Pacific ridge. Bel=
ow
normal precipitation is likely for much of the northwestern CONUS and parts=
 of
the Northern and Central Plains, consistent with the consolidation tool. A
mean
frontal boundary and potential tropical moisture lead to enhanced
probabilities
of above-normal precipitation across much of the eastern U.S. Below-normal
precipitation is more likely over southern parts of the Florida Peninsula,
underneath positive mid-level height anomalies.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=

European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian

good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF CENTRAL NEVADA INTO
EXTREME NORTHWEST UTAH...

Elevated highlights have been consolidated/expanded across much of
the northwest U.S., as strong flow aloft and upper support
overspread the Interior West with the amplification of a mid-level
trough. Widespread 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds will
overlap 15-25% RH from California to the northern Plains tomorrow
afternoon. In addition to the Critical conditions that are still
expected across parts of the western Great Basin, at least locally
Critical conditions will be possible across the northern Plains and
terrain favoring areas of the Inter-mountain west.

At least locally Critical conditions are expected across the
Sacramento Valley and neighboring areas of higher terrain later
tomorrow/Tuesday afternoon into the evening hours, as northerly flow
on the backside of the mid-level trough coincides with northerly
surface winds and 15% RH behind an approaching cold front. Some of
the latest high-resolution guidance members show solidly Critical
conditions across northern California, while other high-resolution
members are less aggressive with stronger surface winds. As fuels
are critically receptive to fire spread in northern California,
Critical highlights may be needed in subsequent outlooks if more
high-resolution ensemble members trend windier.

Lastly, the isolated dry thunderstorm forecast across the northern
Rockies remains on track. Please see the previous forecast below for
more details.

..Squitieri.. 08/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0206 AM CDT Mon Aug 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough over the Northwest will continue to amplify as it
moves southeastward on Tuesday. Surface lows over the northern High
Plains and eastern Great Basin are forecast to deepen during the
day, as a cold front moves through parts of the interior Northwest
and northern Rockies.

...Parts of the interior Northwest and Great Basin - Wind/RH
conditions...
Elevated to potentially critical fire-weather conditions appear
likely on Tuesday across central/northern NV and adjacent portions
of northeast CA, southeast OR, and southwest ID. As stronger flow
associated with the deepening upper trough spreads over the region,
sustained winds are forecast to increase to 20-25 mph (with higher
gusts), as RH drops below critical criteria during the afternoon.
Portions of the critical area will see a wind shift from
west-southwesterly to northwesterly or northerly as the cold front
moves through, with critical conditions possible on either side of
the front.

...Northern Rockies/Northern Great Plains - Wind/RH conditions...
Elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions may develop
across portions of the northern Great Plains on Tuesday. Across the
Dakotas, low-level southerly flow will increase ahead of the surface
low, but some mixing/drying will be possible along the western flank
of returning moisture. Sustained winds may increase to 15-20 mph as
RH values drop into the 15-30% range, with the magnitude of RH
reduction depending on the extent to which smoke inhibits deep
mixing across the region. Elevated conditions will also be possible
within a dry and breezy post-frontal regime across northeast MT.

...Dry Thunderstorm Potential...
As the deepening upper trough moves eastward, thunderstorm
development is expected by late afternoon, with the greatest
coverage anticipated over parts of western/central MT. While much of
this thunderstorm activity is likely to produce at least some
rainfall, an isolated dry-thunderstorm area has been added due to
very receptive fuels and the potential for initial thunderstorm
activity to be rather dry.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN AND CENTRAL NEVADA...

...Synopsis...
Enhanced mid-level flow will begin to overspread much of the Pacific
Northwest and Great Basin early today ahead of a strong shortwave
troughing moving onshore. Ascent from the trough will deepen a
surface cyclone across western Montana while a cold front moves
through the Northwest and northern California. Strong winds and low
relative humidity will support widespread elevated to critical fire
weather conditions from California, through the Great Basin, Rockies
and onto the High Plains.

...Northern and central Nevada...
As the shortwave trough steadily deepens and moves southeast, a belt
of strong westerly flow will develop across portions of the northern
Great Basin. Diurnal heating and deep mechanical mixing from the
increasing flow aloft will support a very dry boundary layer with
widespread surface RH below 10%. Westerly surface winds of 25-30 mph
and locally higher gusts will likely develop in conjunction with the
dry surface conditions. Atop areas of near record-dry fuels, the
favorable combination of dry and windy conditions is forecast to
support widespread critical fire weather.

A cold front associated with the strengthening lee low will move
south into northern Nevada around sunset. Strong wind gusts may
accompany frontal passage along with a significant wind shift to the
north. A few strong gusts may linger into the overnight hours behind
the front as pressure gradients weaken, but increasing humidity
recoveries, weaker winds and cooler temperatures should limit the
threat after dark.

...Rockies and High Plains...
As the surface low begins to deepen in response to the approaching
trough early today, west-east pressure gradients will strengthen
across the Rockies behind a lee trough. Westerly surface flow will
begin to increase through the afternoon, driving dry downslope flow
across much of Idaho, Wyoming and western Montana. To the east of
the lee trough, dry and warm southeasterly flow over the High Plains
will likely develop. Widespread humidity below 25% is expected with
surface winds of 15-25 mph. Fuels remain mostly dry, suggesting
widespread elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are
likely.

Along the cold front across southwestern Montana and central Idaho,
lingering mid-level moisture from recent monsoon activity and
large-scale lift from the approaching trough will support isolated
to widely scattered thunderstorm development by early afternoon.
Model soundings show weak buoyancy developing atop a well-mixed
boundary layer with large dewpoint depressions. The fast storm
speeds and poor precipitation efficiency will likely favor dry
thunderstorms. With receptive fuels and adequate instability/forcing
for lighting, isolated dry strikes appear probable.

...Northern California...
As the shortwave trough moves onshore, the associated cold front
will intensify as it moves out of the Northwest into northern
California. Northerly surface winds of 15-25 mph will likely develop
ahead of and along the front as it slowly moves south late in the
afternoon and early evening. At the same time, mid-level flow along
the backside of the trough will rapidly increase as 500 mb winds of
50 to 60 kts overspread northern California. Model soundings and
high-resolution model guidance show a brief window of strong surface
winds and humidity of 15-20% overlapping across the northern
Sacramento Valley. Uncertainty on the exact temporal and spatial
extent of this overlap remains uncertain. However, elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions appear possible from later
afternoon to early evening ahead of and along the cold front.

After dark, northerly surface winds will likely intensify as the
upper-level jet continues to move south. Despite the increase in
wind speeds, poor phasing of the trough and front with the diurnal
cycle will result in higher surface humidity values. While
elevated/critical criteria conditions appear unlikely overnight, the
strong surface winds and very dry fuels may impact several large
ongoing fires through the overnight hours.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CDT Tue Aug 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow pattern will continue day2/Wednesday, as
the upper trough moves to the east and begins to weaken slightly.
The surface cold front across northern California and the Great
Basin will continue southward, while surface low pressure in the lee
of the Rockies moves eastward onto the High Plains. Lingering strong
winds and dry conditions across California may support elevated fire
weather conditions through the afternoon.

...Northern California...
As the trough continues east, mid-level winds will begin to wane in
the early morning hours across the northern Sacramento Valley. Gusty
surface winds around 15-20 mph may linger through day as they veer
to the northeast, and are enhanced by the development of thermally
induced surface pressure trough. Warm temperatures will also support
widespread relative humidity below 20%. With dry fuels and ongoing
fires, elevated fire weather conditions appear likely through the
day before winds weaken and humidity recoveries improve overnight.

...Dakotas...
Ahead of the surface low and lee trough across the northern Plains,
gusty southerly winds of 15-20 mph are forecast to develop during
the afternoon. Surface humidity values across much of the region
will remain above 30% as the southerly flow transports Gulf moisture
northward. However, a few spots across western South Dakota may see
localized humidity below 25% near peak heating. This should support
a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions given mostly
dry fuels.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
254 AM EDT Tue Aug 17 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Aug 20 2021 - 12Z Tue Aug 24 2021

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A well defined upper level trough should be in place across the
Intermountain West and Northern Rockies to begin the forecast
period Friday, and an upper level ridge situated over the
Southeast U.S. in the wake of Tropical Storm Fred.  The upper
trough then reaches the Upper Midwest by the weekend and drives a
cold front and surface low eastward, with a building ridge across
the Northeast states that will force the main surface low
northward into Canada.  A more robust ridge axis developing over
the Gulf Coast region will tend to steer Tropical Storm Grace
farther westward across the Gulf and eventually making landfall
south of Brownsville, Texas.


...Model Analysis and preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite is still indicating some timing
differences with the trough exiting the Rockies and crossing the
northern Plains, and the 18Z/00Z runs of the GFS have been faster
compared to the better clustered CMC/ECMWF/UKMET guidance.  This
also holds true with the next shortwave across the north-central
U.S. by Sunday night.  The model spread with the path of Grace has
improved since yesterday, with latest trends suggesting a more
southern track owing to the strength of the ridge to its north.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily derived from a 12Z
ECMWF/ECENS/UKMET/CMC blend through Saturday, and then primarily
ECMWF/ECENS/and some GFS for the end of the forecast period.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

Improving weather conditions are expected for the East Coast to
close out the work week after the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred
exit the region, with some lingering showers remaining over
portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.  Moderate to heavy
rainfall is likely across portions of North Dakota and Minnesota
ahead of the developing storm system to close out the work week,
with the potential for some scattered 1 to 3 inch totals where
mesoscale convective complexes develop.  Another corridor of
enhanced showers and storms may materialize across portions of the
Mid-South this weekend owing to a slow moving front in the
vicinity.

In the temperature department, expect readings to be up to 20
degrees below normal across portions of the northern Rockies and
western portions of the northern Plains for the end of the week,
and some high elevation snow for Wyoming and Montana is within the
realm of possibility.  Except for some slightly above average
temperatures across the Great Lakes and New England, no serious
heat waves are currently expected.

Valid 12Z Fri Feb 19 2021 - 12Z Sun Feb 21 2021

...Light snow and freezing rain to linger across the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic through today...

...Central/Southern Plains begin to thaw out heading into the
weekend...

A much quieter weather pattern is in store for the CONUS over the
next few days. The current system that is bringing snow and
freezing rain to the Northeast and northern Mid-Atlantic, as well
as rain and thunderstorms to the Southeast will taper off today
while lingering snow showers will continue over much of the
interior Northeast and New England through Saturday. A general
area of 1-3 inches of additional snowfall is possible for the
Northeast today, while places downwind of the Lower Great Lakes
may receive between 4-8 inches of snow. Freezing rain impacts will
be minimal. Meanwhile, snow will continue for the western
mountains over the next couple of days as an upper-level
disturbance moves through the region. Rain will impact the coast
extending up from California through the Pacific Northwest. The
northern Cascades could see over a foot of snow while parts of the
Cascades, Sierra and Rockies may see between 6-10 inches of snow
through Saturday. Winter Storm Warnings and Advisories are in
effect for parts of the Cascades and Northern Rockies.

An anomalously cold week across the Southern Plains will begin to
come to an end this weekend as an approaching area of low pressure
pulls warmer air northward out ahead of it on Saturday. Before
that, widespread low temperature records may be broken tonight
over parts of eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley as
high pressure shifts into the eastern half of the country. Hard
Freeze warnings are in effect for much of southern/eastern Texas,
and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Temperatures will remain well
below average for much of the central US today and much of
tomorrow.

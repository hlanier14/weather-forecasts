Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1100 AM CDT Sat Oct 30 2021

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes were made to the ongoing forecast.

Locally elevated fire weather conditions will be possible in
portions of the southern High Plains this afternoon. Here, afternoon
relative humidity will fall into the teens in some areas, with peak
winds around 20 mph in other areas. However, the overlap of the
strongest winds with the lowest relative humidity will be limited to
locally favored areas.

..Marsh.. 10/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Sat Oct 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Gusty north winds are expected in the central High Plains today in
the wake of a cold front which will move south through the region.
Some areas will have relative humidity in the 15 to 25 percent
range. However, most of the areas where dry and windy conditions are
expected to overlap has seen recent rainfall. Therefore, the overall
fire weather threat is expected to be mostly limited due to high
fuel moisture. Elsewhere, cool and moist conditions are expected
which will keep fire weather concerns minimal.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Sat Oct 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Cool/moist conditions are expected across the majority of the CONUS
on Sunday. Some dry and occasionally breezy conditions may occur
across portions of the Southwest and Great Basin. Increased winds
may occur as a result of a deeply mixed boundary layer and
moderately strong mid-level westerly flow aloft. However, relative
humidity is not expected to be that dry (20 to 30 percent) and fuels
in the area are not critically dry.

Extended Forecast Discussion

300 PM EDT Sat Oct 30 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Nov 02 2021 - 12Z Sat Nov 06 2021

...Overview...

An omega block centered over North America will likely maintain
broad troughing across the eastern U.S. while general ridging will
tend to re-establish itself over the western U.S. during the
medium range period.  Periodic shortwave energies coming from the
eastern Pacific will attempt to pass under the omega block and
then across the western U.S. towards the central Plains.  This is
where much of the model uncertainty lies.  A more prominent
shortwave is forecast to track through the central Plains midweek
before reaching the East Coast late next week with some potential
for cyclogenesis to occur off the coast.  Another shortwave may
make its way through the western U.S. and move into the southern
Plains by next weekend.

 shifting a bit eastward during the latter part of the week. At
least a couple Pacific shortwaves will reach the West Coast with
some of the energy deflected northward by the Canadian ridge and
the rest passing through the West, which may dampen any ridging
that expands into the western U.S. as well as causing rounds of
precipitation there. Farther eastward, chilly surface high
pressure behind a cold front will promote below normal
temperatures across the central U.S. and increasingly more of the
East. Enhanced rainfall is likely over the Southern Plains and
into the Lower Mississippi Valley around midweek in the vicinity
of that front.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

With the omega block in place over North America, model solutions
appear to split into their own flavors as they try to handle the

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal system with occasional upper-level shortwaves passing
through the West will result in periods of enhanced precipitation
across the area during the second half of the week.  One such
shortwave is forecast to make its way into the central to southern
Plains where moderate to heavy rainfall is possible Wednesday into
Thursday.   Then the combination of moisture and southern stream
shortwave energy interacting with a frontal system across the
south-central U.S. will increase rainfall chances
Tuesday-Wednesday for the southern Plains and possibly into parts
of the lower Mississippi Valley, with some heavy rain possible.
Some precipitation could spread east/northeast during the latter
part of the week, with the higher elevations of the central
Appalachians and the interior Northeast seeing some possibility
for snow, but with low confidence in the specifics.

Meanwhile, unsettled weather is expected to continue along the
West Coast.  Northern California and far southwestern Oregon
should see the heaviest precipitation with normal terrain
enhancements and higher elevation snow.  Some of these activities
are expected to spread into the Pacific Northwest with lesser
totals eastward into the Intermountain West and Rockies.  Some
snow/rain can be expected in the central High Plains Tuesday night
into Wednesday morning as the upper shortwave heads further toward
the northeast.

Behind the cold front and underneath high pressure, well below
normal temperatures are likely across the central and eastern U.S.
This will especially be the case for highs which should be 10-20F
below average from the central and eventually southern parts of
the Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley and eastern
U.S. Chilly lows in the 20s may reach as far south as Kansas and
Iowa, which would only be minus 5-10F anomalies but would still
bring the first freeze around next Tuesday or so. Expect above
normal low temperatures under the western ridge aloft, but periods
of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat below normal over
California on most days and near normal elsewhere.

An omega block centered over North America will likely maintain
broad troughing across the eastern U.S. while general ridging will
tend to re-establish itself over the western U.S. during the
medium range period.  Periodic shortwave energies coming from the
eastern Pacific will attempt to pass under the omega block and

where much of the model uncertainty lies.  A more prominent
shortwave is forecast to track through the central Plains midweek
before reaching the East Coast late next week with some potential
for cyclogenesis to occur off the coast.  Another shortwave may
make its way through the western U.S. and move into the southern
Plains by next weekend.

 shifting a bit eastward during the latter part of the week. At
least a couple Pacific shortwaves will reach the West Coast with
some of the energy deflected northward by the Canadian ridge and
the rest passing through the West, which may dampen any ridging
that expands into the western U.S. as well as causing rounds of
precipitation there. Farther eastward, chilly surface high
pressure behind a cold front will promote below normal
temperatures across the central U.S. and increasingly more of the
East. Enhanced rainfall is likely over the Southern Plains and
into the Lower Mississippi Valley around midweek in the vicinity
of that front.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat October 30 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

...Overview...

An omega block centered over North America will likely maintain
broad troughing across the eastern U.S. while general ridging will
tend to re-establish itself over the western U.S. during the
medium range period.  Periodic shortwave energies coming from the
eastern Pacific will attempt to pass under the omega block and
then across the western U.S. towards the central Plains.  This is
where much of the model uncertainty lies.  A more prominent
shortwave is forecast to track through the central Plains midweek
before reaching the East Coast late next week with some potential
for cyclogenesis to occur off the coast.  Another shortwave may
make its way through the western U.S. and move into the southern
Plains by next weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

With the omega block in place over North America, model solutions
appear to split into their own flavors as they try to handle the
relatively amplified pattern with time.  The ECMWF solutions tend
to be slower while the GFS faster with bringing the broad upper
trough progressively through the eastern U.S. later next week.  In
the mean time, the CMC shows elements seen from both the ECMWF and
the GFS.  The slower ECMWF solutions would therefore open up the
possibility for a closed upper low to form over the central U.S.
followed by cyclogenesis off the New England coast by next
weekend.  On the other hand, the faster GFS would tend to kick the
energy farther offshore.  Meanwhile, recent ECMWF runs have shown
a tendency to speed up this incipient trough progression.  Given
this relatively typical biases of these models in the
medium-range, a general model compromise was used to compose the
WPC medium-range forecasts.  This consisted of mainly an even
blend of the deterministic and ensemble means from the 00Z
ECMWF/EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS, with smaller percentages from the
00Z CMC/CMC means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal system with occasional upper-level shortwaves passing
through the West will result in periods of enhanced precipitation
across the area during the second half of the week.  One such
shortwave is forecast to make its way into the central to southern
Plains where moderate to heavy rainfall is possible Wednesday into
Thursday.   Then the combination of moisture and southern stream
shortwave energy interacting with a frontal system across the
south-central U.S. will increase rainfall chances
Tuesday-Wednesday for the southern Plains and possibly into parts
of the lower Mississippi Valley, with some heavy rain possible.
Some precipitation could spread east/northeast during the latter
part of the week, with the higher elevations of the central
Appalachians and the interior Northeast seeing some possibility
for snow, but with low confidence in the specifics.  On the other
hand, the slower ECMWF solution continues to indicate the
possibility of cyclogenesis near the East Coast by next weekend.

Meanwhile, unsettled weather is expected to continue along the
West Coast.  Northern California and far southwestern Oregon
should see the heaviest precipitation with normal terrain
enhancements and higher elevation snow.  Some of these activities
are expected to spread into the Pacific Northwest with lesser
totals eastward into the Intermountain West and Rockies.  Some
snow/rain can be expected in the central High Plains Tuesday night
into Wednesday morning as the upper shortwave heads further toward
the northeast.

Behind the cold front, a cold high pressure system will maintain
well below normal temperatures across the central and eastern U.S.
 This will especially be the case for highs which should be 10-20F
below average from the central and eventually southern parts of
the Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley and eastern
U.S.  Chilly lows in the 20s may reach as far south as Kansas and
Iowa, which would only be minus 5-10F anomalies but would still
bring the first freeze around next Tuesday or so.  Expect above
normal low temperatures under the western ridge aloft, but periods
of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat below normal over
California on most days and near normal elsewhere.

...Overview...

An omega block centered over North America will likely maintain
broad troughing across the eastern U.S. while general ridging will
tend to re-establish itself over the western U.S. during the
medium range period.  Periodic shortwave energies coming from the
eastern Pacific will attempt to pass under the omega block and
then across the western U.S. towards the central Plains.  This is
where much of the model uncertainty lies.  A more prominent
shortwave is forecast to track through the central Plains midweek
before reaching the East Coast late next week with some potential
for cyclogenesis to occur off the coast.  Another shortwave may
make its way through the western U.S. and move into the southern
Plains by next weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

With the omega block in place over North America, model solutions
appear to split into their own flavors as they try to handle the
relatively amplified pattern with time.  The ECMWF solutions tend
to be slower while the GFS faster with bringing the broad upper
trough progressively through the eastern U.S. later next week.  In
the mean time, the CMC shows elements seen from both the ECMWF and
the GFS.  The slower ECMWF solutions would therefore open up the
possibility for a closed upper low to form over the central U.S.
followed by cyclogenesis off the New England coast by next
weekend.  On the other hand, the faster GFS would tend to kick the
energy farther offshore.  Meanwhile, recent ECMWF runs have shown
a tendency to speed up this incipient trough progression.  Given
this relatively typical biases of these models in the
medium-range, a general model compromise was used to compose the
WPC medium-range forecasts.  This consisted of mainly an even
blend of the deterministic and ensemble means from the 00Z
ECMWF/EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS, with smaller percentages from the
00Z CMC/CMC means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal system with occasional upper-level shortwaves passing
through the West will result in periods of enhanced precipitation
across the area during the second half of the week.  One such
shortwave is forecast to make its way into the central to southern
Plains where moderate to heavy rainfall is possible Wednesday into
Thursday.   Then the combination of moisture and southern stream
shortwave energy interacting with a frontal system across the
south-central U.S. will increase rainfall chances
Tuesday-Wednesday for the southern Plains and possibly into parts
of the lower Mississippi Valley, with some heavy rain possible.
Some precipitation could spread east/northeast during the latter
part of the week, with the higher elevations of the central
Appalachians and the interior Northeast seeing some possibility
for snow, but with low confidence in the specifics.  On the other
hand, the slower ECMWF solution continues to indicate the
possibility of cyclogenesis near the East Coast by next weekend.

Meanwhile, unsettled weather is expected to continue along the
West Coast.  Northern California and far southwestern Oregon
should see the heaviest precipitation with normal terrain
enhancements and higher elevation snow.  Some of these activities
are expected to spread into the Pacific Northwest with lesser
totals eastward into the Intermountain West and Rockies.  Some
snow/rain can be expected in the central High Plains Tuesday night
into Wednesday morning as the upper shortwave heads further toward
the northeast.

Behind the cold front, a cold high pressure system will maintain
well below normal temperatures across the central and eastern U.S.
 This will especially be the case for highs which should be 10-20F
below average from the central and eventually southern parts of
the Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley and eastern
U.S.  Chilly lows in the 20s may reach as far south as Kansas and
Iowa, which would only be minus 5-10F anomalies but would still
bring the first freeze around next Tuesday or so.  Expect above
normal low temperatures under the western ridge aloft, but periods
of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat below normal over
California on most days and near normal elsewhere.

...Strong storm system will affect New England on Sunday...

...Scattered rain and snow showers likely from the Central Rockies
to the High Plains...

...Cold front to bring cooler weather to much of the Plains by
Sunday...

The strong East Coast storm system that has produced coastal
flooding and heavy rainfall over the past couple of days will
affect New England through Sunday as the main surface low lifts
northward to eastern Canada.  New Hampshire and Maine will be the
recipients of the heaviest rain through Halloween with 2 to 3
inches of rain possible, particularly across southern Maine where
the moisture flux from the Atlantic will be most concentrated.  A
Slight Risk for excessive rainfall is also in effect for this
region, and some instances of flooding will be possible in
addition to coastal flooding.  Conditions should quickly improve
in time for the beginning of the work week with some lingering
showers possible, including some lake effect showers downwind of
the Great Lakes and snow showers for the highest elevations.

To the west, a cold front will continue to move southward through
the Plains while stalling across the Rockies and Great Basin.
Scattered rain and snow showers will develop across the Central
Rockies and High Plains throughout the day Sunday as the cold
front continues slowly southward.  Any snow accumulations are
expected to generally remain light with this system given the
relative dearth of moisture available.  Colder temperatures will
spread southward on Sunday, with highs in the 40s for the Northern
Plains, 50s for the Central Plains, and lower to middle 60s
reaching portions of the Southern Plains.  Elsewhere, generally
dry and seasonable conditions are expected for most of the
Southwestern U.S., stretching east across southern Texas.  Some
showers are possible across coastal portions of the Florida
Peninsula, but should remain light.  A storm system over the
eastern Pacific will approach the coast of the Pacific Northwest
and northern California by Monday morning with increasing rain
chances with up to an inch of rainfall possible.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Sun Oct 31 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Nov 03 2021 - 12Z Sun Nov 07 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Wednesday with vestiges of an omega
block over North America, as strong ridging takes hold over the
western half of Canada and lower amplitude ridging extends
southward into the western U.S., separating troughing in eastern
Canada/U.S. and mean troughing across the eastern Pacific. This
pattern should generally shift eastward through the latter part of
the workweek, while shortwaves attempt to pass under the omega
block into the western U.S. Uncertainty with the pattern is high
by Friday into the weekend, but the current forecast suggests the
potential for cyclogenesis to occur in the western Atlantic.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

After reasonable 12/18Z model agreement with the amplified pattern
described above through Wednesday-Thursday, guidance quickly
diverges by Friday regarding how to handle shortwaves digging
through the western side of the trough in the East and their
evolution in determining the upper pattern. The guidance generally
remains in two camps--ECMWF/CMC deterministic and ensemble
guidance and the GFS/GEFS runs. The GFS suite has been
persistently more progressive with this energy and takes the
troughing from the Great Lakes region quickly across the Northeast
into the Atlantic Friday into Saturday, though the 18Z run was a
bit slower than the 12Z. On the other hand, the EC/CMC spin up a
closed upper low separating into the southern stream and tracking
over the Ohio Valley toward the Mid-Atlantic for the latter part
of the week, which produces a surface low off the East Coast.

Additionally, model guidance varies with the handling of the
pattern across the eastern Pacific by late week, which greatly
affects the pattern across the western/central U.S. as shortwaves
may or may not track into the region. GFS runs and GEFS ensemble
members end up with flatter flow and low amplitude troughing over
the northwestern/north-central CONUS by Saturday and create a
closed low in the Northern Plains by Sunday, while the EC remains
ridgy. The 12Z CMC actually pairs closer to the GFS runs for this
feature, but not as aggressive.

Given the small scale of these initial features growing in size
and importance as the forecast progresses (a chaos
theory/butterfly effect situation), predictability is low, which
is shown by ensemble member spaghetti plots as well, with lots of
spread and GEFS members generally having the flattest flow in both
the West and East. But for this forecast cycle, the best approach
(considering relatively typical biases of these models) appeared
to be to lean heavily toward the well-clustered 12Z EC and CMC
ensemble means by the weekend. This provided a solution that has
separation in the northern/southern streams in the East, but not
quite to the level of a closed low that the deterministic CMC and
EC have, plus a bit faster solution than the particularly slow 12Z
ECMWF. Complicating matters a bit, the new 00Z CMC came in with a
faster track of the eastern low. The new 00Z ECMWF remains quite
slow with a closed low.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A shortwave moving across the Southern Plains along with a wavy
frontal boundary and moisture coming in from the Gulf of Mexico
will lead to moderate to heavy rainfall and potential for
thunderstorms Wednesday into Thursday. Some precipitation is
expected to spread east/northeast during the latter part of the
week, with the higher elevations of the central Appalachians and
the interior Northeast seeing some possibility for snow, but with
low confidence in the specifics. The possibility for cyclogenesis
off the East Coast by the weekend will play a role in determining
the amounts and placement of the precipitation in the East.

Frontal systems and upper-level shortwaves passing through the
West will result in periods of enhanced precipitation during the
second half of the week. Northern California and the Pacific
Northwest can expect the heaviest precipitation, with normal
terrain enhancements and higher elevation snow. Lesser
precipitation amounts are likely to spread into the Intermountain
West and Rockies, particularly on Thursday.

Behind the aforementioned front in the Southern Plains stretching
across the Gulf Coast, a cold high pressure system will maintain
well below normal temperatures across the central and eastern
CONUS. This will especially be the case for highs which should be
10-20F below average from the central and southern parts of the
Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley toward the
eastern U.S. Chilly lows are also forecast, with temperatures
about 5-10F below normal across the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and
stretching toward the south-central U.S. by Friday. Expect above
normal low temperatures under the western ridge aloft, but periods
of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat below normal over
California on most days and near to slightly above normal
elsewhere.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Sun Oct 31 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Nov 03 2021 - 12Z Sun Nov 07 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Wednesday with vestiges of an omega
block over North America, as strong ridging takes hold over the
western half of Canada and lower amplitude ridging extends
southward into the western U.S., separating troughing in eastern
Canada/U.S. and mean troughing across the eastern Pacific. This
pattern should generally shift eastward through the latter part of
the workweek, while shortwaves attempt to pass under the omega
block into the western U.S. Uncertainty with the pattern is high
by Friday into the weekend, but the current forecast suggests the
potential for cyclogenesis to occur in the western Atlantic.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

After reasonable 12/18Z model agreement with the amplified pattern
described above through Wednesday-Thursday, guidance quickly
diverges by Friday regarding how to handle shortwaves digging
through the western side of the trough in the East and their
evolution in determining the upper pattern. The guidance generally
remains in two camps--ECMWF/CMC deterministic and ensemble
guidance and the GFS/GEFS runs. The GFS suite has been
persistently more progressive with this energy and takes the
troughing from the Great Lakes region quickly across the Northeast
into the Atlantic Friday into Saturday, though the 18Z run was a
bit slower than the 12Z. On the other hand, the EC/CMC spin up a
closed upper low separating into the southern stream and tracking
over the Ohio Valley toward the Mid-Atlantic for the latter part
of the week, which produces a surface low off the East Coast.

Additionally, model guidance varies with the handling of the
pattern across the eastern Pacific by late week, which greatly
affects the pattern across the western/central U.S. as shortwaves
may or may not track into the region. GFS runs and GEFS ensemble
members end up with flatter flow and low amplitude troughing over
the northwestern/north-central CONUS by Saturday and create a
closed low in the Northern Plains by Sunday, while the EC remains
ridgy. The 12Z CMC actually pairs closer to the GFS runs for this
feature, but not as aggressive.

Given the small scale of these initial features growing in size
and importance as the forecast progresses (a chaos
theory/butterfly effect situation), predictability is low, which
is shown by ensemble member spaghetti plots as well, with lots of
spread and GEFS members generally having the flattest flow in both
the West and East. But for this forecast cycle, the best approach
(considering relatively typical biases of these models) appeared
to be to lean heavily toward the well-clustered 12Z EC and CMC
ensemble means by the weekend. This provided a solution that has
separation in the northern/southern streams in the East, but not
quite to the level of a closed low that the deterministic CMC and
EC have, plus a bit faster solution than the particularly slow 12Z
ECMWF. Complicating matters a bit, the new 00Z CMC came in with a
faster track of the eastern low. The new 00Z ECMWF remains quite
slow with a closed low.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A shortwave moving across the Southern Plains along with a wavy
frontal boundary and moisture coming in from the Gulf of Mexico
will lead to moderate to heavy rainfall and potential for
thunderstorms Wednesday into Thursday. Some precipitation is
expected to spread east/northeast during the latter part of the
week, with the higher elevations of the central Appalachians and
the interior Northeast seeing some possibility for snow, but with
low confidence in the specifics. The possibility for cyclogenesis
off the East Coast by the weekend will play a role in determining
the amounts and placement of the precipitation in the East.

Frontal systems and upper-level shortwaves passing through the
West will result in periods of enhanced precipitation during the
second half of the week. Northern California and the Pacific
Northwest can expect the heaviest precipitation, with normal
terrain enhancements and higher elevation snow. Lesser
precipitation amounts are likely to spread into the Intermountain
West and Rockies, particularly on Thursday.

Behind the aforementioned front in the Southern Plains stretching
across the Gulf Coast, a cold high pressure system will maintain
well below normal temperatures across the central and eastern
CONUS. This will especially be the case for highs which should be
10-20F below average from the central and southern parts of the
Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley toward the
eastern U.S. Chilly lows are also forecast, with temperatures
about 5-10F below normal across the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and
stretching toward the south-central U.S. by Friday. Expect above
normal low temperatures under the western ridge aloft, but periods
of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat below normal over
California on most days and near to slightly above normal
elsewhere.

...One more day of rain for the Northeast as storm system finally
departs Sunday evening...

...Frontal system to bring showers, thunderstorms, and a wintry
mix from the Great Basin to the Central Plains...

...Precipitation chances increase Monday for the West Coast as a
Pacific storm system approaches...

The powerful storm system that brought heavy rain and coastal
flooding to the East Coast the past few days will finally begin to
depart the region on Sunday as the low pressure center moves
northward into Canada. Lingering showers are likely through the
day for northern New England and upstate New York, where some
locations could see up to another inch of rain. As this system
departs, another area of low pressure to the west will deepen and
move further northward into Canada, with a trailing cold front
that will continue east across the Great Lakes Sunday. Scattered
rain showers will be likely through the period with the passage of
the front as well as with additional disturbances rotating around
the system. A wintry mix is also possible with the cooler air
behind the front.

Further west, this cold front will continue southward through the
Plains while remaining stalled through the Central Rockies and
northern Great Basin.  A wintry mix of rain, freezing rain, sleet,
and snow showers will expand in coverage from the Central Rockies
and High Plains Sunday further east into the Central Plains
Monday. Accumulations overall are expected to remain light with
this system given the relative dearth of moisture available.
However, this will likely be the first taste of winter for many
areas east of the Rockies so caution is still advised. A Winter
Weather Advisory is out for portions of eastern Wyoming and
western Nebraska where a glaze of freezing rain and up to 2 inches
of snow are expected on Sunday. Chilly temperatures are forecast
for Sunday and Monday north of the front, which will slow as it
moves into Texas. Highs will generally be in the upper 50s to
lower 60s for the Southern High Plains and Oklahoma. Widespread
highs in the 40s are forecast further north, with temperatures
dipping below freezing Monday and Tuesday morning. Showers and
some thunderstorms are possible along western portions of the
front from the northern Great Basin eastward to western Colorado.

A storm system over the eastern Pacific will approach the coast of
the Pacific Northwest and northern California by Monday morning.
Rain and higher elevation snow is likely throughout the day Monday
and into Tuesday morning. The heaviest rain is forecast for far
southern Oregon and northern California, where totals over an inch
are possible. The system is forecast to weaken as it reaches the
coast, so any more significant impacts should remain limited.

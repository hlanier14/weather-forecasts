Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1140 AM CDT Fri Jun 11 2021

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed to the ongoing fire-weather forecast (see
previous discussion below).  Gusty post-frontal surface winds have
been observed this morning across much of the High Plains from
eastern Montana southward into the Texas Panhandle.  As the surface
pressure gradient relaxes into the afternoon, the winds are expected
to weaken while RH values fall.  This temporal mismatch of strongest
winds and lowest RH, as well as concerns about fuel receptiveness
across the region, should limit the overall fire weather concerns.

..Jirak.. 06/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1246 AM CDT Fri Jun 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
Dry conditions will persist across much of the Southwest and Great
Basin where fuels are most receptive. However, upper-level height
rises across the western CONUS will result in generally weak flow at
the surface. This will mitigate most fire weather threats, though a
few localized concerns may evolve along the High Plains. Elsewhere,
widespread rain chances and high humidity will limit further
concerns.

...Southeast Montana...
Dry post-frontal conditions are expected by late afternoon as RH
falls into the 15-25% range for many locations. Westerly winds are
expected to gradually increase to near 15 mph and may support
localized elevated conditions where fuels are dry. Recent
precipitation over the region and marginal ERC values will limit the
spatial extent of this concern.

...Southern High Plains...
Relative humidity values are forecast to fall into the 15-20% range
behind a southward moving cold front by late afternoon across parts
of the Texas Panhandle and northeast NM. Post-frontal winds will
likely increase to 15-25 mph, but may be offset spatially from the
lowest humidity. Somewhat low ensemble probabilities of overlapping
low RH/strong winds support this idea, though localized elevated
conditions may develop. Furthermore, fuels across this region are
only modestly receptive with seasonal to below-seasonal ERC values
noted.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 11 2021

SYNOPSIS: Heat-related concerns continue to loom across the western U.S. at
the
beginning of the period in association with mid-level high pressure. Over the
course of Week-2 this feature is forecast to weaken, and in turn reduce heat
potential, although uncertainty exists regarding whether heat may linger over
the Great Basin or extend eastward toward the Great Lakes. Model guidance
continues to indicate the potential for a disturbance over the Gulf of Mexico
to possibly become a tropical cyclone near the beginning of the forecast
period. The fate of this disturbance is highly uncertain, with much of the
Gulf
Coast facing potential impacts along its subsequent track. Mid-level low
pressure is forecast across the Northeast and over the Bering Sea, neither of
which appear likely to be a driver for hazardous weather.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of California, the Southwest, the
Great Basin, and the Rockies, Sat, Jun 19.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for most areas stretching from the Pacific
Coastal Ranges to the Rockies, Sat-Sun, Jun 19-20.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the West, Northern and Central
Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Midwest, Sat-Wed, Jun 19-
23.

Slight risk of heavy rain for areas adjacent to the western and central Gulf
of
Mexico and portions of the Tennessee Valley, Sat-Mon, Jun 19-21.

Slight risk of high winds for coastal areas along the western and central Gulf
of Mexico, Sat-Sun, Jun 19-20.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of coastal Oregon and Northern
California, Sat-Sun, Jun 19-20.

Flooding possible for parts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY JUNE 14 - FRIDAY JUNE 18:

FOR SATURDAY JUNE 19 - FRIDAY JUNE 25: Two primary concerns continue to
manifest themselves during Week-2, with the first being potential
record-setting heat across the West. As with yesterday, the high, moderate,
and
slight risks for excessive heat are drawn roughly coincident with GEFS and
ECMWF reforecast guidance forecasting a better than 60%, 40%, and 20% chance,
respectively, of daily maximum temperatures surpassing the 85th percentile
from
climatology. The high risk covers portions of the Great Basin, Desert
Southwest, California, and Rockies on the 19th. Within the high risk area,
daily record high temperatures continue to be possible ranging from the upper
80s in the Sawtooth Valley of Idaho to 115+ degrees F across the Desert
Southwest and near 110 degrees F over the Central Valley of California. A
moderate risk of excessive heat covers most areas between the Pacific Coastal
Ranges and the Rockies on the 19th and 20th, where a handful of record highs
remain possible based on today's National Blend of Models. Beyond the 20th
models begin to diverge on where the core of the heat lingers, with the GEFS
persisting over the Great Basin while the ECMWF shows an elongated corridor of
heat potential stretching eastward toward the Great Lakes. As a result, a
slight risk of excessive heat covers both regions on the 19th through 22nd.
Heat remains the number one source of weather-related fatalities in the U.S.,
so consider reviewing heat safety guidance to better prepare for the event:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat__;!!DZ3fjg!r5d5qAkBokN3h5fg-A9ZxWgtHKrlqWPdgzLnJUmK9tnD2fGbGoO29q7joRMBIX_1cnLXESn_$ .



While not fully indicated on the forecast graphic, the heat appears likely to
have additional adverse impacts. First, the hot and dry conditions are likely
to exacerbate drought over the West, while also supporting increased fire
weather concerns. The National Interagency Fire Center shows widespread
moderate to high significant fire potential across California, Nevada, Idaho,
Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico during Week-1, with these concerns likely to
persist as the prolonged hot and dry weather lingers into Week-2. Second,
temperatures across the Desert Southwest show signs of possibly approaching
120
degrees F which has historically led to aviation impacts regarding jet engines
being outside of their tested safety ranges. Third, the thermal low associated
with the heat over the Great Basin is likely to drive northerly flow along the
immediate Pacific Coastline of Oregon and Northern California and an
associated
slight risk for high winds (exceeding 40 mph) on the 19th and 20th.



The second overarching concern during Week-2 remains impacts from tropical
cyclogenesis possibly occurring over the Western Gulf of Mexico at some point
late in the week of the 13th. The National Hurricane Center currently predicts
a 20% chance of a tropical cyclone (TC) forming over the Bay of Campeche
through the 16th. Model guidance continues to show a deepening circulation as
this feature shifts northward through late in Week-1, with a TC possibly being
present over the western Gulf of Mexico at the outset of Week-2. The last
three
runs of the deterministic ECMWF have shifted progressively northward from
run-to-run, but persisted in terms of having a TC present along roughly 95W
between 25-30N. ECMWF ensemble members show a similar northward track along
95W
before disparities in how quickly the system recurves, bringing the system
ashore anywhere from near the Texas/Mexico Border to the Mississippi River
Delta. The last several deterministic runs from the GFS also highlight the
95th
parallel region and a northward trend with subsequent intializations, although
the 6Z run is a notable outlier to the east with the system just south of the
Delta region. The 6Z GEFS ensembles also show this eastward shift, although
the
0Z ensembles are generally on the eastern periphery of the ECMWF envelope as
well. Given the broad uncertainty regarding a possible track, limited
refinement was made to the slight risks for high wind (Jun 19-20) and heavy
rain (Jun 19-21) from yesterday's outlook. The slight risk for high winds is
posted from the Mexico border eastward through Mobile Bay, while the slight
risk for heavy rain covers this same region with some extension inland over
the
Tennessee and Lower Mississippi Valleys and a slight eastward extension into
the Florida Panhandle. Possible flash flooding and river flooding could occur
from East Texas through southern Alabama where additional rainfall occurs on
top of soils saturated from rainfall over the past 30 days exceeding 200% of
normal. For the latest information on this system please follow updates from
the National Hurricane Center
(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/__;!!DZ3fjg!r5d5qAkBokN3h5fg-A9ZxWgtHKrlqWPdgzLnJUmK9tnD2fGbGoO29q7joRMBIX_1ch9Uh6xL$ )
or your local Weather
Forecast Office.



Alaska is forecast to experience anomalous 500-hPa ridging, resulting in a
tilt
toward near to above-normal temperatures being favored statewide.
Precipitation
signals are mixed across the state, but any convection that develops could be
a
concern given the associated lighting potential and the forecast period
coinciding with the climatological peak of fire season.

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through next week across
much of the Interior West and at times into the northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...


...Overview...

Guidance agrees that a very strong upper ridge will be centered
over the Four Corners states next week while a mean trough
prevails over the East into about Thursday.  A portion of the
energy from an eastern Pacific upper trough/low will eject
northeastward and around the ridge, bringing a cold front into the
Northwest late Monday into late Tuesday and then continuing across
the northern tier states.  This shortwave energy will eventually
help to kick out the eastern trough late in the week.  The
persistence and strength of the western upper ridge will likely
produce a broad area of temperatures that approach/exceed daily
record values over the Interior West/Rockies on most days next
week, making for a hazardous heat wave event.  Some of this heat
will extend into the northern Plains for a time as well.  In the
Gulf of Mexico, a disturbance may form near the Bay of Campeche
and move northward late in the week but there remains a large
degree of uncertainty in its evolution.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The models and means show better than average consensus for the
strength and position of the Four Corners ridge/upper high through
the period, leaving the guidance differences for areas around its
periphery.  Strength of the upper high is remarkable -- near +3
sigma 500mb heights that may breach record high heights for this
early in the warm season. Within the eastern North America mean
trough, there has been some spread for an eastern Canada upper low
that may track into or just north of New England.  Deterministic
models were a bit removed, but clustered with each other, from the
ensemble mean consensus with two areas of low pressure over/near
New England Tue-Wed. With some adjustments still seen in the
ensembles, leaned more toward the deterministic consensus that
shows a bit stronger ridging over the West and Atlantic.

Meanwhile the models show typical variability for the details of
the eastern Pacific energy that ultimately tracks around the
western ridge, favoring a blend approach that includes some
ensemble means later in the period and which represents the most
common elements of guidance.  Did adjust the next Thu/Fri system
quicker, supported by a flattening of the Pacific jet upstream.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, the models and means show an area of
increasing moisture and lower heights aloft/surface pressures
lifting northward out of the Bay of Campeche, with some signals
for possible tropical development per the ECMWF tropical cyclone
formation probabilities >40-50%.  By day 7 Friday the manual
forecast shows an area of low pressure ~300 miles south of the
TX/LA border per the NHC-WPC coordinated forecast.  Monitor future
forecasts for any adjustments.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Within the broad area of heat across the western and northern
U.S., expect the most extreme anomalies to be over the northern
Rockies and High Plains during Monday-Wednesday with highs at
least 20-25F above normal.  Ejection of an eastern Pacific trough
and leading front that crosses northern portions of the West and
continues into the Plains will bring some relief to those areas
but otherwise the West should continue to see highs 10-20F above
normal along with a westward expansion of the heat mid-late week.
Morning lows should also be 10-20F above normal over a majority of
the West through the period, as well as the northern Plains into
Thursday.  The combination of extreme daily temperatures and
duration, as well as being rather early in the season for such an
event, should make this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive
groups. Excessive heat warnings are in place for many areas of the
Southwest next week where temperatures may climb well into the
110s in the lower deserts.

The eastern trough aloft and associated surface waves/fronts will
produce some areas of rain and thunderstorms of varying intensity
and during mid-late week some moderately below normal temperatures
(perhaps 5 to no more than 10F below normal).  The southern tier
may see rain from both a wavy front and typical diurnal convective
activity.  Portions of the Gulf Coast region could see an increase
of rainfall toward the end of next week as moisture pushes
northward across the Gulf.  Monitor forecasts/National Hurricane
Center discussions over the coming days for the latest information
regarding any potential tropical cyclone development.  The upper
trough/surface front initially near the Pacific Northwest will
bring light-moderate rain to the region during the first half of
the week.  Toward late week this system may produce some rainfall
from the northeastern Plains into the Great Lakes.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri June 11 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 17 - 21 2021

Today's model solutions are in a good agreement on the 500-hPa circulation
pattern across the forecast domain during the 6-10 day period. Although the
pattern is slightly deamplified, relative to yesterday's 6-10 day forecast, a
strong mean ridge is predicted over the western CONUS and a mean trough over
the eastern CONUS. The ridge-trough pattern over the CONUS favors positive
mid-level height anomalies over the West and below-normal mid-level heights
over the northeastern CONUS. Weak negative 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over the western Gulf Coast and southern Texas, associated with
unsettled weather later in the 6-10 day period. Over Alaska, positive mid-
level
height anomalies are favored in association with the northward extension of a
mean ridge over the Northeast Pacific and West Coast. 500-hPa heights diminish
from above-normal to more near-normal over the central and western Aleutians,
underneath mean troughing over the Bering Sea and Aleutians.

Troughing centered over the Bering Sea and associated southerly to
southwesterly flow are forecast to favor relatively warm conditions for much
of
Mainland Alaska and the easetern Aleutians. Downstream, anomalous ridging
predicted over much of the western CONUS favors enhanced probabilities of
above-normal temperatures across most of the western CONUS, extending to the
Central and Northern Plains and Great Lakes. Probabilities of above-normal
temperatures exceed 80 percent across parts of the interior West. Northerly
and
northeasterly surface flow favored early in the 6-10 day period tilts odds
toward below-normal temperatures in the Northeast. Below-normal temperature
probabilities in Texas and Louisiana are associated with large positive soil
moisture anomalies and the potential for tropical activity later in the
period.
Above-normal temperatures are favored from the Florida Peninsula to southern
South Carolina, ahead of a mean frontal boundary forecast across the
Southeast.

Forecast troughing centered over the Bering Sea and western Alaska favors
above-normal precipitation over the western Alaska Mainland and Peninsula.
Anomalous ridging and positive height anomalies predicted over much of the
western CONUS are expected to increase chances of below-normal precipitation
across much of the northern and central CONUS, especially over parts of the
Northern Rockies eastward to the Northern Plains and parts of the Midwest.
Weak
below-normal precipitation probabilities over the eastern CONUS are associated
with surface mean high pressure. Odds also tilt toward below-normal
precipitation in the southern Florida Peninsula, as this region is expected to
remain south of a mean frontal boundary across the Southeast. Increased
potential for tropical activity in the western Gulf of Mexico late in the
period elevates odds for above-normal precipitation across the western and
central Gulf Coast. Models predict increased odds of above-normal
precipitation
in the Southwest as some of the Gulf moisture is favored to be advected into
the region, aided by increased southerly flow between a thermal surface low
over the Desert Southwest and a localized area of high pressure over the Four
Corners Region.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the model solutions in the predicted 500-hPa height pattern
across the forecast domain, offset by differences in the temperature and
precipitation fields across Alaska and the eastern CONUS, and uncertainty in
the tropics.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 19 - 25 2021

During the Week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is forecast to
deamplify, relative to the 6-10 day period, and become more zonal over the
much
of the CONUS, but remaining amplified farther west over the Pacific Ocean.
Today's mid-level height pattern consists of a mean trough over the Bering Sea
and western Alaska and a strong mean ridge over the Northeast Pacific.
Above-normal 500-hPa heights are favored over all of Alaska, despite mean
troughing near the western Mainland. Weak mean anticyclonic flow over much of
the West favors above-normal mid-level heights over the western half of the
CONUS. The western extension of the Atlantic mean subtropical ridge favors
slightly above-normal mid-level heights over the Southeast. Negative mid-level
height anomalies over the Great Lakes and Northeast are associated with a mean
trough that is favored to deamplify throughout the Week-2 period.

Above-normal temperatures are favored for much of Mainland Alaska and the
eastern Aleutians, associated with mean southerly flow ahead of a mean trough
over the Bering Sea and the west coast of the Mainland. Positive 500-hPa
height
anomalies over the western CONUS favor above-normal temperatures across the
region. Enhanced above-normal temperature probabilities extend eastward across
the Central and Northern Plains to the Great Lakes, associated with mean
southerly surface flow. Near to below-normal temperatures are expected over
parts of the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley due to above-normal
soil moisture and the potential for tropical activity during the Week-2
period.
Below-normal temperatures in the Northeast are associated with northwesterly
surface flow early and late in the Week-2 period. Probabilities of above-
normal
temperatures are slightly elevated for much of the Southeast, as the western
extension of the Atlantic subtropical ridge is expected to provide
predominantly southerly surface flow.

Forecast troughing over the eastern Bering Sea favors mean southerly flow and
above-normal precipitation over the Aleutians and Mainland Alaska. Below-
normal
precipitation odds are increased for the northwestern and central CONUS,
associated with mean ridging over the western CONUS. The increased potential
for enhanced moisture flow from the Gulf of Mexico favors elevated odds of
above-normal precipitation for much of the Southeast and Lower Mississippi
Valley, extending to the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic. Similar to the 6-10 day
period, models favor a surface pattern conducive for some of this moisture to
be pulled into the Southwest.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among model circulation patterns over the forecast domain, offset by
differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast tools, and
uncertainty in the tropics.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Fri Jun 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

An elevated area was delineated across the eastern Mogollon Rim in
Arizona, White Mountains, and Gila region of southwestern New Mexico
in this outlook update.  Despite the weak flow aloft across the
region, most models and ensembles are in agreement with sustained
afternoon surface winds of 15-20 mph concurrent with critical RH
values in the single digits.  Given the hot and very dry conditions,
ongoing extreme to exceptional drought, and ERC values exceeding the
90th percentile, fire weather concerns will be elevated tomorrow.

..Jirak.. 06/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Fri Jun 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will become established over the south-central
U.S. over the weekend, resulting in hot and dry, but relatively
calm, conditions across the Southwest. While fuels will continue to
cure, weak surface winds will yield only localized fire weather
concerns. Elsewhere, scattered rain chances and/or weak winds under
a surface high will mitigate additional fire weather threats.

...Southwest...
Localized elevated conditions will be possible along the Mogollon
Rim in AZ and into the Gila region of southwest NM Saturday
afternoon. Although flow will be weak over the region, deep
boundary-layer mixing and terrain-enhancements may result in winds
up to 15-20 mph coincident with RH values near 10%. To the east,
isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible along the southern
Rockies within an upslope flow regime. While wetting precipitation
is expected (and will most likely fall over modestly receptive
fuels), a few dry lightning strikes are possible.

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Plains through Saturday morning...

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Mid-Atlantic through Saturday morning...

A front extending from the Mid-Atlantic to the Upper Mississippi
Valley, then southwestward to the Southern High Plains, will move
eastward to parts of the Northeast, trailing off the Lower
Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains by Sunday. Showers and
thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the boundary over
most of the Mississippi Valley and parts of the Central/Southern
Plains through Saturday.  The SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over the Central Plains through Saturday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes. There is a 10% or greater probability of wind gust
of 65 knots or greater over parts of the Central/Southern Plains.
Additionally, there is a 10% or greater probability of two-inch or
great hail over parts of the Central/Southern High Plains through
Saturday morning.

Along the eastern part of the front, multiple upper-level impulses
are east of the Mississippi River, one over the Mid-Atlantic,
second over the Western Ohio Valley, and the third over Michigan.
The upper-level energy over the Mid-Atlantic will produce showers
and thunderstorms, some with heavy rain. The WPC has issued a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms. The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers through Saturday morning.

The severe thunderstorm threat weakens on Saturday and is more
likely over parts of the Central Gulf Coast and the Southern High
Plains.  There will also be a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
over parts of the Tennessee Valley on Saturday into Sunday
morning.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop east of the
Mississippi River to parts of the East Coast on Saturday into
Sunday morning.

In the meantime, a weak front will come onshore over the Pacific
Northwest on late Friday afternoon and dissipate on Saturday. A
second front will move onshore over the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday. The systems will produce rain over parts of the Pacific
Northwest/Northern California through Sunday afternoon.

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through next week across
much of the Interior West and at times into the northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...


...Overview...

Guidance agrees that a very strong upper ridge will be centered
over the Four Corners states next week while a mean trough
prevails over the East into about Thursday.  A portion of the
energy from an eastern Pacific upper trough/low will eject
northeastward and around the ridge, bringing a cold front into the
Northwest late Monday into late Tuesday and then continuing across
the northern tier states.  This shortwave energy will eventually
help to kick out the eastern trough late in the week.  The
persistence and strength of the western upper ridge will likely
produce a broad area of temperatures that approach/exceed daily
record values over the Interior West/Rockies on most days next
week, making for a hazardous heat wave event.  Some of this heat
will extend into the northern Plains for a time as well.  In the
Gulf of Mexico, a disturbance may form near the Bay of Campeche
and move northward late in the week but there remains a large
degree of uncertainty in its evolution.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The models and means show better than average consensus for the
strength and position of the Four Corners ridge/upper high through
the period, leaving the guidance differences for areas around its
periphery.  Strength of the upper high is remarkable -- near +3
sigma 500mb heights that may breach record high heights for this
early in the warm season. Within the eastern North America mean
trough, there has been some spread for an eastern Canada upper low
that may track into or just north of New England.  Deterministic
models were a bit removed, but clustered with each other, from the
ensemble mean consensus with two areas of low pressure over/near
New England Tue-Wed. With some adjustments still seen in the
ensembles, leaned more toward the deterministic consensus that
shows a bit stronger ridging over the West and Atlantic.

Meanwhile the models show typical variability for the details of
the eastern Pacific energy that ultimately tracks around the
western ridge, favoring a blend approach that includes some
ensemble means later in the period and which represents the most
common elements of guidance.  Did adjust the next Thu/Fri system
quicker, supported by a flattening of the Pacific jet upstream.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, the models and means show an area of
increasing moisture and lower heights aloft/surface pressures
lifting northward out of the Bay of Campeche, with some signals
for possible tropical development per the ECMWF tropical cyclone
formation probabilities >40-50%.  By day 7 Friday the manual
forecast shows an area of low pressure ~300 miles south of the
TX/LA border per the NHC-WPC coordinated forecast.  Monitor future
forecasts for any adjustments.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Within the broad area of heat across the western and northern
U.S., expect the most extreme anomalies to be over the northern
Rockies and High Plains during Monday-Wednesday with highs at
least 20-25F above normal.  Ejection of an eastern Pacific trough
and leading front that crosses northern portions of the West and
continues into the Plains will bring some relief to those areas
but otherwise the West should continue to see highs 10-20F above
normal along with a westward expansion of the heat mid-late week.
Morning lows should also be 10-20F above normal over a majority of
the West through the period, as well as the northern Plains into
Thursday.  The combination of extreme daily temperatures and
duration, as well as being rather early in the season for such an
event, should make this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive
groups. Excessive heat warnings are in place for many areas of the
Southwest next week where temperatures may climb well into the
110s in the lower deserts.

The eastern trough aloft and associated surface waves/fronts will
produce some areas of rain and thunderstorms of varying intensity
and during mid-late week some moderately below normal temperatures
(perhaps 5 to no more than 10F below normal).  The southern tier
may see rain from both a wavy front and typical diurnal convective
activity.  Portions of the Gulf Coast region could see an increase
of rainfall toward the end of next week as moisture pushes
northward across the Gulf.  Monitor forecasts/National Hurricane
Center discussions over the coming days for the latest information
regarding any potential tropical cyclone development.  The upper
trough/surface front initially near the Pacific Northwest will
bring light-moderate rain to the region during the first half of
the week.  Toward late week this system may produce some rainfall
from the northeastern Plains into the Great Lakes.

most of the Mississippi Valley and parts of the Central/Southern
Plains through Saturday.  The SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over the Central Plains through Saturday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes. There is a 10% or greater probability of wind gust
of 65 knots or greater over parts of the Central/Southern Plains.
Additionally, there is a 10% or greater probability of two-inch or
great hail over parts of the Central/Southern High Plains through
Saturday morning.

Along the eastern part of the front, multiple upper-level impulses
are east of the Mississippi River, one over the Mid-Atlantic,
second over the Western Ohio Valley, and the third over Michigan.
The upper-level energy over the Mid-Atlantic will produce showers
and thunderstorms, some with heavy rain. The WPC has issued a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms. The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers through Saturday morning.

The severe thunderstorm threat weakens on Saturday and is more
likely over parts of the Central Gulf Coast and the Southern High
Plains. Showers and thunderstorms will develop east of the
Mississippi River to parts of the East Coast on Saturday into
Sunday morning.

In the meantime, a weak front will come onshore over the Pacific
Northwest on late Friday afternoon and dissipate on Saturday. A
second front will move onshore over the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday. The systems will produce rain over parts of the Pacific
Northwest/Northern California through Sunday afternoon.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 AM CDT Sat Jun 12 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will continue to build over the southern High
Plains for the next 24 hours, which will support generally weak flow
at the surface and a continuation of hot and dry conditions west of
the southern Rockies. Wind enhancements along terrain features will
likely result in areas of elevated conditions for parts of the
Southwest, but relatively benign winds and/or recent precipitation
and rain chances today will mitigate most other concerns.

...Eastern Arizona into Western New Mexico...
Although upper-level flow over the region will remain fairly weak,
deep-boundary layer mixing is expected once again this afternoon
amid strong diurnal heating. This will help support 15-20 mph winds,
especially within and in the lee of the Mongollon Rim and into the
Gila Region of southwest NM. Poor overnight RH recovery and little
moisture flux into the region will result in another day of single
digit RH values. Several fires in the broader region confirm
receptive fuels are in place and will support elevated fire weather
conditions given the forecast wind/RH combinations.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop along
the southern Rockies within an up-slope flow regime. Precipitable
water values are forecast to increase to generally above 0.6 inches,
but a few thunderstorms on the periphery of the better moisture may
support a few dry lightning strikes over dry fuels. However, the
expected coverage of dry lightning is too low to warrant additional
highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 AM CDT Sat Jun 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Meridional upper-level flow is expected to become established along
the West coast as a strong ridge remains in place along the axis of
the Rocky Mountains. A low-amplitude impulse moving along the coast
will support modest surface pressure falls over the Pacific
Northwest Sunday afternoon, resulting in strengthening
pressure-gradient winds, and a subsequent increase in fire weather
concerns, within the Great Basin. Elsewhere across the CONUS recent
rainfall and/or weak winds in the vicinity of a surface high will
mitigate additional fire weather potential.

...Great Basin...
Ensemble guidance suggests winds will likely increase to 15-20 mph
across a broad swath of the Great Basin Sunday afternoon. Antecedent
hot and dry conditions are already in place, and 5-15% RH values
appear likely for much of the region. Several fires are noted across
NV and UT, indicating that fuels are receptive amid persistent
drought conditions. Consequently, elevated fire weather conditions
appear likely. Strengthening mid-level flow will support periods of
critical conditions as winds increase to 20-25 mph. However,
confidence in the most likely location and coverage of critical
conditions remains too low to highlight in this outlook.

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through next week across
much of the Interior West into California and through midweek over
the northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...


...Overview...

Today's guidance maintains reasonable continuity for the general
pattern evolution.  The very strong upper ridge centered over the
Four Corners states next week may weaken somewhat by
Friday-Saturday.  Vigorous shortwave energy brushing the Northwest
and tracking around the Four Corners ridge will push a cold front
across the northern half of the West and Plains, eventually
reaching northern parts of the East by next weekend.  This energy
should re-establish eastern North American mean troughing after it
kicks out a leading trough expected to persist near the East Coast
into Thursday.  Expect the western upper ridge to support a large
area of temperatures that approach/exceed daily record values over
portions the Interior West/Rockies on most days next week and
extending into California during the latter half of the
week--making for a hazardous heat wave event.  Some of this heat
will extend into the northern Plains through at least midweek as
well.  In the Gulf of Mexico, there is still the potential for a
disturbance to form near the Bay of Campeche and move northward
late in the week but also a large degree of uncertainty in its
evolution.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The models and means continue to agree well for the strength and
position of the Four Corners ridge/upper high through the period.
Early-mid period strength of the upper ridge is remarkable with
the new 00Z GFS showing 500mb height anomalies of +2.5-3 standard
deviations over parts of the Rockies/High Plains and even greater
than that north of the Canadian border on Tuesday.  Such heights
may breach record high heights for this early in the warm season.
Models/means all show some weakening of the ridge by
Friday-Saturday.  For the initial eastern North America upper
trough, most guidance has gravitated to a common solution but the
00Z CMC differs with some details.  It may still take some time to
resolve the finer details of surface low evolution near New
England.  Among 12Z/18Z guidance an operational model blend
represented consensus well.

Not counting the 00Z CMC, there is decent agreement in principle
for the shortwave ejecting through the Northwest and around the
western ridge, ultimately settling into the long-term mean trough
over eastern North America.  The main issue with the leading front
is that the 12Z/18Z GFS runs push it farther south over the Plains
versus other guidance by late in the period (leading to a dramatic
difference in rainfall over the southern Rockies/High Plains).
The 00Z GFS appears to have adjusted back somewhat.  Meanwhile
models and individual ensemble members show considerable
difficulty in handling the complexities of North Pacific
flow--leading some guidance to become up to 180 degrees out of
phase for eastern Pacific/western North America features by late
in the week/weekend.  An operational model blend for the first
half of the period trending to an even weight of models/means
later represents consensus well for the leading shortwave, and by
way of the GFS/ECMWF offsetting late in the period over the
eastern Pacific/western North America the blend ends up close to
the conservative mean solution while waiting for details to become
more clear.

Latest guidance continues to show the possibility for some degree
of tropical development to emerge from the Bay of Campeche and
track northward over the Gulf of Mexico.  Through the 12Z/18Z
cycles the ECMWF had been the steadiest with the depiction of the
surface system while the GFS/CMC were trending eastward.  The 00Z
cycle has yielded a reversal with all three of those models
trending slower and the GFS/CMC westward.  Ensemble members are
still sufficiently diverse to keep their means from showing much
definition.  Needless to say there is still considerable
uncertainty.  The manual forecast reflects an extrapolation of
yesterday's NHC-WPC coordination, with a weak feature reaching the
west-central Gulf Coast by early next Saturday.  00Z model trends
would delay the possible system's progress.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The most extreme anomalies within the area of intense
western/northern U.S. heat will be on Tuesday when areas over the
northern half of the Rockies/High Plains and possibly into parts
of the Great Basin may see highs 20-30F above normal.  It may not
be out of the question for one or more locations to set a new
record high for June.  The front progressing eastward from the
Northwest Tuesday onward will bring a brief cooler trend across
northern parts of the West into midweek and then into the northern
Plains.  The southern half to two-thirds of the West should see
highs consistently 10-20F above normal for most of the period,
including a westward expansion of the heat into California from
about Wednesday onward.  Northern areas should also rebound to
well above normal readings late in the week as well, though with
some uncertainty due to guidance spread for details of flow aloft.
 Morning lows should also be 10-20F above normal over a majority
of the West through the period, as well as the northern Plains
into Thursday.  Expect numerous daily records for highs/warm lows
for most of the period.  The combination of extreme daily
temperatures and duration, as well as being rather early in the
season for such an event, should make this a dangerous heat wave
for sensitive groups. Excessive heat warnings are in place for
many areas of the Southwest next week where temperatures may climb
well into the 110s in the lower deserts.

The eastern trough aloft and associated surface waves/fronts will
produce some areas of rain and thunderstorms of varying intensity
and during mid-late week some moderately below normal temperatures
(perhaps 5 to no more than 10F below normal).  The southern tier
may see rain from both a wavy front and typical diurnal convective
activity.  Portions of the Gulf Coast region could see an increase
of rainfall toward the end of next week as moisture pushes
northward across the Gulf.  Guidance spread and variability thus
far keep confidence low for determining the timing and
coverage/intensity of rainfall.  Monitor forecasts/National
Hurricane Center discussions over the coming days for the latest
information regarding any potential tropical cyclone development.
The upper trough/surface front initially affecting the Pacific
Northwest will bring light-moderate rain through Tuesday or
Tuesday night.  Toward late week this system may produce some
rainfall from the eastern Plains into the Great Lakes and
Northeast.

position of the Four Corners ridge/upper high through the period.
Early-mid period strength of the upper ridge is remarkable with
the new 00Z GFS showing 500mb height anomalies of +2.5-3 standard
deviations over parts of the Rockies/High Plains and even greater
than that north of the Canadian border on Tuesday.  Such heights
may breach record high heights for this early in the warm season.
Models/means all show some weakening of the ridge by
Friday-Saturday.  For the initial eastern North America upper
trough, most guidance has gravitated to a common solution but the
00Z CMC differs with some details.  It may still take some time to
resolve the finer details of surface low evolution near New
England.  Among 12Z/18Z guidance an operational model blend
represented consensus well.

Not counting the 00Z CMC, there is decent agreement in principle
for the shortwave ejecting through the Northwest and around the
western ridge, ultimately settling into the long-term mean trough
over eastern North America.  The main issue with the leading front
is that the 12Z/18Z GFS runs push it farther south over the Plains
versus other guidance by late in the period (leading to a dramatic
difference in rainfall over the southern Rockies/High Plains).
The 00Z GFS appears to have adjusted back somewhat.  Meanwhile
models and individual ensemble members show considerable
difficulty in handling the complexities of North Pacific
flow--leading some guidance to become up to 180 degrees out of
phase for eastern Pacific/western North America features by late
in the week/weekend.  An operational model blend for the first
half of the period trending to an even weight of models/means
later represents consensus well for the leading shortwave, and by
way of the GFS/ECMWF offsetting late in the period over the
eastern Pacific/western North America the blend ends up close to
the conservative mean solution while waiting for details to become
more clear.

Latest guidance continues to show the possibility for some degree
of tropical development to emerge from the Bay of Campeche and
track northward over the Gulf of Mexico.  Through the 12Z/18Z
cycles the ECMWF had been the steadiest with the depiction of the
surface system while the GFS/CMC were trending eastward.  The 00Z
cycle has yielded a reversal with all three of those models
trending slower and the GFS/CMC westward.  Ensemble members are
still sufficiently diverse to keep their means from showing much
definition.  Needless to say there is still considerable
uncertainty.  The manual forecast reflects an extrapolation of
yesterday's NHC-WPC coordination, with a weak feature reaching the
west-central Gulf Coast by early next Saturday.  00Z model trends
would delay the possible system's progress.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The most extreme anomalies within the area of intense
western/northern U.S. heat will be on Tuesday when areas over the
northern half of the Rockies/High Plains and possibly into parts
of the Great Basin may see highs 20-30F above normal.  It may not
be out of the question for one or more locations to set a new
record high for June.  The front progressing eastward from the
Northwest Tuesday onward will bring a brief cooler trend across
northern parts of the West into midweek and then into the northern
Plains.  The southern half to two-thirds of the West should see
highs consistently 10-20F above normal for most of the period,
including a westward expansion of the heat into California from
about Wednesday onward.  Northern areas should also rebound to
well above normal readings late in the week as well, though with
some uncertainty due to guidance spread for details of flow aloft.
 Morning lows should also be 10-20F above normal over a majority
of the West through the period, as well as the northern Plains
into Thursday.  Expect numerous daily records for highs/warm lows
for most of the period.  The combination of extreme daily
temperatures and duration, as well as being rather early in the
season for such an event, should make this a dangerous heat wave
for sensitive groups. Excessive heat warnings are in place for
many areas of the Southwest next week where temperatures may climb
well into the 110s in the lower deserts.

The eastern trough aloft and associated surface waves/fronts will
produce some areas of rain and thunderstorms of varying intensity
and during mid-late week some moderately below normal temperatures
(perhaps 5 to no more than 10F below normal).  The southern tier
may see rain from both a wavy front and typical diurnal convective
activity.  Portions of the Gulf Coast region could see an increase
of rainfall toward the end of next week as moisture pushes
northward across the Gulf.  Guidance spread and variability thus
far keep confidence low for determining the timing and
coverage/intensity of rainfall.  Monitor forecasts/National
Hurricane Center discussions over the coming days for the latest
information regarding any potential tropical cyclone development.
The upper trough/surface front initially affecting the Pacific
Northwest will bring light-moderate rain through Tuesday or
Tuesday night.  Toward late week this system may produce some
rainfall from the eastern Plains into the Great Lakes and
Northeast.

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through next week across
much of the Interior West and through midweek over the northern
Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest/California next week...


...Overview...

Today's guidance maintains reasonable continuity for the general
pattern evolution.  The very strong upper ridge centered over the
Four Corners states next week may weaken somewhat by
Friday-Saturday.  Vigorous shortwave energy brushing the Northwest
and tracking around the Four Corners ridge will push a cold front
across the northern half of the West and Plains, eventually
reaching northern parts of the East by next weekend.  This energy
should re-establish eastern North American mean troughing after it
kicks out a leading trough expected to persist near the East Coast
into Thursday.  Expect the western upper ridge to support a large
area of temperatures that approach/exceed daily record values over
portions the Interior West/Rockies on most days next week and
extending into California during the latter half of the
week--making for a hazardous heat wave event.  Some of this heat
will extend into the northern Plains through at least midweek as
well.  In the Gulf of Mexico, there is still the potential for a
disturbance to form near the Bay of Campeche and move northward
late in the week but also a large degree of uncertainty in its
evolution.

Short Range Forecast Discussion

253 AM EST Thu Dec 23 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Dec 23 2021 - 12Z Sat Dec 25 2021

...An active pattern will bring significant mountain snow and
heavy lower elevation rain to the western U.S. into the weekend...

...Snow showers expected across the Great Lakes and Northeast
Thursday before switching to a rain/snow mix on Friday...

...Persistent warm and dry conditions over the central U.S. will
generate fire weather concerns over the Front Range on Thursday...

Throughout the short-range period much of the activity over the
CONUS will be focused over the western U.S. as multiple features
impact the region simultaneously. One such feature is a moderately
strong atmospheric river, which is transporting anomalously high
amounts of atmospheric moisture onshore by way of southern
California. Along the low lying coastal regions this anomalous
moisture will translate into heavy rainfall over the next couple
days, with some locations, including the terrain adjacent to the
Los Angeles and San Diego metro areas, forecast to receive 1 to 3+
inches of rain in 24 hours. Given the potential for flash flooding
as well as runoff over nearby burn scarred and hydrologically
sensitive areas, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight
Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of southwestern California
through Saturday morning. Further north, a cold front forecast to
move onshore this morning and progress slowly through the
Intermountain West over the next couple of days will interact with
the moisture supplied by the atmospheric river to produce heavy
snowfall over the high elevation terrain from the Cascades to the
Rockies. Over the Sierra Nevada there is potential for 5+ feet of
snow to accumulate through Christmas morning, while more moderate
totals of around 1 to 4 feet are expected across the rest of the
western mountain ranges. In preparation for the snow and potential
for hazardous travel conditions, a menagerie of Winter Storm
Watches and Warnings as well as Winter Weather Advisories have
been put into effect throughout the western U.S.

Meanwhile, a tight pressure gradient is forecast to develop on the
lee-side of the Rockies later today, generating strong winds with
gusts up to and exceeding 65 mph, particularly in the Southern
High Plains. Given the potential for these winds to be damaging,
blow down trees, cause power outages, and make travel hazardous,
High Wind Watches and Warnings have been put into for portions of
the Central/Southern Rockies and the High Plains. In addition to
the aforementioned hazards, strong winds can also contribute to
the spread of wildfires where very dry fuels are present and low
relative humidity values are expected. This combination of
conditions is forecast to occur over the Central/Southern High
Plains today, prompting the issuance of an Elevated Risk of Fire
Weather by the the Storm Prediction Center.

To the east, a quasi-stationary boundary extending through the
Great Lakes will be the focus for the development of light snow
from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast through Friday morning. As
a warm front approaches from the southwest a rain/snow mix will
emerge, allowing for freezing rain to form and a thin layer of ice
to accumulate over portions of the Upper Midwest, New York, and
southern New England.

To end the work week a warm, dry pattern will set up over the
central U.S., allowing daily high temperatures across the Plains
and Mississippi Valley to raise significantly. The greatest
departures from normal will likely be felt over the Southern
Plains, where temperature anomalies of 25 to 30 degrees above
normal are expected on Friday, translating to highs in the 70s and
80s. Conversely, temperatures along the East and West coasts are
forecast to be near or moderately below normal.

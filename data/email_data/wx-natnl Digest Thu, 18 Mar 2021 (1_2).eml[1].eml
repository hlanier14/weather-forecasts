Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1115 AM CDT Wed Mar 17 2021

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTH TEXAS...

This morning's observed sounding at DRT sampled a very dry airmass
within the dry slot of the upper-level cyclone in western North
Texas. This air will continue to move downstream into parts of South
Texas. Current observations show 15-25 mph winds ongoing with RH in
the teens in parts of the Rio Grande Valley. Portions of the Hill
Country are currently seeing elevated to near critical conditions,
but dewpoints will tend to increase this afternoon and limit the
fire weather threat along with less receptive fuels. Relatively
minor changes have been made to the ongoing forecast based on
observational/guidance trends.

..Wendt.. 03/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0134 AM CDT Wed Mar 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low will mature and move rapidly northeast across
Oklahoma and Texas through the day today. a 100 kt mid-level jet
will move east with the low across the mid-south. A cold front
trailing from the surface low across western Missouri will move
across Texas reaching the coast by this afternoon. Critical fire
weather conditions will be possible along the southern Rio Grande
Valley in the dry post front airmass.

...Rio Grande Valley...
Northwesterly flow behind the departing cold front and upper-low
will bring dry downslope air to much of south Texas. Surface RH of
7-15% will be accompanied by sustained surface winds of 20-30 mph.
With dry fuels in place, critical fire weather conditions are
expected. Elevated conditions will extend northwestward to west
Texas, but increasing humidity from cooler air behind the front will
limit the potential for more robust fire weather conditions.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 17 2021

SYNOPSIS: A surface disturbance is forecast to be tracking across the
east-central U.S. at the start of the period, bringing heavy rain potential=
 to
portions of the South. Beyond this point, mid-level high pressure is foreca=
st
to become established off the West Coast. This setup favors a storm track
displaced northward over Canada, with some potential for rapidly moving
disturbances descending through the Great Lakes. With high pressure off the
West Coast, there are beginning to be signs of downslope winds across North=
ern
California which could yield some out-of-season fire weather concerns.
Mid-level high pressure is forecast to slowly build northward across Alaska=
,
leading to temperatures becoming increasingly seasonable while the primary
storm track is focused out of the Bering Sea.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Central and Southern Plains,
Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and the
Southeast, Thu, Mar 25.

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 25 - WEDNESDAY MARCH 31: A surface disturbance is foreca=
st
to be situated over the Southern Plains at the beginning of Week-2. Models
continue to dispute how progressive this system will be, having obvious
implications for the location and timing of any associated heavy rainfall. =
The
GEFS is faster than the ECMWF, placing the heavy precipitation potential on
the
25th across the Tennessee Valley and Southeast, while the ECMWF is focused
more
over the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley. For consistency, the ECMWF
forecast continues to be favored here, resulting in a slight risk of heavy
rain
on the 25th focused across the south-central CONUS. Beyond the 25th any hea=
vy
rainfall considerations appear to lessen, as the system is forecast to lift
northward toward eastern Canada, thus limiting the availability of moisture=
 as
its warm sector becomes displaced from the Gulf of Mexico.



Outside of the system impacting the eastern half of the country early in th=
e
forecast period, anomalous 500-hPa ridging becoming established off the
Pacific
Coast appears likely to keep things fairly quiet. This feature would serve =
to
limit the onshore flow of Pacific moisture, while displacing the storm trac=
k
toward Canada. The one caveat to this benign pattern which is beginning to
flare up is the potential for northeasterly flow across portions of the Wes=
t,
with downslope warming signals building across portions of Northern and
Central
California in both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast guidance. The potential fo=
r
relatively warm and dry downslope flow occurring in concert with observed s=
oil
moisture currently being as low as the historical bottom 1% presents some
concern. Despite this, a half inch to an inch of precipitation is forecast
across this region during the next three days, which may help moisten fuels
and
limit fire concern. Given this setup is occurring outside of typical fire
season, and the novelty of the downslope signals in the guidance, no high w=
ind
hazard is indicated at present.



A fairly cool and wet pattern has been anticipated across Alaska in recent
days, but anomalous 500-hPa ridging has begun to trend poleward over the Gu=
lf
of Alaska. As this feature noses closer to the mainland, below-normal
temperature chances are likely to wane, while the focus for the storm track
shifts away from the Gulf of Alaska and more out of the Bering Sea into the
western mainland. Continued snowfall across the mainland and interior in th=
is
setup is unlikely to drive any Week-2 hazards, but could exacerbate concern=
s
on
a longer time horizon by adding snow water to the hydrological system in
anticipation of river break up during April.

256 PM EDT Wed Mar 17 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Mar 20 2021 - 12Z Wed Mar 24 2021

...Overview...

Guidance shows the establishment of a large scale mean trough
aloft over the west-central U.S. next week, increasing the
precipitation potential over the Plains and Mississippi Valley
while also producing one or more episodes of meaningful
rain/mountain snow over parts of the West/Rockies.  Ahead of this
developing trough expect some degree of mean ridging to settle
into southeastern Canada while a fairly narrow ridge drifts from
the Plains into the East.  Leading shortwave energy consolidating
into a trough (with possible embedded low) along the
central/southern East Coast should generate a frontal wave that
ultimately wraps up off the Florida/Southeast coast before
tracking farther into the Atlantic.  This system could bring some
rain and brisk winds to coastal areas of the southern Mid-Atlantic
and Southeast.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Broadly speaking there continues to be reasonable clustering for
individual features but with some detail/timing differences and
the occasional stray solution.  Most continuity changes are
generally modest as well.  Upper trough energy coming into the
West this weekend should separate with the central/southern part
of the trough likely ejecting northeastward through the
Plains/Upper Midwest by Tuesday-Wednesday.  The associated surface
system could be fairly vigorous by midweek if this energy forms a
closed low or negatively tilted shortwave as some guidance is
advertising.  A blend approach is reasonable to navigate between
the GFS/GEFS (more southeastward amplitude of the shortwave latter
half of the period) and 00Z ECMWF (slower than previous runs)
extremes.  Behind this feature there is a decent consensus that
Pacific energy diving into the evolving mean trough will form an
upper low near the Four Corners by day 7 Wednesday.  The main
considerations here were to phase out the 00Z CMC for having more
southwestward amplitude mid-late period and to average the past
two runs for ECMWF input late in the forecast.  There is good
agreement for the next shortwave approaching the Northwest next
Wednesday.  By early next week the 00Z UKMET became deeper than
most solutions with the East Coast upper feature though the new
12Z run is similar and now joined by the farther south 12Z CMC.
At that time the 12Z GFS strays farther north/northeast than the
previous run or consensus.  The 00Z/06Z guidance average did bring
the western Atlantic surface low somewhat closer to the
southeastern coast compared to continuity.  A 00Z/06Z operational
model blend early trending toward an even model/ensemble mean mix
late, with aforementioned fine-tuning, provided a good starting
point for the manual forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The West will see a series of rain/mountain snow events with the
expected succession of shortwaves.  This weekend the leading
system should bring moderate amounts especially to favored terrain
from the Northwest into the central Rockies.  Lingering energy
crossing southern parts of the West could eventually extend the
precipitation into the southern Rockies.  The next system will
spread its moisture from the Northwest through much of the Rockies
from late weekend into next week, with moderate to locally
enhanced activity.  Then around midweek the Pacific Northwest
should begin to see the precipitation from another shortwave/cold
front.

Expect precipitation to expand in coverage and intensity over the
Plains and Mississippi Valley next Monday-Wednesday.  Ejection of
leading western U.S. shortwave energy will coincide with
increasing Gulf inflow around a surface ridge reaching the eastern
states.  Heaviest rainfall should progress from the central Plains
eastward with time ahead of the best upper dynamics and developing
surface low pressure/trailing cold front.  Some snow may be
possible from the north-central High Plains northeastward, within
the cold sector of the developing surface system.  The upstream
energy digging into the West early-mid week may hold the front
trailing from the Plains-Upper Midwest system over the southern
Plains, which could maintain a threat for enhanced rainfall over
southern parts of the Plains/Mississippi Valley.

The system forecast to develop offshore Florida and then lift
north/northeast may bring some rainfall and brisk winds to areas
near the Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic coast but the heaviest
rain should remain offshore.  Otherwise most of the eastern U.S.
should be dry for most of the period.

The warmest temperature anomalies during the period will gradually
migrate from the northern Plains into the Great Lakes region, with
max/min readings generally 10-20F above normal and on some days up
to a few degrees warmer.  The best potential for daily records
should be for warm lows over the northern Plains/Upper Midwest on
Sunday.  Somewhat less extreme warm anomalies will extend farther
south/southwest ahead of the mean frontal boundary with morning
lows tending to have higher anomalies than daytime highs.
Trailing cooler air will spread across the West and into the
Rockies, bringing highs down to 5-15F below normal.  The upper
trough over the Southeast coast this weekend will produce highs
more than 10F below normal over some areas, followed by a rebound
to at least normal readings.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

There is potential for locally elevated fire weather in portions of
central Florida tomorrow. Confidence is reasonably high in 15-20 mph
southwesterly surface winds with increasing low/mid-level flow ahead
of the cold front. RH will be borderline (at or above 35%) in most
locations, however. The exception may be areas closer to the coast
where trajectories will remain over land the longest. RH near or
just below 30% would be possible in that narrow corridor. Fuels are
more receptive inland where RH is expected to be higher. Given the
uncertainties and limited spatial extent, no highlights will be
added.

...Synopsis...
In the wake of the fast moving upper low Day1/Wednesday high
pressure will build quickly across the western and central portions
of the CONUS. Troughing will continue across the East where
widespread precipitation and cooler temperatures are expected. The
high pressure will serve to limit wind speeds across the Southwest.
This along with cooler temperatures behind the departing storm
system should result in conditions unfavorable for widespread
organized fire weather on Day2.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed March 17 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 23 - 27 2021

Today's models are in good agreement on the longwave 500-hPa height pattern
across the forecast domain during the 6-10 day period. An amplified pattern=
 is
predicted, featuring anomalous ridging over the eastern Pacific and the
eastern
third of the CONUS, with anomalous troughing forecast over Mainland Alaska =
and
the central and southwest CONUS.

A strong west-to-east mid-level flow forecast over the Bering Sea and into
southwest Alaska supports an active storm track across much of Alaska,
increasing chances of above normal precipitation for Alaska. North of this
storm track, negative height anomalies are predicted, which, coupled with
relatively cold easterly low-level flow from Canada, favor below normal
temperatures across the state.

Downstream of the eastern Pacific ridge, storm activity is forecast to be
suppressed, enhancing the likelihood of near to below normal precipitation =
for
western parts of the Lower 48. A trough is forecast to amplify downstream o=
f
this ridge, favoring near to below normal temperatures for the western half=

thirds of the CONUS is forecast to shift eastward, compared to the 6-10 day
period, as well as deamplify (due to natural uncertainty in longer leads,

eastward and begin to diminish during the week-2 period, and above normal
temperatures ahead of the trough shift east of the Mississippi. One or more
storm systems moving across the eastern U.S. favor above normal precipitati=

for most of the East, though probabilities are relatively low due to
uncertainty in the strength and position of the 500-hPa trough as it moves

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=

...An intense low pressure system is expected to bring widespread
thunderstorms across the Deep South with dangerous severe weather
likely through Thursday...

...Threat of excessive rainfall will expand into the Southeast
tonight...

...Critical fire weather threat along the Rio Grande River Valley
tonight...

A low pressure system currently moving through Oklahoma will be
the impetus for flash flooding and severe weather concerns across
the Deep South over the next 24 hours. This area of low pressure
will continue pulling moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and
spreading it over the the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast
tonight and tomorrow. This will contribute to continued
atmospheric destabilization and an increased threat of widespread
severe thunderstorms and tornado outbreaks across the region.
Increased moisture flow into the area has also lead to a
heightened risk of flash flooding across the Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley and Southeast tonight. The
low pressure system will expand into the east coast tomorrow as it
continues to generate thunderstorms and potential severe weather
activity in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley. This
system, and most of its impacts, should move off into the Atlantic
by Friday afternoon leaving behind light snow and windy conditions
in its wake across much of the Northeast.

Elsewhere, a new system will enter the Northwest on Thursday and
produce some measurable mountain snow for the Olympic and Sierra.
Coastal and lower elevation areas will experience rain. This same
dynamic will continue across the intermountain west as the system
redevelops over the region on Friday morning. Temperatures will
cool down across the eastern half of the country, as the storm
system moves through. The Northern Plains will experience a
gradual warm-up heading into the weekend as a warm front lifts
through the region. Much of the Rio Grande Valley is under an
Elevated or Critical Fire Weather area for tonight as dry and
windy conditions are expected to fuel potential fire activity.

400 PM EDT Wed Mar 17 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Mar 20 2021 - 12Z Wed Mar 24 2021

...Overview...

Guidance shows the establishment of a large scale mean trough
aloft over the west-central U.S. next week, increasing the
precipitation potential over the Plains and Mississippi Valley
while also producing one or more episodes of meaningful
rain/mountain snow over parts of the West/Rockies.  Ahead of this
developing trough expect some degree of mean ridging to settle
into southeastern Canada while a fairly narrow ridge drifts from
the Plains into the East.  Leading shortwave energy consolidating
into a trough (with possible embedded low) along the
central/southern East Coast should generate a frontal wave that
ultimately wraps up off the Florida/Southeast coast before
tracking farther into the Atlantic.  This system could bring some
rain and brisk winds to coastal areas of the southern Mid-Atlantic
and Southeast.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Broadly speaking there continues to be reasonable clustering for
individual features but with some detail/timing differences and
the occasional stray solution.  Most continuity changes are
generally modest as well.  Upper trough energy coming into the
West this weekend should separate with the central/southern part
of the trough likely ejecting northeastward through the
Plains/Upper Midwest by Tuesday-Wednesday.  The associated surface
system could be fairly vigorous by midweek if this energy forms a
closed low or negatively tilted shortwave as some guidance is
advertising.  A blend approach is reasonable to navigate between
the GFS/GEFS (more southeastward amplitude of the shortwave latter
half of the period) and 00Z ECMWF (slower than previous runs)
extremes.  Behind this feature there is a decent consensus that
Pacific energy diving into the evolving mean trough will form an
upper low near the Four Corners by day 7 Wednesday.  The main
considerations here were to phase out the 00Z CMC for having more
southwestward amplitude mid-late period and to average the past
two runs for ECMWF input late in the forecast.  There is good
agreement for the next shortwave approaching the Northwest next
Wednesday.  By early next week the 00Z UKMET became deeper than
most solutions with the East Coast upper feature though the new
12Z run is similar and now joined by the farther south 12Z CMC.
At that time the 12Z GFS strays farther north/northeast than the
previous run or consensus.  The 00Z/06Z guidance average did bring
the western Atlantic surface low somewhat closer to the
southeastern coast compared to continuity.  A 00Z/06Z operational
model blend early trending toward an even model/ensemble mean mix
late, with aforementioned fine-tuning, provided a good starting
point for the manual forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The West will see a series of rain/mountain snow events with the
expected succession of shortwaves.  This weekend the leading
system should bring moderate amounts especially to favored terrain
from the Northwest into the central Rockies.  Lingering energy
crossing southern parts of the West could eventually extend the
precipitation into the southern Rockies.  The next system will
spread its moisture from the Northwest through much of the Rockies
from late weekend into next week, with moderate to locally
enhanced activity.  Then around midweek the Pacific Northwest
should begin to see the precipitation from another shortwave/cold
front.

Expect precipitation to expand in coverage and intensity over the
Plains and Mississippi Valley next Monday-Wednesday.  Ejection of
leading western U.S. shortwave energy will coincide with
increasing Gulf inflow around a surface ridge reaching the eastern
states.  Heaviest rainfall should progress from the central Plains
eastward with time ahead of the best upper dynamics and developing
surface low pressure/trailing cold front.  Some snow may be
possible from the north-central High Plains northeastward, within
the cold sector of the developing surface system.  The upstream
energy digging into the West early-mid week may hold the front
trailing from the Plains-Upper Midwest system over the southern
Plains, which could maintain a threat for enhanced rainfall over
southern parts of the Plains/Mississippi Valley.

The system forecast to develop offshore Florida and then lift
north/northeast may bring some rainfall and brisk winds to areas
near the Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic coast but the heaviest
rain should remain offshore.  Otherwise most of the eastern U.S.
should be dry for most of the period.

The warmest temperature anomalies during the period will gradually
migrate from the northern Plains into the Great Lakes region, with
max/min readings generally 10-20F above normal and on some days up
to a few degrees warmer.  The best potential for daily records
should be for warm lows over the northern Plains/Upper Midwest on
Sunday.  Somewhat less extreme warm anomalies will extend farther
south/southwest ahead of the mean frontal boundary with morning
lows tending to have higher anomalies than daytime highs.
Trailing cooler air will spread across the West and into the
Rockies, bringing highs down to 5-15F below normal.  The upper
trough over the Southeast coast this weekend will produce highs
more than 10F below normal over some areas, followed by a rebound
to at least normal readings.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
222 AM EDT Thu Mar 18 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 21 2021 - 12Z Thu Mar 25 2021

...Overview...

Deep reloading western CONUS troughing lifting out through the
Plains will be the main driver(s) to the forecast during the
medium range. Multiple rain areas (some snow out of the Rockies to
the western Plains) are favored around the lead area of low
pressure into the Upper Midwest early in the week before focusing
on Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley. A slow-moving ocean
storm off the Southeast coast will lift north-northeastward just
offshore before pulling out to sea. This system could bring some
rain and brisk winds to coastal areas from the Southeast to
southern New England.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance suites, reasonable clustering of the
models led to a deterministic blend to start the forecast
Sunday-Monday (12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian), despite
differences with the handling of the western trough and Southeast
coastal low (middle ground solutions were preferred). For days the
guidance had been trending weaker and farther offshore but since
the 00Z runs last night reverted back north with less separation
from the northern stream flow which now gets it tugged back
northward. In the West, the ECMWF continued to be a laggard in the
guidance but had support from several ensemble members.
Nevertheless, preferred a solution nearer to its ensemble mean as
the ECMWF has been too deep/slow with some recent troughs.

By late Mon into Tue, GFS/GEFS were quicker with the height falls
into the Mississippi Valley and points eastward whereas the ECMWF
ensembles were slower, due in part to a stronger second upper
trough into the West with which the GFS/GEFS were weaker. With the
Canadian even slower than the ECMWF, opted to rely more on the
ECMWF ensemble mean for timing of the troughs out of the West at a
pace slower than the GEFS mean. Parallel GFS continued to be on
the quicker side as well.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Cold front into the Pacific Northwest Sunday will bring light to
moderate amounts of coastal/lowland rain and mountain snow,
followed by more showery precipitation and generally lighter
amounts until about midweek (Wednesday). That system may bring
another round of light to modest rain/snow to coastal areas and
the Cascades as well as northern Idaho. Temperatures will remain
cooler than normal through the period.

The Rockies to the central states will see larger effects from the
lead and trailing areas of low pressure along the progressing
frontal boundary during the period. Precipitation will expand on
Monday out of the Rockies and onto the central Plains where some
locally heavier amounts may fall. Temperatures will be mild enough
to support mostly rain except for the northwest side of the front
and surface low. As the first low lifts into the Great Lakes,
precipitation will expand to the northeast as well but may lessen
in intensity. By then, trailing upper trough through the West will
start to round the base in the Southwest and start to develop
another surface low along the front over Texas. This may promote
another area of perhaps locally heavier rain nearer to the Gulf
coast as moisture will be quite sufficient by then. Temperatures
will be near to above normal east of the frontal boundary,
especially through the northern tier where highs may reach into
the 60s to the Canadian border.

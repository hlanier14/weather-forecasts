Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1029 AM CST Sun Dec 19 2021

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

Minimal adjustments were made with this update. A slight
west-northwestward expansion was made to the Elevated area over
parts of southeastern WY (across Fire Weather Zone WYZ310), where RH
values are already in the upper teens per the latest surface
observations. Here, forecast soundings suggest that RH will briefly
drop into the lower teens with 30+ mph gusts during this afternoon.
These factors will support locally Critical conditions, though the
anticipated short duration and localized nature of the threat
precludes a Critical delineation. Elsewhere, the previous forecast
remains on track.

..Weinman.. 12/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CST Sun Dec 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level long-wave trough will move off the east coast on Sunday,
leaving a generally broad, coast-to-coast ridge in its wake.
Embedded within the broad ridge, a strong short-wave trough will
move from north-central Mexico into central Texas and another strong
trough will move across southern Canada. At the surface, a dry
continental airmass will continue to settle across much of the
eastern United States in the wake of a cold front passage.

... Southern High Plains ...

Dry return flow is in the process of establishing itself early this
morning as lee troughing develops and the surface high pressure
moves east. Sustained winds this afternoon will range from 15-20
mph, with gusts locally in excess of 25 mph possible. The downslope
component of the flow will support temperatures quickly recovering
into the 50s F by afternoon with minimum relative humidity
percentages falling into the teens. The result will be elevated to
locally critical fire conditions across the region.

... Central High Plains ...

Low-to-mid-level westerly flow is expected to strengthen this
morning into the afternoon across southeast Wyoming into central
Nebraska as the strong mid-level trough moves across southern
Canada. This westerly downslope flow around 20 mph with gusts in
excess of 30 mph should allow temperatures to quickly warm into the
40s F to low 50s F by early afternoon. Given the dry antecedent
airmass, afternoon minimum relative humidity percentages will fall
into the teens to low twenties despite the relatively cool surface
temperatures. The result will be elevated to locally critical fire
weather conditions for a couple of hours. Mitigating factors for a
more robust threat include recent precipitation (snow) and the
relatively short daylight hours limiting the duration of afternoon
heating.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1203 PM CST Sun Dec 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes were made
with this update. Elevated to locally Critically conditions appear
most likely in the lee of the higher terrain across parts of New
Mexico tomorrow/Monday afternoon. Here, subsidence-induced drying on
the backside of a departing southern-stream midlevel trough will
favor critically low RH (single digits to lower teens). However, the
lack of a tighter surface pressure gradient should generally
mitigate fire-weather concerns (outside of terrain-favored areas).

..Weinman.. 12/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0130 AM CST Sun Dec 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
The broad, coast-to-coast mid-level ridge from Sunday will amplify
across the western United States in response to a strong, deep low
off the California coast. Farther east, a strong short-wave trough
will continue moving across the Southeast and a series of short-wave
troughs move across southern Canada. At the surface, a reinforcing
shot of a modified continental polar airmass will push south into
the central Plains in the wake of a dry cold front, keeping in place
a dry airmass.

Despite the antecedent dry airmass across the High Plains,
relatively weak low-level flow should temporarily temper large-scale
fire concerns.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The upper-level pattern continues to favor a slower evolution
through the end of the weekend. During this time, a very strong
ridge will be anchored over central/east-central Pacific Ocean.
There will be impulses tracking through the flow on the north side
of this ridge, which help reinforce a mean trough over the eastern
Pacific that drifts near/along the West Coast. Fast flow will
prevail downstream, between low heights over central Canada and an
upper high forecast to migrate eastward across Mexico and the
southern Gulf of Mexico.  This pattern will favor multiple days of
widespread precipitation over the West, with the Sierra Nevada
likely to see the highest five-day totals.  Well-above normal
temperatures are expected across much of the Southern Plains
before spreading to the east later in the extended period. In
contrast, temperature will trend colder across the northern tier
of the country. Systems to the east of the Rockies will initially
have dynamic support from southern Canada/northern tier U.S. flow
and then become more dependent on features ejecting from the West
Coast trough.

Early in the period over the East, consensus has been stable in
recent runs for the system crossing southeastern Canada and
northeastern U.S. around midweek.  However guidance is still
having some difficulties in resolving the details of the system
expected to be just off the North Carolina coast early Wednesday
and continue over the Atlantic thereafter, favoring an
intermediate approach. The WPC blend began with a mix of the 00Z
ECWMF/CMC/UKMET/GFS(and 06Z) and with time increased weighting of
both the EC ensemble and GEFS means while decreasing the use of
the CMC and UKMET.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Lower elevation rain and mid-high elevation snow can be expected
for a broad area of the western states as a persistent flow of
moisture is directed onshore ahead of an eastern Pacific/West
Coast upper trough. There will be periods where the precipitation
will be moderate or heavy which may increase soil saturation and
increase sensitivity to local runoff; however given some of the
uncertainty on timing and interactions, the exact location and
intensity of lower elevation rainfall with respect to local
runoff/flooding issues over California. Parts of northern/central
California is expected to have some of the highest accumulations,
especially heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada. These snows may have
high liquid equivalents in the favored upslope areas of the Sierra
Nevada range. Some moisture should extend as far south as southern
California and Arizona after midweek while favored terrain over
the Great Basin and northern/central Rockies will see meaningful
precipitation as well. Temperatures ranging 15 to 25 degrees F
warmer than seasonal average will be present over much of the
Southern Plains will spread into the Mississippi Valley later in
the period - a few record highs may be possible over Texas. A warm
up of 10 to 20 degrees F above the mean may reach the East by the
weekend.

Low pressure tracking away from near the North Carolina Coast may
be accompanied by a little rain early Wednesday while passage of a
southeastern Canada system and a weak upstream feature may produce
light snow over the upper Great Lakes and northern New England. A
more organized system may spread snow and rain spread from the
Northern High Plains to the Northeast. The far northern portion of
the Plains will have temperatures plummet-  with 15 to 30 degrees
F below normal over parts of Montana and North Dakota.  The
unsettled pattern over the West should lead to near or above
normal lows and near to below normal highs through the entire
week.  Western highs should gradually trend cooler with time as
the axis of the eastern Pacific upper trough reaches at least as
far as the West Coast.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The upper-level pattern continues to favor a slower evolution
through the end of the weekend. During this time, a very strong
ridge will be anchored over central/east-central Pacific Ocean.
There will be impulses tracking through the flow on the north side
of this ridge, which help reinforce a mean trough over the eastern
Pacific that drifts near/along the West Coast. Fast flow will
prevail downstream, between low heights over central Canada and an
upper high forecast to migrate eastward across Mexico and the
southern Gulf of Mexico.  This pattern will favor multiple days of
widespread precipitation over the West, with the Sierra Nevada

...Unsettled weather lingers over the Pacific Northwest, the
northern Rockies and the Upper Midwest...

...Low pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico to deliver heavy
showers and thunderstorms to Florida and the Southeast coast...

...Dry and mild throughout much of the nation's midsection...

The week leading up to Christmas starts out active in the
Northwest thanks to a cut-off upper low in the northeast Pacific
funneling moisture into the region. A frontal system just off the
coast will be responsible for periods of coastal/valley rain and
heavy mountain snow. A Flood Watch is in place for parts of
northwest Oregon through Monday morning, while Winter Storm
Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories stretching from the
Oregon/Washington Cascades to the High Plains of Montana are also
in effect into Monday morning. Snow totals through Monday are
likely to exceed a foot in parts of the Cascades and Bitterroots.
A brief building bubble of high pressure over southern British
Columbia gives the Northwest a break in the action during the day.
The next push of Pacific moisture arrives Tuesday evening into
Wednesday with more lower elevation rain and accumulating
mountains snow, this time extending as far south as central
California. Meanwhile, a quick moving wave of low pressure in
Montana will produce light snow accumulations across the Northern
Plains late Monday into early Tuesday. This system then reaches
the Upper Great Lakes by Tuesday night where several inches of
snow are possible.

To the south, an area of low pressure looks to form along a
frontal boundary in the Gulf of Mexico Monday morning. Spotty
showers will track along the immediate central Gulf Coast on
Monday as the storm traverses the central Gulf of Mexico. By early
Tuesday morning the storm will have strengthened and a threat for
heavy rain and thunderstorms, some of which could be severe, is
expected across most of the Florida Peninsula. Some thunderstorms
could produce damaging wind gusts, tornadoes, and waterspouts.
Over an inch of rainfall is forecast across northern Florida,
southern Georgia, and far southern South Carolina through Tuesday
evening.

Sandwiched between the active weather patterns in the Northwest
and the Southeast is upper level ridging that extends from the
Great Basin to the Mid-Atlantic coast. The result is high pressure
dominating the pattern in the central Rockies, the Nation's
Heartland, and the Northeast. Mostly dry conditions and abnormally
mild temperatures for late December are forecast in these regions
the first half of the week, although chilly morning lows are still
likely in the Northeast Monday morning. In fact, mostly dry
conditions persists even as a more spring-like air-mass arrives
late week for most of the Plains and Mississippi Valley.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun December 19 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The large scale pattern continues to show better than average
agreement and predictability.  Shortwaves tracking around a very
strong central Pacific into Bering Sea/Alaska upper ridge will
periodically dive into and reinforce an amplified trough whose
axis should be near the West Coast, possibly drifting slightly
inland later in the period.  Fast flow downstream--between low
heights over Canada and a ridge tracking over Mexico and the
southern Gulf of Mexico--will carry along ejecting features that
should support a couple surface systems during the period.  Expect
the West Coast upper trough to support a broad area of
precipitation over the West for multiple days with areas from
western Oregon into the Sierra Nevada likely to see the highest
five-day totals.  Also of note, a strong temperature contrast will
set up between much above normal temperatures over and east of the
central/southern Plains and well below normal temperatures over
the extreme northern Plains.  Even with the above average
confidence in the large scale pattern, embedded details have lower
predictability so some specifics for the lower 48 forecast remain
uncertain.

The first major feature of note will be a West Coast shortwave
that ejects eastward after early Thursday and likely produces a
Plains through southeastern Canada/Northeast U.S. system around
Friday and Christmas Day/Saturday.  Over recent days there has
been a fair amount of variability for the character of this energy
near the West Coast and how quickly it will continue onward.  An
average of 12Z/18Z guidance eventually trending toward a mix of
models and means provided a good intermediate solution early in
the period and held close to continuity later as the 18Z GFS/12Z
ECMWF ended up trending slower than in the previous cycle while
the ensemble means and CMC continue to reflect a faster solution
per continuity.  Overall the new 00Z model runs have become less
amplified with the West Coast shortwave as of early Thursday and
differ for details of separate offshore energy, affecting
coverage/timing of precipitation over southern parts of the West.
This change has allowed the GFS and ECMWF to return to a faster
surface progression over eastern North America though.

The aforementioned strategy also worked well for resolving lower
confidence details within and downstream from the persistent West
Coast trough after ejection of the first shortwave.  There is a
reasonable signal in the models and ensemble means that another
general area of low pressure should evolve over the central U.S.
around Sunday-Monday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A broad area of the West will see lower elevation rain and
mid-high elevation snow with a persistent flow of moisture
directed onshore ahead of shortwaves digging into the West Coast
mean trough aloft, with moisture and terrain enhancement extending
as far east as the Rockies.  There will be periods when the
precipitation will be moderate or heavy which may increase soil
saturation and sensitivity to local runoff; however uncertainty on
timing and shortwave interactions will temper confidence in
resolving the exact location and intensity of lower elevation
rainfall with respect to local runoff/flooding issues over
California. The Oregon Cascades and parts of northern/central
California are likely to have some of the highest accumulations,
especially heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada. These snows may have
high liquid equivalents in the favored upslope areas of the Sierra
Nevada range.  Favored terrain over the Great Basin and
northern/central Rockies will likely see meaningful precipitation
as well.  The timing and amounts of precipitation over southern
parts of the West have become more of a question mark with latest
adjustments in the models.  Colder air pushing into Northwest may
lead to very low snow levels by next Sunday-Monday while other
parts of the West may also see declining snow levels as the upper
trough axis nudges eastward.

A late week into weekend system should spread precipitation across
the northeastern quadrant of the country.  Best potential for some
snow will be across the extreme northern tier including the Upper
Great Lakes and parts of New England.  Confidence is only moderate
at best for system details given model variability thus far.
Another area of precipitation (some snow in northern areas) may
develop over the northern and east-central U.S. toward early next
week with another area of low pressure.

The central and southern Plains will see much above normal
temperatures for most of the period with plus 15-25F anomalies.
Highs could even reach or exceed 30F above normal at some
locations on Friday.  Flow ahead of the late week system will push
some of this warmth into the East as well.  Daily records for
highs/warm lows will be possible where temperatures are most
anomalous.  In contrast, temperatures that are 15-30F or more
below normal should settle into parts of Montana and North Dakota.
 The West will trend gradually colder with time, leading to some
highs 10-15F below normal by the weekend and early next week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 AM CST Mon Dec 20 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough evident in water vapor imagery this morning over
northern Mexico and West Texas will continue moving eastward along
the Gulf Coast throughout the day.  Meanwhile, a shortwave midlevel
ridge will build into the Southwest today.  At the surface, high
pressure will dominate conditions over most of the CONUS, as low
pressure systems move eastward across eastern Canada and the Gulf of
Mexico.

...Portions of Central/Southern New Mexico...
In the wake of the departing midlevel trough, enhanced northwesterly
flow aloft will help support downslope flow in the lee of the high
terrain across the region.  As a result, subsidence and downward
mixing will promote dry and windy conditions for terrain-favored
locations.  Given the dry airmass already in place, RH values are
expected to fall into the single digits, as sustained northwesterly
surface winds approach 20 mph.  Given the dry fuels across the
region (80th percentile ERC values), elevated fire weather
conditions are likely from the late morning through the afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CST Mon Dec 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
With an upper-level ridge in place over the Southwest, a potent
shortwave trough is forecast to move from the northern Rockies
across the top of the ridge, leading to enhanced flow aloft over
much of the central and southern High Plains.  At the surface, a
weak low pressure system is forecast to move eastward across the
northern Plains toward the Great Lakes while an associated cold
front moves southward through the central Plains.  A lee trough is
forecast to become established along the High Plains by Tuesday
afternoon.

...East-Central New Mexico into Adjacent Portions of West Texas...
As the aforementioned shortwave moves through to the north, an
enhanced belt of northwesterly flow across the region will promote
dry and windy conditions through downslope effects.  Critical RH
values are likely to be widespread along the High Plains from
southeastern Wyoming southward through West Texas, with single
digits likely in the lee of high terrain in eastern New Mexico.
Sustained northwesterly surface winds are likely to approach 20 mph,
elevating fire weather conditions.  Critical fire weather conditions
may be possible, but the current forecast timing of the shortwave is
too early for the stronger winds to be realized at the surface.

...Far Southeastern Wyoming into Adjacent Portions of Northern
Colorado and the Southwestern Nebraska Panhandle...
Despite cool temperatures (highs only in the 40s F) across the
region, the winds will be very strong just above the surface (>50
mph at 1000 ft AGL).  Downslope processes in the lee of the high
terrain should aid in warming, drying, and mixing of strong winds
down to the surface, resulting in elevated to locally critical fire
weather conditions.

...Unsettled weather lingers over the Pacific Northwest and the
northern Rockies as the next wave of moisture reaches the West
Coast...

...Low pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico to deliver heavy
showers and thunderstorms to Florida and the Southeast coast...

...Dry and mild throughout much of the nation's midsection but
cold with occasional light snow across the northern tier...

More active weather is expected across the Pacific Northwest in a
battle zone between a large cut-off upper low in the northeast
Pacific and arctic air over western Canada.  A frontal system just
off the coast will be responsible for periods of coastal/valley
rain and heavy mountain snow.  Snow totals through tonight are
likely to exceed a foot in parts of the Cascades and Bitterroots.
A brief building bubble of high pressure over southern British
Columbia gives the Northwest a break in the action early on
Tuesday before the next push of Pacific moisture arrives Tuesday
evening into Wednesday with more lower elevation rain and
accumulating mountains snow, this time extending as far south as
central California. Meanwhile, a quick moving wave of low pressure
in Montana will produce light snow accumulations across the
northern Plains late Monday into early Tuesday.  This system then
reaches the upper Great Lakes by Tuesday night where several
inches of snow are possible.

To the south, an area of low pressure is forming along a frontal
boundary in the Gulf of Mexico this morning.  Spotty showers will
track along the immediate central Gulf Coast on Monday as the
storm traverses the central Gulf of Mexico. By early Tuesday
morning the storm will have strengthened and a threat for heavy
rain and thunderstorms, some of which could be severe, is expected
across most of the Florida Peninsula.  Some thunderstorms could
produce damaging wind gusts, tornadoes, and waterspouts.  Over an
inch of rainfall is forecast across northern Florida, southern
Georgia, and far southern South Carolina through Tuesday evening
before the low tracks off the Southeast U.S. coast Tuesday night.

Sandwiched between the active weather patterns in the Northwest
and the Southeast is upper level ridging that extends from the
Great Basin to the Mid-Atlantic coast. The result is high pressure
dominating the pattern in the central Rockies, the Nation's
Heartland, and the Northeast. Mostly dry conditions and abnormally
mild temperatures for late December are forecast in these regions
the first half of the week, although chilly morning lows are still
likely in the Northeast Monday morning. In fact, mostly dry
conditions persists even as a more spring-like air-mass arrives
late week for most of the Plains and Mississippi Valley.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...
Models and ensembles continue to show a progressive pattern with
broad cyclonic flow across most of the lower 48 while an upstream
ridge builds over the eastern Pacific next weekend.  Guidance
remains fairly well clustered for a strong southern into eastern
Canada storm system and trailing cold front sweeping through the
eastern half of the country mid-late week.  Specifics over the
eastern Pacific Wednesday-Thursday and continuing eastward across
the lower 48 appear to be clearing up.  The 00z UKMET is weaker
than the 06z GFS/00z ECMWF/00z Canadian which are quite agreeable
-- went towards the growing consensus for the manual progs.  The
relative improvement in clustering for a meaningful eastern
Pacific into western U.S. shortwave after midweek has brought
guidance closer together for the lower 48 pattern by mid-late
period.

The most common theme in the guidance at the moment is for a
frontal system to reach the Plains by Saturday and continue
eastward into Sunday.  The ridge that builds off the West Coast
during the weekend may support elongation of upper troughing into
the Southwest U.S., which would lead to some deceleration of the
front over the southern Plains.  The 00Z ECMWF has shifted
noticeably farther west with the upper ridge versus continuity,
which allows a stronger shortwave/closed low to move through
British Columbia Saturday into next Sunday which will be watched,
but is not presently preferred.  To account for lingering
uncertainty, a compromise of the 00z UKMET/00z GFS/00z ECMWF/00z
Canadian was used early for pressures/500 hPa heights, winds, and
generally for QPF before using increasing amounts of ensemble mean
(ECMWF/NAEFS) solutions with time.  The remainder of the grids
used the 13z National Blend of Models as a baseline.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...
The vigorous surface low tracking across southern into eastern
Canada mid-late week will bring a period of strong winds to
northern tier areas, especially the Northern Plains into Wednesday
and perhaps to some degree locations farther east thereafter.
Expect mostly light to moderate rain to develop along the trailing
cold front over the east-central U.S. around Wednesday and
progress eastward/northeastward into Thursday.  Highest totals
should extend from the south-central Mississippi Valley up the
Ohio Valley.  Chilly flow behind the system may produce a period
of lake effect precipitation, mainly over the upper and eastern
portions of the Great Lakes.  The southern Florida Peninsula will
see increasing rainfall mid-late week as moisture interacts with a
stalled front to the south.  Easterly low level flow should lead
to highest totals over eastern areas.  Meanwhile, a Pacific system
reaching the northern half of the West Coast after midweek will
produce organized precipitation over central/northern parts of the
West, which for Western WA could persist through next weekend.
The upper level portion of this system may support a central U.S.
front that could start to produce some rain next weekend.

Overall expect temperatures across the lower 48 to reach fairly
seasonable levels by next weekend with many locations seeing highs
within a few degrees of normal.  Before then, the warm sector
ahead of the front crossing the eastern half of the country
Wednesday-Thursday will bring a brief period of warmth to the
South and East as temperatures reach up to 10-15F above normal
(perhaps even warmer for morning lows on Wednesday).  Colder air
behind the front will spread from the Plains into the East
mid-late week with readings generally 5-10F or so below normal.
Parts of the High Plains could rebound to scattered plus 10F
anomalies on Friday.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CST Sun Nov 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong shortwave trough will continue to intensify as it moves out
of the Plains early this morning and into the eastern US. Strong
mid-level flow will accompany the trough and extend westward toward
a building ridge centered over the southern Great Basin. The strong
flow will move north along the periphery of the ridge as several
small shortwaves embedded within move ashore across the Pacific
Northwest. Surface high pressure over the Rockies and Great Basin
will support some gusty downslope flow across the Front Range and
adjacent High Plains as well as weak offshore flow across southern
California. However, with poor RH expected, significant overlap
between strong winds and warm/dry surface conditions is unlikely
through the forecast period. Fire weather concerns will remain
minimal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 PM CST Sun Nov 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 11/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CST Sun Nov 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging over much of the western US should flatten
somewhat under the influence of a shortwave trough moving ashore
across the Pacific Northwest early Day2/Monday. As the shortwave
strengthens, a 60 to 70 kt mid-level jet will move eastward across
the northern and central Rockies. Aided by the increasing flow aloft
across the Rockies, a potent lee trough will develop through the day
supporting strong downslope winds across the Front Range and High
Plains. Breezy conditions may extend as far south as eastern New
Mexico where somewhat warmer and drier conditions may support
locally elevated fire weather potential through the afternoon.
However, cooler temperatures and weaker winds across the rest of the
lower 48 should limit the potential for significant fire weather
concerns through the forecast period.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST Sun Nov 14 2021

Valid 00Z Mon Nov 15 2021 - 00Z Wed Nov 17 2021

...Heavy rain and mountain snow resumes over the Pacific
Northwest....

...An Alberta clipper will deliver rain/snow and gusty winds to
the Great Lakes tonight and then New England on Monday...

...Light rain/snow will fall across the Northern Plains to Upper
Midwest through Monday morning...

...A much stronger storm will spread mountain snows and high winds
across the northern Rockies to northern High Plains Monday night
to Tuesday...

A slow moving, yet potent low pressure system will bring an
Atmospheric River event in the form of heavy mountain snow to the
Cascades and heavy low elevation rainfall to the Pacific Northwest
through Monday. Heavy rainfall will soak the Olympic Peninsula and
northern Washington Cascades through Monday morning where Slight
Risks of Excessive Rainfall are in effect. Multiple inches are
likely for these areas over the next 24 hours. This system will
deepen as it glides across southwestern Canada over the next few
days. It will generate high winds over the Northern Rockies/Plains
as it continues to deepen tonight. High temperatures will rise
steeply over this area to between 25-30 degrees above average over
the next couple of days due to the approaching deep trough.

Meanwhile, a pair of Alberta clipper systems will bring winter
weather to the Northern Plains and Northeast respectively over the
next two days. The weaker of the two clippers will produce light
rain/snow over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest tonight
before dissipating. The downstream clipper will produce light to
moderate snowfall over the Lower Great Lakes, Central Appalachians
and Adirondacks through Monday. Generally 2-4 inches of snow are
expected with isolated higher amounts possible over the peaks of
the aforementioned mountains. This clipper will simultaneously
produce rainfall over coastal New England through Monday.
Temperatures cool down across the east in the wake of this system,
with parts of the Ohio Valley and Central Appalachians
experiencing particularly cold high temperatures between 15-25
degrees on Monday. A quieter period awaits the CONUS heading into
midweek.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun November 14 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance generally agrees that progressive mean flow late this
week should eventually transition toward an amplifying mean trough
over the central-eastern U.S. as a ridge building over the eastern
Pacific during the weekend begins to move into the West early next
week. This evolution should promote a couple surges of chilly air
over the central/eastern states while temperatures over the West
remain near to above normal.

While most solutions offer similar ideas for the large scale
evolution, models and ensembles continue to be at odds over
various aspects of the forecast behind the well-clustered late
week upper trough crossing the East and associated cold
front/trailing high pressure. Before the latest 00Z cycle it had
appeared guidance was starting to cluster somewhat for the system
expected to track toward the Pacific Northwest late this
week--aside from the 12Z UKMET straying to the fast side and the
12Z/18Z GFS runs leaning a tad slow. Now the 00Z UKMET/CMC have
adjusted to a weaker and more open shortwave that leads to a much
weaker/slower/suppressed surface wave. The 00Z ECMWF is somewhat
weaker/slower but on a similar track and is now more similar to
the GFS. The latest manual forecast based on data through the
12Z/18Z cycles used a model composite at 12Z Thursday and then
phased out the UKMET contribution. Continued uncertainty with how
this system will evolve tempers confidence in details of the
general area of lower pressure and one or more fronts forecast to
reach the central U.S. by Saturday. Farther west, additional
diffuse energy may reach areas over and southwest of the
southwestern U.S. Models and ensembles vary considerably for what
may become of this energy (open trough or closed low) and its
location, with consecutive model runs also quite variable. In
addition there are meaningful differences for timing of the upper
ridge moving into the West early next week and upstream energy
(12Z CMC strayed well ahead of other guidance, 12Z ECMWF a bit
slow). At least the new 00Z CMC has adjusted closer to consensus.
These various issues affect how amplified the central-eastern U.S.
upper trough will be and the southern/eastern extent of surface
fronts by the end of the period. The lack of confidence in
specifics by the latter half of the period favored a fairly rapid
increase of 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF mean input, reaching 60 percent
total by day 7 Monday, with the rest composed of the 12Z ECMWF and
small parts of the 12Z/18Z GFS.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Strong low pressure tracking over eastern Canada should bring
brisk winds to areas from the Upper Midwest into the Northeast
Thursday-Friday while mostly light to moderate precipitation
(mostly rain) will accompany the trailing front crossing the
eastern U.S. Northern and eastern portions of the Great Lakes
should see a period of lake effect precipitation after frontal
passage. Meanwhile the southern Florida Peninsula may experience
locally moderate to heavy rainfall around Thursday as moisture
interacts with a stalled front to the south and another front
approaching from the northwest. Continued spread and variability
in guidance for the system approaching the West Coast late this
week keep confidence lower than desired for the specifics of rain
and higher elevation snow that should spread across the
central/northern West Coast into the northern Rockies. Upstream
moisture may keep some precipitation over the northern Pacific
Northwest through the weekend. As shortwave energy continues
eastward, expect another area of rain to develop from the southern
Plains eastward/northeastward from the weekend into early next
week ahead of one or more cold fronts but again with low
confidence for coverage and amounts at this time. Precipitation
could change to snow over the farthest north latitudes with
reinforcing cold air.

Areas near the East Coast will see temperatures up to 10-15F above
normal on Thursday ahead of an advancing cold front. The cooling
trend behind this front will bring generally 5-12F below normal
readings from the Plains into the East Thursday-Saturday. Upstream
system progression may bring a brief episode of warmth from the
West into the High Plains late this week, peaking with some highs
10-15F above normal over the central High Plains on Friday.
Another push of cold air should extend southeastward from the
northern Plains Sunday-Monday with highs 5-10F below normal.

157 AM EST Mon Nov 15 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Nov 18 2021 - 12Z Mon Nov 22 2021

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance generally agrees that progressive mean flow late this
week should eventually transition toward an amplifying mean trough
over the central-eastern U.S. as a ridge building over the eastern
Pacific during the weekend begins to move into the West early next
week. This evolution should promote a couple surges of chilly air
over the central/eastern states while temperatures over the West
remain near to above normal.

While most solutions offer similar ideas for the large scale
evolution, models and ensembles continue to be at odds over
various aspects of the forecast behind the well-clustered late
week upper trough crossing the East and associated cold
front/trailing high pressure. Before the latest 00Z cycle it had
appeared guidance was starting to cluster somewhat for the system
expected to track toward the Pacific Northwest late this
week--aside from the 12Z UKMET straying to the fast side and the
12Z/18Z GFS runs leaning a tad slow. Now the 00Z UKMET/CMC have
adjusted to a weaker and more open shortwave that leads to a much
weaker/slower/suppressed surface wave. The 00Z ECMWF is somewhat
weaker/slower but on a similar track and is now more similar to
the GFS. The latest manual forecast based on data through the
12Z/18Z cycles used a model composite at 12Z Thursday and then
phased out the UKMET contribution. Continued uncertainty with how
this system will evolve tempers confidence in details of the
general area of lower pressure and one or more fronts forecast to
reach the central U.S. by Saturday. Farther west, additional
diffuse energy may reach areas over and southwest of the
southwestern U.S. Models and ensembles vary considerably for what
may become of this energy (open trough or closed low) and its
location, with consecutive model runs also quite variable. In
addition there are meaningful differences for timing of the upper
ridge moving into the West early next week and upstream energy
(12Z CMC strayed well ahead of other guidance, 12Z ECMWF a bit
slow). At least the new 00Z CMC has adjusted closer to consensus.
These various issues affect how amplified the central-eastern U.S.
upper trough will be and the southern/eastern extent of surface
fronts by the end of the period. The lack of confidence in
specifics by the latter half of the period favored a fairly rapid
increase of 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF mean input, reaching 60 percent
total by day 7 Monday, with the rest composed of the 12Z ECMWF and
small parts of the 12Z/18Z GFS.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CST Mon Nov 15 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging across the Great Basin will begin to weak today as
a shortwave trough approaches the Pacific Northwest. Strong flow
aloft will overspread the Rockies as a cold front moves south out of
Canada. Ahead of the front, strong downslope winds are expected to
develop along the Front Range through the afternoon. While localized
fire weather potential will exist with the strong winds in the
northern Rockies, elsewhere, fire weather potential will remain low.

...Northern and central Rockies...
As the previously mentioned shortwave trough advances toward the
northern and central Rockies through the day, low-level surface
pressure gradients will tighten substantially in response to the
development of a strong lee trough. Very strong surface gusts
greater than 50 mph will be possible through terrain gaps and in the
adjacent foothills from Montana south, through eastern Wyoming and
onto the Front Range of northern Colorado. While winds will be very
strong, surface humidity values will be slow to fall through day, as
a result of mid-level cloud cover and lingering surface moisture.
Prior day humidity recoveries as high as 80% across portions of the
northern Rockies also suggest fuel availability will be limited to
pockets of fuels generally unfavorable for large fire spread.
Localized fire weather conditions cannot be ruled out given strong
winds and increased drying near topography. However, the spatial
coverage of sustained elevated and critical conditions is expected
to remain too low to include any areas at this time.

0158 AM CST Mon Nov 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND
WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper low/trough will move eastward Day2/Tuesday across southern
Canada and the northern Rockies while mid-level ridging develops
across the eastern US. A cold front associated with the trough will
move south out of Canada and into the northern Plains late in the
period. Strong surface winds are expected ahead of the trough and
cold front supporting critical fire weather conditions across
portions of the southern Rockies and High Plains.

...Eastern New Mexico and portions of the southern High Plains...
Similar to Day1/Monday, the increasing flow aloft perpendicular to
the higher terrain will support the development of a strong lee
trough/low across eastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado. In
response, west-east surface pressure gradients will quickly
strengthen through the day, supporting strong westerly surface flow.
Enhanced by the strengthening flow aloft and topography, widespread
winds of 25-35 mph and higher gusts are likely from eastern New
Mexico into portions of southern Colorado and West Texas.
Unseasonably warm temperatures and strong downsloping will favor low
humidity values with widespread surface RH less than 10% expected
through the afternoon. Favorable meteorological conditions will
overlap with drying grassy fuels supportive of fire spread. As a
result, widespread elevated to critical fire weather conditions are
forecast to develop across portions of eastern New Mexico and the
southern High Plains Day2/Tuesday. Fire weather concerns will
diminish quickly overnight as surface temperatures cool ahead of a
fast moving cold front.

...Central Plains...
Low-end fire weather potential may also develop for a few hours
behind the fast moving cold front across portions of the Dakotas and
eastern Wyoming. Strong winds of 25-35 mph and higher gusts are
forecast to continue as they shift to the northwest through the day.
Uncertainty remains on the coverage of low surface humidity with
cooler temperatures expected behind the front. Current ensemble
guidance suggests minimum RH may struggle to get below 25% despite
the strong winds. Locally elevated fire weather conditions may
develop where humidity remains less than 25% and grassy fuels exist,
though forecast confidence is low.

...Heavy rain and mountain snow culminates today over the Pacific
Northwest before tapering off tonight....

...A rapidly intensifying low pressure system will bring high
winds across the northern Rockies today and through the northern
Plains on Tuesday...

...Areas of rain/snow over the Northeast will gradually taper off
as low pressure system exits New England...

The latest round of heavy precipitation across northwestern
Washington state will reach peak intensity today as multiple
frontal waves push onshore and consolidate into a major low
pressure system centered over British Columbia.  Deep mild air
ahead of the system will keep much of the precipitation as heavy
rain even up into the mountainous terrains, with only the highest
peaks seeing heavy snow.  A strong cold front will then sweep
across the Pacific Northwest later today through tonight as the
low pressure system intensifies.  Cold air rushing in behind the
front will change the heavy rain quickly to heavy snow across the
higher elevations along with high winds.  The system will likely
reach peak intensity tonight over Alberta Canada and slowly
weakens as it tracks across the Canadian prairies through
Wednesday morning.  A widespread high wind event is anticipated
for the northern Rockies then spreading east through the northern
Plains to the upper Midwest for the next couple of days.  Only
modest snow amounts are forecast for the northern Rockies with
this system followed by little precipitation across the northern
Plains given an apparent lack of available moisture.  High
temperatures will rise steeply across the High Plains well into
the 70s for the next couple of afternoons, which are between 25-30
degrees above average for this time of the year.  In contrast,
colder than normal temperatures will surge into the Pacific
Northwest.

Meanwhile, an Alberta clipper with areas of rain/snow will begin
to depart the Northeast today.  Areas of rain/snow across the
Great Lakes to New England will slowly taper off through Tuesday.
Another weaker clipper system will produce light rain/snow over
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest tonight before dissipating.
The downstream clipper will produce light to moderate snowfall
over the Lower Great Lakes, Central Appalachians and Adirondacks
through Monday. Generally 2-4 inches of snow are expected with
isolated higher amounts possible over the peaks of the
aforementioned mountains. This clipper will simultaneously produce
rainfall over coastal New England through Monday. Temperatures
cool down across the east in the wake of this system, with parts
of the Ohio Valley and Central Appalachians experiencing
particularly cold high temperatures between 15-25 degrees on
Monday. A quieter period awaits the CONUS heading into midweek.

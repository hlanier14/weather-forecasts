1253 AM CST Sun Jan 16 2022

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will quickly progress from the northern Rockies
into the lower Mississippi Valley today. Weak surface troughing will
occur in the southern Plains as a result. A dry airmass will still
be present across the southern High Plains region. Though winds are
expected to remain weak, a few areas of locally elevated fire
weather may occur around terrain features.

across the Four Corners. Modest to moderate mid-level northwesterly
winds across the Divide will promote some degree of lee troughing
during the afternoon in the High Plains. The airmass across the
region should remain quite dry. Areas of locally elevated fire
weather conditions will be possible from east-central New Mexico
into the Texas Panhandle. Given the generally weak lee trough as
well as potential for high-level clouds to decrease boundary-layer
mixing, such conditions are expected to remain localized and brief.

200 AM EST Sun Jan 16 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 19 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 23 2022

...Pattern Overview...

A mean upper ridge will amplify along/off the West Coast by
mid-later week. This will allow a series of northern stream
impulses carve out and reinforce a large mean trough downstream
over the central to eastern U.S. later week into the weekend. Of
the main shortwaves, the first should slide over the Great Lakes
into the Northeast Wednesday and Thursday, with the next tending
to dig more sharply into the South Friday and up off the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast coast Saturday. There is significant
forecast spread and run to run uncertainty with this latter
feature and associated mid-winter weather focus with frontal
wave/coastal low genesis.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a model
and ensemble composite days 3-7.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An organized low pressure system will dig into the north-central
U.S. and subsequently track moving eastward along the
U.S./Canadian border Wed/Thu. This should bring some snow to the
Great Lakes then northern New England, with locally higher totals
expected near typical lake enhancement areas as cold high pressure
sweeps down across the central and eastern U.S. in the wake of the
low. The wavy trailing cold front on the leading edge of this
Arctic blast will gain some Gulf moisture to fuel an emerging area
of precipitation up from the South/Southeast. Guidance varies with
potential focus due to ample run to run trough track/separation
uncertainty aloft. The pattern offers potential into later week
for an enhanced swath of overrunning snow/ice on the northern
periphery of activity. A cluster of multi-model ensemble members
along with in particular the 18 UTC GFS/00 UTC Canadian models,
are more robust with frontal wave/coastal low/storm genesis and
mid-winter precipitation extent across the region and the East
Coast at these longer time periods. Meanwhile, The West could see
some light precipitation through the period, particularly over the
Pacific Northwest and into the Northern Rockies as weakening
systems cross the region, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.

A mean upper ridge will amplify along/off the West Coast by
mid-later week. This will allow a series of northern stream

over the central to eastern U.S. later week into the weekend. Of
the main shortwaves, the first should slide over the Great Lakes

low in a pattern with above normal predictability for these
features. The wavy trailing cold front on the leading edge of this
Arctic blast will gain some Gulf moisture to fuel an emerging area
of precipitation up from the South/Southeast. Guidance varies
however with potential focus due to ample run to run trough
track/separation uncertainty aloft later week into the weekend.
The pattern offers potential into later week for an enhanced swath
of overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity. A
cluster of multi-model ensemble members along with in particular
the 18 UTC GFS and now the latest 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian models,
are much more robust with frontal wave to coastal low/storm
genesis and mid-winter precipitation extent across the region and
up the East Coast at these longer time periods. However, the 00
UTC GFS has backed off. The preferred model and composite trends
WPC product continuity toward more organized and closer to the
coast genesis and track, but at this point not as strong as some
of the models. Meanwhile, The West could see some light
precipitation through the period, particularly over the Pacific
Northwest and into the Northern Rockies as weakening systems cross
the region, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.

...Heavy Snow for parts of the Central/Southern Appalachians,
Lower Great Lakes/Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast on
Sunday...

...Significant rain/freezing rain for parts of the Mid-Atlantic
and the Central/Southern Appalachians; Light rain/freezing rain
for parts Northeast on Sunday...

...Some heavy rain, strong thunderstorms, and high winds can be
expected to impact the coastal sections of the southern
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast Coast Sunday into Monday...

A strong storm over the Southeast/Southern Appalachians will move
northeastward inland from the coast to Southeastern Canada by
Tuesday. The system will produce rain, thunderstorms, snow, and
rain/freezing rain from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the
Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic, Sunday.

Heavy snow will extend from the Tennessee Valley, Central/Southern
Appalachians, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic, with significant
rain/freezing rain over parts of the Southeast, Central/Southern
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic from Sunday morning to Sunday evening.
From Sunday evening into Monday morning, heavy snow will extend
into parts of the Ohio Valley, Lower Great Lakes, and Northeast.
Also, rain/freezing rain will move into parts of the northern
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Furthermore, the rain will move into
parts of the northern Mid-Atlantic and Southern New England
overnight Sunday. On Monday, as the storm moves across the
Northeast, the rain will develop over the coastal regions of Maine
with heavy snow inland. Light snow will linger over parts of the
Central/Southern Appalachians into the Northeast by Monday evening
into Tuesday. The heavy snow will end overnight Monday over Maine.
The combination of snow and ice may cause hazardous road
conditions during and after the storm.

Meanwhile, a boundary over Central Canada will move into the Upper
Midwest by Sunday evening. The system will produce light snow over
parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley and the Upper Great Lakes
for Sunday and begin to wane by Monday evening. By Tuesday
morning, a wave of low pressure over the Northern High Plains will
move into the Northern Plains. Light snow will develop across the
parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern High Plains into the
Northern Plains overnight Monday into Tuesday morning. The snow
will result in reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions.

Weak onshore flow and approaching upper-level energy will develop
light rain and higher elevation snow over parts of the Pacific
Northwest Monday evening into Tuesday. Moreover, upper-level
energy will move over California producing scattered areas of rain
Monday evening into Tuesday.

...Cooled South to East Coast Snow/Ice Threat with frontal/coastal
low genesis late week...

...Pattern Overview...

A mean upper ridge will amplify along/off the West Coast by
mid-later week. This will allow a series of northern stream
impulses carve out and reinforce a large mean trough downstream
over the central to eastern U.S. later week into the weekend. Of
the main shortwaves, the first should slide over the Great Lakes
into the Northeast Wednesday and Thursday, with the next tending
to dig more sharply into the South Friday and up off the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast coast Saturday. There is significant
forecast spread and run to run uncertainty with this latter
feature and associated mid-winter weather focus with frontal
wave/coastal low genesis.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Weather
Highlights/Hazards...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a model
and ensemble composite days 3-7. There is good agreement with an
organized low pressure system set to dig into the north-central
U.S. and subsequently track moving eastward along the
U.S./Canadian border Wed/Thu. This should bring some snow to the
Great Lakes then northern New England, with locally higher totals
expected near typical lake enhancement areas as cold high pressure
sweeps down across the central and eastern U.S. in the wake of the
low in a pattern with above normal predictability for these
features. The wavy trailing cold front on the leading edge of this
Arctic blast will gain some Gulf moisture to fuel an emerging area
of precipitation up from the South/Southeast. Guidance varies
however with potential focus due to ample run to run trough
track/separation uncertainty aloft later week into the weekend.
The pattern offers potential into later week for an enhanced swath
of overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity. A
cluster of multi-model ensemble members along with in particular
the 18 UTC GFS and now the latest 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian models,
are much more robust with frontal wave to coastal low/storm
genesis and mid-winter precipitation extent across the region and
up the East Coast at these longer time periods. However, the 00
UTC GFS has backed off. The preferred model and composite trends
WPC product continuity toward more organized and closer to the
coast genesis and track, but at this point not as strong as some
of the models. Meanwhile, The West could see some light
precipitation through the period, particularly over the Pacific
Northwest and into the Northern Rockies as weakening systems cross

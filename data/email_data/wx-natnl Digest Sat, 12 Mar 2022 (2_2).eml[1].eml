...A significant late season winter storm to produce a plethora of
hazardous weather up and down the East Coast that includes heavy
snow, strong winds, severe weather, and flash flooding...

...Temperatures to fall 20 to 30 degrees below average across the
central and eastern U.S. behind an Arctic cold front this weekend,
including sub-freezing temperatures to the Gulf Coast Sunday
morning...

...Locally heavy rain and mountain snow to affect the Pacific
Northwest beginning late Saturday; High winds expected in the
northern High Plains...

A robust upper level trough is supporting an environment favorable
for the rapid intensification of a low pressure system tracking up
the Eastern Seaboard later today. Considerably colder than normal
temperatures spilling into the eastern third of the Lower 48 will
allow precipitation to fall as snow from the Mid-South and
Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast. As heavy snow ends in parts of
the Tennessee Valley early this morning, the axis of heavy snow
moves into the northern Mid-Atlantic and interior Northeast. Snow
totals exceeding 4 inches are forecast from the central
Appalachians on north into the Poconos, Catskills, and northern
Appalachians. Snowfall totals could accumulate exceed a foot in
the higher elevations of the Northeast. Lighter accumulations on
the order of 1 to 3 inches are possible along the I-95 corridor
with slick travel conditions possible. In addition to the periods
of snow, winds will pick up and near-whiteout conditions could
unfold, making for treacherous travel conditions by both ground
and air. Wind Advisories have been hoisted from the central Gulf
Coast and Southeast on north into the Northeast where wind gusts
up to 50 mph are possible. Severe weather is also forecast in the
Southeast where an Enhanced Risk (threat level 3/5) has been
posted from Savannah, GA on north through the coastal Carolinas
and into southeast Virginia. A Slight Risk (threat level 2/5)
extends south into central Florida as well. Severe storms in these
areas could produce damaging wind gusts, tornadoes, and hail.
Lastly, heavy rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding in
parts of northern Florida this morning.

In wake of this storm system, an injection of cold Canadian air is
bringing perhaps one of the last shots of winter-like conditions
the winter season has to offer in the East. Numerous record cold
max temperatures are forecast from the Great Lakes on south to the
central Gulf Coast. Daytime high temperature anomalies will range
between 20 to 30 degrees below normal throughout the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys today. By Sunday morning, lows will be in the
teens throughout the Great Lakes and Northeast with subfreezing
temps anticipated from the central Gulf Coast to northern Florida.
Due to the expected subfreezing temperatures, Freeze Warnings have
been issued for Saturday night and early Sunday morning from the
Lower Mississippi Valley and northern Florida to central South
Carolina. Temperatures will be cold enough to break records in the
Southeast where record cold is possible as far south as the Tampa,
FL metro area. Temperatures will begin to moderate in the Midwest
where daytime highs are set to reach the 60s by Sunday. The same
moderating temperature trend eventually reaches the East Coast by
the start of the upcoming week.

In the West, a more active pattern returns as a potent Pacific
cyclone slams into the Pacific Northwest late Saturday. Periods of
heavy rain along with heavy mountain snow will accompany this
storm system which will spread east into the interior Northwest by
Sunday morning. After a brief break, another round of
precipitation reaches the Pacific Northwest Sunday night and
continues into Monday morning as another cold front nears the
coast. Farther inland, strong wind gusts are expected in the
northern Sierra Nevada and the northern High Plains. High Winds
Warnings and Watches have been issued for these areas today as
wind gusts in excess of 60 mph are possible, making for difficult
travel conditions for high profile vehicles as well as a chance
for downed trees and power outages.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0943 AM CDT Wed May 04 2022

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN TO NORTHEAST NEW
MEXICO...

The ongoing forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed based on morning observations and latest trends is morning
guidance. The 12 UTC ABQ and EPZ soundings sampled a dry boundary
layer over NM and surface observations show RH already falling into
the upper teens to low 20s. Further drying is expected as broad
subsidence overspreads the region to the south of an upper-level low
over CO. Uncertainty remains regarding the extent of the fire
weather threat across the western TX Panhandle, and will be
dependent on where the dryline sharpens this afternoon.
Additionally, morning clouds and light rainfall across southeast NM
and southwest TX introduce some uncertainty regrading the RH
forecast for this afternoon. However, there are several factors that
justify maintaining the ongoing risk areas, including regional ERCs
above the 90th percentile, limited observed recent rainfall at the
surface, observed RH falls on the western periphery of the cloud
deck, and a strong signal in ensemble guidance for elevated to
critical conditions by late afternoon.

..Moore.. 05/04/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Wed May 04 2022/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper-level trough across the Four Corners and central
Rockies will move eastward into the central/southern Plains today. A
surface cyclone will deepen in eastern New Mexico. Fire weather
concerns will be focused across New Mexico.

...New Mexico into West Texas...
Strong surface winds are expected to develop behind a composite
front/dryline in West Texas. Winds of 20-25 mph are probable across
much southern, central, and northeastern New Mexico. RH of 10-15%
will be common, but locally 5-10% is possible. Critical conditions
may extend into parts of the Texas Panhandle and South Plains at
least briefly. With modest uncertainty in the dryline position and
possible South Plains precipitation this morning, Elevated
highlights will be maintained in these areas.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0108 PM CDT Wed May 04 2022

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

An Elevated risk area has been introduced for portions of southern
Nevada where confidence has increased the duration and coverage of
15-20 mph winds with sub 15% RH. Fuels across this region have
continued to dry with ERCs generally near or above the 80th
percentile, which should support at least a low-end fire weather
threat. The forecast across New Mexico remains on track with only
minor adjustments needed based on latest ensemble guidance. See the
previous discussion below for details.

..Moore.. 05/04/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0139 AM CDT Wed May 04 2022/

...Synopsis...
Shortwave ridging aloft will be present across the Southwest on
Thursday. Broadly cyclonic flow will move into parts of the
Northwest. A strong mid-level jet will exist across the Sierra into
the Great Basin by late afternoon. At the surface, modest flow aloft
across the southern Rockies may deepen a surface trough in eastern
New Mexico. Similarly, weak surface troughing is expected in the
central Great Basin.

...Central New Mexico...
A spatially limited area of Elevated fire weather is possible as
surface winds increase in response to the weak lee trough. Winds of
15-20 mph are expected along with 10-15% RH. It is possible locally
Critical conditions could develop where terrain-enhanced winds
exceed 20 mph.

...Southern Nevada...
Strong heating in the region could bring temperatures into the 80s
to near 90 F. Given the weak surface trough, it is not clear how
widespread 15-20 mph winds will be. RH will likely fall to near 10%,
however. Locally elevated conditions are possible.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed May 04 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 10 - 14 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs dynamical model solutions remain in good =
agreement in predicting an
amplified 500-hPa height pattern across North America during the 6-10 day
period. The highest amplitude is forecast early in the period, with deep
troughing (ridging) and associated negative (positive) height anomalies
predicted over the western (eastern) CONUS. The 0z ECMWF ensemble is
particularly strong with the ridging over the eastern CONUS, depicting an
expansive area of daily mean +240 meter height departures across parts of t=
he
Great Lakes and southeastern Canada on days 6 and 7. The high amplitude rid=
ge
is forecast to result in a cut-off mid-level low retrograding off the
mid-Atlantic and Southeast coasts, favoring closer to normal heights over
those
areas. Some weakening and eastward progression of the mid-level height patt=
ern
is forecast by day-10. As the troughing in the West shifts further inland
later
in the period, ridging initially favored over the East Pacific is forecast =
to
move closer to the West Coast. Across Alaska, models are in good agreement =
in
maintaining mean troughing over most of the Mainland, ahead of a strong rid=
ge
forecast over the Aleutians. Generally near to above normal mid-level heigh=
ts
are forecast over Alaska, except over the northern Mainland where weakly be=
low
normal heights are favored.

Increased probabilities of below normal temperatures are forecast across mo=
st
of the western CONUS due to predicted troughing over the region. Increased
southerly flow and anomalously strong ridging downstream of this trough fav=
ors
enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures across much of the cent=
ral
and eastern CONUS, with the highest confidence (>90 percent probabilities)
across parts of the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys. The National
Blend of Models indicates the potential for record high temperatures across
parts of the east-central CONUS, particularly across the Middle and Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. Anomalous onshore flow along with the
potential for increased cloud cover and precipitation, associated with a
retrograding cut-off low, favor increased chances for near normal temperatu=
res
along the southern mid-Atlantic and Southeast coasts, with slightly below
normal temperatures indicated over parts of the Florida Peninsula. Below
normal
temperature probabilities are enhanced for most of central and southern
Mainland Alaska as well as the Panhandle, due to mean troughing forecast
across
much of the state.

An active pattern is favored for much of the western and central CONUS, due=
 to
the likelihood of anomalous southerly flow and associated moisture advectio=
n
ahead of the trough predicted over the western CONUS. Therefore, probabilit=
ies
of above normal precipitation are enhanced for most of the Northern and
Central
Rockies and Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and the Northwest. A drying
trend
is possible toward the end of the period, especially along the West Coast, =
as
the troughing progresses farther inland and ridging expands over the East
Pacific. Ridging over eastern North America leads to elevated chances of be=
low
normal precipitation for most of the eastern CONUS, and the Southern Plains=
.
However, the potential for enhanced onshore flow results in increased
probabilities for near to above normal precipitation for the parts of the
southern mid-Atlantic and Southeast, with the highest rainfall totals depic=
ted
in the ECMWF ensemble. Near to above normal precipitation is favored for
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle due to mean troughing. Conversely, near t=
o
below normal precipitation is most likely for much of the Aleutians and Ala=
ska
Peninsula due to predicted ridging upstream.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on an amplified pattern persisting through much of the
period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 12 - 18 2022

An amplified 500-hPa height pattern is forecast over North America during t=
he
early part of week-2, with a transition to a less amplified pattern later i=
n
the period. Troughing over the western CONUS is favored to weaken by the
middle
of the period, with potential for split flow emerging over the West due to
weak
ridging being depicted in the model ensembles over western Canada. Downstre=
am,
over the central and eastern CONUS, the mid-level pattern is forecast to
become
more zonal as the initial ridging de-amplifies. For the week-2 period as a
whole, near to above normal heights are favored for much of the CONUS, with
the
largest positive height anomalies over the Northeast, and near normal heigh=
ts
predicted over the interior West. Cut-off mid-level low pressure is forecas=
t
to
move across the coastal Southeast and the Florida Peninsula early in the
period, which favors closer to normal heights for those areas. Mean troughi=
ng
is likely to persist over Mainland Alaska throughout the period but with on=
ly
modest height anomalies (tilt toward negative anomalies further north and
positive anomalies to the south). More significant positive height anomalie=
s
are predicted across the Aleutians as above normal heights are forecast in
association with mean ridging upstream.

Below normal temperatures are favored for much of the western CONUS due to
residual troughing forecast through the middle of the period. Probabilities=
 of
above normal temperatures are elevated for most of the CONUS east of the
Rockies. The magnitude of the warm and cold temperature anomalies is foreca=
st
to moderate by the middle of the period as the mid-level height pattern
becomes
less amplified, with the initial trough over the West forecast to shift
eastward and weaken. The GEFS depicts less weakening of this trough compare=
d
to
the ECMWF ensemble, and would therefore result in enhanced chances of near =
to
below normal temperatures developing over the Upper Midwest and Mississippi
Valley later in the period, although the forecast for the period as a whole=
 is
still above normal for these areas. Cut-off mid-level low pressure may resu=
lt
in near to below normal temperatures across the coastal Southeast and Flori=
da
Peninsula at the outset of the period, but this feature is forecast to quic=
kly
weaken, allowing the above normal temperatures forecast upstream to expand
into
the region. Persistent troughing leads to elevated chances of near to below
normal temperatures across most of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, excep=
t
for parts of the northeastern Mainland where increased chances for above
normal
temperatures are forecast, consistent with the consolidated forecast tool.

Chances of above normal precipitation are elevated for much of the Northern
and
Central Rockies and Plains, and the Upper Mississippi Valley, ahead of the
trough forecast over the western CONUS. As this trough progresses eastward =
and
weakens, a drier pattern is forecast, particularly across the Pacific
Northwest, California and the Southwest where near to below normal
precipitation probabilities are elevated. Below normal precipitation is
favored
for much of the Northeast and Ohio Valley, in association with anomalous
ridging predicted over the East. Conversely, there is a slight tilt toward
above normal precipitation for parts of the Southeast and southern Mid-
Atlantic
due to predicted mean troughing lingering over the region, and consistent w=
ith
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Both reforecast tools also support
increased chances for below normal precipitation across parts of the Southe=
rn
Plains, which are forecast to be well displaced from the mean storm track a=
s
the troughing to the west lifts northward. Above normal precipitation is al=
so
favored for most of Alaska, as troughing is forecast to persist ahead of me=
an
ridging forecast over the Aleutians.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a
fairly amplified pattern predicted early in the period offset by a transiti=
on
to a lower amplitude pattern by the end of week-2.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

...North-central Great Basin/Rockies cold heavy snow threat to
contrast emerging north-central U.S. convection and record
south-central U.S to Midwest heat pattern with Omega-style block
development this weekend into next week...
...Lead Mid-Atlantic rainfall threat into Saturday with the closed
low to settle over a blocked western Atlantic next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Upper trough in the East will move offshore, close off and linger
off the Southeast coast through the medium range. There was plenty
of spread in the guidance, particularly with the 00z
CMC/CMCE/UKMET 06z GEFS, with respect to the intensity of the
closed low in the Atlantic beginning on Sunday and continuing
through Wednesday. The 00z EC appears to best capture the pattern
across the CONUS. There's notable spread in the 00z EC ensemble
members with respect to the upper-trough in the west by next
Tuesday and Wednesday. Thus, a blend of majority deterministic 00z
EC and 06z GFS was utilized through day 6. A more even combination
of deterministic and ensemble guidance was blended for day 7.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A leading closed upper trough and well organized surface
low/frontal system will track from the Ohio Valley through the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic this weekend. Some strong storms and
locally heavy downpours are possible considering slow system track
and pooled moisture/instability. The system will then stall and
retrograde over the western Atlantic next week as part of a
developing Omega-style block.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramatic change over much of the West later this week into next
week as an amplified mean upper trough and wavy frontal systems
become established over the region. This will support significant
cooling to include spotty record values along with a widespread
precipitation focus from the Northwest/Sierra through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies. This will include a substantial
and lingering threat for widespread heavy snows as further
enhanced in favored terrain. Expect temperatures to range as much
as 10-20 degrees below normal.

Uncertain upper system ejections channeled between amplified
eastern Pacific upper ridging/upper troughing over the West and
amplified east-central U.S. upper ridging as part of the
aforementioned Omega-style block over the lower 48 will trap a
slow moving and wavy frontal zone over the north-central U.S. to
support an emerging convection/rainfall pattern. This offers a
runoff threat given moist ambient Northern Plains soil conditions.
The Storm Prediction Center also highlights a concern for severe
weather into the eastern Central Plains for at least Sunday and
Monday. The pattern meanwhile favors record high temperatures over
the south-central U.S., with pre-frontal warmth gradually building
northeastward next week through the MS/TN Valleys/Midwest under
the upper ridge, in stark contrast to the wintry conditions over
the West and moderated/cooled high pressure dammed airmass to
linger over the East on the backside of a difficult to dislodge
western Atlantic circulation.

...North-central Great Basin/Rockies cold heavy snow threat to
contrast emerging north-central U.S. convection and record
south-central U.S to Midwest heat pattern with Omega-style block
development this weekend into next week...
...Lead Mid-Atlantic rainfall threat into Saturday with the closed
low to settle over a blocked western Atlantic next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Upper trough in the East will move offshore, close off and linger
off the Southeast coast through the medium range. There was plenty
of spread in the guidance, particularly with the 00z
CMC/CMCE/UKMET 06z GEFS, with respect to the intensity of the
closed low in the Atlantic beginning on Sunday and continuing
through Wednesday. The 00z EC appears to best capture the pattern
across the CONUS. There's notable spread in the 00z EC ensemble
members with respect to the upper-trough in the west by next
Tuesday and Wednesday. Thus, a blend of majority deterministic 00z
EC and 06z GFS was utilized through day 6. A more even combination
of deterministic and ensemble guidance was blended for day 7.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A leading closed upper trough and well organized surface
low/frontal system will track from the Ohio Valley through the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic this weekend. Some strong storms and
locally heavy downpours are possible considering slow system track
and pooled moisture/instability. The system will then stall and
retrograde over the western Atlantic next week as part of a
developing Omega-style block.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramatic change over much of the West later this week into next
week as an amplified mean upper trough and wavy frontal systems
become established over the region. This will support significant
cooling to include spotty record values along with a widespread
precipitation focus from the Northwest/Sierra through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies. This will include a substantial
and lingering threat for widespread heavy snows as further
enhanced in favored terrain. Expect temperatures to range as much
as 10-20 degrees below normal.

Uncertain upper system ejections channeled between amplified
eastern Pacific upper ridging/upper troughing over the West and
amplified east-central U.S. upper ridging as part of the
aforementioned Omega-style block over the lower 48 will trap a
slow moving and wavy frontal zone over the north-central U.S. to
support an emerging convection/rainfall pattern. This offers a
runoff threat given moist ambient Northern Plains soil conditions.
The Storm Prediction Center also highlights a concern for severe
weather into the eastern Central Plains for at least Sunday and
Monday. The pattern meanwhile favors record high temperatures over
the south-central U.S., with pre-frontal warmth gradually building
northeastward next week through the MS/TN Valleys/Midwest under
the upper ridge, in stark contrast to the wintry conditions over
the West and moderated/cooled high pressure dammed airmass to
linger over the East on the backside of a difficult to dislodge
western Atlantic circulation.

...There is a Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms and flash
flooding across parts of the Central Plains on Wednesday...

The weather pattern will remain rather active from the Rockies to
the Appalachians through the end of the week as a well organized
low pressure system emerges over the southern High Plains
Wednesday afternoon, and then progresses to the Ohio Valley by
Friday afternoon.  One of the hazards from this event will be the
plethora of heavy rainfall that is forecast from northern Texas to
Kansas and western Missouri, with the highest totals likely over
eastern Oklahoma where a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall is in
effect through early Thursday.  The potential exists for patchy
areas of 3-5 inch rainfall by midday Thursday, and training
convection with rainfall rates well over an inch per hour in some
instances could easily lead to flash flooding.  Another hazard
will be the Enhanced to Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms
across this same general area in the warm sector of the low
through Wednesday night, with the potential for tornadoes, large
hail, and damaging winds.  The severe threat is then greatest
across the ArkLaTex region for Thursday.

Elsewhere across the nation, fire weather concerns will be making
weather headlines across much of New Mexico and portions of
Arizona and western Texas through early Thursday, with warm
temperatures, extremely low humidity, and gusty winds increasing
the potential for wildfires.  In addition, degraded air quality is
likely in some areas owing to wildfire smoke and also blowing
dust.  For the Pacific Northwest, showers and high elevation snow
returns on Thursday as a Pacific storm system enters the region,
with the greatest precipitation expected for the Oregon Cascades.

In terms of temperatures, it will remain rather cool from the
Central Plains to the Ohio Valley on Thursday, with highs running
10 to 20 degrees below average in many cases, mainly owing to
increased cloud cover and rain.  On the contrary, it will remain
warm and humid across the Southeast and Gulf Coast region with the
cold front not making much progress past the Interstate 20
corridor.  Temperatures will also be above average across much of
the Intermountain West to close out the week.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 04 2022

SYNOPSIS: Week-2 starts with a strong mid-level ridge over eastern North
America, which will keep a threat for excessive heat in parts of the
Mississippi Valley and eastern Texas during the first half of the period.
Farther west, cold air will have settled into much of the western CONUS bef=
ore
week-2, where there=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs a slight chance for much be=
low normal temperatures in
much of the western half of the country persisting into early week-2.
Meanwhile, a mid-level trough and surface storm system favored  early in th=
e
period  may bring  potentially heavy precipitation and high winds to parts =
of
the Great Plains , as well as  As week-2 progresses, the pattern becomes le=
ss
amplified, reducing the risk for hazards for the latter half of the period.
Over parts of the Northern Plains and Alaska, , seasonal snow and ice melt
continues where there remains an increased risk for river flooding.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the  western CONU=
S,
Thu-Fri, May 12-13.

Slight risk of excessive heat in parts of eastern Texas, a Lower Mississipp=
i
and Tennessee Valleys, and the Southeast, Thu-Sat, May 12-14.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the eastern and south-centr=
al
Great Plains, Wed, May 11.

Slight risk of high winds over much of the Great Plains, Thu-Fri, May 12-13=
.

Possible flooding along the Red River of the North and part of the James
River.

Possible flooding in central and eastern Alaska.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY MAY 07 - WEDNESDAY MAY 11:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!_gQB2-n686HP0K9asLjGqBnXL-30M8Q2s_YMzoQWXegP_SIS9kHLu1HCnLEf9=

FOR THURSDAY MAY 12 - WEDNESDAY MAY 18: The GEFS and European Ensembles hav=
e
both slowed the transition to a less amplified  and  more progressive patte=
rn
by about a day, which was also the case yesterday relative to the day befor=
e.
This could be indicating that the expected de-amplification is being
overstated, and that the transition to a zonal, progressive mid-level flow =
may
not be as pronounced. For today, however, we again favor significant
de-amplification as indicated by a preponderance of the tools.



With mid-level high pressure over the Northeast moving out more slowly, the
increased risk of excessive heat for eastern Texas and the Lower Mississipp=
i
Valley has been extended one more day relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook.
Temperatures should reach the mid-90=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs across par=
ts of the south-central
CONUS
early in week-2, and with de-amplification expected, the hazards threat wil=
l
slide southward across the lower portions of the Gulf States. Temperature
anomalies will probably be higher farther to the north, from Upper Mississi=
ppi
Valley through the Great Lakes and Northeast, which is closer to the center=
 of
largest 500-hPa anomalies. However, maximum temperatures will likely remain
below hazards thresholds there in an absolute sense.





Farther west, the week starts with cold air over the interior western CONUS=
 in
association with a moderately strong mid-level trough that will have been
established before week-2. This cold air is favored to move eastward and
moderate by the middle week-2, but not before much below normal temperature=
s
threaten a large part of the region early in the period. Some reforecast to=
ols
bring temperatures below 40 deg F south to near the Mexican border May 11-1=
2,
with enhanced chances for temperatures below freezing reaching into the
southern Rockies.



Between the two extremes of temperature, there is general agreement that so=
me
sort of storm will be affecting the central CONUS early in the period,
increasing the likelihood of heavy precipitation and another high winds
episode
in parts of the central states. Models are not in good agreement on the
specifics of this scenario, but all move any storminess out of the central
CONUS around day 9 (Sat May 14). There remains a heavy precipitation threat
for
May 12 in parts of the Great Plains, but the axis of heaviest precipitation=
 is
slightly farther north and west than yesterday, and the hazard shape has be=
en
altered to that effect. The high winds threat is posted for an additional d=
ay
(Fri May 13) based on models and re-forecast tools showing the high winds
threat persisting well to the west of the storm system. As with the
temperature
hazards, the de-amplifying, and more progressive pattern that is favored to
develop across the CONUS will significantly reduce the chances or any extre=
me
weather during the latter half of week-2



 Persistent easterly flow is expected to develop along parts of the Eastern
Seaboard in the wake of the weakening and exiting high pressure system.
Farther
south, a surface low pressure could form near the southern Atlantic Coast
before week-2, enhancing the pressure gradient and the strength of the
easterly
winds, until the system begins to fade around mid-week. This could cause
dangerously high surf, beach erosion, strong rip tides, particularly along =
the
southern half of the Atlantic coastline. The surf could build to over 8 fee=
t
in
some areas.



Flooding may persist throughout week-2 in the Red River Valley of the North=
,
and extend into part of the James River basin, primarily due to melting sno=
w
and ice. Flooding is also possible through week-2 in a swath across central
Alaska for the same reason.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 AM CDT Thu May 05 2022

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
The central/southern Plains mid-level trough will continue its slow
progression eastward today. Across the West Coast, broadly cyclonic
flow will exist with a strong upper-level jet across the northern
Sierra. At the surface, fire weather concerns will be driven by weak
surface trough development in the Great Basin and in eastern New
Mexico.

...Central New Mexico...
Mid-level winds will be decreasing during the day. However, they
will be sufficient to induce a weak lee trough in the eastern
plains. Winds of 15-20 mph with perhaps some higher speeds in
terrain-favored areas. Dry air will once again be present with
afternoon RH falling to 10-15%.

...Southern Nevada...
Temperatures in the upper 80s to low 90s F will support afternoon RH
of 10-20% across much of Nevada. A weak surface trough in the Great
Basin will promote 15-20 mph winds. Elevated fire weather concerns
will exist where fuels have sufficiently dried.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1227 AM CDT Thu May 05 2022

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Low-amplitude ridging will develop over the Southwest on Friday. The
broad western trough will shift east with time, increasing flow
across the Divide. At the surface, the pressure pattern will
generally remain weak over areas of dry fuels.

...New Mexico...
Locally elevated conditions are possible. Dry air will remain in
place and RH will fall to 5-15% during the afternoon. Surface winds
are expected to be weaker than on Thursday as are mid-level winds.
15-20 mph winds would be most likely around wind-prone terrain
features.

...Colorado...
The surface pressure pattern in addition to the mid-level winds
across the Divide may be enough to bring gusty winds to parts of the
Front Range. Most guidance shows 10-20% RH during the afternoon, but
varies on the wind speeds. Even with 15-20 mph possible in places,
some recent rainfall has reduced some fuel receptiveness enough to
preclude highlights. Localized concerns are possible, however.

...Heavy snow threat over a cold north-central Great Basin/Rockies
to contrast north-central U.S. convection and south-central U.S to
Midwest record heat as part of Omega-style block development over
the lower 48 and adjoining oceans this weekend into next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A composite of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS along with the 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian, ECMWF ensemble mean and 01 UTC National
Blend of Models seems to present a reasonable forecast basis while
tending to mitigate embedded system variance consistent with a
pattern with near normal predictability Sunday into Monday. The
GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means remain best clustered and
in line with WPC continuity and the NBM Tuesday-next Thursday.
Despite better similarities, recent run-run guidance continuity
issues still suggests some caution with embedded feature details,
especially days 5-7. Most of the newer 00 UTC guidance maintain
similar trends from earlier guidance, with the Canadian remaining
the most out of phase with other guidance with the timing/emphasis
on systems digging into the western U.S.upper trough.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system will track off the Mid-Atlantic Sunday. The low stalls and
retrogrades over the western Atlantic back toward the Southeast
coast mid-later next week with wrapping rains within a developing
Omega-style block.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramatic change over much of the West later this weekend into next
week as an amplified mean upper trough and wavy frontal systems
become established over the region. This will support significant
cooling to include spotty record values along with a widespread
precipitation focus from the Northwest/Sierra through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies. This will include a substantial
and lingering threat for widespread heavy snows as further
enhanced in favored terrain. Expect temperatures to range as much
as 10-20 degrees below normal.

Upper system ejections channeled between amplified eastern Pacific
upper ridging/upper troughing over the West and amplified
east-central U.S. upper ridging as part of the aforementioned
Omega-style block over the lower 48 and adjoining oceans will trap
a slow moving and wavy frontal zone over the north-central U.S. to
support an emerging but uncertain convection/rainfall pattern.
This offers a runoff threat given moist ambient Northern Plains
soil conditions. The Storm Prediction Center also highlights a
concern for severe weather into the eastern Central Plains for at
least Sunday and Monday. The pattern meanwhile favors record high
temperatures over the south-central U.S., with pre-frontal warmth
gradually building northeastward next week through the MS/TN
Valleys/Midwest under the upper ridge, in stark contrast to the
wintry conditions over the West and moderated/cooled high pressure
dammed airmass to linger over the East on the backside of a
difficult to dislodge western Atlantic circulation.

...On Thursday, heavy rain and severe thunderstorms will develop
over portions of the Southern Plains, Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley, and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys...

...On Friday, heavy rain and severe thunderstorms will develop
over portions of the Central/Southern Appalachians, Central Gulf
Coast/Southeast, and Eastern Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic...

On Thursday, low pressure over the Central/Southern Plains will
move eastward to the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic by Saturday. The
associated boundary aids in destabilizing the atmosphere producing
showers and thunderstorms over parts of the South-Central portion
of the country. Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains,
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley, and Tennessee Valley through
Friday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes.

In addition, heavy rain will be associated with these
thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Central/Southern Plains,
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley, and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys
through Friday morning. The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams being the most vulnerable.

The severe thunderstorm threat moves eastward to the Southeast and
Appalachians on Friday. As a result, the SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Central/Southern
Appalachians, Central Gulf Coast/Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic from
Friday through Saturday morning. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

However, the threat of excessive rainfall will continue over a
much small area over the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic. Therefore, the
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic from Friday through Saturday morning.
The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of
flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams being
the most vulnerable. Also, on Saturday, upper-level riding
building over the Central/Southern Plains aiding in producing high
temperatures that will be tied, near, or break records over the
region.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, upper-level energy and an associated front
will begin to move onshore over the Pacific Northwest, producing
light rain over the Northwest. The light rain will start to move
into Northern California by late Thursday morning and by late
Thursday afternoon, the rain will develop over parts of the
Northern Intermountain Region. Overnight Thursday, the rain will
change over to snow at the highest elevations. Light rain will
move into parts of the Northern High Plains and Northern Plains on
Friday, then into parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley by
Saturday. Additionally, the snow levels lower slightly over the
Northwest overnight Friday.

Furthermore, on Thursday, the SPC issued two areas of an Elevated
Risk of fire weather, one over the Southern Rockies and the second
over parts of the Great Basin. The fire weather threat is due to
gusty winds, dry fuels, and low relative humidity. There are no
fire weather threat areas over the lower forty-eight states on
Friday.

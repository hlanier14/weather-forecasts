...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR AREAS OF SOUTH-CENTRAL
NEW MEXICO INTO MUCH OF EASTERN COLORADO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST...THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...AND THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS....

Extremely critical strength winds are already being observed at
several observation sites across the southern and central High
Plains with some temperatures in the 80s already across eastern
Colorado. Widespread extremely critical conditions remain likely as
mixing deepens this afternoon and relative humidity drops further.
Expanded the Extremely Critical delineation slightly southwest
across New Mexico where sustained winds are forecast above 30 mph
and relative humidity in the single digits.

Trimmed the isolated dry thunderstorm area slightly east to where
storm initiation is expected. Western portions of the isolated dry
thunderstorm area may see limited lightning activity, but if any
storms do develop, fire starts could spread rapidly given the
extremely critical wind/RH. Given this threat, will keep the
isolated dry thunderstorm threat farther west despite the more
conditional threat.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Fri Apr 22 2022/

...Synopsis...
***DANGEROUS FIRE-WEATHER CONDITIONS EXPECTED TODAY ACROSS PORTIONS
OF EAST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO INTO EASTERN COLORADO***

A highly amplified large-scale trough and accompanying intense
deep-layer south-southwesterly flow will emerge over the southern
Rockies and adjacent High Plains by peak heating. As a result,
strong cyclogenesis will occur over far northeastern Colorado during
the afternoon, with a sharpening dryline extending southward along
the Kansas/Colorado border and the Texas/New Mexico border. The
combination of a strong surface pressure gradient, hot/dry
conditions behind the dryline, and strong south-southwesterly flow
aloft will result in extremely critical fire-weather conditions from
east-central New Mexico into eastern Colorado today.

...East-central New Mexico into eastern Colorado...
As temperatures climb into the upper 70s to middle 80s behind the
sharpening dryline, deep boundary-layer mixing into very dry air
aloft will result in widespread 5-15 percent minimum RH. At the same
time, 30-40 mph sustained south-southwesterly surface winds (with
widespread gusts of 50-60 mph) will overspread critically dry fuels
(ERCs above the 90th+ percentile). The volatile combination of very
strong/gusty winds, anomalously warm/dry conditions, and near-record
dry fuels will encourage extreme fire-weather conditions.

...Remainder of the central and southern High Plains...
The eastern extent of critical fire-weather conditions will be
demarcated by the placement of the dryline. Strong 30+ mph sustained
southerly surface winds (with higher gusts) concurrent with
afternoon RH values below 20% will extend into southern New Mexico,
West Texas, the western Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles, western Kansas,
and western Nebraska -- where fuels remain critically dry.

...Dry Thunderstorm Potential...
Another point of concern will be isolated dry thunderstorm
development immediately along and ahead of the dryline this
afternoon, which is expected to take place along the axis of the
driest fuels. Any cloud-to-ground lightning flashes that can occur
in proximity to the Colorado/Kansas and New Mexico/Texas border area
will do so over very receptive fuels, and likely with little wetting
rainfall at the early stages of thunderstorm evolution.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 22 2022

SYNOPSIS: There is good agreement across the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble means indicating mid-level low pressure over the northeastern lowe=
r
48
at the beginning of the period, supporting enhanced chances for much below
normal temperatures across parts of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Tennessee
Valley, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Appalachians. These ensemble means
generally indicate weak mid-level low pressure progressing eastward across =
the
northern half of the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) throughout week-2, which is
relatively different compared to yesterday's models favoring more mid-level
high pressure across the region. This pattern favors increasing chances for
much below normal temperatures shifting across the country during the perio=
d.
Forecast positive mid-level height departures across the south-central CONU=
S
at
the beginning of the period support much above normal temperatures across t=
he
Central and Southern Plains which could exacerbate ongoing drought conditio=
ns
and enhance wildfire risk. Mid-level high pressure across parts of the
Mainland
of Alaska could support anomalously warm temperatures across the western
Mainland.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across portions of the Ohio
Valley, Central and Southern Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, Sat, Apr 30.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across portions of the Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and
Appalachians, Sat-Sun, Apr 30-May 1.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures shifting eastward from the We=
st
to the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Central Appalachians, Sat-Fri, Apr 30-=
May
6.

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures across parts of the Central a=
nd
Southern Plains, Sat-Sun, Apr 30-May 1.

Slight risk of high winds across portions of the Central and Southern Plain=
s,
Sat-Sun, Apr 30-May 1.

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures across portions of western
Mainland Alaska, Sat-Mon, Apr 30-May 2.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 30 - FRIDAY MAY 06: There continues to be good multi-mod=
el
depiction of mid-level troughing over the northeastern CONUS at the beginni=
ng
of the period supporting anomalously cold temperatures across the region. A
slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for portions of the
Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and
Appalachians, Apr 30 to May 1. A moderate risk continues to be posted acros=
s
parts of the Ohio Valley, Central and Southern Appalachians, and Mid-Atlant=
ic,
Apr 30. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance =
of
minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and 40 Deg F
(supporting potential frost) in the highlighted risk area. Potential for mu=
ch
below normal temperatures significantly diminish across this region by the
middle of the period as this trough weakens, but may return toward the end =
of
the period.



Multiple model ensemble means have shifted its pattern from mid-level ridgi=
ng
across the north-central CONUS to weak mid-level troughing shifting eastwar=
d
across the northern half of the lower 48 during Week-2, supporting enhanced
chances for anomalously cold temperatures shifting across the country durin=
g
the period. A broad area of slight risk of much below normal temperatures i=
s
highlighted across the northern half of the CONUS indicating the eastward
shift
of this risk throughout week-2. Across the posted risk area, the GEFS and
ECMWF
reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling=
 to
the lowest 15th percentile and 40 Deg F. This enhanced anomalous cold
potential
can also be seen in today's CPC 8-14 day mean temperature outlook, which
favors
higher probabilities of below normal temperatures across the northern half =
of
the CONUS compared to yesterday's outlook.



Multiple models show the possibility of a surface low forming over the Cent=
ral
and Southern Plains and associated frontal activity. This pattern supports =
a
slight risk of episodes of high winds across parts of the Central and South=
ern
Plains, Apr 30 to May 1. The highlighted risk area is primarily based on th=
e
ECMWF reforecast tool which indicates at least a 20% chance of wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph, as well as the 6Z deterministic G=
FS
showing wind speeds exceeding these values. This disturbance combined with
possible strong onshore flow from the Gulf of Mexico may also elevate chanc=
es
for some episodes of heavy rainfall toward the middle of the period. The
uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble and ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a =
20
percent chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding 1-inch for parts of =
the
Central and Southern Plains and Lower and Middle Mississippi Valley during =
the
10 to 12 day period (May 2 to May 4). Due to poor model agreement with the
GEFS, a related heavy rainfall hazard is not designated at this time.



There continues to be good model agreement indicating positive mid-level
height
departures across the south-central CONUS at the beginning of the period. T=
he
slight risk of much above normal temperatures is maintained for parts of th=
e
Central and Southern Plains, Apr 30 to May 1, where the reforecast tools sh=
ow
at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile
and
90 Deg F (95 Deg F in Texas). Despite the actual temperatures not potential=
ly
posing a health hazard, of greatest concern is the possibility of exacerbat=
ing
ongoing drought conditions and enhanced wildfire risk associated with
increased
likelihood of high winds. The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) is
predicting a moderate risk of significant fire potential at the end of week=
-1
across parts of the highlighted risk area.



Mid-level ridging continues to be anticipated across much of mainland Alask=
a
excluding the Aleutians, with decreasing model agreement by the middle of
week-2. Due to good consistency with yesterday's model guidance, a slight r=
isk
of much above normal temperatures continues to be posted for western Mainla=
nd
Alaska Apr 30 to May 2, but is slightly shifted south based on reforecast
tools
and recent deterministic model guidance of surface temperature anomalies. T=
he
GEFS reforecast tool and uncalibrated ensemble mean continues to extend the
signal for much above normal temperatures further inland, extending into
portions of inland Mainland Alaska. However, the ECMWF reforecast tool and
other mean temperature guidance tools do not support this feature, precludi=
ng
this risk from including the interior Mainland. Any warmup, however, could
increase snowmelt across interior Mainland Alaska, resulting in elevating
flooding concerns especially given the high snow water equivalent values.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Fri Apr 22 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 25 2022 - 12Z Fri Apr 29 2022

...Overview...

As upper/surface lows track into south-central Canada as the
medium range period begins Monday, the trailing cold front should
sweep across the south-central to eastern U.S. and provide a focus
for rain and thunderstorms. Upper troughing over the Midwest/Great
Lakes should shift eastward as next week progresses and likely
form an upper low over/near the Northeast later in the week,
promoting a shift from warmer to cooler than average temperatures
and keeping some precipitation over New England. Meanwhile model
guidance supports mean troughing from the eastern Pacific into the
western U.S., likely with an embedded upper low, leading to
potential for rounds of precipitation in the Northwest.
Sufficiently strong upper troughing may move into the West by next
Friday to enhance precipitation over the northern Rockies/Plains.
Expect broad upper ridging between the two troughs, leading to
warm temperatures across the Southwest to southern/central High
Plains.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Over recent days the greatest spread and run-to-run variability
have been with the overall mean trough over the eastern Pacific
and western U.S. Some important details remain unresolved but at
least there are common themes emerging. One shortwave reaching the
Northwest around Tuesday should continue onward into southern
Canada, possibly forming a compact upper low, as it tracks around
the northern periphery of the central U.S. mean ridge. The 00Z CMC
was farthest south with this energy (adjusting toward consensus in
the 12Z run) while otherwise there is still meaningful timing
spread with the ensemble means generally on the slow side versus
the operational models. Another shortwave dropping into the mean
trough should reach near the West Coast by Thursday, with the full
trough including the upper low to the north progressing inland
through Friday. The majority cluster through the 06Z cycle
consisted of the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF and CMC along with the ensemble
means. The new 12Z GFS has strayed to the faster side while the
00Z GFS tracked its upper low on the south side of the spread late
Thursday-early Friday while the 00Z ECMWF could be a tad on the
amplified with the trough. There is also suggestion of a weak
shortwave reaching the Southwest around Wednesday but it should
have at most modest effect and shear out as it heads downstream
into the mean ridge.

Meanwhile guidance maintains better than average agreement for the
idea that energy just west of leading low pressure/upper low over
Ontario will form an upper low that should cross New England
around late Wednesday-Thursday and may still linger close to the
region through Friday. There is still some debate over exactly
when the upper low will form (depending in part on what height
contour interval is used) and the timing/track into Friday. The
00Z ECMWF is slightly slow around late Wednesday while the 06Z/12Z
GFS stray to the northern side of the spread by Friday.

The revised forecast incorporated the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GFS, and 00Z
UKMET/CMC (in order of more to less weight) for about the first
half of the period and then added some of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF
means by days 6-7 Thursday-Friday. The blend also split GFS input
between the 06Z and 00Z runs late in the period due to differing
preferences for the New England upper low and western U.S. trough.
This approach yielded minimal changes in continuity.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The cold front trailing from the low moving across Canada early in
the workweek will intersect with warm/moist air from the Gulf and
lead to widespread rain along the front stretching from the Great
Lakes to Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and into the southern Plains
Monday, shifting to the Eastern Seaboard Tuesday. While greater
potential for excessive rainfall has phased into the short range
period, some high rain rates with unstable conditions could extend
into Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday and cause
localized flash flooding. Neutral to wet soils may lower the
threshold for runoff issues over the Lower Mississippi Valley
while it is worth monitoring the potential for this activity to
overcome the drier ground conditions over Texas. Elsewhere, the
front should accelerate and lead to lighter overall rainfall
amounts over the eastern U.S. Monday-Tuesday. Then as the
Northeast upper low develops midweek and surface low pressure
pivots over the region, precipitation is forecast to linger
especially across New England, with some potential for higher
elevations to receive snow. How much precipitation falls will be
sensitive to exact system details. Meanwhile in the West,
unsettled weather is likely as shortwave energy moves through the
mean trough south of a closed upper low positioned off British
Columbia through Thursday. Guidance is starting to resolve a
better defined episode of rain and high elevation snow in the
early-mid part of the week with a leading shortwave (with lower
confidence for a second feature) followed by another later in the
week with a separate shortwave and then inland progression of the
overall trough/upper low by Friday. At that time the combination
of upper trough dynamics and developing northerly/easterly low
level upslope flow could lead to areas of heavier precipitation
over the northern Rockies/Plains. Specifics will take time to
resolve. Currently it appears that the higher elevations of the
northern Rockies would see some snow with this event while precip
type farther east will be sensitive to system details. Meanwhile a
frontal boundary draped over the central Plains may help to focus
some rainfall as far southeast as the Mid Mississippi Valley late
in the week.

Warmer than normal conditions for the eastern third of the U.S.
Monday-Tuesday will switch to below normal behind the cold frontal
passage. The core of that cold air is likely to keep temperatures
15-30F below normal in the Dakotas and Upper Midwest early in the
week (with a few record lows possible) and extend 10-20F below
normal readings through the Great Lakes/Central Appalachians
during Tuesday-Thursday. These temperatures should moderate
somewhat late next week. Farther west, upper ridging migrating
from the Southwest into the central U.S. will spread warmer than
average temperatures from the Southwest (with some record highs
possible in southern California Monday) into the Four Corners
states and into southern/central parts of the Plains. The High
Plains may see temperatures around 15-20F above normal mid-late
week. The Northwest will see a gradual cooling trend during the
period and slightly below normal highs should extend into
California and the Great Basin by late next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri April 22 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 28 - MAY 02, 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in decent agreement i=
n depicting above normal
500-hPa heights across most of North America during the next 6-10 days.
However, there is some uncertainty in the mean height fields over Alaska an=
d
parts of the western CONUS. Mid-level troughing is favored west of Alaska,
with
ridging favored over much of the Mainland. Mean mid-level troughs and
below-normal 500-hPa heights are favored along the Eastern Seaboard and ove=
r
the northwestern CONUS. Conversely, mean mid-level ridging and near to
above-normal heights are predicted across much of the central lower 48.

Above normal temperatures are favored for much of Alaska, associated with m=
ean
southerly flow ahead of a mean mid-level trough farther west. Enhanced
probabilities of below-normal temperatures are predicted across the West Co=
ast
and Northern Tier, associated with predominantly below-normal mid-level
heights
over the northwestern CONUS and a more suppressed ridge over the central
CONUS,
relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 6-10 day outlook. Enhance=
d below-normal temperature
probabilities are also favored across the eastern third of the lower 48,
behind
mean mid-level troughing centered off the Eastern Seaboard. Above-normal
temperatures are strongly favored across the south-central CONUS, associate=
d
with positive mid-level height anomalies and mean southerly flow.

Increased odds of above-normal precipitation are favored across western
Mainland Alaska, ahead of a mean mid-level trough. Below-normal precipitati=
on
is favored farther eastward across southeastern Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle, associated with weak synoptic forcing. Above-normal precipitatio=
n
odds are enhanced across the Northern Tier of the CONUS from the interior
Pacific Northwest to the Upper Mississippi Valley, associated with mean
troughing over the West Coast and the potential for low pressure systems to
ride up and over a predicted mean ridge in the central CONUS. Enhanced
probabilities of below-normal precipitation are favored across the Four
Corners, as troughing is not expected to dig far enough south. Below-normal
precipitation is also favored along the Gulf Coast and across much of the
eastern CONUS, behind the predicted mean trough centered east of the Atlant=
ic
Coast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
decent
model agreement, offset by increasing uncertainty in the temperature and
precipitation fields over Alaska, the southeastern CONUS, and the Four
Corners.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 30 - MAY 06, 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in general agreement =
with respect to the
predicted
mean 500-hPa height pattern across northern and eastern North America.
However,
there is increased uncertainty across remaining areas of the forecast domai=
n,
particularly over the western CONUS and eastern Alaska. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs predicted
mean
500-hPa height pattern is more zonal, relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDs week-2
outlook,
but maintains day-to-day continuity with a continued de-amplification of th=
e
mean mid-level flow pattern.

Mean southerly flow ahead of a predicted mid-level trough over the Bering S=
ea
favors above-normal temperatures across western Alaska. Over the CONUS, wea=
k
troughing over the Northeast Pacific and a de-amplified ridge over the Cent=
ral
and Southern CONUS favors below-normal temperature odds across the West Coa=
st,
extending eastward to the Central and Northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
Across
the eastern third of the CONUS, mean northerly flow upstream of strong
mid-level troughing over the western Atlantic favors enhanced odds of
below-normal temperatures, particularly for parts of the Upper Midwest and
Great Lakes. Above-normal temperature odds are indicated across much of the
southern CONUS, associated with a predicted suppressed mid-level ridge.

Mean southerly flow tilts odds toward above-normal precipitation over
southwestern Alaska and the eastern Aleutians. Above-normal precipitation i=
s
indicated from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley, ahead of a mean mid-level trough favored over the weste=
rn
CONUS. Odds tilt toward above-normal precipitation across much of the centr=
al
CONUS extending eastward into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, as the
progressive pattern favors a series of fast-moving low pressure systems to
move
eastward from the Plains to the East Coast during week-2. Below-normal
precipitation is favored across the southwestern CONUS, due to weak positiv=
e
mid-level height anomalies. Odds tilt toward below-normal precipitation acr=
oss
the Florida Peninsula, as trailing frontal boundaries associated with rapid=
ly
progressing low pressure systems are not expected to make it far enough sou=
th.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a very progressive and zonal mid-level height pattern, resulting in weak
probabilities in the precipitation fields and increased uncertainty in the
temperature fields.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

...Significant winter storm to impact portions of the Rockies and
Northern Plains into Sunday...

...Severe thunderstorms expected over the Great Plains tonight and
from the Upper Midwest to the Southern Plains on Saturday...

...Scattered instances of flash flooding across portions of the
Great Plains and Mississippi Valley through Sunday...

...Damaging wind gusts and very dangerous fire-weather conditions
are forecast throughout the Central/Southern High Plains and
Southern Rockies this weekend...

Troughing in the Rockies and Plains will bring unsettled weather
to the central part of the country over the next few days. An area
of surface low pressure will deepen over the foothills of the
Rockies and develop into a powerful dynamic mid-latitude cyclone
tonight. Out ahead of this system, moderate to heavy rain showers
and thunderstorms will proliferate across the Northern Plains and
Upper Midwest while scattered showers and thunderstorms, some
severe, initiate along a well defined cold front extending down
the spine of the Great Plains tonight. Severe thunderstorms may
produce large hail, damaging straight-line winds and a few
tornadoes. Areas of heavy rainfall capable of producing flash
flooding may develop over portions of eastern North Dakota and
western Minnesota as well as southeastern Iowa tonight, where
Slight Risks of excessive rainfall are in effect. The leading cold
front will continue to be the focus for showers and thunderstorms
as it moves into the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley and Southern
Plains on Saturday. The Storm Prediction Center issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms for these areas which include the
chance for tornadoes, strong wind gusts and hail. This cold front
is expected to slow down a bit as it moves into the Midwest on
Saturday night. This will open the door for a long duration rain
event to develop across portions of the Southern Plains and
Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley through Monday morning. A Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall leading to flash flooding is in effect
for the aforementioned regions on Sunday as a result.

Within the cold sector of this dynamic system, a significant late
season winter storm will produce heavy wet snow and strong winds
from the Rockies through portions of the Northern Plains into
Sunday. A combination of heavy snow and strong winds will produce
blizzard conditions across portions of the Northern Plains
starting tonight. Travel will be very difficult to impossible.
Power outages and tree damage are expected. Significant impacts to
livestock are also possible. Prepare now for impactful winter
weather and delayed travel. Between 6-12 inches of snow are
expected for much of the impacted portions of the Rockies, while
12-18 inches are likely over much of the Montana/Dakota border
region as well as much of northeastern Wyoming by Sunday. Portions
of north-central Wyoming, such as the Bighorn, will likely see
snow amounts exceeding 2 feet. Blizzard Warnings have been issued
for much eastern Montana, western North Dakota, northeastern
Wyoming and northwestern South Dakota.

To the south of this system, very dry, warm and windy conditions
will combine to produce extremely critical fire conditions across
western portions of the Central/Southern Plains as well as the
Southwest tonight. Isolated dryline thunderstorms may provide the
spark for wildfires over parts of eastern Colorado/northeastern
New Mexico and western Kansas/far northwestern Texas. High Wind
Watches and Warnings are in effect for much of the Central
Southern Plains and Southwest. A Critical Risk of fire weather
remains in place over parts of eastern New Mexico, the Texas
panhandle and western Oklahoma on Saturday due to continued warm,
dry and windy conditions. Warm air will spread eastward out ahead
of the Rockies/Plains system. A nice warm weekend is in store for
much of the eastern third of the country beneath an area of high
pressure. Cold air filters into the central U.S. on the backside
of the winter storm. High temperatures will be 20-30 degrees below
average for much of the Northern Plains this weekend. A building
ridge in the West will allow for temperatures to rebound beginning
Saturday.

342 PM EDT Fri Apr 22 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 25 2022 - 12Z Fri Apr 29 2022

...Overview...

As upper/surface lows track into south-central Canada as the
medium range period begins Monday, the trailing cold front should
sweep across the south-central to eastern U.S. and provide a focus
for rain and thunderstorms. Upper troughing over the Midwest/Great
Lakes should shift eastward as next week progresses and likely
form an upper low over/near the Northeast later in the week,
promoting a shift from warmer to cooler than average temperatures
and keeping some precipitation over New England. Meanwhile model
guidance supports mean troughing from the eastern Pacific into the
western U.S., likely with an embedded upper low, leading to
potential for rounds of precipitation in the Northwest.
Sufficiently strong upper troughing may move into the West by next
Friday to enhance precipitation over the northern Rockies/Plains.
Expect broad upper ridging between the two troughs, leading to
warm temperatures across the Southwest to southern/central High
Plains.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Over recent days the greatest spread and run-to-run variability
have been with the overall mean trough over the eastern Pacific
and western U.S. Some important details remain unresolved but at
least there are common themes emerging. One shortwave reaching the
Northwest around Tuesday should continue onward into southern
Canada, possibly forming a compact upper low, as it tracks around
the northern periphery of the central U.S. mean ridge. The 00Z CMC
was farthest south with this energy (adjusting toward consensus in
the 12Z run) while otherwise there is still meaningful timing
spread with the ensemble means generally on the slow side versus
the operational models. Another shortwave dropping into the mean
trough should reach near the West Coast by Thursday, with the full
trough including the upper low to the north progressing inland
through Friday. The majority cluster through the 06Z cycle
consisted of the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF and CMC along with the ensemble
means. The new 12Z GFS has strayed to the faster side while the
00Z GFS tracked its upper low on the south side of the spread late
Thursday-early Friday while the 00Z ECMWF could be a tad on the
amplified with the trough. There is also suggestion of a weak
shortwave reaching the Southwest around Wednesday but it should
have at most modest effect and shear out as it heads downstream
into the mean ridge.

Meanwhile guidance maintains better than average agreement for the
idea that energy just west of leading low pressure/upper low over
Ontario will form an upper low that should cross New England
around late Wednesday-Thursday and may still linger close to the
region through Friday. There is still some debate over exactly
when the upper low will form (depending in part on what height
contour interval is used) and the timing/track into Friday. The
00Z ECMWF is slightly slow around late Wednesday while the 06Z/12Z
GFS stray to the northern side of the spread by Friday.

The revised forecast incorporated the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GFS, and 00Z
UKMET/CMC (in order of more to less weight) for about the first
half of the period and then added some of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF
means by days 6-7 Thursday-Friday. The blend also split GFS input
between the 06Z and 00Z runs late in the period due to differing
preferences for the New England upper low and western U.S. trough.
This approach yielded minimal changes in continuity.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The cold front trailing from the low moving across Canada early in
the workweek will intersect with warm/moist air from the Gulf and
lead to widespread rain along the front stretching from the Great
Lakes to Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and into the southern Plains
Monday, shifting to the Eastern Seaboard Tuesday. While greater
potential for excessive rainfall has phased into the short range
period, some high rain rates with unstable conditions could extend
into Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday and cause
localized flash flooding. Neutral to wet soils may lower the
threshold for runoff issues over the Lower Mississippi Valley
while it is worth monitoring the potential for this activity to
overcome the drier ground conditions over Texas. Elsewhere, the
front should accelerate and lead to lighter overall rainfall
amounts over the eastern U.S. Monday-Tuesday. Then as the
Northeast upper low develops midweek and surface low pressure
pivots over the region, precipitation is forecast to linger
especially across New England, with some potential for higher
elevations to receive snow. How much precipitation falls will be
sensitive to exact system details. Meanwhile in the West,
unsettled weather is likely as shortwave energy moves through the
mean trough south of a closed upper low positioned off British
Columbia through Thursday. Guidance is starting to resolve a
better defined episode of rain and high elevation snow in the
early-mid part of the week with a leading shortwave (with lower
confidence for a second feature) followed by another later in the
week with a separate shortwave and then inland progression of the
overall trough/upper low by Friday. At that time the combination
of upper trough dynamics and developing northerly/easterly low
level upslope flow could lead to areas of heavier precipitation
over the northern Rockies/Plains. Specifics will take time to
resolve. Currently it appears that the higher elevations of the
northern Rockies would see some snow with this event while precip
type farther east will be sensitive to system details. Meanwhile a
frontal boundary draped over the central Plains may help to focus
some rainfall as far southeast as the Mid Mississippi Valley late
in the week.

Warmer than normal conditions for the eastern third of the U.S.
Monday-Tuesday will switch to below normal behind the cold frontal
passage. The core of that cold air is likely to keep temperatures
15-30F below normal in the Dakotas and Upper Midwest early in the
week (with a few record lows possible) and extend 10-20F below
normal readings through the Great Lakes/Central Appalachians
during Tuesday-Thursday. These temperatures should moderate
somewhat late next week. Farther west, upper ridging migrating
from the Southwest into the central U.S. will spread warmer than
average temperatures from the Southwest (with some record highs
possible in southern California Monday) into the Four Corners
states and into southern/central parts of the Plains. The High
Plains may see temperatures around 15-20F above normal mid-late
week. The Northwest will see a gradual cooling trend during the
period and slightly below normal highs should extend into
California and the Great Basin by late next week.

342 PM EDT Fri Apr 22 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 25 2022 - 12Z Fri Apr 29 2022

...Overview...

As upper/surface lows track into south-central Canada as the
medium range period begins Monday, the trailing cold front should
sweep across the south-central to eastern U.S. and provide a focus
for rain and thunderstorms. Upper troughing over the Midwest/Great
Lakes should shift eastward as next week progresses and likely
form an upper low over/near the Northeast later in the week,
promoting a shift from warmer to cooler than average temperatures
and keeping some precipitation over New England. Meanwhile model
guidance supports mean troughing from the eastern Pacific into the
western U.S., likely with an embedded upper low, leading to
potential for rounds of precipitation in the Northwest.
Sufficiently strong upper troughing may move into the West by next
Friday to enhance precipitation over the northern Rockies/Plains.
Expect broad upper ridging between the two troughs, leading to
warm temperatures across the Southwest to southern/central High
Plains.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Over recent days the greatest spread and run-to-run variability
have been with the overall mean trough over the eastern Pacific
and western U.S. Some important details remain unresolved but at
least there are common themes emerging. One shortwave reaching the
Northwest around Tuesday should continue onward into southern
Canada, possibly forming a compact upper low, as it tracks around
the northern periphery of the central U.S. mean ridge. The 00Z CMC
was farthest south with this energy (adjusting toward consensus in
the 12Z run) while otherwise there is still meaningful timing
spread with the ensemble means generally on the slow side versus
the operational models. Another shortwave dropping into the mean
trough should reach near the West Coast by Thursday, with the full
trough including the upper low to the north progressing inland
through Friday. The majority cluster through the 06Z cycle
consisted of the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF and CMC along with the ensemble
means. The new 12Z GFS has strayed to the faster side while the
00Z GFS tracked its upper low on the south side of the spread late
Thursday-early Friday while the 00Z ECMWF could be a tad on the
amplified with the trough. There is also suggestion of a weak
shortwave reaching the Southwest around Wednesday but it should
have at most modest effect and shear out as it heads downstream
into the mean ridge.

Meanwhile guidance maintains better than average agreement for the
idea that energy just west of leading low pressure/upper low over
Ontario will form an upper low that should cross New England
around late Wednesday-Thursday and may still linger close to the
region through Friday. There is still some debate over exactly
when the upper low will form (depending in part on what height
contour interval is used) and the timing/track into Friday. The
00Z ECMWF is slightly slow around late Wednesday while the 06Z/12Z
GFS stray to the northern side of the spread by Friday.

The revised forecast incorporated the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GFS, and 00Z
UKMET/CMC (in order of more to less weight) for about the first
half of the period and then added some of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF
means by days 6-7 Thursday-Friday. The blend also split GFS input
between the 06Z and 00Z runs late in the period due to differing
preferences for the New England upper low and western U.S. trough.
This approach yielded minimal changes in continuity.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The cold front trailing from the low moving across Canada early in
the workweek will intersect with warm/moist air from the Gulf and
lead to widespread rain along the front stretching from the Great
Lakes to Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and into the southern Plains
Monday, shifting to the Eastern Seaboard Tuesday. While greater
potential for excessive rainfall has phased into the short range
period, some high rain rates with unstable conditions could extend
into Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday and cause
localized flash flooding. Neutral to wet soils may lower the
threshold for runoff issues over the Lower Mississippi Valley
while it is worth monitoring the potential for this activity to
overcome the drier ground conditions over Texas. Elsewhere, the
front should accelerate and lead to lighter overall rainfall
amounts over the eastern U.S. Monday-Tuesday. Then as the
Northeast upper low develops midweek and surface low pressure
pivots over the region, precipitation is forecast to linger
especially across New England, with some potential for higher
elevations to receive snow. How much precipitation falls will be
sensitive to exact system details. Meanwhile in the West,
unsettled weather is likely as shortwave energy moves through the
mean trough south of a closed upper low positioned off British
Columbia through Thursday. Guidance is starting to resolve a
better defined episode of rain and high elevation snow in the
early-mid part of the week with a leading shortwave (with lower
confidence for a second feature) followed by another later in the
week with a separate shortwave and then inland progression of the
overall trough/upper low by Friday. At that time the combination
of upper trough dynamics and developing northerly/easterly low
level upslope flow could lead to areas of heavier precipitation
over the northern Rockies/Plains. Specifics will take time to
resolve. Currently it appears that the higher elevations of the
northern Rockies would see some snow with this event while precip
type farther east will be sensitive to system details. Meanwhile a
frontal boundary draped over the central Plains may help to focus
some rainfall as far southeast as the Mid Mississippi Valley late
in the week.

Warmer than normal conditions for the eastern third of the U.S.
Monday-Tuesday will switch to below normal behind the cold frontal
passage. The core of that cold air is likely to keep temperatures
15-30F below normal in the Dakotas and Upper Midwest early in the
week (with a few record lows possible) and extend 10-20F below
normal readings through the Great Lakes/Central Appalachians
during Tuesday-Thursday. These temperatures should moderate
somewhat late next week. Farther west, upper ridging migrating
from the Southwest into the central U.S. will spread warmer than
average temperatures from the Southwest (with some record highs
possible in southern California Monday) into the Four Corners
states and into southern/central parts of the Plains. The High
Plains may see temperatures around 15-20F above normal mid-late
week. The Northwest will see a gradual cooling trend during the
period and slightly below normal highs should extend into
California and the Great Basin by late next week.

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN PLAINS...

Expanded the Elevated area northeastward into eastern Nebraska, far
southeast South Dakota, far southwest Minnesota, and far northwest
Iowa. There will be a narrow region between the dryline and synoptic
front where warm, dry and windy conditions are expected beneath the
mid-level jet streak. The HRRR and RAP suggest these conditions may
continue even farther north, but fuels are less susceptible in this
region and the duration of these conditions should be less. Despite
the less receptive fuels, it is worth monitoring closely as
meteorological conditions may reach extremely critical for at least
an hour or two. Additionally, any fires which do develop in this
region will encounter a wind shift during the late afternoon/evening
as the front moves through.

Also expanded the Critical farther northeast across Kansas in this
same axis of strong winds and low relative humidity.

..Bentley.. 04/22/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0203 AM CDT Fri Apr 22 2022/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level low is forecast to develop and deepen over the
Dakotas on Saturday with enhanced mid-/low-level flow stretching
from Minnesota southwestward to West Texas.  At the surface, a
strong low pressure system will slowly drift to the north-northeast
across the Dakotas with an extensive cold front/dryline extending
southward bisecting the Plains.

...Portions of the central/southern Plains
The surface cyclone and associated dryline responsible for the
significant wildfire-spread concerns on Friday will drift eastward
on Saturday. By Saturday afternoon, the dryline is expected to mix
east to the I-35 corridor in central Kansas and Oklahoma. Widespread
20+ mph sustained winds concurrent with RH values of 15 percent are
expected to ensue in the post-dryline environment for at least a few
hours Saturday afternoon, from New Mexico into western Kansas and
Oklahoma. As a result, critical fire weather conditions are likely
across the region where dry and windy conditions will overlap dry
fuels.  Adjustments may be made in future updates if appreciable
rainfall occurs on Friday to temper fire-weather concerns for some
locations.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0103 AM CDT Sat Apr 23 2022

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A deep-layer trough positioned over central/northern Rockies and
central/northern High Plains will shift east throughout the day into
portions of northern Great Plains. A strong 80-100 kt mid-level jet
positioned along the southeastern flank of the trough will parallel
the aforementioned progression, with the core of the jet moving from
the central Plains into the Great Lakes region. At the surface, a
dry line will shift east into the southern/central Plains throughout
the afternoon and early evening.

...Central/Southern Plains...
Diurnal heating and associated boundary layer mixing of strong
mid-level flow west of the dry line (mainly across the southern
Plains) will result in strong westerly/southwesterly sustained
surface winds of 20-30 mph, gusting to 35-40+ mph, amid RH values
into the teens. These conditions will promote several hours of
critical fire-weather conditions amid dry/receptive fuels.

Farther north, most guidance suggests the dry line will extend
northeast along a narrow corridor from portions of central Kansas
into eastern Nebraska and possibly as far as southeast South Dakota
and northwest Iowa, situated between an advancing cold front to the
west and a warm/moist airmass to the east. This would result in a
few hours of elevated to near critical fire-weather conditions amid
fuels that remain conducive to large-fire spread. Given uncertainty
in the coverage/intensity of the eastward dry line protrusion and
coverage of overnight/morning wetting rain potential, the previous
elevated/critical delineations have been maintained and will be
subject to refinements in the next outlook update.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0105 AM CDT Sat Apr 23 2022

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A deep-layer trough over the central CONUS will continue lifting
northeast into the Great Lakes region and into south-central Canada.
Meanwhile, a mid-level ridge will build across the central/northern
Rockies. Mid-level flow between these features should remain quite
marginal, perhaps approaching 40-50 kt. At the surface, a cold front
will weaken and become somewhat diffuse across portions of the
southern/central Plains, while a residual dry airmass remains over
much of the southern High Plains and Southwest. Given the lack of
appreciable flow aloft, and cooler temperatures associated with the
post-frontal airmass, fire-weather concerns should remain low across
the region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
305 AM EDT Sat Apr 23 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Apr 26 2022 - 12Z Sat Apr 30 2022

...Overview...

An upper trough is forecast to track from the Midwest eastward and
develop an embedded upper low spinning over the Northeast for the
latter part of the week. This will initially push a cold front
with rainfall along it across the Eastern Seaboard Tuesday, then
strengthening surface low pressure could promote lingering
precipitation in the Northeast as the week progresses. Meanwhile,
mean troughing is likely in the West with multiple shortwaves
tracking through causing rounds of precipitation, while ridging in
between will promote warm temperatures across the Southwest to
southern/central High Plains.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance has remained consistent with better than average
agreement for the eastern trough developing into an upper low.
There is still some variability in the timing of the upper low
forming (depending in part on what height contour interval is
used), with the 12Z ECMWF on the slower side to develop it but the
00Z EC showing its development more in line with other guidance.
Models also continue to show a strengthening surface low Wednesday
into Thursday near New England, with good clustering in position
for a medium range forecast. By Friday into Saturday, there is
some uncertainty with the timing of the upper low lifting out
northeastward, with GFS runs faster while the CMC runs appeared
slow initially, but the 00Z ECMWF clusters with it. The latter
cluster is slower than the ensemble means at this point though.

Greater model differences are seen with the pattern over the West
despite general agreement initially for troughing stemming from an
upper low centered near British Columbia. One uncertain shortwave
reaching the Northwest around Tuesday should continue onward into
southern Canada, possibly forming a compact upper low, as it
tracks around the northern periphery of the central U.S. mean
ridge. The exact timing/track have varied a fair amount from run
to run and model to model. There is also some suggestion of a weak
shortwave reaching the Southwest around Wednesday but it should
have at most modest effect and shear out as it heads downstream
into the mean ridge. By Thursday, another shortwave is likely to
drop into the West Coast while the bulk of guidance favors the
trough axis shifting eastward by Friday-Saturday. There has been a
general trend in recent guidance towards less of a persistent and
strong upper low within the trough, though considering the
uncertain Pacific origins of the associated shortwaves, confidence
is low. At this point, the main outlier with the pattern appears
to be the CMC runs, especially the 00Z, which shows stronger
energy in the East Pacific around Friday that causes the trough to
slow down considerably compared to other guidance that shows
troughing moving into the north-central U.S. on Saturday. At least
model agreement remains fairly good for upper ridging in between
the West and East trough/low features.

The WPC forecast utilized a multi-model 12/18Z deterministic blend
early in the forecast period, phasing out the CMC and UKMET in
favor of the pretty agreeable ensemble means as the period
progressed. This approach yielded minimal changes in continuity.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The cold front moving across the Eastern Seaboard Tuesday as the
period begins will promote rain and possibly thunderstorms along
it, but its reasonably fast progression should keep rainfall
amounts in the light to moderate range. Then as surface low
pressure consolidates and pivots, precipitation will remain in the
forecast across the Northeast through the end of the workweek.
There is some potential for higher elevations of New England to
receive snow with this precipitation activity. How much
precipitation falls will be sensitive to exact system details.
Meanwhile in the West, unsettled weather is likely as shortwave
energy moves through the mean trough south of a closed upper low
positioned off British Columbia through Thursday. Guidance has
persisted in showing a better defined episode of rain and high
elevation snow in the early-mid part of the week with a leading
shortwave followed by another later in the week with a separate
shortwave and then inland progression of the overall trough by
Friday. Heavier precipitation is likely with the latter shortwave,
which should be in the form of snow over the northern Rockies, and
there is once again some potential for the northern High Plains to
see snow by the latter part of next week, though precipitation
type in the lower elevations will be quite sensitive to system
details. Meanwhile a frontal boundary draped over the central
Plains may help to focus some rainfall as far southeast as the Mid
Mississippi Valley late in the week.

The core of post-frontal cold air is forecast in the
Dakotas/Midwest on Tuesday and spreading into the Great Lakes
region by Wednesday-Thursday, with temperatures 10-25F below
average. As the cold front sweeps across the East, temperatures
will transition from warmer than normal on Tuesday to below normal
midweek, though with some temperature moderation. The Northwest
should see near to slightly below average temperatures, but by
late week temperatures in the northern Rockies/Plains may become
much below normal especially in terms of highs with the
possibility of more potent troughing aloft. Meanwhile farther
south, ridging in place will spread warmer than normal
temperatures from the Southwest/Four Corners states into northern
and central parts of the Plains, with temperatures in the 90s in
many areas.

Valid 12Z Tue Apr 26 2022 - 12Z Sat Apr 30 2022

...Overview...

An upper trough is forecast to track from the Midwest eastward and
develop an embedded upper low spinning over the Northeast for the
latter part of the week. This will initially push a cold front
with rainfall along it across the Eastern Seaboard Tuesday, then
strengthening surface low pressure could promote lingering
precipitation in the Northeast as the week progresses. Meanwhile,
mean troughing is likely in the West with multiple shortwaves
tracking through causing rounds of precipitation, while ridging in
between will promote warm temperatures across the Southwest to
southern/central High Plains.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance has remained consistent with better than average
agreement for the eastern trough developing into an upper low.
There is still some variability in the timing of the upper low
forming (depending in part on what height contour interval is
used), with the 12Z ECMWF on the slower side to develop it but the
00Z EC showing its development more in line with other guidance.
Models also continue to show a strengthening surface low Wednesday
into Thursday near New England, with good clustering in position
for a medium range forecast. By Friday into Saturday, there is
some uncertainty with the timing of the upper low lifting out
northeastward, with GFS runs faster while the CMC runs appeared
slow initially, but the 00Z ECMWF clusters with it. The latter
cluster is slower than the ensemble means at this point though.

...April blizzard to impact portions of the northern Plains this
weekend...

...Strong cold front to produce the threat of severe weather from
the Upper Midwest to the southern Plains today, with damaging wind
gusts and critical fire weather a concern throughout the central
and southern High Plains...

...Scattered instances of flash flooding possible on Sunday across
portions of the southern Plains and Lower/Middle Mississippi
Valley...

A maturing storm system over the northern Plains will be the
catalyst for active weather across the central U.S. this weekend.
The low pressure system currently located over south-central South
Dakota is expected to continue strengthening today as it loops
over the Dakotas and eventually exits northeast into Canada on
Sunday. A broad precipitation shield to the north and west of the
system, aided by a closed upper-level low, will produce areas of
heavy snow across parts of the northern/central Rockies and
northern High Plains. Snowfall amounts up to two feet are forecast
throughout northeast Wyoming, eastern Montana, and western North
Dakota. Strong wind gusts as high as 60 mph combined with heavy
snow will reduce visibility and make travel difficult to
impossible at times. Blizzard Warnings are in effect.

On the warm side of the system, numerous showers and thunderstorms
will lead to the threat of severe weather and flash flooding over
the next couple of days. A potent cold front pushing through the
Great Plains has already sparked a line of severe thunderstorms
early this morning from central Nebraska to the Texas Panhandle.
The severe weather threat will gradually shift eastward today
along the cold front, extending from Minnesota and the eastern
Dakotas to central Oklahoma. This includes the potential for
damaging wind gusts, large hail, and a few tornadoes. In order to
highlight the potential, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe thunderstorms for this region.
Additionally, a few storms could contain heavy rainfall rates and
lead to isolated-to-scattered instances of flash flooding. Heavy
rain may also fall over areas enduring a melting snow pack across
northern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota today, increasing the
threat for flooding and prompting Flood Watches to be issued. By
Sunday, the threat of excessive rainfall increases as the cold
front stalls across the Mid-Mississippi Valley and southern
Plains. Rainfall totals may exceed two inches from far
north-central Texas to northwest Arkansas, including southeast
Oklahoma. A Slight Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive Rainfall has been
issued for an area extending from central Texas to southern
Illinois, where scattered flash floods are possible.

Meanwhile, on the warm, but dry side of the system there remains
the threat of critical fire weather through this evening. Gusty
westerly winds combined with low relative humidity will make for
ripe wildfire spreading conditions from the central Plains to the
southern Rockies/High Plains. Ongoing fires could continue to
spread uncontrollably, with new fires easily started as well. Red
Flag Warnings and a Critical Risk of fire weather remain in effect
from central Kansas across the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles into
eastern New Mexico. Wind Advisories have also been issued and
extend throughout much of the Great Plains.

In the temperature department, above average and summer-like
warmth will surge ahead of the aforementioned cold front. Highs
into the 80s will reach into the Midwest today, extending into the
Lower Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic on Sunday. Warmer weather will
also make a return to southern California and the Southwest by
Sunday as an upper-level ridge builds into the region. Well below
average temperatures are rightfully forecast across the northern
Plains over the next few days as fresh snow blankets this part of
the country. Slightly below average temperatures will also extend
into the Midwest, central and southern Plains by the beginning of
the week following the cold frontal passage.

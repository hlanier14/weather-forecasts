Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1014 AM CST Mon Dec 06 2021

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track with localized elevated fire weather
conditions possible through the day across the southeastern Rolling
Plains and Hill Country of central Texas. Morning surface
observations show that the cold front and associated zone of strong
surface-pressure rises/isallobaric wind response has shifted into
southern TX. Winds remain gusty behind the front due to low-level
cold advection, but upstream VWP profiles from OK show winds the
lowest 1 km are beginning to wane. Latest guidance also shows
weakening winds through the remainder of the day, though RH values
will likely continue to fall into the 25-35% range. While localized
elevated conditions remain probable for central TX today, the
combination of weakening winds, marginal RH, and ERC values
generally near the 50th percentile preclude any risk areas.

..Moore.. 12/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0134 AM CST Mon Dec 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level trough will move eastward through the Northeast
today. Across much of the central and western U.S., broad cyclonic
flow will develop. At the surface, a cold front will continue
southward through the Plains, reaching the Gulf Coast during the
evening/overnight. Locally elevated fire weather conditions are
possible in parts of the Texas Low Rolling Plains into the Edwards
Plateau. However, overlap of 20-25% RH and 15-20 mph winds appears
it will be less than three hours. No highlights will be added.

...Back-to-back heavy mountain snows expected across the Cascades,
Sierra Nevada, Intermountain West, and Rockies...

...Overview...

A generally progressive pattern is expected to persist through the
medium range period with a tendency for a ridge to become more
dominant across the South by early next week.  A couple of
synoptic scale systems moving through this progressive pattern
will be of concern.  A low pressure system forecast to track
through the central Plains to the Great Lakes will likely bring a
swath of wintry weather across the interior western U.S. late week
to the Great Lakes by the weekend, while heavy rain is possible on
Saturday across the Tennessee Valley ahead of a cold front with
timing uncertainties.  Over the Pacific Northwest, the first wave
of heavy mountain snows late this week will likely be followed by
another wave of moisture which has the potential to deliver
heavier snowfall amounts for the higher elevations.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance this morning exhibits reasonably good
agreement with the overall large-scale pattern described above,
with increasing uncertainties across the South by early next week.
 For the low pressure system forecast to develop over the central
Plains on Friday, models have generally increased the amplitude of
the shortwave dipping into the western U.S., resulting in a
stronger/deeper low to develop with a slightly faster forward
motion.  There has been a tendency to push the associated cold
front faster toward the east through the eastern U.S. during the
weekend as well.  Both the GFS and the ECMWF have attempted to
develop a frontal wave over the southern Appalachians during the
weekend in some previous runs although their ensemble means do not
support such development.  By early next week, ensemble means
generally support the establishment of a ridge across the South.
However, the latest (12Z) ECMWF develops an anomalous upper low
over the Deep South amid significant amplification of the frontal
wave over increasing amplitude of the upper-level pattern.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As the trough deepens in the West, precipitation will spread from
the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies southward to California
into the Great Basin to Central Rockies Thursday and Friday.
Favored terrain in Arizona could also see some enhanced activity.
Generally expect higher elevation snow and lower elevation rain,
with snow levels likely somewhat low as upper troughing amplifies.
Parts of Southern California may see the first rainfall in over a
month. Then as the western upper trough approaches/pushes into the
Plains toward the end of the week, precipitation should track
ahead of a low pressure system and a strong cold front. Some
wintry weather could spread into the Northern Plains and
Midwest/Great Lakes Friday in the cold air north and west of the
low track. Then rainfall may become moderate to heavy over parts
of the east-central U.S. especially by Saturday with the aid of
strengthening Gulf inflow ahead of the strong cold front.
Additionally, heavy precipitation chances are forecast to increase
in the Pacific Northwest starting around Friday night or Saturday
and continuing through the weekend as a potential atmospheric
river event sets up, though uncertainty remains with the
progression/southward extent of moisture, and will continue to be
monitored.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast to be in place in the central U.S. Thursday and Friday,
with highs currently forecast to rise into the 80s in portions of
Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley, which could approach or
set daily records as the temperatures should be 15-30F above
normal. These warm temperatures will push into the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys and Eastern Seaboard on Saturday, while temperatures
moderate to near normal behind. The western U.S. can expect below
average temperatures especially Friday and Saturday, with the
Central Great Basin in particular seeing temperatures 10-20F below
normal. Then, as ridging builds across the lower 48 by early next
week, temperatures should return to 10-20F above normal across the
northern two-thirds of the Plains by next Sunday and Monday.

...Back-to-back heavy mountain snows expected across the Cascades,
Sierra Nevada, Intermountain West, and Rockies...

...Overview...

A generally progressive pattern is expected to persist through the
medium range period with a tendency for a ridge to become more
dominant across the South by early next week.  A couple of
synoptic scale systems moving through this progressive pattern
will be of concern.  A low pressure system forecast to track
through the central Plains to the Great Lakes will likely bring a
swath of wintry weather across the interior western U.S. late week
to the Great Lakes by the weekend, while heavy rain is possible on
Saturday across the Tennessee Valley ahead of a cold front with
timing uncertainties.  Over the Pacific Northwest, the first wave
of heavy mountain snows late this week will likely be followed by
another wave of moisture which has the potential to deliver
heavier snowfall amounts for the higher elevations.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance this morning exhibits reasonably good
agreement with the overall large-scale pattern described above,
with increasing uncertainties across the South by early next week.
 For the low pressure system forecast to develop over the central
Plains on Friday, models have generally increased the amplitude of
the shortwave dipping into the western U.S., resulting in a
stronger/deeper low to develop with a slightly faster forward
motion.  There has been a tendency to push the associated cold
front faster toward the east through the eastern U.S. during the
weekend as well.  Both the GFS and the ECMWF have attempted to
develop a frontal wave over the southern Appalachians during the
weekend in some previous runs although their ensemble means do not
support such development.  By early next week, ensemble means
generally support the establishment of a ridge across the South.
However, the latest (12Z) ECMWF develops an anomalous upper low
over the Deep South amid significant amplification of the frontal
wave over increasing amplitude of the upper-level pattern.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As the trough deepens in the West, precipitation will spread from
the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies southward to California
into the Great Basin to Central Rockies Thursday and Friday.
Favored terrain in Arizona could also see some enhanced activity.
Generally expect higher elevation snow and lower elevation rain,
with snow levels likely somewhat low as upper troughing amplifies.
Parts of Southern California may see the first rainfall in over a
month. Then as the western upper trough approaches/pushes into the
Plains toward the end of the week, precipitation should track
ahead of a low pressure system and a strong cold front. Some
wintry weather could spread into the Northern Plains and
Midwest/Great Lakes Friday in the cold air north and west of the
low track. Then rainfall may become moderate to heavy over parts
of the east-central U.S. especially by Saturday with the aid of
strengthening Gulf inflow ahead of the strong cold front.
Additionally, heavy precipitation chances are forecast to increase
in the Pacific Northwest starting around Friday night or Saturday
and continuing through the weekend as a potential atmospheric
river event sets up, though uncertainty remains with the
progression/southward extent of moisture, and will continue to be
monitored.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast to be in place in the central U.S. Thursday and Friday,

normal. These warm temperatures will push into the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys and Eastern Seaboard on Saturday, while temperatures
moderate to near normal behind. The western U.S. can expect below
average temperatures especially Friday and Saturday, with the
Central Great Basin in particular seeing temperatures 10-20F below
normal. Then, as ridging builds across the lower 48 by early next
week, temperatures should return to 10-20F above normal across the
northern two-thirds of the Plains by next Sunday and Monday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0134 PM CST Mon Dec 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Latest guidance and observations continue to support the idea of
localized fire weather concerns across eastern NM and west TX
Tuesday afternoon. Although some recent solutions hint at RH
reductions into the 15-20% range across the region, the probability
for widespread sustained winds over 15 mph remains modest. The best
potential for sustained elevated wind/RH conditions will reside in
the immediate lee of the Guadalupe and Sacramento mountains and
along/south of the I-40 corridor between Albuquerque, NM to
Amarillo, TX. At this time, these conditions appear too limited
spatially to warrant a broader risk area, but trends will be
monitored.

To the east, dry conditions will likely prevail for the Mid-Atlantic
states with RH values falling to near 25% Tuesday afternoon. This
may pose a low-end fire weather concern for locations that do not
receive rainfall today given antecedent dry fuels across the
Carolinas and VA/MD. However, weak winds will limit the fire weather
threat.

..Moore.. 12/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CST Mon Dec 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will deepen across the eastern third of the
country while an upper ridge develops over the central/northern
Rockies on Tuesday. Weak lee troughing in the southern High Plains
is possible during the afternoon. Some increase in westerly winds in
eastern New Mexico and western Texas will occur as a result. Between
RH being marginally low (likely 20-25%) and winds being light
(around 15 mph), only locally elevated conditions are expected.

Over the Pacific Northwest, heavy mountain snows late this week

next Pacific front.  Models have generally shown a progressively
faster/earlier arrival of this round of moisture by the weekend.

The WPC medium-range forecasts were based on 40% from the 00Z
ECMWF and EC mean, 40% from the 00Z/06Z GFS and the 06Z GEFS, as
well as 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  More of the ensemble means

exit into the the northern Plains toward the upper Midwest.  By
Friday night, the snow and mixed precipitation should spread into
the Great Lakes with moderate to locally heavy amounts possible.
Some wintry mix is also possible across interior New England
Friday night/Saturday morning.  Farther south, rain with embedded
thunderstorms are expected to extend southwestward into the Deep
South, with heavy rainfall possible over the Tennessee Valley on
Saturday.  While the cold front is currently forecast to clear the
East Coast by early next week, there is some potential for an
upper low to form over the Deep South which would significantly
change the weather outlook.

Out West, the first wave of heavy mountain snows late this week
will likely be followed by the arrival of the next wave of
moisture by the weekend.  It appears that this renewed atmospheric

Central Great Basin in particular seeing temperatures 10-20F below

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 12 - 16 2021

Dynamical models are in excellent agreement regarding an amplified 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern across the forecast domain during the 6-10 day
period. Anomalous troughing and associated below normal 500-hPa heights are
forecast across the Northeastern Pacific, including over Mainland Alaska, t=
he
Alaska Panhandle, and parts of the western CONUS. Enhanced ridging and
positive
500-hPa height anomalies are favored on both sides of this trough, across t=
he
Aleutians and the Bering Sea, and over much of the CONUS east of the Rockie=
s.
The highest positive height anomalies (>180 meters) are forecast across the
Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes for the period as a who=
le,
with a trend toward higher heights favored along the Eastern Seaboard by th=
e
middle of the period as the ridging gradually shifts eastward.

The anomalous ridging across the eastern and central CONUS, along with the
forecast positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation, supports unseasonably wa=
rm
temperatures over a broad region of the CONUS, excluding the West Coast. Th=
e
largest positive temperature anomalies are forecast to be initially focused
over the Great Plains on day-6, and then quickly spread eastward to the
Atlantic Coast by the middle of the period. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs forecast indicates
elevated
probabilities of above normal temperatures from the Rockies and Great Basin=
 to
the East Coast, which is also supported by the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools.
The highest probabilities (>80-90 percent) are located over parts of the Gr=
eat
Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes, corresponding with the largest
positive 500-hPa height anomalies and where the uncalibrated ECMWF and GEFS
ensembles depict daily mean temperature anomalies of +15-20 deg F during th=
e
period. Along the west coast of the CONUS and Alaska, anomalous troughing
supports increased chances of near to below normal temperatures, with the
highest probabilities (>80 percent) of below normal temperatures indicated
across southern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle.

Mid-level ridging over the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS and associated
surface high pressure favor a dry pattern from the Great Plains to the East
Coast. This is likely to exacerbate precipitation deficits that are emergin=
g
across parts of the central and eastern U.S., with areas of moderate to sev=
ere
drought expanding across parts of the Great Plains, Mississippi Valley,
southern Mid-Atlantic, and northern New England according to the U.S. Droug=
ht
Monitor. Probabilities of below normal precipitation are increased over mos=
t
of
the CONUS east of the Rockies, with the highest probabilities (>60 percent)
over the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast. A flip to elevated below
normal precipitation probabilities compared to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs forecast is
warranted over parts of the east-central CONUS as a result of a departing
system that is forecast to bring enhanced precipitation to the region in th=
e
day 4-5 timeframe, but exit by the start of the forecast period. Slightly
lower
probabilities of below normal precipitation are indicated across portions o=
f
the Great Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, and the Great Lakes
relative to surrounding regions as dynamical models depict increased southe=
rly
return flow possibly increasing frontogenesis, and subsequently precipitati=
on
chances, across these areas later in the period. Troughing over the northea=
st
Pacific favors increased onshore flow along the West Coast, leading to
increased probabilities for above normal precipitation over the western thi=
rd
of the CONUS, consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. The
ridge-trough orientation across Alaska favors increased near to below norma=
l
precipitation probabilities for much of the state, as a result of increased
mid-level northerly flow.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered =

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5=
,
due to excellent model agreement regarding an amplified pattern forecast
across
North America, and in the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 14 - 20 2021

The highly amplified mid-level 500-hPa pattern forecast during the 6-10 day
period is forecast to continue into week-2, with a slight eastward shift. T=
his
would favor the Bering Sea ridge to expand eastward to encompass more of
Mainland Alaska, with the ECMWF ensemble more progressive with this feature
compared to the GEFS and Canadian ensembles, which is also more consistent
with
the Week 3-4 outlook, released on Dec 3. Below normal 500-hPa heights remai=
n
favored for the period as a whole over most of Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle, with positive height anomalies forecast across the extreme
southwestern Mainland and the Aleutians. Troughing and associated below nor=
mal
mid-level heights are forecast across the western third of the CONUS, with
downstream ridging and positive height anomalies favored to persist over th=
e
central and eastern CONUS. The mean ridge axis is shifted east relative to =
the
6-10 day period, and the highest positive height anomalies (>180 meters) ar=
e
depicted across the Ohio Valley and interior Northeast.

The enhanced ridging over the eastern and central CONUS supports high
confidence for an anomalously warm pattern east of the Rockies during the
week-2 period, with increased probabilities for above normal temperatures
depicted in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecast from the Rockies to =
the East Coast. There is a
large region with probabilities greater than 90 percent extending from the
eastern Great Plains, through parts of the Middle and Lower Mississippi,
Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, southern Great Lakes, and the interior Northea=
st
and mid-Atlantic. While the GEFS reforecast tool is more toned down with th=
e
higher probabilities compared to the ECMWF reforecast tool, analog guidance=
,
as
well as teleconnection analysis with the positive height anomaly center ove=
r
the Ohio Valley, both support the very high chances for above normal
temperatures during week-2. Positive mean temperature anomalies of over +15
deg
F are indicated in the uncalibrated ECMWF and GEFS ensembles over the Midwe=
st
early in week-2, with +5-10 deg F anomalies persisting across much of the
eastern two-thirds of the CONUS throughout the period putting winter-like
weather on hold for the time being.

Elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation remain favored across =
the
eastern third of the CONUS, along with the High Plains, underneath anomalou=
s
ridging. The highest probabilities for below normal precipitation (>50
percent)
are located over the Southeast, supported by the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast
tools. A combination of increased southerly flow around surface high pressu=
re,
and possible influence from shortwave disturbances rotating through the tro=
ugh
to the west, may lead to increased frontal activity across parts of the
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes, resulting in a slight tilt toward
increased
above normal precipitation probabilities over these areas. Increased trough=
ing
in the west generally favors a wetter pattern, with elevated probabilities =
for
above normal precipitation highlighted from the West Coast inland through t=
he
Rockies. Near to below normal precipitation is forecast across Alaska, on t=
he
backside of this troughing, although there are some hints of increased onsh=
ore
flow across western Alaska due to the mid-level flow becoming more westerly=
 as
opposed to northerly as the ridge axis shifts to the east compared to the 6=
-10
day period.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
very good agreement in the dynamical and statistical tools regarding anomal=
ous
warmth over the eastern half of the CONUS, offset by some uncertainty in th=
e
precipitation forecast as well as the mid-level pattern evolution over Alas=
ka.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys into parts of the
Southeast through Tuesday morning...

... There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys into parts of the
Western Gulf Coast through Tuesday morning...

...Lake effect snow downwind from the Great Lakes and light snow
over parts of the Northeast...

A strong front over parts of the Central Gulf Coast into the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast will move off the East Coast by Tuesday
morning. The system will produce showers and thunderstorms over
parts of the Central/Western Gulf Coast into the Southeast and
Southern Appalachians; some of the thunderstorms will be severe.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys into parts of the Southeast through Tuesday morning.  The
hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, a few tornadoes, and a
minimal threat for hail.

Moreover, some of the thunderstorms will have heavy rain.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys
into parts of the Western Gulf Coast through Tuesday morning.  The
associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain. On Tuesday, rain over the Mid-Atlantic will come to an end.
However, waves of low pressure along the front over the Gulf Coast
Region will produce showers and thunderstorms near the Gulf Coast
on Wednesday into Thursday morning, as rain develops along the
front over the Southeast on Wednesday, ending on Thursday.

Meanwhile, rain changing to snow will move across the Northeast
with the front, then move off the Northeast Coast by Tuesday
morning. In the wake of the system over the Northeast, lake effect
snow will develop downwind from the Great Lakes through Tuesday
morning.  Upper=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDlevel energy moving across the Great Lakes=
 into
the Northeast on Wednesday into Thursday morning will produce
light snow over the country's northeast corner. The snow and wind
will result in reduced visibilities and hazardous driving
conditions.

Furthermore, a complicated area of upper-level energy and a
surface low and associated front will aid in producing rain and
higher elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest into the Northern
Rockies on Monday evening. Overnight Monday, the rain and higher
elevation snow will move southward into California and the Great
Basin into parts of the Central Rockies by Tuesday evening.  On
Tuesday, rain will move farther south into Southern California by
Tuesday evening and into parts of the Southwest.

FOR TUESDAY DECEMBER 14 - MONDAY DECEMBER 20: There is good multi-model
depiction of amplified troughing (ridging) over the eastern Mainland Alaska
(western Aleutians), persisting from week-1 into week-2, continuing a cold
pattern throughout much of Alaska. A slight risk (greater than 20% chance) =
of
much below normal temperatures is posted for much of Alaska south of the
Brooks
Range, excluding the western Aleutians, Dec 14 to 17, where both the GEFS a=
nd
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatur=
es
falling to the lowest 10th percentile and interior (coastal) areas dropping
below -20 Deg F (0 Deg F). Recent GEFS ensemble means show 2-meter
temperatures
reaching 16 Deg F below normal across much of the highlighted risk area and
period. A moderate risk (at least a 40% chance) of much below normal
temperatures is highlighted for southwestern and south-central Mainland
Alaska,
including the Alaska Panhandle and eastern Aleutians, where the reforecast
tools indicate at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the
lowest 10th percentile. Many of these highlighted risk areas may experience
temperatures falling to the lowest 5th percentile.



The aforementioned mid-level trough over Alaska is expected to extend
southward
to the western half of the CONUS throughout the period, starting out amplif=
ied
and gradually weakening throughout week-2. This pattern is anticipated to
support surface low pressure centered over the Gulf of Alaska, with a front
extending southward across the West Coast of the CONUS from the beginning t=
o
middle of the period. This pattern is anticipated to favor enhanced onshore
flow over the western CONUS, supporting a slight risk of heavy precipitatio=
n
(rain and high-elevation snow) across parts of the Pacific Northwest and
northern and central California, Dec 14 to 17. A slight risk of heavy snow =
is
posted for the Cascades, northern Sierra Nevada Mountains, and parts of the
northern Rockies, Dec 14 to 17. The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20=
%
chance of highlighted heavy precipitation areas receiving 3-day liquid
equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch, with localize=
d
areas receiving 2 inches).



The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means show increased chances for enhanced
integrated vapor transport (IVT) values exceeding 250 kg/m/s extending from
the
Pacific Northwest as far south as Southern California from the beginning to
middle of week-2. Therefore, a slight risk of heavy rain is designated for
parts of southwestern California, Dec 14 to 15, where both reforecast tools
indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th
percentile and one inch. If this heavy precipitation does occur, it would b=
e
the first heavy precipitation event of the season. A slight risk of high wi=
nds
is also highlighted for coastal portions of California, associated with a
potential front associated with the surface low over the northeastern Pacif=
ic.
The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceedin=
g
the 85th percentile and 25 mph in this region.



Following a wet November when precipitation averaged 150 to 200 percent of
normal, many river levels across northwest Washington are running above the
95th percentile. Due to the ongoing antecedent wetness and heavy rainfall (=
3
to
5 inches) forecast during the next week, a flooding possible hazard is post=
ed
for northwest Washington. This flooding risk may persist throughout week-2,
since above normal precipitation is favored to continue in this region.



A wet pattern is forecast to persist over Hawaii for week-2, which could
support localized flooding where there is already saturated ground, but als=
o
provide relief to some areas currently experiencing severe drought. More th=
an
a
quarter of Hawaii is currently designated in severe to exceptional drought.

FOR TUESDAY DECEMBER 14 - MONDAY DECEMBER 20: There is good multi-model
depiction of amplified troughing across much of Alaska (excluding the
southwestern Mainland and western Aleutians), persisting from week-1 into
week-2, continuing a cold pattern throughout much of Alaska. A slight risk
(greater than 20% chance) of much below normal temperatures is posted for m=
uch
of Alaska south of the Brooks Range, excluding the western Aleutians, Dec 1=
4
to
17, where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20%
chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 10th percentile and
interior (coastal) areas dropping below -20 Deg F (0 Deg F). Recent GEFS
ensemble means show 2-meter temperatures reaching 16 Deg F below normal acr=
oss
much of the highlighted risk area and period. A moderate risk (at least a 4=
0%
chance) of much below normal temperatures is highlighted for southwestern a=
nd
south-central Mainland Alaska, including the Alaska Panhandle and eastern
Aleutians, where the reforecast tools indicate at least a 40% chance of
minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 10th percentile. Many of these highlight=
ed
risk areas may experience temperatures falling to the lowest 5th percentile=
.



The aforementioned mid-level trough over Alaska is expected to extend
southward
to the western half of the CONUS throughout the period, starting out amplif=
ied
and gradually weakening throughout week-2. This pattern is anticipated to
support surface low pressure centered over the Gulf of Alaska, with a front
extending southward across the West Coast of the CONUS from the beginning t=
o
middle of the period. This pattern is anticipated to favor enhanced onshore
flow over the western CONUS, supporting a slight risk of heavy precipitatio=
n
(rain and high-elevation snow) across parts of the Pacific Northwest and
northern and central California, Dec 14 to 17. A slight risk of heavy snow =
is
posted for the Cascades, northern Sierra Nevada Mountains, and parts of the
northern Rockies, Dec 14 to 17. The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20=
%
chance of highlighted heavy precipitation areas receiving 3-day liquid
equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch, with localize=
d
areas receiving 2 inches).



The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means show increased chances for enhanced
integrated vapor transport (IVT) values exceeding 250 kg/m/s extending from
the
Pacific Northwest as far south as Southern California from the beginning to
middle of week-2. Therefore, a slight risk of heavy rain is designated for
parts of southwestern California, Dec 14 to 15, where both reforecast tools
indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th
percentile and one inch. If this heavy precipitation does occur, it would b=
e
the first heavy precipitation event of the season. A slight risk of high wi=
nds
is also highlighted for coastal portions of California, associated with a
potential front associated with the surface low over the northeastern Pacif=
ic.
The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceedin=
g
the 85th percentile and 25 mph in this region.



Following a wet November when precipitation averaged 150 to 200 percent of
normal, many river levels across northwest Washington are running above the
95th percentile. Due to the ongoing antecedent wetness and heavy rainfall (=
3
to
5 inches) forecast during the next week, a flooding possible hazard is post=
ed
for northwest Washington. This flooding risk may persist throughout week-2,
since above normal precipitation is favored to continue in this region.



A wet pattern is forecast to persist over Hawaii for week-2, which could
support localized flooding where there is already saturated ground, but als=
o
provide relief to some areas currently experiencing severe drought. More th=
an
a
quarter of Hawaii is currently designated in severe to exceptional drought.

...Winter weather is likely for the northern Plains to
Midwest/Upper Great Lakes behind a surface low Friday, while heavy
rain is expected in the east-central U.S. along its associated
cold front...

...Heavy precipitation is forecast to spread southward along the
West Coast late this week into early next week...

...Overview...

A generally progressive and active weather pattern is forecast to
occur through early next week, as a mid-upper trough pushes from
the Intermountain West early Friday toward the East by Sunday,
while a surface low and potent cold front track ahead of it. A
swath of wintry weather is likely to spread from the Central
Rockies into northern portions of the Plains to the Midwest/Upper
Great Lakes on Friday behind the low, while heavy rain is possible
late this week across the east-central U.S. along and ahead of the
cold front with some timing uncertainties. Meanwhile, slow-moving
and reloading troughing in the eastern Pacific will give
persistent moist inflow to the West Coast, with heavy mountain
snows likely that should spread southward as the period progresses.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period begins Friday with quite good model
agreement with the overall large-scale pattern, despite some minor
differences in shortwave energy within the main trough with its
axis tracking through western and central parts of the U.S.
through the end of the week. The track of the surface low pressure
system moving quickly from the central High Plains into the Upper
Great Lakes has also been in good agreement for a few model cycles
now, though the timing of the cold front extending southward from
the low remains somewhat variable. A multi-model deterministic
blend was able to be used early in the period.

By Sunday, differences begin to arise in the East that amplify
Monday-Tuesday, particularly with whether or not northern and
southern streams will separate depending primarily on distribution
of energy within the trough. This is highly uncertain and has had
quite a bit of run-to-run variability within and between model
guidance. With the 12/18Z (yesterday) model cycle, which the WPC
forecast is based on, trends seemed to be for more separation of
the streams and a southern stream low that is slower to exit the
Southeast. This was shown by the 12Z ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET
(through its period), with the CMC and EC ensemble means also
showing stream separation. The GFS and GEFS runs appeared to be
basically alone in their more phased and faster track of the
trough eastward into the Atlantic. Considering typical biases of
the model suites, the WPC forecast was based on an intermediate
solution but slightly favoring the slower side of the
guidance--mainly a blend of the EC and CMC ensemble means with
some component of the in between deterministic CMC, and not
favoring the 12Z ECMWF that was slower than basically every
ensemble member but also not favoring the fast GFS runs. However,
the incoming 00Z deterministic models including the CMC and ECMWF
are showing faster movement of a more phased trough offshore,
indicating high uncertainty continues. Expect forecast changes
with this feature as models still vary.

Upper troughing is forecast to drop southward from Alaska across
the eastern Pacific over the weekend and into early next week.
While model guidance agrees upon the existence of this feature and
its slow drift southward, there is plenty of variety in how
amplified it could be at any given time, which affects the moist
onshore flow axis into the West Coast and the extent/amounts/type
of precipitation. At this point, a similar model blend previously
described worked for this feature as well--with deterministic
models early on quickly transitioning to a blend heavy on the EC
and CMC ensemble means. In between these troughs, model agreement
is reasonably good for upper ridging to build in across the
central U.S.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The surface low pressure system tracking northeastward into the
Midwest/Great Lakes Friday to early Saturday will likely spread
snow on the backside from the Central Rockies into northern
portions of the Plains and into the Midwest, with moderate to
locally heavy snow possible. The trailing cold front associated
with this low will track through the eastern half of the U.S. and
spread widespread rain with embedded thunderstorms along and ahead
of it. There is potential for heavy rain amounts with
quick-hitting high rainfall rates that could cause flooding/flash
flooding issues for portions of the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee,
and Ohio Valleys on Friday into early Sunday. Then, how much rain
falls along the Eastern Seaboard will depend on the timing of the
upper trough and cold front exiting into the Atlantic, which
remains uncertain. Meanwhile, persistent onshore flow is likely
initially in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies and then
could track south into California by early next week. Enhanced
totals are likely along favored terrain, with heavy mountain snow.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast to be in place in the central U.S. on Friday, with highs
currently forecast to rise into the 80s from portions of Texas to
the Lower Mississippi Valley, which could approach or set daily
records as the temperatures should be 15-30F above normal.  These
warm temperatures will push into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and
Eastern Seaboard on Saturday, while temperatures moderate to near
normal behind. The western U.S. can expect below average
temperatures especially Friday and Saturday, with the Central
Great Basin in particular seeing temperatures 10-20F below normal.
Then, as ridging builds across the lower 48 by early next week,
temperatures should return to 10-20F above normal across much of
the central U.S. by Sunday and lasting/warming further though
Tuesday.

mountain snow in the Cascades and Sierra Nevada.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast to be in place in the central U.S. on Friday, with highs
currently forecast to rise into the 80s from portions of Texas to
the Lower Mississippi Valley, which could approach or set daily
records as the temperatures should be 15-30F above normal. These
warm and potentially record-setting temperatures will push into
the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Eastern Seaboard on Saturday, while
temperatures moderate to near normal behind. The western U.S. can
expect below average temperatures especially Friday and Saturday,
with the Central Great Basin in particular seeing temperatures
10-20F below normal. Then, as ridging builds across much of the
lower 48 by early next week, temperatures should return to 10-20F
above normal across the central U.S. by Sunday and lasting/warming
further though Tuesday.

...Winter weather is likely for the northern Plains to
Midwest/Upper Great Lakes behind a surface low Friday, while heavy
rain is expected in the east-central U.S. along its associated
cold front...

...Heavy precipitation is forecast to spread southward along the
West Coast late this week into early next week...

...Overview...

A generally progressive and active weather pattern is forecast to
occur through early next week, as a mid-upper trough pushes from
the Intermountain West early Friday toward the East by Sunday,
while a surface low and potent cold front track ahead of it. A
swath of wintry weather is likely to spread from the Central
Rockies into northern portions of the Plains to the Midwest/Upper
Great Lakes on Friday behind the low, while heavy rain is possible
late this week across the east-central U.S. along and ahead of the
cold front. Meanwhile, slow-moving and reloading troughing in the
eastern Pacific will give persistent moist inflow to the West
Coast, with heavy mountain snows likely that should spread
southward as the period progresses.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period begins Friday with quite good model
agreement with the overall large-scale pattern, with the main
trough axis tracking through western and central parts of the U.S.
through the end of the week, despite some minor differences in
shortwave energy within it. The track of the surface low pressure
system moving quickly from the central High Plains into the Upper
Great Lakes has also been in good agreement for a few model cycles
now, though the timing of the cold front extending southward from
the low remains somewhat variable. A multi-model deterministic
blend was able to be used for the WPC forecast early in the period.

By Sunday, differences begin to arise in the East that amplify
Monday-Tuesday, particularly with whether or not northern and
southern streams will separate depending primarily on distribution
of energy within the trough. This is highly uncertain and has had
quite a bit of run-to-run variability within and between model
guidance. With the 12/18Z (yesterday) model cycle, which the WPC
forecast is based on, trends seemed to be for more separation of
the streams and a southern stream low that is slower to exit the
Southeast. This was shown by the 12Z ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET
(through its period), with the CMC and EC ensemble means also
showing stream separation. The GFS and GEFS runs appeared to be
basically alone in their more phased and faster track of the
trough eastward into the Atlantic. Considering typical biases of
the model suites, the WPC forecast was based on an intermediate
solution but slightly favoring the slower side of the
guidance--mainly a blend of the EC and CMC ensemble means with
some component of the in between deterministic CMC--not favoring
the 12Z ECMWF that was slower than basically every ensemble
member, nor favoring the fast GFS runs. However, the incoming 00Z
deterministic models including the CMC and ECMWF are showing
faster movement of a more phased trough offshore, indicating high
uncertainty continues. Expect forecast changes with this feature
as models still vary.

Upper troughing is forecast to drop southward from Alaska across
the eastern Pacific over the weekend and into early next week.
While model guidance agrees upon the existence of this feature and
its slow drift southward, there is plenty of variety in how
amplified it could be at any given time, which affects the moist
onshore flow axis into the West Coast and the extent/amounts/type
of precipitation. At this point, a similar model blend previously
described worked for this feature as well--with deterministic
models early on quickly transitioning to a blend heavy on the EC
and CMC ensemble means. In between these troughs, model agreement
is reasonably good for upper ridging to build in across the
central U.S.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The surface low pressure system tracking northeastward into the
Midwest/Great Lakes Friday to early Saturday will likely spread
snow on its backside from the Central Rockies into northern
portions of the Plains and into the Midwest, with moderate to
locally heavy snow possible. The trailing cold front associated
with this low will track through the eastern half of the U.S. and
spread widespread rain with embedded thunderstorms along and ahead
of it. There is potential for heavy rain amounts with
quick-hitting high rainfall rates that could cause flooding/flash
flooding issues for portions of the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee,
and Ohio Valleys on Friday and especially into Saturday. Then, how
much rain falls along the Eastern Seaboard will depend on the
timing of the upper trough and cold front exiting into the
Atlantic, which remains uncertain. Meanwhile, persistent onshore
flow is likely initially in the Pacific Northwest and northern
Rockies and then could track south into California by early next
week. Enhanced totals are likely along favored terrain, with heavy
mountain snow in the Cascades and Sierra Nevada.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast to be in place in the central U.S. on Friday, with highs
currently forecast to rise into the 80s from portions of Texas to
the Lower Mississippi Valley, which could approach or set daily
records as the temperatures should be 15-30F above normal. These
warm and potentially record-setting temperatures will push into
the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Eastern Seaboard on Saturday, while
temperatures moderate to near normal behind. The western U.S. can
expect below average temperatures especially Friday and Saturday,
with the Central Great Basin in particular seeing temperatures
10-20F below normal. Then, as ridging builds across much of the
lower 48 by early next week, temperatures should return to 10-20F
above normal across the central U.S. by Sunday and lasting/warming
further though Tuesday.

...Below average temperatures and light snow showers forecast
throughout the Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast over the next
few days...

...Heavy snow possible across parts of the Sierra Nevada and
Intermountain West starting Wednesday night...

A departing storm system lifting farther north into eastern Canada
this morning and a potent cold front exiting into the western
Atlantic will leave behind a true winter airmass throughout the
north-central and eastern U.S. today. The cold westerly winds will
also lead to lake effect snow showers downwind of the Great Lakes.
Light snow is possible into the Upper Midwest as well, thanks to a
weak low pressure system entering the region. The coldest
temperatures will be found across the northern tier and into the
Upper Great Lakes, with highs only reaching into the teens and
20s. By Wednesday morning, an upper level trough swinging through
the Ohio Valley will produce the chance for light snow showers to
develop in the Ohio Valley and northern Mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, a
developing coastal low along the Carolina coast is expected to
move northeast and rapidly strengthen east of New England. As a
result, a period of light snow is possible across parts of
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine into the overnight hours
on Wednesday. Additionally, showers and isolated thunderstorms are
expected along a stationary boundary draped across the Southeast
on Wednesday.

For the western United States, periods of light mountain snow and
scattered coastal/lower elevation rain showers are expected
throughout much of the region today. Parts of Southern California
may also see a few raindrops as an upper level low drops southward
along the West Coast. A deep upper level trough and strong cold
front is then forecast to enter the Northwest on Wednesday before
pushing into the central Great Basin by Wednesday night. Heavy
snow is possible throughout the Cascades and into the Sierra
Nevada, where snowfall accumulations over 8 inches are possible.
As cold air filters into the Intermountain West, snow is likely to
fall across the lower elevations into Thursday morning for
portions of central and northern Nevada.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CST Tue Dec 07 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced midlevel westerly flow will cross the southern
Rockies and emerge over the southern High Plains by this afternoon.
As this occurs, a weak lee surface low will develop over portions of
northeastern New Mexico, resulting in a modest enhancement to the
surface pressure gradient across eastern New Mexico and western
Texas.

...Eastern New Mexico and Western Texas...
Locally Elevated fire-weather conditions appear likely during the
afternoon hours across parts of eastern New Mexico and western
Texas, aided by downslope warming/drying amid breezy westerly
surface winds. Present indications are that the best overlap of low
RH (15-20 percent) and breezy westerly surface winds (15-20 mph)
will be spatially limited, as the stronger surface winds will be
displaced slightly northward from the greater RH reductions expected
over the Trans-Pecos region. The localized nature of the
fire-weather threat precludes highlights at this time, though trends
will be monitored.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1053 AM CST Thu Mar 11 2021

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL INTO SOUTHERN
NEW MEXICO...

Latest guidance consensus continues to show several hours of 10-20%
RH overlapping with 15-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds
over dry fuels (particularly in lower terrain areas) of central into
southern New Mexico. No changes were made to the ongoing
Elevated/Critical fire weather highlights across portions of the
southwest U.S.

Across the Mid Atlantic, surface RH has already dropped to 25-35%
across portions of central Virginia into Maryland. Both the RNK and
IAD 12Z observed soundings showed very dry air from just above the
surface to around 700 mb. While visible satellite shows extensive
cloud cover gradually approaching from the west, at least a few more
hours of diurnal heating under clear skies are expected. This
heating should aid in enough boundary-layer mixing to support
widespread 25-30% RH, with sustained southwesterly winds approaching
15 mph (with occasional higher gusts), warranting the continuation
of the Elevated area.

..Squitieri.. 03/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1247 AM CST Thu Mar 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad longwave upper-level trough remains largely in place across
the West Coast with a belt of stronger flow extending from northern
Baja California into the southern High Plains and portions of the
Midwest. This pattern is expected to hold through the day today, and
the persistent nearly zonal flow over the southern Rockies, along
with weak mid/upper-level diffluence, will help support modest
surface pressure falls over central/eastern New Mexico today. The
low-level mass response coupled with antecedent dry conditions will
support another day of fire weather concerns.

...New Mexico...
The forecast remains on track with widespread elevated to critical
fire weather conditions likely across New Mexico and adjacent areas
of southeast AZ, west TX, and far southeast CO later today. The main
change compared to previous outlooks was a reduction in the risk
area across west TX (where modest moisture return is ongoing) and
the OK/TX Panhandles where cooler post-frontal air will limit RH
reductions this afternoon.

To the west, recent observations across NM show dewpoint values in
the single digits to low teens, which will support another day of
widespread RH values in the 5-10% range west of the surface
trough/stalled cold front. Modest surface pressure falls will limit
the spatial extent of windy conditions compared to Wednesday, but
sustained 15-25 mph winds appear likely across the risk area per
recent ensemble guidance. A corridor of stronger mid-level flow
should exist from southwest to central NM, and given deep afternoon
boundary-layer mixing and terrain enhancements, will support wind
gusts between 30-40 mph. Fuels across eastern and southern portions
of NM remain receptive after several days of dry and windy
conditions. Further north, fuels within the higher elevations are
only modestly receptive, but recent reports suggest low-elevation
fuels are receptive and will support a fire weather concern.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Dry conditions persist across the western Carolinas and into the
Mid-Atlantic region after relative humidity values fell into the
teens for several locations yesterday. Recent fuel analyses suggest
that 10/100-hour fuel moisture values have fallen to near 5 and 10%,
respectively. Although winds have become more southerly with the
eastward translation of a surface high, moisture return into the
region will be minimal today based on upstream dewpoints across the
western Carolinas in the low to mid 30s. Meager moisture return
coupled with diurnal heating should yield RH values in the 20-30%
range for today. The approach of a surface trough/cold front from
the west will augment pressure-gradient winds this afternoon. Winds
between 10-15 mph appear most likely and will support elevated fire
weather conditions for most locations in the risk area. Frequent
wind gusts near 20 mph are possible and may support localized/brief
critical conditions.

...A major weekend snowstorm for the Central Rockies/High Plains
and a heavy rainfall threat from the Central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Overview...

A potent closed upper trough/low will track from the Southwest to
the Southern Plains this weekend into Monday. This plus a well
organized surface low over the Central Plains will spread
significant snow to the Central Rockies and central High Plains,
while severe weather and heavy rain are possible across the
central U.S. from the short range period into early next week as
the medium range period begins. Another amplified trough may dig
into an unsettled West early next week and serve as a kicker for
the initial closed low, pushing it northeastward as it weakens.
The second system may reach the central U.S. by next midweek and
spread additional precipitation to the central/eastern CONUS.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance agreement is good for the initial portion of the
medium range with the closed upper low as well as upper troughing
over the eastern Pacific and the Northeast. Then, model
diagnostics become trickier as differences arise with the
troughing/energy moving into the West from the Pacific beginning
Monday. After several days of fairly consistent model runs (for
the most part, with the main exception of the weaker UKMET that
has not been favored) with strong energy/troughing coming in, now
the 00Z ECMWF is also weaker with the kicker as most of its energy
remains across Canada. Ensemble members show a good bit of spread
with the troughing, especially the EC and CMC ensembles. So
confidence lowers from around Monday onward with this feature and
its interaction with the initial upper low. The differences become
even more notable around Tuesday night/Wednesday, as the 00Z EC
wraps energy from its central Canadian upper low southward,
producing a trough axis across the Great Lakes region and south.
This is unlike consensus and unlike the 00Z EC mean. Meanwhile,
the 00Z CMC has a solution with stronger energy producing a
slower-moving low staying across the Four Corners to central U.S.
on Wednesday/Thursday. Overall, going with the well-clustered GEFS
and EC ensemble means by the latter part of the period seemed like
the safest bet for now, along with some component of the 06Z GFS
that had better alignment with the means than other deterministic
models.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Significant heavy snow along with gusty winds creating low
visibility and possible blizzard conditions are forecast to
continue from the short range period into Sunday across the
Central Rockies and central portions of the High Plains. More
moderate snows could spread across the Central Plains into the
Upper Midwest into early next week. In the warm sector, heavy
rains/convection will also develop in earnest and spread from the
south-central Plains to the mid-lower Mississippi Valley/Mid-South
where increasingly deep moisture inflow from the Gulf of Mexico
will wrap around the low into a slow-moving frontal zone. SPC
shows a severe weather threat for the Southern Plains to the
Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley unstable warm sector through
Sunday.

Subsequent evolution is less clear, but expect a weakening system
will lift northeastward across the east-central U.S. early next
week and into the Atlantic by Wednesday. This could spread some
enhanced rainfall/convection to the Southeast and Southern
Appalachians. With a cold high pressure wedge in place, wrap-back
moisture in cooler than normal temperatures may support a chance
for mainly light overrunning snows from the north-central
Appalachians through the northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
Monday and Tuesday, but uncertainty in precipitation type and
amounts are high.

While uncertainty also remains with the strength of the trough
coming into the West, at least some precipitation is likely for
the early week from the West Coast into the Intermountain West.
Another round of snow is possible for the Central Rockies/central
High Plains around Tuesday and Wednesday. As a low pressure system
may track across the south-central U.S. towards the Ohio Valley
through the middle part of the week, renewed precipitation is
possible for portions of the central and eastern U.S., but with
low confidence as to the details.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL INTO SOUTHERN
AND NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO...

The previous forecast remains on track across portions of the
Southwest. Guidance consensus continues to show 10-15% surface RH
overlapping 20-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds during
the mid-late afternoon hours across much of central New Mexico. A
few expansions were made to the Critical area to reflect the latest
high-resolution model guidance. Fuels still remain more marginally
receptive to fire spread in higher terrain. However, finer fuels
across lower-terrain areas are dried sufficiently to support
wildfire-growth potential.

Portions of the Mid Atlantic are expected to see 15 mph sustained
westerly surface winds during the afternoon hours, potentially
overlapping 25-35% RH, especially over New Jersey. Finer fuels
appear modestly supportive to support at least local wildfire-spread
concerns. At the moment, the primary mitigating factor for adding an
Elevated area is the potential for persistent cloud cover and
associated scattered showers, which may hinder robust boundary-layer
mixing. An Elevated area may be added in future outlooks if clearer
skies and stronger surface heating become apparent.

..Squitieri.. 03/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CST Thu Mar 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
The main upper-level trough, currently residing across the West
Coast, is forecast to begin translating eastward into the Southwest
through the day Friday. Broad synoptic ascent ahead of the
approaching wave will induce surface pressure falls across the
southern High Plains through the day Friday. Height rises over the
Plains amid broad warm advection will begin to orient the flow over
the southern Rockies more meridionally, resulting in only modest lee
troughing over central New Mexico/far southern Colorado. An increase
in southerly surface winds is expected, but will likely be confined
to just New Mexico and the bordering portions of neighboring states.
Nonetheless, dry conditions and receptive fuels coupled with windy
conditions will result in another day of heightened fire weather
concerns.

...New Mexico...
Recent ensemble guidance maintains confidence in the fire weather
potential for Friday afternoon by featuring high probabilities for
relative humidity values in the single digits to low teens and wind
speeds between 15-25 mph across New Mexico. Low-level flow over the
next 48 hours will predominantly be out of the south/southwest with
trajectories emanating off the higher terrain of northern Mexico.
The resultant downslope warming/drying, coupled with daytime
heating/deep boundary-layer mixing, should support the ensemble RH
forecast. As with Thursday, the strongest mid-level flow will likely
be aligned from southwest to central NM, which will allow for better
wind potential within the higher terrain across the central portions
of the state. This also introduces some uncertainty for the RH/wind
forecast for the High Plains to the east (along the TX/NM border)
where downslope warming and drying may not be maximized. Fuels
across southern and eastern NM remain dry and receptive to fire
spread, but receptive fuels across the higher terrain in central and
northern NM will remain confined to lower elevations.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Dry post-frontal air is expected to overspread the Mid-Atlantic
region by late Friday after the passage of a cold front. Weakness in
cold advection behind the front and clearing skies by the afternoon
may allow for temperatures to warm enough to yield RH values as low
as 25% from western VA to eastern PA. Additionally, 10-15 mph post
frontal winds are expected, and if coincident with reduced RH, may
support some fire weather concern. This potential will largely be
conditional on minimal rainfall along the front and skies clearing
in time to allow some daytime heating. A notable spread in guidance
precludes any risk areas, though conditions will continue to be
monitored.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST March 11 2021

SYNOPSIS: Surface low pressure is anticipated to exit the Northeast at the
beginning of the period. Mid-level flow is anticipated to be predominantly
weak
during week-2, resulting in low potential for hazards across the lower 48 a=
nd
Alaska. Some model ensemble means (ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian) indicate the
potential for mid-level low pressure forming across the Mississippi Valley
towards the end of the period, which may support a cold front extending fro=
m
the Great Lakes to the Southern Plains and resultant wet weather to the
eastern
third of the Contiguous U.S. Many models indicate the possibility of a stor=
m
forming over the Gulf of Alaska, although no related hazards are posted for
Alaska at this time.

HAZARDS

Flooding possible for portions of the Middle Mississippi and Ohio River
Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MARCH 14 - THURSDAY MARCH 18:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!reC7NDZMatA9aua6DNtexZPsbq0fLzlGC2gIy8DTUwMx8Y-HgTXpZp_mMu9U7=
o-6QYINdLyi$

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 19 - THURSDAY MARCH 25: A surface low is predicted to exit
the
Northeast at the beginning of week-2, followed by weakening of mid-level lo=
w
pressure over the East Coast. Zonal mid-level flow is forecast to dominate
week-2, albeit the possibility of short-wave troughs during the period,
supporting relatively mild temperatures across the lower 48. There is a
potential for much below normal temperatures to linger across parts of the
Central and Southern Rockies and Central and Southern Great Plains from the
end
of week-1 to the beginning of the outlook period. However, there is
insufficient model agreement indicating the increased risk for much below
normal temperatures lasting beyond a day, precluding a much below normal
temperature risk from being highlighted in today's outlook.



There is relatively good agreement amongst the ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensemble means indicating the potential of short-wave troughing forming ove=
r
the Great Plains later in the period (around March 23). This trough may
support
the formation of a cold front extending from the Great Lakes to the Souther=
n
Plains, bringing wet weather to parts of the eastern third of the CONUS.
Although some areas may receive localized heavy rainfall, widespread heavy
precipitation is not anticipated at this time, precluding a heavy
precipitation
hazard from being posted at this time. The greatest related concern is floo=
d
potential over the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, as precipitation is
forecast to be well above-normal over the lower Midwest during week-1.
Although
there is a slight tilt in the odds for below-normal rainfall across this
region
during week-2, any increase in precipitation may exacerbate river levels.
Therefore the possible flooding area is maintained for the region.



Similar to yesterday, the ECMWF and GEFS ensemble means continue to favor
anomalous troughing centered over the Northeast Pacific, with the ECMWF
favoring a more westerly solution than the GEFS. The mean week-2 mid-level
negative height departures in the ECMWF having more westward placement over
the
eastern Pacific, while favoring positive height anomalies across the Southw=
est
and parts of the Intermountain West. The mean GEFS pattern, however, depict=
s
negative mid-level height anomalies over the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California, which would be more favorable for heavy precipitation across th=
e
region. This is reflected in the GEFS reforecast tool which shows at least =
a
20% chance of 3-day accumulated precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th
percentile and 1 inch (1.5 inches across coastal Pacific Northwest), wherea=
s
the ECMWF reforecast tool does not. Given these continued model differences=
 in
and increased uncertainty in regards to the risk of heavy precipitation ove=
r
the West Coast, a related hazard is not designated at this time.



Over Alaska the majority of model (ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian) ensemble mean=
s
favor above normal 500hPa heights across mainland Alaska and the Aleutians,
and
normal to below normal departures across the Alaska Panhandle. While the GE=
FS
continues to favor anomalous cold across portions of the western and southe=
rn
Mainland, tied to anomalous troughing aloft, there is still insufficient
confidence to post any temperature related hazards at this time. Surface lo=
w
pressure is anticipated to form over the Gulf of Alaska during week-2. Mode=
l
guidance including the reforecast tools, however, do not support increased
chances for precipitation or wind hazards at this time.

...A major weekend snowstorm for the Central Rockies/High Plains
and a heavy rainfall threat from the Central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Overview...

A potent closed upper trough/low will track from the Southwest to
the Southern Plains this weekend into Monday. This plus a well
organized surface low over the Central Plains will spread
significant snow to the Central Rockies and central High Plains,
while severe weather and heavy rain are possible across the
central U.S. from the short range period into early next week as
the medium range period begins. Another amplified trough may dig
into an unsettled West early next week and serve as a kicker for
the initial closed low, pushing it northeastward as it weakens.
The second system may reach the central U.S. by next midweek and
spread additional precipitation to the central/eastern CONUS.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance agreement is good for the initial portion of the
medium range with the closed upper low as well as upper troughing
over the eastern Pacific and the Northeast. Then, model
diagnostics become trickier as differences arise with the
troughing/energy moving into the West from the Pacific beginning
Monday. After several days of fairly consistent model runs (for
the most part, with the main exception of the weaker UKMET that
has not been favored) with strong energy/troughing coming in, now
the 00Z ECMWF is also weaker with the kicker as most of its energy
remains across Canada. Ensemble members show a good bit of spread
with the troughing, especially the EC and CMC ensembles. So
confidence lowers from around Monday onward with this feature and
its interaction with the initial upper low. The differences become
even more notable around Tuesday night/Wednesday, as the 00Z EC
wraps energy from its central Canadian upper low southward,
producing a trough axis across the Great Lakes region and south.
This is unlike consensus and unlike the 00Z EC mean. Meanwhile,
the 00Z CMC has a solution with stronger energy producing a
slower-moving low staying across the Four Corners to central U.S.
on Wednesday/Thursday. Overall, going with the well-clustered GEFS
and EC ensemble means by the latter part of the period seemed like
the safest bet for now, along with some component of the 06Z GFS
that had better alignment with the means than other deterministic
models.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Significant heavy snow along with gusty winds creating low
visibility and possible blizzard conditions are forecast to
continue from the short range period into Sunday across the
Central Rockies and central portions of the High Plains. More
moderate snows could spread across the Central Plains into the
Upper Midwest into early next week. In the warm sector, heavy
rains/convection will also develop in earnest and spread from the
south-central Plains to the mid-lower Mississippi Valley/Mid-South
where increasingly deep moisture inflow from the Gulf of Mexico
will wrap around the low into a slow-moving frontal zone. SPC
shows a severe weather threat for the Southern Plains to the
Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley unstable warm sector through
Sunday.

Subsequent evolution is less clear, but expect a weakening system
will lift northeastward across the east-central U.S. early next
week and into the Atlantic by Wednesday. This could spread some
enhanced rainfall/convection to the Southeast and Southern
Appalachians. With a cold high pressure wedge in place, wrap-back
moisture in cooler than normal temperatures may support a chance
for mainly light overrunning snows from the north-central
Appalachians through the northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
Monday and Tuesday, but uncertainty in precipitation type and
amounts are high.

While uncertainty also remains with the strength of the trough
coming into the West, at least some precipitation is likely for
the early week from the West Coast into the Intermountain West.
Another round of snow is possible for the Central Rockies/central
High Plains around Tuesday and Wednesday. As a low pressure system
may track across the south-central U.S. towards the Ohio Valley
through the middle part of the week, renewed precipitation is
possible for portions of the central and eastern U.S., but with
low confidence as to the details.

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding possible over parts of
the Central/Southern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley through
Saturday...

...Warm temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average found from the
Southeast to the Northeast Friday...

...Critical risk of fire weather for central and southern New
Mexico...

...Significant winter storm to begin Friday evening into Saturday
morning across the Central Rockies and central High Plains...

A low pressure system with a frontal boundary extending from the
Southwest to the Northeast is forecast to move into Canada
overnight. Ahead of the cold front, temperatures will rise into
the 60s and 70s across the East Coast. As the system propagates
quickly northeast the northern half of the frontal boundary is
expected to keep pace, dousing the Northeast in light to moderate
rain into the early morning Saturday. Conversely, the southern
half of the frontal boundary will more or less stall over an area
extending from the Central/Southern Plains to the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys. Showers and thunderstorms will persist along
the leading edge of the frontal boundary, some of which could
become severe. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight
Risk for severe thunderstorms for portions of the Central Plains
and Mississippi Valley through tomorrow morning. Damaging wind
gusts and large hail are expected to be the main threats with
these storms. The threat for severe weather will continue
throughout the period, with the primary region of concern tomorrow
being a Slight Risk area extending from the Texas Panhandle to
southwestern Oklahoma, while central Texas, central Oklahoma and a
portion of southern Kansas will be at greatest risk on Saturday.

These thunderstorms will also have the potential to cause flash
and urban flooding as they develop and remain over the same areas
due to the slow progression of the frontal boundary. At present,
the Weather Prediction Center has indicated a Marginal Risk for
Excessive Rainfall and Flood Watches have been issued for portions
of the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, where one to two
inches of rainfall will be possible through tomorrow evening. The
risk for flash flooding in these regions will be carried
throughout the period. As showers and thunderstorms cluster over
the Central/Southern Plains Friday into Saturday rainfall totals
in excess of two to three inches will be possible, making flash
flooding a concern in these regions throughout the early weekend.
On the very southern end of this frontal boundary over New Mexico
and western Texas, persistent dry conditions, exacerbated by a
passing cold front this evening, combined with high winds
associated with the frontal passage will create a Critical Risk of
fire weather throughout the period. Much of New Mexico will be at
greatest risk for fire weather and Red Flag Warnings are currently
in effect.

A large upper-level low spinning above the southwestern U.S. will
be the catalyst for an upcoming significant winter storm across
the Central Rockies and central High Plains. Before the system
fully develops this weekend, heavy snow could fall across the
higher elevations of the Intermountain West and Southwest.
Portions of Utah and Arizona could see over 6 inches of snow by
Saturday morning. Heavy mountain snow and lower elevation heavy
rain will also remain possible across southern California through
Friday. As the upper-level low moves eastward, an area of low
pressure is expected to develop across the southern High Plains on
Friday and produce heavy snow across central Colorado and
southeast Wyoming this weekend. Light snow is forecast to develop
Friday evening across the region; however, much of the winter
weather impacts are forecast to occur later in the day on Saturday
and throughout much of Sunday. Widespread travel impacts are
likely as strong winds combined with snowfall rates of one to two
inches per hour could produce near blizzard conditions. Winter
Storm Watches have been issued and include southeast Wyoming,
northeast and central Colorado, as well as western Nebraska.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu March 11 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 17 - 21 2021

Model guidance depicts an eastward progression to the longwave pattern over
the
CONUS during the 6-10 day period with a 500-hPa trough shifting from the
Rockies on day 6 (Mar 17) to the eastern U.S. by day 8 (Mar 19). As this
longwave trough progresses eastward later next week, a low pressure system =
is
likely to track from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the East Coast, enhanc=
ing
probabilities of above normal precipitation for these areas. Surface high
pressure, in the wake of this low pressure system, favors below normal
precipitation for much of the central U.S. extending westward to include th=
e
Southwest. The 500-hPa trough offshore of the West Coast and enhanced onsho=
re
flow support increased probabilities of above normal precipitation for the
Pacific Northwest and northern California.

Forecast confidence is lower in the 6-10 day temperature outlook due to a
variable pattern during this 5-day period and continued poor agreement betw=
een
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Below normal temperatures are most lik=
ely
across the central U.S., where cold air advection is forecast on days 6 and=
 7
behind a surface low. Also, widespread and heavy snowfall predicted this
weekend across the central Rockies and adjacent High Plains favor below nor=
mal
temperatures for these areas through next week. Compared to yesterdays
temperature outlook, the coverage of near to below normal temperatures was
expanded east of the Mississippi River as the longwave trough overspreads t=
he
eastern third of the CONUS.

The 0Z ECMWF and 0Z Canadian ensemble mean solutions are most bullish in th=
e
development of a Rex block over Alaska and the North Pacific during the day
6-10 period. The building ridge overtop a closed 500-hPa low favors near to
below normal temperatures throughout most of Alaska, with the exception bei=
ng
the northern Mainland where above normal temperatures are favored. Near to
below normal precipitation is also favored across Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted variable temperature pattern during this 5-day period, especial=
ly
the eastern CONUS, and poor agreement among many temperature and precipitat=
ion
tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 19 - 25 2021

Although ensemble spread is moderate to large over the forecast domain duri=
ng
week-2, there are a few common features among the ensemble means to key upo=
n
for the temperature and precipitation outlooks. A longwave trough is foreca=
st
to persist over the North Pacific, while a 500-hPa ridge of modest amplitud=
e
becomes centered over the interior West. A shallow longwave trough is forec=
ast
across eastern North America. The two largest 500-hPa height anomaly center=
s
(-90 to -120 meters) are centered over the North Pacific and eastern Canada=
.
Teleconnections upon these well agreed 500-hPa height anomalies support a
slightly colder outcome over the central and eastern CONUS, compared to the
reforecast GEFS and ECMWF tools. Based on statistical and dynamical guidanc=
e,
below normal temperatures are most likely across the lower Mississippi Vall=
ey
and western Gulf Coast. The favored area of below normal temperatures forec=
ast
for parts of the central Rockies and high Plains is mostly related to snowf=
all
considerations. Near normal temperatures are favored for much of the easter=
n
CONUS due to the expectation of a variable 7-day temperature pattern.
Increased
probabilities of above normal temperatures are forecast for the western CON=
US
with a mean 7-day ridge aloft and associated positive 500-hPa height
anomalies.
These increased probabilities of above normal temperatures extend east to
include the northern Great Plains and upper Mississippi Valley where the GE=
FS
and ECMWF reforecast tools depict probabilities exceeding 50 percent.

After a low pressure system tracks eastward to the East Coast by day 8, a
drier
pattern is anticipated for a majority of the eastern and central CONUS duri=
ng
week-2. This drier pattern is also consistent with a longwave ridge (trough=
)
axis predicted to extend over the Rockies (East Coast). The one exception i=
s
for enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation across the Florida
Peninsula where the tail end of a cold front is expected to stall early in
week-2. The persistent trough over the North Pacific continues to favor abo=
ve
normal precipitation across the Pacific Northwest. Below normal precipitati=
on
favored for the remainder of the western CONUS is consistent with ridging
aloft
and above normal 500-hPa heights.

Ensemble means depict a closed 500-hPa low over the North Pacific with
positive
500-hPa height anomalies to the north over Alaska. The longwave pattern fav=
ors
near or above normal temperatures throughout a majority of Alaska. However,=
 a
small area with slightly elevated probabilities for below normal temperatur=
es
is forecast for eastern Mainland Alaska due to nearby surface high pressure
and
easterly flow. Below normal precipitation is likely for Alaska with a storm
track well south of the state.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
continued poor agreement among temperature tools and typical low
predictability
during early spring.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...A major weekend snowstorm for the Central Rockies/High Plains
and a heavy rainfall threat from the Central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Overview...

A potent closed upper trough/low will track from the Southwest to
the Southern Plains this weekend into Monday. This plus a well
organized surface low over the Central Plains will spread
significant snow to the Central Rockies and central High Plains,
while severe weather and heavy rain are possible across the
central U.S. from the short range period into early next week as
the medium range period begins. Another amplified trough may dig
into an unsettled West early next week and serve as a kicker for
the initial closed low, pushing it northeastward as it weakens.
The second system may reach the central U.S. by next midweek and
spread additional precipitation to the central/eastern CONUS.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance agreement is good for the initial portion of the
medium range with the closed upper low as well as upper troughing
over the eastern Pacific and the Northeast. Then, model
diagnostics become trickier as differences arise with the
troughing/energy moving into the West from the Pacific beginning
Monday. After several days of fairly consistent model runs (for
the most part, with the main exception of the weaker UKMET that
has not been favored) with strong energy/troughing coming in, now
the 00Z ECMWF is also weaker with the kicker as most of its energy
remains across Canada. Ensemble members show a good bit of spread
with the troughing, especially the EC and CMC ensembles. So
confidence lowers from around Monday onward with this feature and
its interaction with the initial upper low. The differences become
even more notable around Tuesday night/Wednesday, as the 00Z EC
wraps energy from its central Canadian upper low southward,
producing a trough axis across the Great Lakes region and south.
This is unlike consensus and unlike the 00Z EC mean. Meanwhile,
the 00Z CMC has a solution with stronger energy producing a
slower-moving low staying across the Four Corners to central U.S.
on Wednesday/Thursday. Overall, going with the well-clustered GEFS
and EC ensemble means by the latter part of the period seemed like
the safest bet for now, along with some component of the 06Z GFS
that had better alignment with the means than other deterministic
models.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Significant heavy snow along with gusty winds creating low
visibility and possible blizzard conditions are forecast to
continue from the short range period into Sunday across the
Central Rockies and central portions of the High Plains. More
moderate snows could spread across the Central Plains into the
Upper Midwest into early next week. In the warm sector, heavy
rains/convection will also develop in earnest and spread from the
south-central Plains to the mid-lower Mississippi Valley/Mid-South
where increasingly deep moisture inflow from the Gulf of Mexico
will wrap around the low into a slow-moving frontal zone. SPC
shows a severe weather threat for the Southern Plains to the
Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley unstable warm sector through
Sunday.

Subsequent evolution is less clear, but expect a weakening system
will lift northeastward across the east-central U.S. early next
week and into the Atlantic by Wednesday. This could spread some
enhanced rainfall/convection to the Southeast and Southern
Appalachians. With a cold high pressure wedge in place, wrap-back
moisture in cooler than normal temperatures may support a chance
for mainly light overrunning snows from the north-central
Appalachians through the northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
Monday and Tuesday, but uncertainty in precipitation type and
amounts are high.

While uncertainty also remains with the strength of the trough
coming into the West, at least some precipitation is likely for
the early week from the West Coast into the Intermountain West.
Another round of snow is possible for the Central Rockies/central
High Plains around Tuesday and Wednesday. As a low pressure system
may track across the south-central U.S. towards the Ohio Valley
through the middle part of the week, renewed precipitation is
possible for portions of the central and eastern U.S., but with
low confidence as to the details.

...Heavy rainfall threat in the Tennessee Valley early next week...

...Overview and Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Unwinding closed low over the Central Plains will lift into the
Great Lakes, spreading rainfall east of the Mississippi on Monday,
while another system enters the West. That system is forecast to
track eastward through the middle of the lower 48 as another
Pacific system comes into Washington and Oregon late in the week
next week.

The models and ensembles were drastically different in the short
range over the eastern Pacific, hinging on how to evolve sharp
troughing between Alaska and Hawai'i. The 12Z ECMWF/UKMET detached
a southern upper low near 33N/145W Sunday while the 12Z (and 18Z)
GFS/Canadian did not, leaving differences in the northern stream
flow into the Pacific Northwest; namely, the ECMWF/UKMET were much
quicker into/through WA/OR than the GFS/Canadian. The ensemble
members tied to each parent model mostly followed along with a
corresponding quicker or slower solution. Trends over the past few
days showed a more consistent GEFS than ECMWF EPS and favored the
less split solution shown by the 18Z GFS, though with a great deal
of uncertainty.

By next Tue into Wed, the GFS/ECMWF came mostly back into
agreement with the track of and northwestern trough or upper low
through the Four Corners and onto the Plains. Thereafter,
differences in Canada ultimately led to the 12Z ECMWF falling out
of favor in the East, likely too far south/deep with an upper low
(on the edge or outside its ensemble members' spread). 18Z GFS
simulated a reasonable solution as the upper trough may reach the
Appalachians around the end of next week, supporting surface low
pressure into the Tennessee Valley next Thursday. The 18Z GFS did
appear too strong with a trailing upper/sfc low over the Northeast
Pacific and perhaps too quick with the lead front around next
Thursday into WA/OR. Trended toward the ensemble means as a
consensus hedge given the lead-in uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Decaying Plains system will still support wrap-around snow on its
northwest/north side in the cold sector (Corn Belt/Upper
Midwest/Dakotas) on Monday with overrunning snow to the
north/northeast ahead of the warm front as the surface high
retreats into Atlantic Canada. This may support a transition to
rain in some areas as milder air is drawn into the region. In the
warm sector, modest to perhaps locally heavy rain, perhaps driven
by convection, will blossom and expand into/through the mid-South
to the Ohio River Valley. Focus will shift back to the west out of
the southern Rockies as the next system may again tap the Gulf of
Mexico for moisture into the lower Mississippi Valley Wed-Thu, and
perhaps to the East Coast by next Friday.

Temperatures will be mild ahead of the Plains system through the
Southeast, but colder than normal in the Northeast until the high
moves offshore. Much cooler than normal temperatures will follow
behind the lead and subsequent Plains and Northwest systems,
respectively. Temperatures may be variable across the High Plains
but within about 5-15 degrees of normal for the middle of March.

...Heavy rainfall threat in the Tennessee Valley early next week...

...Overview and Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Unwinding closed low over the Central Plains will lift into the
Great Lakes, spreading rainfall east of the Mississippi on Monday,
while another system enters the West. That system is forecast to
track eastward through the middle of the lower 48 as another
Pacific system comes into Washington and Oregon late in the week
next week.

The models and ensembles were drastically different in the short
range over the eastern Pacific, hinging on how to evolve sharp
troughing between Alaska and Hawai'i. The 12Z ECMWF/UKMET detached
a southern upper low near 33N/145W Sunday while the 12Z (and 18Z)
GFS/Canadian did not, leaving differences in the northern stream
flow into the Pacific Northwest; namely, the ECMWF/UKMET were much
quicker into/through WA/OR than the GFS/Canadian. The ensemble
members tied to each parent model mostly followed along with a
corresponding quicker or slower solution. Trends over the past few
days showed a more consistent GEFS than ECMWF EPS and favored the
less split solution shown by the 18Z GFS, though with a great deal
of uncertainty.

By next Tue into Wed, the GFS/ECMWF came mostly back into
agreement with the track of and northwestern trough or upper low
through the Four Corners and onto the Plains. Thereafter,
differences in Canada ultimately led to the 12Z ECMWF falling out
of favor in the East, likely too far south/deep with an upper low
(on the edge or outside its ensemble members' spread). 18Z GFS
simulated a reasonable solution as the upper trough may reach the
Appalachians around the end of next week, supporting surface low
pressure into the Tennessee Valley next Thursday. The 18Z GFS did
appear too strong with a trailing upper/sfc low over the Northeast
Pacific and perhaps too quick with the lead front around next
Thursday into WA/OR. Trended toward the ensemble means as a
consensus hedge given the lead-in uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Decaying Plains system will still support wrap-around snow on its
northwest/north side in the cold sector (Corn Belt/Upper
Midwest/Dakotas) on Monday with overrunning snow to the
north/northeast ahead of the warm front as the surface high
retreats into Atlantic Canada. This may support a transition to
rain in some areas as milder air is drawn into the region. In the
warm sector, modest to perhaps locally heavy rain, perhaps driven
by convection, will blossom and expand into/through the mid-South
to the Ohio River Valley. Focus will shift back to the west out of
the southern Rockies as the next system may again tap the Gulf of
Mexico for moisture into the lower Mississippi Valley Wed-Thu, and
perhaps to the East Coast by next Friday.

Temperatures will be mild ahead of the Plains system through the
Southeast, but colder than normal in the Northeast until the high
moves offshore. Much cooler than normal temperatures will follow
behind the lead and subsequent Plains and Northwest systems,
respectively. Temperatures may be variable across the High Plains
but within about 5-15 degrees of normal for the middle of March.

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted mid-level trough across the southern Great Basin
will deepen and become negatively tiled through the next 24 hours as
it moves east toward the Four Corners. At 500 mb a 70-80 kt
cyclonically curved jet will intensify to near 100 kts on the
southeastern flank of the trough. To the east, a low amplitude
trough will drive mid-level northwesterly flow across the
Mid-Atlantic. At the surface, broad lee cyclogenesis will gradually
take place across eastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado with
a dryline trailing south across the southern High Plains. Critical
fire weather conditions are expected across portions of New Mexico
and west Texas.

...New Mexico...
The lee low across New Mexico and Colorado will deepen, slowly at
first, through the day in response to height falls ahead of the
approaching trough. Boundary-layer flow is forecast to increase to
20-30 mph through the day under the intensifying mid-level jet.
Widespread surface humidity of 5-15% will be supportive of critical
fire weather conditions across a broad swath of central and eastern
New Mexico. Humidity values will increase with eastward extent in
response to increasingly moist return flow across west Texas.
Despite the increase in moisture, gusty winds and plentiful fine
fuels will likely support elevated fire weather potential across
eastern New Mexico and far west Texas through the afternoon.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Dry northwesterly surface flow around 15 mph and humidity values of
25-30% are forecast to develop behind a cold front across portions
of Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic through tomorrow afternoon. The dry
boundary-layer and gusty winds may support locally elevated fire
weather conditions through the day. Considerable uncertainty from
cloud/shower activity will limit confidence in deeper diurnal mixing
and more widespread elevated fire weather potential. However,
locally elevated conditions may develop regionally given marginally
supportive fuels and relatively dry and windy conditions.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1152 AM CDT Mon May 17 2021

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

Made minor modifications to the eastern portion of the elevated area
across the southern High Plains based on the expected eastward
extent of the deeply mixed dry airmass.

Elsewhere, added a critical area in northeast North Dakota. Morning
guidance has come in with sustained surface winds near 20 mph. In
addition, several sites are already sustained at 15 mph with
occasional observations near 20 mph. In addition, this portion of
North Dakota was only minimally impacted by recent rainfall and
therefore, fuels remain critically dry amid ongoing drought
conditions.

..Bentley.. 05/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CDT Mon May 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
A closed upper-level low positioned over the lower Great Basin
region will shift east throughout the day, into the lower Rockies by
the end of the period. Marginally enhanced mid-level flow will
accompany the southern periphery of the low/trough throughout this
progression, overspreading portions of the Southwest and southern
High Plains. Farther north, a mid-level trough will begin entering
portions of the Pacific Northwest. At the surface, lee cyclogenesis
will occur along the southern High Plains, with a dry line extending
south into the Big Bend region of West Texas. Likewise, a cold front
will enter portions of northern/western New Mexico throughout the
day.

...Southwest and West Texas...
A combination of diurnal heating/mixing processes west of the dry
line and a strengthening surface pressure gradient will result in
sustained surface wind speeds of 10-15 mph, with locally higher
gusts. Meanwhile, RH values should fall into the teens and single
digits amid widespread extreme/exceptional drought conditions. Fuel
receptivity decreases with eastern extent across the area, however,
the wind/RH combo may be a bit stronger in areas immediately behind
the dry line across eastern New Mexico and far West Texas. Thus,
elevated fire-weather conditions can be expected, with localized
critical conditions possible.

...Northeast Montana and Northern North Dakota...
Warm/dry conditions are expected across the region, with southerly
sustained winds of 10-15 mph, gusting into the 20s mph, as a surface
low strengthens across south-central Canada. Widespread drought
conditions are present, and fuels remain at least marginally
receptive to large-fire spread despite some recent wetting rains in
isolated areas. RH values should fall into low to mid 20s during the
afternoon, supporting elevated fire-weather conditions.

...Southern Plains Heavy Rain/Convection Threat lingers to
mid-late week...
...Developing heat for the East-Central U.S.; Cold/Unsettled with
high-elevation snow over the West/Rockies...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue the trend of establishing an
amplified upper-level pattern across the U.S. with a deep trough
moving into the western U.S. and a warm ridge building over the
eastern U.S.  Downstream from the deep upper trough, there
continues to be a general model trend for a faster northern stream
flow across the northern tier states into southeastern Canada.
Meanwhile, the strengthening of the deep-layer warm high in the
East will continue to keep the stream of Gulf moisture open for
the Plains states especially for eastern to southern Texas on
Friday, followed by a shift in the rain axis toward the southern
High Plains during the weekend.  There is also the tendency for
the rain to become more diurnally-driven with time.  Farther
north, the deep upper trough will keep a good chance of wet snow
for the higher elevation of the northern Rockies especially on
Thursday to Friday.  By early next week, models have recently
trended toward the formation of an occluded low over the northern
Plains as the upper trough exists the northern Rockies.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  Good WPC
continuity was maintained.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Models and ensembles still agree that upper flow pattern over the
lower 48 states will significantly amplify over the next few days.
The upper pattern will be highlighted into midweek by an emerging
digging trough into the West and troughing over the south-central
Plains increasingly blocked by an amplified and warming ridge
building out from the East. Ridge amplification into late this
week will coincide with substantial warming from the Midwest
towards and especially in the East where some record high minimum
and maximum values will be possible, with temperature anomalies
upwards to 10-20F above normal.

Meanwhile, an ongoing but transitional heavy rainfall event should
persist through mid-late week with continued but slowly
diminishing focus over the Southern Plains. WPC QPF shows this
trend, but blocky flow and deep pooled Gulf moisture suggests some
downpours may produce more hefty local amounts and runoff issues.

Digging of amplified upper troughing over the West will support
widespread moderate precipitation from the Pacific Northwest and
Sierra through the north-central Intermountain West/Rockies,
including some mountain enhanced snows to focus over the northern
Rockies. Ahead of the Pacific front that moves into the West,
early week maximum temperatures 10-20F above normal from the
Northwest through the northern Rockies/Plains will abruptly cool
with pattern amplification and wavy cold frontal passage to result
in 10-20F below normal temperatures centered across the
Intermountain West.

Downstream, ejecting western trough impulses and some energy lift
from the southern Plains will shear northward over the central
U.S. on the western periphery of an anchoring east-central ridge.
This conduit will support periods of enhanced convective rains as
moisture and instability are focused along a slow-moving and wavy
front across the north-central U.S.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon May 17 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 23 - 27 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa patt=
ern
across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period.
Dynamical models forecast a  500-hPa trough over the Bering Sea and anomalo=
us
ridging over the Gulf of Alaska, extending to Mainland Alaska. Downstream, =
a
trough is forecasted over the western CONUS and enhanced ridging is predict=
ed
over the central and eastern CONUS. Below normal heights are forecast over =
the
western CONUS, while above normal heights are predicted underneath the ridg=
ing
over the eastern two-thirds of CONUS.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across much of Alas=
ka
associated with above normal heights. Troughing favors below normal
temperatures across the western CONUS. A broad ridge predicted over the
central
and eastern CONUS favors above normal temperatures for most of the eastern =
and
much of central CONUS. However, below normal temperatures are favored over
Southern Texas, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

Predicted surface low pressure leads to increased chances of above normal
precipitation for much of Alaska. Mean surface flow shifts to northeasterly
from the Northern West Coast eastward to the Front Range of the Rockies,
increasing chances of near to below normal precipitation over the western
CONUS, extending eastward to the Central High Plains. Increased odds of abo=
ve
normal precipitation are indicated across the Northern Plains, Great Lakes,
parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley and extending to the Southern High
Plains, ahead of predicted mean troughing. The enhanced ridging increases
probabilities of below normal precipitation over the eastern CONUS and the
Lower Mississippi Valley.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 20% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% o=
f
Yesterday's 12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 20% of Today'=
s
0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset slightly by increasing
uncertainty in regards to the precipitation forecast over the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 25 - 31 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is generally forecast =
to
be similar but less amplified compared to the 6-10 day period. A weakening
500-hPa trough is forecast across the western CONUS with near normal height=
s,
while  ridging is forecast over most of the central and eastern CONUS with
above normal heights.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across western and
northern Mainland Alaska, associated with above normal heights, while surfa=
ce
low pressure leads to increased chances of below normal temperatures across
the
Alaska Panhandle. Troughing favors below normal temperatures across the
Northwestern CONUS and much of California. Elevated chances of near to abov=
e
normal temperatures are forecast across most of the remainder of the CONUS
associated with ridging, consistent with temperature tools.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across Alaska due =
to
predicted storm systems. Surface anomalous northeasterly flow predicted acr=
oss
the western CONUS elevates chances of near to below normal precipitation ov=
er
much of the western CONUS. Conversely, above normal precipitation is favore=
d
over the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio
and
Tennessee Valleys, related to potential storm systems and consistent with t=
he
ERF consolidation forecast tool. Below normal precipitation is favored for
much
of the southeastern CONUS due to predicted ridging.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red

 of
Yesterday's 12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 20% of Today=
's
0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty in regards to the temperature and precipitation
forecast
over the CONUS.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1259 AM CDT Mon May 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level closed low over the lower Rockies will transition to an
open wave, resulting in a relaxing height gradient, as it merges
with a mid-level trough entering portions of the Pacific Northwest.
Consequently, mid-level flow over portions of the Southwest and
southern High Plains will decrease in magnitude as compared to
previous days. With a lack of appreciable mid-level flow, surface
winds are expected to become more light and variable, despite
ambient dry conditions prevailing across parts of the Southwest and
southern High Plains. Thus, fire-weather concerns remain low.

...Damaging severe thunderstorms and potentially significant flash
flooding possible through Wednesday across the Southern Plains and
portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley...

...Warm temperatures and critical fire weather found across the
Northern Plains...

Attention continues to be drawn towards the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley this evening as multiple rounds of severe
thunderstorms and flash flooding threaten the region. The setup
for this continuing active weather pattern includes a stationary
front extending from the Southern Rockies, across the Southern
Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley, as well as into the Ohio
Valley. A warm and humid airmass is also found to the south of
this boundary, with continued replenishing moisture entering from
the western Gulf of Mexico over the next few days. Lastly, a
dryline also exists across the Southern High Plains and should
help spark thunderstorm activity. The most impactful weather
hazard this evening and tonight will likely be associated with
damaging thunderstorms found across West Texas. These storms may
produce damaging wind gusts, isolated tornadoes, and very large
hail. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk
(level 4 of 5) for severe thunderstorms across the region, with an
emphasis on the threat of destructive hail. Along with severe
weather, flash flooding is possible overnight across the Southern
Plains, Central High Plains, and sections of southern
Louisiana/southeast Texas. Numerous reports of flash flooding have
already occurred in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana today.
By Tuesday and Wednesday, flash flooding is forecast to become a
larger concern as heavy rain falls over saturated ground from
southeast Oklahoma, throughout much of East Texas, and southern
Louisiana. Widespread rainfall amounts of 5+ inches are forecast,
with locally higher amounts possible thanks to efficient rainfall
rates found in thunderstorms across the area. Due to the forecast
heavy rain and hydrologic conditions, WPC has issued a large
Moderate Risk (level 3 of 4) for Excessive Rainfall on both
Tuesday and Wednesday throughout the aforementioned regions. The
threat of heavy rain does shift slightly southward on Wednesday
and includes southern Texas. Flash Flood Watches have been issued
for southern Oklahoma, much of north-central and East Texas,
southwest Arkansas, and western Louisiana.

Elsewhere, a cold front entering the Pacific Northwest is expected
to bring light showers and high elevation snow to the Northwest
and eventually into the Northern Rockies by Wednesday. Farther
east, above average temperatures should be found from the Northern
Plains to the Northeast. The warm temperatures will not be as
welcomed across portions of the Northern Plains due to extreme
droughts conditions found in the area. In fact, gusty winds and
low relative humidity has led to critical fire weather in
northeast North Dakota. Red Flag Warnings have are also in effect.

...Southern Plains Heavy Rain/Convection Threat lingers to
mid-late week...
...Developing heat for the East-Central U.S.; Cold/Unsettled with
high-elevation snow over the West/Rockies...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue the trend of establishing an
amplified upper-level pattern across the U.S. with a deep trough
moving into the western U.S. and a warm ridge building over the
eastern U.S.  Downstream from the deep upper trough, there
continues to be a general model trend for a faster northern stream
flow across the northern tier states into southeastern Canada.
Meanwhile, the strengthening of the deep-layer warm high in the
East will continue to keep the stream of Gulf moisture open for
the Plains states especially for eastern to southern Texas on
Friday, followed by a shift in the rain axis toward the southern
High Plains during the weekend.  There is also the tendency for
the rain to become more diurnally-driven with time.  Farther
north, the deep upper trough will keep a good chance of wet snow
for the higher elevation of the northern Rockies especially on
Thursday to Friday.  By early next week, models have recently
trended toward the formation of an occluded low over the northern
Plains as the upper trough exits the northern Rockies.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  Good WPC
continuity was maintained.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Models and ensembles still agree that upper flow pattern over the
lower 48 states will significantly amplify over the next few days.
The upper pattern will be highlighted into midweek by an emerging
digging trough into the West and troughing over the south-central
Plains increasingly blocked by an amplified and warming ridge
building out from the East. Ridge amplification into late this
week will coincide with substantial warming from the Midwest
towards and especially in the East where some record high minimum
and maximum values will be possible, with temperature anomalies
upwards to 10-20F above normal.

Meanwhile, an ongoing but transitional heavy rainfall event should
persist through mid-late week with continued but slowly
diminishing focus over the Southern Plains. WPC QPF shows this
trend, but blocky flow and deep pooled Gulf moisture suggests some
downpours may produce more hefty local amounts and runoff issues.

Digging of amplified upper troughing over the West will support
widespread moderate precipitation from the Pacific Northwest and
Sierra through the north-central Intermountain West/Rockies,
including some mountain enhanced snows to focus over the northern
Rockies. Ahead of the Pacific front that moves into the West,
early week maximum temperatures 10-20F above normal from the
Northwest through the northern Rockies/Plains will abruptly cool
with pattern amplification and wavy cold frontal passage to result
in 10-20F below normal temperatures centered across the
Intermountain West.

Downstream, ejecting western trough impulses and some energy lift
from the southern Plains will shear northward over the central
U.S. on the western periphery of an anchoring east-central ridge.
This conduit will support periods of enhanced convective rains as
moisture and instability are focused along a slow-moving and wavy
front across the north-central U.S.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0111 AM CDT Tue May 18 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals a broad upper-level low
over the central Rockies that is expected to largely remain in place
through the day. This will allow for persistent, though weak, zonal
low to mid-level flow across the Southwest and maintain a surface
low currently residing over southwest Texas. Across the northern
CONUS, surface pressure falls along and ahead of a weak cold front
moving across the Canadian Prairies will allow for enough moisture
return to introduce isolated rain chances and increase RH above
critical thresholds across the Dakotas where conditions have been
dry.

...Southern New Mexico and Southwest Texas...
West to northwesterly flow across the Southwest will introduce areas
of downslope warming and drying across the broader region that may
introduce pockets of elevated fire weather conditions. Persistent
downslope flow has yielding dewpoints in the single digits to low
teens west of a surface low/dryline across southern NM and southwest
TX. Although mid and upper-level flow will be weak, 15-20 mph
surface winds appear are expected across this region and will likely
coincide with afternoon RH minimums near 15%. Given the dry fuels
across this area, elevated fire weather conditions appear likely.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop by mid
to late afternoon across northern AZ and NM this afternoon. Forecast
soundings indicated PWAT values will generally range between 0.4-0.6
inches over a dry boundary-layer, suggesting that a mixture of wet
and dry thunderstorms is possible. However, confidence in the
coverage of dry thunderstorms is fairly low, especially over AZ
where instability will likely be more limited as compared to Monday.

...Southern Plains Heavy Rain/Convection Threat lingers into late
week...
...East-Central U.S. Heat...
...Cold and Unsettled West with Northern Rockies Snows...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium-range product suite was derived days 3-5 (Fri-Sun)
from a composite of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and
12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models. Added 18 UTC GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble means days
6/7 as forecast spread increases. WPC continuity is well
maintained and is in line with newer 00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The lower 48 pattern will significantly amplify as highlighted by
troughing over the West, with lead south-central Plains troughing
blocked by an amplified ridge out from the East. Ridge
amplification offers substantial warming for the Midwest and the
East. Some record high minimum and maximum values will be
possible, with temperature anomalies 10-20F above normal.

Meanwhile, an ongoing heavy rainfall event should persist into
late week with continued but slowly diminishing focus over the
Southern Plains. WPC QPF shows this trend, but blocky flow and
deep pooled Gulf moisture suggests some downpours may produce more
hefty local amounts and runoff issues.

Amplified upper troughing over the West favors some moderate
precipitation for the north-central Intermountain West/Rockies,
including an enhanced snow focus over the northern Rockies. This
occurs as post-frontal conditions cool to 10-20F below normal
across the Intermountain West/northern Rockies.

Downstream, ejecting western trough impulses and some energy lift
from the southern Plains will shear northward over the central
U.S. on the western periphery of the east-central U.S. ridge. This
conduit will support periods of enhanced convective rains as
moisture and instability are focused along a slow-moving and wavy
front across the north-central states. Some activity may spill
over the Great Lakes to the backdoor front tempered Northeast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CDT Tue May 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to deepen across the West over the
next 48 hours. As this occurs, surface pressure falls across the
inter-mountain West will strengthen low and mid-level winds across
much of the Great Basin. This will introduce elevated to critical
fire weather conditions across a region that has seen minimal
rainfall over the past two weeks. Elsewhere across the CONUS,
widespread rain chances and weak low-level flow will limit
additional fire weather threats.

...Southern Great Basin and Southwest...
AHPS analyses suggest that most of the southern Great Basin and
northern AZ have seen almost no rainfall over the past two weeks.
The combination of little rain and slightly above normal
temperatures during this period have resulted in areas of receptive
fuels (10 and 100-hour fuel moisture values below 5% noted in recent
analyses). Strengthening pressure-gradient winds will increase to
near 20 mph by late afternoon and will likely be augmented by
frequent gusts up to 25-30 mph. Deep-boundary layer mixing and
minimal moisture return into the region will support RH reductions
into the 5-15% range. Critical fire weather conditions appear most
likely across southern NV into adjacent areas of southwest UT and
northwest AZ where the strongest mid-level winds are currently
expected, though transient critical conditions are possible in
peripheral areas.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Ensemble guidance and deterministic forecast soundings suggest that
a narrow corridor of dry thunderstorms is possible across northern
UT into western WY and western CO Wednesday afternoon. The approach
of the upper-level wave will act to cool temperatures aloft as well
as provide forcing for ascent across the region. Mid-level moisture
atop a deep, well-mixed boundary layer may support a mix of wet and
dry thunderstorms, though low confidence in the coverage of dry
thunderstorms and fuel readiness preclude any risk areas for this
outlook.

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over the Central
Gulf Coast to the Southern Plains through Thursday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Southern Plains through Wednesday morning...

The quasi-stationary front extending from the Middle
Mississippi/Western Ohio Valleys to the Southern Plains will
slowly dissipate by Wednesday night.  The dryline oscillation over
the Southern Plains will also dissipate ahead of the next system.
Showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop in the moist
air over the Southern/Central Plains and the Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley through Thursday morning.  The WPC has issued a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over the Central Gulf Coast to
the Southern Plains through Thursday.  The showers and
thunderstorms will produce heavy rain over the region producing
numerous areas of flash flooding.  Additionally, the heavy rain
may cause many streams and possibly larger rivers to flood.  On
Wednesday into Thursday morning, the Moderate Risk is mainly over
the Southern Plains.  Additionally, rain will develop over parts
of the Upper Midwest on Tuesday into Wednesday.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Northern Rockies to Northern
California will advance eastward to the Upper Midwest westward to
the Great Basin by Thursday morning.  Rain and highest elevation
snow will develop over parts of the Pacific Northwest into parts
of the Northern Rockies on Tuesday, ending on Wednesday morning.
Behind the front, the snow levels will lower as the rain and
higher elevation snow returns to the Pacific Northwest/Northern
Rockies later on Wednesday afternoon into Thursday morning. As the
front moves onto the Northern High Plains, showers and
thunderstorms will develop overnight on Tuesday, moving into the
Northern Plains by Wednesday morning.  On Wednesday, showers and
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Upper Mississippi
Valley/Upper Great Lakes through Thursday morning.

Elsewhere, upper-level energy will produce rain over parts of
Northern New England through Tuesday evening. Easterly flow off
the Atlantic will aid in producing rain with embedded
thunderstorms over the east coast of Florida through Thursday
morning.

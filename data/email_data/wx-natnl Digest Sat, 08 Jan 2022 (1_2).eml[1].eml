Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu January 06 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 12 - 16 2022

An amplified 500-hPa ridge over the Rockies increases probabilities for abo=
ve
normal temperatures across much of the western and central CONUS. The near
normal temperatures favored for parts of the Great Basin are related to
prevalent surface high pressure that is likely to promote low-level inversi=
ons
with abundant snow cover throughout this region. Near normal temperatures a=
re
also more likely from the Rio Grande Valley eastward along the Gulf Coast
where
increasing chances for widespread precipitation are expected to have a
moderating effect on temperatures. Large negative temperature anomalies (-1=
0
to
-25 degrees F) are forecast across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on day 6,
Jan
12. Although temperatures are expected to moderate after day 6, this anomal=
ous
cold expected at the start of the period enhances probabilities for below
normal temperatures from the Mid-Atlantic northward to New England.

On Jan 12 and 13, a broad area of surface high pressure is forecast to exte=
nd
over the entire CONUS. Later next week, model solutions remain consistent t=
hat
a shortwave trough in the southern stream ejects eastward from the
southwestern
U.S. or northern Mexico with a subsequent track toward the Southeast. Along
its
eastward track, above normal precipitation is favored from the Rio Grande
Valley eastward to the Gulf Coast States. From days 8 to 10 (Jan 14-16), th=
ere
is an increasing chance of surface low development near the East Coast as t=
he
southern stream shortwave trough potentially interacts with the northern
stream. Therefore, near to above normal precipitation is favored across the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Ridging aloft favors below normal precipitation
along the West Coast and also the north-central CONUS.

An amplified 500-hPa trough is expected to persist over the North Pacific
through day 7. Enhanced onshore flow, associated with this trough, favors
above
normal precipitation across southern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhand=
le.
Above normal temperatures are likely to accompany this wet pattern, while n=
ear
to below normal temperatures are more likely for the northern half of Mainl=
and
Alaska.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
the expectation for the onset of a pattern change later in this period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 14 - 20 2022

Model solutions continue to indicate the potential for a retrogression of t=
he
longwave pattern during mid to late January. Negative 500-hPa height anomal=
ies
over the Aleutians and North Pacific are forecast to be replaced by positiv=
e
anomalies by around day 10. Meanwhile, the GFS ensemble mean depicts the
longwave trough axis, initially near the East Coast, eventually shifting to
the
west-central CONUS. This predicted longwave pattern transition during week-=
2
lowers forecast confidence in the temperature and precipitation outlooks.


Near to below normal temperatures are favored for much of the eastern CONUS
which is likely to be affected by amplified troughing throughout the 7-day
period. Farther to the south along the Gulf Coast and Florida, probabilitie=
s
for above normal temperatures are slightly elevated where cold air advectio=
n
is
not expected and 500-hPa heights may begin to rise over the southeastern CO=
NUS
by the end of week-2. Although near normal temperatures are favored across =
the
northern Great Plains, there are increasing chances for anomalous cold to
return later this month. Increased probabilities for above normal temperatu=
res
are forecast throughout much of the western CONUS, due to anomalous 500-hPa
ridging persisting through early week-2.

At the beginning of week-2, a predicted shortwave trough in the southern
stream
favors above normal precipitation across the Gulf Coast States. As describe=
d
in
the 6-10 day outlook, there is an elevated chance of surface cyclogenesis
early
in week-2 near the East Coast. The location of where this surface low
development occurs is likely to be determined by interaction, if any, betwe=
en
the northern and southern streams, and the placement of the 500-hPa trough
axis. Regardless of the exact details on this potential storm=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs track and
intensity, the evolving longwave pattern favors near to above normal
precipitation across the eastern CONUS. If the mean trough axis retrogrades
westward as expected, then the mid-latitude storm track would eventually sh=
ift
more inland towards the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys. This may not occur unti=
l
the end of week-2 or later in the month. The slightly elevated probabilitie=
s
for above normal precipitation, forecast across the northern to central hig=
h
Plains, is related to the expectation of increasing chances of upslope flow
later in week-2. Below normal precipitation is most likely along the West
Coast
as the 500-hPa ridge axis is forecast to shift westward across this region
during week-2.

Since anomalous cold is likely to be located over eastern North America, ne=
ar
to above normal temperatures remain favored for Alaska through week-2. As t=
he
500-hPa troughing over the North Pacific weakens, a drying pattern is
anticipated. However, a wet pattern heading into the week-2 period slightly
elevates probabilities for above normal precipitation across southern coast=
al
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
the expectation of a longwave pattern change during week-2.

FORECASTER: B. Pugh

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, with no changes
or additions made.

..Squitieri.. 01/07/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CST Fri Jan 07 2022/

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude midlevel trough and accompanying speed maximum will
advance east-southeastward from the Pacific Northwest toward the
northern Rockies and adjacent Plains during the Day 1 period. Along
the southern periphery of the midlevel speed maximum, enhanced
downslope flow will favor lee troughing along the central and
southern High Plains -- where modest boundary-layer warming and
drying will occur during the afternoon.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
Westerly surface winds will strengthen this afternoon across parts
of the central and southern High Plains in response to the
sharpening lee trough. Downslope-related warming and drying combined
with diurnal heating will support minimum RH values of 15-25 percent
from the Colorado Front Range southward through east-central New
Mexico. The best overlap of low RH and breezy westerly surface winds
will likely occur across terrain-favored areas of southern Colorado
and east-central New Mexico, where a few hours of locally elevated
fire-weather conditions will be possible. Presently, these
conditions appear too localized to introduce highlights, though
trends will be monitored.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
150 PM EST Fri Jan 07 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Jan 10 2022 - 12Z Fri Jan 14 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin on Monday with an amplified
upper flow pattern as a trough extends southward from a deep upper
low over east-central Canada and ridging prevails across the
western U.S. and Canada. A split flow pattern is likely to develop
across the eastern Pacific and West, as a southern stream low
drops southward near the California coast through the early part
of the workweek. Another Pacific shortwave should approach the
West Coast around midweek with guidance showing varying ideas for
what form it will take thereafter and how it may interact with the
leading upper low. Meanwhile in the East, the pattern may
deamplify somewhat by mid-late week but one or more shortwaves of
uncertain strength and timing will likely track through the
lingering broad mean trough.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Reasonably good predictability exists early in the period as model
guidance has remained consistent and agreeable with the deep upper
trough across the East and ridging across the West. However the
full array of guidance has not improved confidence with ongoing
uncertainties in the rest of the forecast, but there are some
common themes that provide decent continuity in principle.

There is still a majority cluster that has a compact closed low
tracking along the central-southern California coast into far
northern Baja California Monday-Wednesday with subsequent ejection
in response to upstream flow. The new 12Z CMC has deviated from
consensus by pulling its closed low from a more southern part of
the overall shortwave. Then models/ensembles continue to show
their divergence for details of the next Pacific shortwave.
Multiple GFS runs have been closing a low over the eastern
Pacific, and now the 12Z CMC does the same farther south, while
the 00Z ECMWF/CMC agreed more with the ensemble means which have
been maintaining an open shortwave at least until the feature
crosses the West Coast.  Interestingly by late next week the
06Z/12Z GFS runs are not far from the majority solution for the
large scale pattern after subtracting their eastern Pacific upper
low. The 12Z ECMWF provides yet another option, trending somewhat
slower/more separated and bringing the best concentration of
energy into the Northwest instead of digging into the Great
Basin/Four Corners. Preference based on 00Z/06Z guidance was to
follow the model consensus for the leading Pacific feature and
then weight the forecast more to the 00Z ECMWF/CMC and 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means when the next shortwave comes into the
picture.

Meanwhile in the broad cyclonic flow farther east, the best signal
exists for a shortwave to cross the eastern half of the country
around Wednesday-Thursday. As can be the model's occasional bias
with upper troughs, the latest CMC runs are quite amplified (even
pulling off a closed low east of Florida by Friday in the new 12Z
run). Even if not quite an outlier, these CMC runs are extreme
compared to most of the full ensemble envelope.

The late-period transition to half means/half models (versus all
models early) kept somewhat more 00Z ECMWF input relative to the
06Z GFS/00Z CMC given the desire to downplay GFS specifics near
the West Coast and the CMC in the East.

...Weather Highlights...

Drier conditions are likely over much of the contiguous U.S. for
the early part of next workweek as large surface highs influence
the Intermountain West to the central U.S. behind a cold front.
Showers could linger over Florida on Monday as the front passes
through, while generally westerly flow causes lake effect snow
downwind of the Great Lakes especially on Monday but with the
possibility for additional rounds as the week progresses. The
Pacific Northwest should see periods of precipitation as fronts
approach the area, with higher totals over typical upslope areas
of the Olympics and Cascades.  Locally moderate to heavy activity
may be possible over the Olympics and vicinity around midweek when
the area may be on the southeast fringe of an atmospheric river
event aimed at Vancouver Island. The upper low initially dropping
southward near the California coast may spread moisture into the
Southwest by Tuesday-Wednesday. This precipitation should be
fairly light but heavier rainfall may develop over the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley by mid-late week as the upper
low tracks/shears northeastward and the surface pattern becomes
more favorable for drawing moisture northward from the Gulf of
Mexico. It will take additional time to refine the details of
rainfall coverage and magnitude though.

The next round of arctic air will be in place across the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest on Monday, with temperatures of 10-25F
below normal and maximum temperatures staying below 0F in some
areas. By Tuesday this chilly air will spread into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic in modified form, with high temperatures
10-30F below average for one of the coldest days of the season
thus far. Then the central U.S. will see a pronounced warming
trend next week with expanding coverage of max/min temperatures
10-20F above normal Tuesday onward.  Some locations in the
northern two-thirds of the Plains may see even warmer readings
mid-late week. Across the West expect to see daytime highs within
10F on either side of normal through the period, while above
normal lows should become more prevalent with time.  Best
potential for one or more days with plus 10F or greater anomalies
for lows would be over the Southwest and Pacific Northwest as
separate features bring clouds/moisture into those regions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0127 PM CST Fri Jan 07 2022

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

Very minor adjustments were made to the Elevated delineation to
reflect the latest guidance consensus. Otherwise, the previous
forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions made.

..Squitieri.. 01/07/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0209 AM CST Fri Jan 07 2022/

...Synopsis...
Broad large-scale troughing will persist across the western CONUS,
with enhanced west-southwesterly downslope flow supporting the
maintenance of a lee trough across the central and southern High
Plains. An embedded midlevel speed maximum will track
east-southeastward through the base of the large-scale trough,
resulting in the development of a surface low over the southern High
Plains. South of the surface low, breezy surface winds will overlap
dry boundary-layer conditions, yielding a few hours of elevated
fire-weather conditions across the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
West-southwesterly surface winds will gradually strengthen across
the southern High Plains in response to the developing surface low
over the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles. Here, downslope warming and
drying combined with diurnal heating will support RH values of 15-25
percent with 20-25 mph west-southwesterly surface winds. These
meteorological conditions combined with seasonably dry fuels will
favor a few hours of elevated fire-weather conditions during the

SYNOPSIS:   Surface low pressure near the East Coast is favored early in th=
e

period, increasing the potential for heavy snow over parts of the northeast=
ern

contiguous U.S., with possible heavy precipitation across the Gulf States.

Later in the period, the development of mid-level low pressure forecast ove=
r

the Great Plains is expected to promote anomalously cold temperatures and

possible much below normal temperatures over the north-central lower 48.

Mid-level high pressure favored over Alaska is expected to bring more tranq=
uil

conditions for much of the state.



HAZARDS



Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Lower Mississippi

Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southeast, and eastern Texas, Sat, Jan 15.



Slight risk of heavy snow over portions of the Great Lakes, Central

Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast, Sat-Mon, Jan 15-17.



Slight risk of much below normal temperatures over the Northern Plains, Upp=
er

Mississippi Valley, and the western Great Lakes , Tue-Fri, Jan 18-21.



Slight risk of episodes of high winds across coastal portions of central an=

0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensembles feature a broad coverage of positive 500-hPa

Thus, a slight risk of heavy precipitation remains issued for parts of the

Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southeast, and eastern Texas fo=

e 0z GEFS

and 0z ECMWF ensembles showing this mean surface low tracking eastward and

deepening across the eastern U.S and into the Atlantic by day 10 (Jan 17).
This

predicted synoptic setup is expected to draw plenty of moist air from the

Atlantic, where the presence of cold air advection on the backside of the

deepening low supports an increased potential of heavy snowfall over parts =
of

the northeastern CONUS. A slight risk area of heavy snow remains posted for
Jan

15 to 17 and is adjusted to include more of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley=

potential

for cold air damming, which may lead to icing and freezing rain further sou=
th

in parts of the Mid-Atlantic.



Across the western CONUS, surface high pressure remains favored over the Gr=

Diablo and Santa Ana winds in central and southern California, respectively=

Todays ensembles feature a stronger area of positive pressure anomalies ove=

development of downstream troughing east of the Rockies, where ensembles

maintain a broad area of mean surface high pressure descending southward fr=

Canada which could usher anomalously cold air into the north-central CONUS

towards the middle of the period. This is evident in the 0z and 6z GEFS whi=

Plains and the Upper Midwest by the middle of the period, which is also

consistent with reforecast guidance depicting at least a 20% chance of mini=

wever,
these

below normal temperatures remains issued for Jan 18 through the entirety of

week-2, but no longer covers the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and portions of t=

Over Alaska, the aforementioned development of mid-level ridging favored ov=

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri January 07 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 13 - 17 2022

A broad 500-hPa ridge, initially over the Rockies, is forecast to retrograd=
e
westward to the Northeast Pacific from Jan 13 to 17. This ridging aloft
increases probabilities for above normal temperatures for much of the weste=
rn
CONUS. Abundant snow cover and the likelihood of low-level inversions,
associated with surface high pressure, continues to favor near normal
temperatures across parts of the Great Basin. Anomalous cold is forecast to
retreat northward from the Northeast by Jan 13. Since there are no apparent
indications of strong cold air advection among the model solutions during d=
ays
6 to 9, near to above normal temperatures are favored across the central an=
d
eastern CONUS. However, by around day 10 (Jan 17), recent GFS ensemble mean=
s
depict anomalous cold returning to the northern Great Plains.

Model solutions remain consistent that a shortwave trough in the southern
stream ejects eastward from the southwestern U.S. with surface low developm=
ent
across the south-central CONUS on day 7 (Jan 14). This low pressure system =
is
then expected to track east of the Mississippi River with increasing
uncertainty if this parent low tracks northeast to the Great Lakes or refor=
ms
near the East Coast. Although the deterministic 0Z ECMWF model depicts a
northeastward track to the eastern Great Lakes by Jan 16, the preferred GFS
and
ECMWF ensemble means favor the low pressure system tracking to the Ohio Val=
ley
and then reforming near the Mid-Atlantic or New England coast. Along the
predicted tracks of the southern stream shortwave trough and associated low
pressure system, near to above normal precipitation is favored for much of =
the
south-central and eastern CONUS. A broad 500-hPa ridge increases probabilit=
ies
for below normal precipitation throughout the western CONUS.

A 500-hPa trough is expected to persist over the Gulf of Alaska through day=
 7
before weakening and being replaced by a building ridge. Enhanced onshore
flow,
associated with the trough, favors above normal precipitation across southe=
rn
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Near to above normal temperatures
are
favored throughout much of Alaska with good model agreement depicting an
absence of anomalous cold at the higher latitudes of western North America
through mid-January. Probabilities for below normal temperatures are slight=
ly
elevated along the North Slope, based on the GFS model.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
relatively good agreement and consistency on the precipitation outlook offs=
et
by an expected pattern change by day 10.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 15 - 21 2022

A retrogression of the longwave pattern over North America remains likely f=
rom
mid to late January. The GFS ensemble means are consistent and depict a 500=
-
hPa
ridge (trough) becoming centered over the North Pacific and Alaska (Great
Plains) by around day 10, Jan 17. As the 500-hPa ridge amplifies and extend=
s
poleward over Alaska, there is an increasing chance of Arctic air to
overspread
the north-central CONUS later in week-2. Therefore, below-normal temperatur=
es
are favored across the northern to central Great Plains and upper Mississip=
pi
Valley. A two-class change in temperatures from the 6-10 to 8-14 day period
was
made for parts of the northern and central Great Plains, given the predicte=
d
transition in temperatures. Since the West Coast is expected to have positi=
ve
500-hPa height anomalies throughout week-2, increased probabilities for abo=
ve
normal temperatures are forecast for that region. Above normal temperatures
are
also favored for parts of the Southeast where cold air advection is least
likely and there could be a tendency for 500-hPa height rises downstream of
the
amplified trough. The large coverage of elevated near normal mean temperatu=
re
probabilities throughout the eastern and central CONUS is necessary due to =
a
predicted variable temperature pattern during this 7-day period.

Early in week-2, a low pressure system is forecast to track either across t=
he
eastern Great Lakes or near the East Coast. Despite the model differences o=
n
its exact track, this low pressure system favors near to above normal
precipitation for the eastern Great Lakes, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic. As =
a
500-hPa trough axis becomes centered near the 100th meridian, waves of low
pressure may develop and track east along a stationary front close to the G=
ulf
Coast. Therefore, above-normal precipitation is favored from the southern
Rockies and Rio Grande Valley east to the Gulf Coast States. The elevated
probabilities for above normal precipitation forecast across the northern t=
o
central high Plains are related to the increased chance of upslope snow.
Consistent with the expectation of anomalous cold returning to the
north-central CONUS with northwest surface flow, below normal precipitation=
 is
slightly favored for the upper Mississippi Valley. Upstream 500-hPa ridging
enhances probabilities for below normal precipitation to the west of the
Continental Divide.

The building 500-hPa ridge from the North Pacific to Alaska is expected to
result in a drying trend later in week-2. However, due to lingering wetness
heading into week-2, probabilities for above normal precipitation are sligh=
tly
elevated across southern Mainland Alaska. Since anomalous cold is likely to=
 be
located over the higher latitudes of central and eastern North America, nea=
r
to
above normal temperatures are favored throughout Alaska.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted longwave pattern transition and variable temperatures across th=
e
CONUS during the 7-day period.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Lingering heavy snowfall over New England as quick hitting
Nor'easter exits to the northeast...

...Moderate to heavy mountain snow and gusty winds to impact the
Northern Rockies to end the workweek...

...Dangerously cold temperatures located throughout the Northern
Plains and Midwest to briefly retreat on Saturday, before the next
surge of Arctic air enters the region on Sunday...

A rapidly deepening low pressure system approaching Nova Scotia
continues to produce moderate to locally heavy snowfall over
portions of eastern New England. After impacting the Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast earlier today, additional hazardous conditions
remain possible over portions of the eastern Maine coast through
tonight, where the snowfall should exit last. An additional 2-3
inches of snowfall in addition to gusty winds could produce minor
to locally moderate winter storm impacts along eastern Maine
coast, per the WPC Winter Storm Severity Index (WSSI). As cold air
settles in behind the front, cold and blustery conditions are
expected throughout the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast.
With the Great Lakes still mostly free of ice, scattered lake
effect snow bands will persist through tomorrow downwind of Lake
Erie and Ontario, where Lake Effect Snow Warnings and Winter
Weather Advisories are in effect until tomorrow morning. High
pressure settling in overhead should put a temporary lid on the
lake-effect snow machine until later this weekend, when the next
frontal system blows through.

Meanwhile after a stretch of very active and wintry weather across
the Northwest, Pacific moisture entering the Northern
Rockies/Great Basin will shift the heavy snow threat into the
Northern Rockies through tomorrow morning. Snow accumulations up
to five inches (with higher amounts up to a foot in the terrain)
remain possible through tomorrow morning along and east of the
Northern Rockies. Additionally, as a cold front traverses the
region, gusty winds up to 60 mph are expected throughout the
Northwest, Northern Great Basin, and Northern Rockies today. These
potent wind gusts could lead to blowing and drifting snow over
parts of northwestern Montana, where Blizzard Warnings are in
effect.

Otherwise, some relief from the bitter cold is expected over the
Midwest. As a strong area of high pressure slides to the East
Coast on Saturday, it will usher in warm southerly winds to the
Central U.S. on Saturday. This will help return temperatures to
slightly above average. However, this brief warm up will be
short-lived as another arctic cold front surges southward across
the Northern Plains Saturday afternoon and enters the Midwest by
Sunday morning. Light rain showers and pockets of freezing
rain/drizzle are possible along and ahead of this cold front. The
best chances for light freezing rain exist from the
Mid-Mississippi Valley and Midwest on Saturday to the northern
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast by Sunday morning. Farther south, the
aforementioned cold front may spark scattered thunderstorms over
the Lower Mississippi Valley as it clashes with a warm and moist
airmass flowing out of the Gulf of Mexico. A few thunderstorms
could turn severe over Texas and Arkansas, with isolated tornadoes
and damaging wind gusts the main concern. A few areas of heavy
rain may also produce isolated flooding concerns throughout the
Mid-South/Tennessee Valley on Saturday as precipitation falls over
areas that have already experienced a wet start to the year.

Extended Forecast Discussion

334 PM EST Fri Jan 07 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Jan 10 2022 - 12Z Fri Jan 14 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin on Monday with an amplified
upper flow pattern as a trough extends southward from a deep upper
low over east-central Canada and ridging prevails across the
western U.S. and Canada. A split flow pattern is likely to develop
across the eastern Pacific and West, as a southern stream low
drops southward near the California coast through the early part
of the workweek. Another Pacific shortwave should approach the
West Coast around midweek with guidance showing varying ideas for
what form it will take thereafter and how it may interact with the
leading upper low. Meanwhile in the East, the pattern may
deamplify somewhat by mid-late week but one or more shortwaves of
uncertain strength and timing will likely track through the
lingering broad mean trough.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Reasonably good predictability exists early in the period as model
guidance has remained consistent and agreeable with the deep upper
trough across the East and ridging across the West. However the
full array of guidance has not improved confidence with ongoing
uncertainties in the rest of the forecast, but there are some
common themes that provide decent continuity in principle.

There is still a majority cluster that has a compact closed low
tracking along the central-southern California coast into far
northern Baja California Monday-Wednesday with subsequent ejection
in response to upstream flow. The new 12Z CMC has deviated from
consensus by pulling its closed low from a more southern part of
the overall shortwave. Then models/ensembles continue to show
their divergence for details of the next Pacific shortwave.
Multiple GFS runs have been closing a low over the eastern
Pacific, and now the 12Z CMC does the same farther south, while
the 00Z ECMWF/CMC agreed more with the ensemble means which have
been maintaining an open shortwave at least until the feature
crosses the West Coast.  Interestingly by late next week the
06Z/12Z GFS runs are not far from the majority solution for the
large scale pattern after subtracting their eastern Pacific upper
low. The 12Z ECMWF provides yet another option, trending somewhat
slower/more separated and bringing the best concentration of
energy into the Northwest instead of digging into the Great
Basin/Four Corners. Preference based on 00Z/06Z guidance was to
follow the model consensus for the leading Pacific feature and
then weight the forecast more to the 00Z ECMWF/CMC and 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means when the next shortwave comes into the
picture.

Meanwhile in the broad cyclonic flow farther east, the best signal
exists for a shortwave to cross the eastern half of the country
around Wednesday-Thursday. As can be the model's occasional bias
with upper troughs, the latest CMC runs are quite amplified (even
pulling off a closed low east of Florida by Friday in the new 12Z
run). Even if not quite an outlier, these CMC runs are extreme
compared to most of the full ensemble envelope.

The late-period transition to half means/half models (versus all
models early) kept somewhat more 00Z ECMWF input relative to the
06Z GFS/00Z CMC given the desire to downplay GFS specifics near
the West Coast and the CMC in the East.

...Weather Highlights...

Drier conditions are likely over much of the contiguous U.S. for
the early part of next workweek as large surface highs influence
the Intermountain West to the central U.S. behind a cold front.
Showers could linger over Florida on Monday as the front passes
through, while generally westerly flow causes lake effect snow
downwind of the Great Lakes especially on Monday but with the
possibility for additional rounds as the week progresses. The
Pacific Northwest should see periods of precipitation as fronts
approach the area, with higher totals over typical upslope areas
of the Olympics and Cascades.  Locally moderate to heavy activity
may be possible over the Olympics and vicinity around midweek when
the area may be on the southeast fringe of an atmospheric river
event aimed at Vancouver Island. The upper low initially dropping
southward near the California coast may spread moisture into the
Southwest by Tuesday-Wednesday. This precipitation should be
fairly light but heavier rainfall may develop over the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley by mid-late week as the upper
low tracks/shears northeastward and the surface pattern becomes
more favorable for drawing moisture northward from the Gulf of
Mexico. It will take additional time to refine the details of
rainfall coverage and magnitude though.

The next round of arctic air will be in place across the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest on Monday, with temperatures of 10-25F
below normal and maximum temperatures staying below 0F in some
areas. By Tuesday this chilly air will spread into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic in modified form, with high temperatures
10-30F below average for one of the coldest days of the season
thus far. Then the central U.S. will see a pronounced warming
trend next week with expanding coverage of max/min temperatures
10-20F above normal Tuesday onward.  Some locations in the
northern two-thirds of the Plains may see even warmer readings
mid-late week. Across the West expect to see daytime highs within
10F on either side of normal through the period, while above
normal lows should become more prevalent with time.  Best
potential for one or more days with plus 10F or greater anomalies
for lows would be over the Southwest and Pacific Northwest as
separate features bring clouds/moisture into those regions.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 AM EST Sat Jan 08 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Jan 11 2022 - 12Z Sat Jan 15 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin on Tuesday with split flow
across the western U.S. as a southern stream closed low drifts
near Baja California through midweek with ridging across the
Northwest in a Rex block pattern. The southern stream low is
currently expected to push into the Four Corners around Thursday
while additional Pacific energy moves toward the West Coast.
Meanwhile, shortwave impulses will track through broad troughing
in the eastern (especially northeastern) U.S. along with low
pressure/frontal systems.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Reasonably good model agreement and predictability exist early in
the medium range period with deep upper troughing across the East
and ridging across the West undercut by the southern stream upper
low. Most guidance for the 12/18Z (yesterday) cycle was aligned
and consistent with previous runs with the position and closing
off the initial southern stream low feature at least for a period
on Tuesday/Wednesday. The main exception in terms of position was
the 12Z CMC, which has a center position farther to the southwest
compared to the vast majority of other guidance. Then energy
tracking eastward across the Pacific and approaching the West
Coast Thursday shows considerably more variability with strength,
position, and track as well as whether or not the energy closes
off (which GFS runs had been persistent with until the 18Z run).
Trends in recent guidance indicate that impulse may drift in the
eastern Pacific through late week or at least stay limited to the
Northwest with less interaction with the initial low, but with low
confidence. CMC runs are the exception to this in terms of
deterministic guidance, and spaghetti plots show tremendous
variability in the details of the western U.S. flow by Friday and
Saturday.

Meanwhile in the East, initial model agreement is quite good with
the trough axis over the Eastern Seaboard early Tuesday, which
lifts away and relaxes the amplitude of the overall flow by
midweek, though additional shortwaves approach. One upstream
shortwave develops some considerable differences among models by
Wednesday and Thursday. In terms of the 12Z model cycle, the UKMET
and CMC appeared to be outliers in how deep the energy from the
shortwave causes the trough axis to dig in the east-central U.S.,
as confirmed by the 12Z CMC the deepest and the UKMET compared to
individual ensemble members' 500mb heights. However, incoming 00Z
guidance including the GFS and ECMWF show deeper troughing than
their previous runs, even closing off a low across the Atlantic by
Friday, so the trend appears to be in a deeper direction.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was based mainly on a blend of
the 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF early on, phasing in the GEFS and EC
ensemble means as the period progressed to downplay the specifics
of a particular model runs. At the time, did not favor the
CMC/UKMET for the reasons above, but given the way 00Z models are
trending, perhaps their influence with a deeper trough in the East
would have been helpful.

...Weather Highlights...

Drier conditions are likely over much of the contiguous U.S. on
Tuesday as large surface highs influence the Intermountain West to
the central U.S. behind a cold front, and high pressure will push
into the East on Wednesday. Showers could linger over Florida on
Tuesday after the front passes through, while generally westerly
flow could cause lake effect snow downwind of the Great Lakes at
times through the week, though in lesser amounts than during the
short range period Monday. The Pacific Northwest should see
periods of precipitation as fronts approach the area, with higher
totals over typical upslope areas of the Olympics and Cascades.
Locally moderate to heavy activity may be possible over the
Olympics and vicinity around midweek when the area could be on the
southeast fringe of an atmospheric river event aimed at Vancouver
Island. The upper low initially dropping southward near the
California coast may spread moisture into the Southwest by
Tuesday-Wednesday. This precipitation should be fairly light but
heavier rainfall may develop over the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley by mid-late week as the upper low tracks/shears
northeastward and the surface pattern becomes more favorable for
drawing moisture northward from the Gulf of Mexico. It will take
additional time to refine the details of rainfall coverage and
magnitude though.

Cold air will be in place over the Upper Midwest and spreading
into the Northeast on Tuesday, with high temperatures 10-30F below
average for one of the coldest days of the season thus far. Then
the central U.S. will see a pronounced warming trend next week
with expanding coverage of max/min temperatures 10-20F above
normal Tuesday onward. Some locations in the northern two-thirds
of the Plains may see even warmer readings mid-late week. Across
the West expect to see daytime highs within 10F on either side of
normal through the period, while above normal lows should become
more prevalent with time. By the end of the week temperatures are
currently forecast to moderate close to normal.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 AM EST Sat Jan 08 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Jan 11 2022 - 12Z Sat Jan 15 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin on Tuesday with split flow
across the western U.S. as a southern stream closed low drifts
near Baja California through midweek with ridging across the
Northwest in a Rex block pattern. The southern stream low is
currently expected to push into the Four Corners around Thursday
while additional Pacific energy moves toward the West Coast.
Meanwhile, shortwave impulses will track through broad troughing
in the eastern (especially northeastern) U.S. along with low
pressure/frontal systems.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Reasonably good model agreement and predictability exist early in
the medium range period with deep upper troughing across the East
and ridging across the West undercut by the southern stream upper
low. Most guidance for the 12/18Z (yesterday) cycle was aligned
and consistent with previous runs with the position and closing
off the initial southern stream low feature at least for a period
on Tuesday/Wednesday. The main exception in terms of position was
the 12Z CMC, which has a center position farther to the southwest
compared to the vast majority of other guidance. Then energy
tracking eastward across the Pacific and approaching the West
Coast Thursday shows considerably more variability with strength,
position, and track as well as whether or not the energy closes
off (which GFS runs had been persistent with until the 18Z run).
Trends in recent guidance indicate that impulse may drift in the
eastern Pacific through late week or at least stay limited to the
Northwest with less interaction with the initial low, but with low
confidence. CMC runs are the exception to this in terms of
deterministic guidance, and spaghetti plots show tremendous
variability in the details of the western U.S. flow by Friday and
Saturday.

Meanwhile in the East, initial model agreement is quite good with
the trough axis over the Eastern Seaboard early Tuesday, which
lifts away and relaxes the amplitude of the overall flow by
midweek, though additional shortwaves approach. One upstream
shortwave develops some considerable differences among models by
Wednesday and Thursday. In terms of the 12Z model cycle, the UKMET
and CMC appeared to be outliers in how deep the energy from the
shortwave causes the trough axis to dig in the east-central U.S.,
as confirmed by the 12Z CMC the deepest and the UKMET compared to
individual ensemble members' 500mb heights. However, incoming 00Z
guidance including the GFS and ECMWF show deeper troughing than
their previous runs, even closing off a low across the Atlantic by
Friday, so the trend appears to be in a deeper direction.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was based mainly on a blend of
the 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF early on, phasing in the GEFS and EC
ensemble means as the period progressed to downplay the specifics
of a particular model runs. At the time, did not favor the
CMC/UKMET for the reasons above, but given the way 00Z models are
trending, perhaps their influence with a deeper trough in the East
would have been helpful.

...Weather Highlights...

Drier conditions are likely over much of the contiguous U.S. on
Tuesday as large surface highs influence the Intermountain West to
the central U.S. behind a cold front, and high pressure will push
into the East on Wednesday. Showers could linger over Florida on
Tuesday after the front passes through, while generally westerly
flow could cause lake effect snow downwind of the Great Lakes at
times through the week, though in lesser amounts than during the
short range period Monday. The Pacific Northwest should see
periods of precipitation as fronts approach the area, with higher
totals over typical upslope areas of the Olympics and Cascades.
Locally moderate to heavy activity may be possible over the
Olympics and vicinity around midweek when the area could be on the
southeast fringe of an atmospheric river event aimed at Vancouver
Island. The upper low initially dropping southward near the
California coast may spread moisture into the Southwest by
Tuesday-Wednesday. This precipitation should be fairly light but
heavier rainfall may develop over the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley by mid-late week as the upper low tracks/shears
northeastward and the surface pattern becomes more favorable for
drawing moisture northward from the Gulf of Mexico. It will take
additional time to refine the details of rainfall coverage and
magnitude though.

Cold air will be in place over the Upper Midwest and spreading
into the Northeast on Tuesday, with high temperatures 10-30F below
average for one of the coldest days of the season thus far. Then
the central U.S. will see a pronounced warming trend next week
with expanding coverage of max/min temperatures 10-20F above
normal Tuesday onward. Some locations in the northern two-thirds
of the Plains may see even warmer readings mid-late week. Across
the West expect to see daytime highs within 10F on either side of
normal through the period, while above normal lows should become
more prevalent with time. By the end of the week temperatures are
currently forecast to moderate close to normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 AM CST Sat Jan 08 2022

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
A broad midlevel trough and accompanying southwesterly speed maximum
will overspread the southern Rockies and adjacent High Plains, while
a lee surface low evolves southeastward across the TX and OK
Panhandles. A dryline extending south of the surface low will
advance slowly eastward across the southern High Plains, eventually
being overtaken by a cold front during the evening and overnight
hours.

...Southern High Plains...
A few hours of elevated fire-weather conditions are expected across
portions of the southern High Plains during the afternoon hours
today. As the boundary layer diurnally deepens behind the dryline
and south of the surface low, RH values will fall into the 15-20
percent range -- aided by downslope warming and drying. At the same
time, a tightening pressure gradient along the southern periphery of
the surface low will support 15-25 mph west-southwesterly surface
winds with locally higher gusts. The lack of a tighter surface
pressure gradient and stronger boundary-layer winds should limit the
overall fire-weather threat to an extent, though dry fuels (ERCs in
the 70th-80th percentile) will support at least elevated conditions.
By the evening time frame, low-level winds will shift to a northerly
direction behind the cold front, remaining breezy into the overnight
hours.

...Light freezing rain to spread across the Midwest today before
entering the Northeast and northern Mid-Atlantic on Sunday...

...Isolated severe thunderstorms and periods of heavy rain
possible over the next few days from East Texas to the Tennessee
Valley...

...Strong cold front to bring well below average temperatures,
gusty winds, and blowing snow across the northern tier this
weekend...

The main weather system to track this weekend will be a strong
cold front swinging into the central U.S. today and leading to an
area of precipitation to extend from the Lower Mississippi Valley
to the Midwest. Cold air at the surface will allow for light
freezing rain/drizzle to overspread the Ozarks of Arkansas and
Missouri this morning before expanding into Illinois and Indiana
by this afternoon into the early evening hours. Ice accretion is
expected to remain under a tenth of an inch, but even a glaze of
freezing rain can become dangerous on untreated surfaces. By
Sunday morning, showers are forecast to reach into the Northeast
and northern Mid-Atlantic, where fresh snowfall and a cold airmass
remains in place. This will lead to atmospheric conditions
conducive for widespread freezing rain. Luckily, temperatures
should warm to near or above freezing by the afternoon hours for
the I-95 corridor. However, subfreezing temperatures will remain
stubborn across the Interior Northeast. Total ice accretion may
add up to over a tenth of an inch throughout central Pennsylvania,
as well as lower New York State and western
Massachusetts/Connecticut. Residents in the aforementioned regions
are urged to double check road conditions and the current forecast
before traveling, as well as taking extra precautions where roads
may become slick.

As the approaching cold front reaches the central and southern
Plains, warm southerly flow out of the Gulf of Mexico will allow
for numerous showers and thunderstorms to develop from East Texas
to the Tennessee and Lower Ohio valleys. Isolated thunderstorms
could turn severe from the Upper Texas Coast to northeast Arkansas
today, with damaging wind gusts, large hail, and a marginal threat
for tornadoes potentially affecting the region. Scattered
instances of heavy rain are also possible and could lead to
isolated flash flood concerns from East Texas to central Kentucky.
Showers and thunderstorms will be slow to exit the Mid-South and
finally shift into the Southeast by Sunday night, but not before
dropping around 1 to 3 inches of rain.

Winter looks to keep a tight grip on the northern tier this
weekend as a fresh surge of arctic air drops into the Northern
Plains today and enters the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes on Sunday.
Low temperatures are expected to remain below zero with blustery
winds making it feel much colder. These winds combined with a
healthy snowpack will lead to blowing snow, which can create low
visibility and dangerous travel conditions. Winter Weather
Advisories have been issued throughout North Dakota, northeast
South Dakota, and western Minnesota to highlight the concern.
Elsewhere, much quieter weather is in store for the western U.S.
and Rockies compared to the last several days. A few pockets of
light snow found in the high terrain of western Colorado is the
only notable precipitation forecast through early Monday.

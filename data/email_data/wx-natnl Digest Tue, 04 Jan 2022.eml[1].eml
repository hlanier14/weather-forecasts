Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1006 AM CST Mon Jan 03 2022

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast. Fairly rapid warming and drying
will occur across parts of the southern High Plains based on
observed morning soundings. Meteorological conditions could become
elevated for brief periods. Fuels should continue to dry after
recent snowfall.

..Wendt.. 01/03/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CST Mon Jan 03 2022/

...Synopsis...
In the wake of the strong trough moving offshore across the East
Coast, mid-level flow is forecast to weaken temporarily as the flow
pattern becomes more zonal. A weak surface low/trough in the lee of
the Rockies will support southerly flow returning to the southern
High Plains through the afternoon. The warming of the already dry
airmass may result in localized fire weather potential and drying of
fine fuels.

...Southern High Plains...
As overall forcing slackens under the zonal flow regime, southerly
return flow should result in a quick warm up in temperatures across
the southern High plains through the afternoon. South/southwesterly
flow may periodically reach 15+ mph through the day in response to
troughing in the lee of the southern/central Rockies. Diurnal RH
minimums are expected to be low, (10-15%) given the dry airmass and
little moisture in place. Fine fuel moisture has decreased following
the freeze and precipitation event several days ago. The warming and
dry airmass should further augment fuel availability supporting some
fire weather potential today. However, the lack of stronger
background winds should keep the threat primarily local in nature.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1218 PM CST Mon Jan 03 2022

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EAST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO INTO
PORTIONS OF THE TEXAS PANHANDLE AND SOUTH PLAINS...

The forecast remains on track. Elevated conditions appear more
probable within the lee of the Davis Mountains. The elevated has
been expanded into this area. The critical area remains unchanged.
Fuels are still expected to dry today and through tomorrow
afternoon. Recent snowfall may offer some mitigation of fire
ignition/spread potential on a local basis, but the meteorological
conditions expected should support fire weather concerns by the
mid/late afternoon.

..Wendt.. 01/03/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CST Mon Jan 03 2022/

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow will dominate the mid levels across the CONUS as a strong
jet streak and shortwave trough move across the West Coast and nose
eastward into the central Rockies. Surface high pressure will shift
eastward as a surface low moves out of the northern High Plains
toward the Great Lakes. Warming temperatures and strengthening
low-level winds across the Southern High Plains will produce
critical fire weather conditions within already dry fuels.

...Southern High Plains...
Strong winds aloft associated with a low amplitude shortwave trough
and an attendant mid-level jet will overspread the region starting
early D2/Tuesday. The development of a lee trough will further
enhance surface flow through the day as widespread winds of 20-30
mph develop from the west/southwest. Downsloping will further
augment the dry antecedent airmass with model soundings showing
boundary-layer mean RH of 8-15% through the afternoon across much of
the High Plains. With several days of drying occurring after the
hard freeze and precipitation event, fine fuels across the Texas
Panhandle and eastern New Mexico have shown rapid increase in
dryness. Continued drying suggests sufficiently dry fuels will be in
place along with a favorable overlap of strong winds and low RH for
elevated and critical fire weather conditions.

Localized elevated fire weather conditions may also occur further
north across portions of the central High Plains where stronger
downslope westerly flow is expected to materialize. Here greater
uncertainty in humidity values and fuel status suggests a more
localized threat.

...Additional rounds of heavy coastal rain and mountain snow for
the Northwest...

...Much below normal temperatures for the north-central U.S. and
accumulating snow from the Appalachians to the Northeast late
week...


...General Pattern Overview...

The upper level pattern over the CONUS during the medium range
period should remain fairly amplified but also progressive.
Troughing sweeping through the East Thursday into Friday should
give way to a brief period of upper ridging this weekend as an
arctic air mass settles into the north-central U.S. in the wake of
the strong cold front. Meanwhile, a strong atmospheric river may
bring another round of heavy rain and mountain snows to the
Northwest late this week with the upper trough sliding eastward
into the Central U.S. and eventually the Great Lakes/Northeast and
ridging beginning to build again over the West. Another trough may
approach the West Coast by next Monday.


...Guidance assessment and uncertainty...

The latest model guidance continues to show fairly good synoptic
scale agreement through at least Saturday, with some lingering
mesoscale timing and amplitude differences with individual
shortwaves. Regarding the early period East Coast low, the 06z/12z
GFS continues to be faster/more offshore with the track while the
bulk of the rest of the guidance suggests something closer to the
coast and a more impactful winter storm from the lower Ohio Valley
into the Northeast. By Sunday, the 06z GFS was considerably
stronger with a cut off upper low over the Southwest, which did
not have much ensemble support, but it appears the 12z has backed
off somewhat with that. By day 7, there are also some timing
differences with the next system moving towards the West Coast.

The WPC forecast was based primarily on a multi-deterministic
model blend through Saturday. After this, the GFS was dropped due
to the issues in the West described above, and contributions from
the ensemble means were increased to account for growing late
period uncertainties. This approach provided a relatively
consistent forecast compared to the previous WPC blend.


...Sensible Weather...

There will be multiple Pacific storm systems that will affect the
Pacific Northwest and inland across portions of the Great Basin
and the Northern Rockies. This will result in heavy rain and heavy
mountain snow for Thursday and Friday, with a likely atmospheric
river event for northern Oregon and southwest Washington during
this time. A drying trend should commence in time for the weekend
across much of the West as high pressure builds back into the
region. Meanwhile, an area of accumulating snow is possible north
and west of a low pressure system tracking across the Mid-Atlantic
and deepening off the Northeast Coast Thursday-Friday. The latest
guidance shows the best potential for at least a couple of inches
across the central Appalachians/lower Ohio Valley into the
northern Mid-Atlantic and New England. More showers and storms are
likely to make a return to the Gulf Coast region and into the
Tennessee Valley by Sunday ahead of the next front.

Temperatures are expected to be much below normal across the
central/northern Plains to the Upper Midwest through the end of
the week with a large surface high of arctic origin governing the
weather pattern for this region. Subzero highs are once again
likely for portions of eastern Montana, North Dakota, and northern
Minnesota, and highs in the teens settling as far south as Kansas
on Thursday. Some moderation of the severe cold may come across
this region on Saturday ahead of the next arctic surge into the
northern tier states on Sunday, which is not expected to be as
intense as the earlier arctic blast. Elsewhere, seasonably cold
conditions are expected west of the Continental Divide with
readings generally within 10 degrees of climatological averages,
and mild across the southern Plains and Deep South with highs
running 5 to 15 degrees above average this weekend.

...Multiple rounds of heavy snow forecast across the Northwest and
Northern Rockies through midweek, with heavy rain and flooding
possible along coastal regions of Oregon and Washington...

...Potent low pressure system to enter the Northern Plains and
Upper Midwest on Tuesday, with gusty winds found across the Plains
and light-to-moderate snow located throughout the Upper Midwest
and Great Lakes into the day on Wednesday...

...Next system to enter the Central High Plains on Wednesday will
spread potentially heavy snow across portions of eastern Wyoming
and western Nebraska...

An active and wintry weather pattern will continue to impact much
of the Northwest and Northern Rockies as prevalent onshore flow
from the eastern Pacific and two separate impulses of upper level
energy traverse this part of the Nation. The first system is
currently entering the interior Northwest and will spread snow
eastward into the Northern Rockies by Tuesday morning. By Tuesday
afternoon, a separate wave of low pressure and associated moisture
surge will enter southwestern Oregon. Heavy coastal rain is
possible and may lead to isolated instances of flooding from
southwest Oregon to the far northern California coastline.
Widespread total snowfall amounts over a foot are likely through
Wednesday evening across the Cascades and high terrain of the
Northern Great Basin and Northern Rockies, which will add onto an
already healthy snowpack. Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather
Advisories are in effect.

Snow is also expected to spread east of the Rockies and into parts
of the Plains and Upper Midwest/Great Lakes over the next few
days. The aforementioned low pressure system spreading across the
Northwest today will enter the Northern Plains on Tuesday. As it
does so, gusty winds up to 65 mph can be expected throughout the
Central High Plains. Meanwhile, light to moderate snowfall will be
found to the north of the low on Tuesday and Wednesday while
extending from eastern North Dakota to the Upper Great Lakes.
Gusty winds and higher snow totals could make driving treacherous
throughout far northern Wisconsin and the U.P. of Michigan from
late Tuesday night into Wednesday. Thus, Winter Storm Watches have
been issued here.

An additional system to track for potential winter weather hazards
is forecast to reach the Central High Plains by Wednesday. A
well-defined quasi-stationary boundary will focus a possibly heavy
band of snow from southeast Wyoming to western Nebraska through
Wednesday night before weakening and shifting into the Central
Plains. Snowfall totals could top 6 inches within the heaviest
axis. Meanwhile, on the cold side of this boundary an arctic
airmass is forecast to enter the north-central United States.
Subzero low temperatures are expected throughout the Dakotas and
Montana on Wednesday, with single digit temperatures reaching into
the Upper Midwest as well.

Elsewhere, a winter storm is currently winding down along the
coastal Mi-Atlantic and will completely come to an end early this
evening. Temperatures will drop well below freezing tonight across
the Mid-Atlantic states, therefore any melted snow will quickly
refreeze on roadways and sidewalks. For the Southern High Plains,
gusty winds and low relative humidity may lead to Critical Fire
Weather on Tuesday from east-central New Mexico into the Texas
Panhandle.

FOR TUESDAY JANUARY 11 - MONDAY JANUARY 17: Anomalous mid-level low pressur=
e
is
predicted to continue from the end of week-1 into the beginning of week-2
across the Northeast, bringing increased chances for much below normal
temperatures to the area. The ECMWF ensemble mean depiction of this mid-lev=
el
trough is more amplified and persists longer compared to the GEFS ensemble
mean, translating to the ECMWF reforecast tool indicating an increased risk
for
much below normal temperatures being more expansive and prolonged compared =
to
the GEFS. The ECMWF reforecast tool shows at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile from the Northeast to
Mid-Atlantic during the 8 to 10 day period (Jan 11 to 13) with the extreme
anomalous cold lingering across New England until Jan 14, whereas the GEFS
reforecast tool shows these thresholds being primarily focused over the
Northeast significantly tapering off by Jan 13. A slight risk of much below
normal temperatures is posted for the Northeast, Jan 11 to 12, where the bo=
th
the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures
falling to the lowest 10th percentile and 0 Deg F. A moderate risk of much
below normal temperatures is designated for portions of the Northeast, Jan =
11
to 12, where both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools show a 40% chance of
temperatures reaching hazardous thresholds, with the greatest probabilities
indicated for day 8 (Jan 11). Both reforecast tools also indicate elevated
chances of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 5th percentile where =
the
moderate risk is highlighted. This hazard will be monitored in the upcoming
days for possible extension of the much below normal temperature risk.



Surface high pressure is anticipated to form over the Great Basin during
week-2, which could support episodes of increased Diablo and Santa Ana wind=
s
in
central and southern California, respectively. A slight risk of episodes of
high winds is designated for coastal portions of central and Southern
California during week-2. There is inherent uncertainty regarding the detai=
ls
of the orientation and placement of this surface high, and thus the timing =
and
locality of this wind hazard. Therefore, a broad period of time is highligh=
ted
for these regions.



A series of surface lows are forecast to form over the Gulf of Alaska durin=
g
the period, which supports an increased risk of episodic heavy precipitatio=
n
and high winds across the southeastern Mainland of Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle. A slight risk of heavy precipitation is designated for parts of =
the
southeastern Mainland of Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, Jan 11 to 15, whe=
re
the reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of 3-day liquid equivalent
totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch (2 inches locally). A sli=
ght
risk of heavy snow is posted across parts of the southeastern Mainland of
Alaska, including higher elevation areas of the Kenai Peninsula where heavy
precipitation is most likely to be in the form of snow. A slight risk of hi=
gh
winds is highlighted for coastal portions of the southeastern Mainland of
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, Jan 11 to 15, where the reforecast tools
indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile
and
35 mph.



Mid-level troughing is predicted across western and northern Mainland Alask=
a
from the beginning to middle of week-2, supporting enhanced chances for
anomalous cold across the region. The GEFS reforecast tool has a stronger
signal for extreme cold potential, showing higher probabilities and a great=
er
area anticipated to reach hazardous thresholds. This tool shows at least a =
20%
chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and -2=
0
Deg F across northwestern and northern Mainland Alaska, including Seward
Peninsula from the beginning to middle of the period. The ECMWF, however,
favors the majority of the much below normal temperatures remaining north o=
f
the Seward Peninsula. Due to these differences and uncertainty regarding th=
e
potential of temperatures reaching hazardous thresholds , a related much be=
low
normal temperature area is not included at this time but will be monitored =
in

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon January 03 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 09 - 13 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in very good agreemen=
t in predicting an
amplified
500-hPa circulation pattern across the forecast domain. During the 6-10 day
period, strong ridging is forecast to be centered over Eastern Siberia, and=
 a
trough is forecast downstream over the Aleutians expanding northeastward to
western Mainland Alaska, with associated below normal 500-hPa heights. The
predicted anomalous ridging over the western CONUS continues to progress to
the
east in ensemble means with positive 500-hPa height anomalies forecast acro=
ss
most of the CONUS. However, anomalous troughing and associated below normal
500-hPa heights are forecast over parts of the Northeast.

Increased probabilities of below normal temperatures are indicated over
northwestern Mainland Alaska underneath below normal 500-hPa heights and
offshore low-level flow. Above normal temperatures are favored over parts o=
f
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, associated with predicted
low-level onshore flow. A ridge forecast over the western CONUS favors
elevated
probabilities for near to above normal temperatures for the western and
central
CONUS and Southeast underneath predicted above normal 500-hPa heights. Belo=
w
normal temperatures are predicted over parts of the western Great Lakes, pa=
rts
of the Mid-Atlantic, and much of the Northeast due to forecast troughing.

Forecast low-level offshore flow leads to increased chances of near to belo=
w
normal precipitation over parts of western Mainland Alaska. Above normal
precipitation is favored for southeastern Alaska due to predicted onshore
flow.
The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of above normal
precipitation for parts of the Pacific Northwest. Below normal precipitatio=
n
is
favored over much of the western CONUS eastward to the north-central CONUS,
underneath predicted above normal 500-hPa heights. Elevated chances of belo=
w
normal precipitation also extend to the Great Lakes and Northeast, behind a
forecast mean trough. Near to above normal precipitation is favored for par=
ts
of the Southwest, Southern Plains and Southeast, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool.

tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 11 - 17 2022

The week-2 model forecasts depict a similar circulation pattern from the 6-=

the main features.

Below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of western and
northern Mainland Alaska, associated with forecast low-level easterly flow.
Above normal temperatures are favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska and =
the
Panhandle underneath an anomalous ridge and low-level onshore flow. Near to
above normal temperatures are favored over most of the CONUS, as above norm=
al
mid-level heights are predicted to persist during the period and also
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. However, below normal
temperatures are favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic and much of the
Northeast, also supported by the temperature consolidation tool.

CONUS, under the predicted above normal 500-hPa heights and supported by th=
e
reforecast tools. Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of the
Southwest, Southern Plains, and the Florida Peninsula, supported by the

shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=

the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

...Additional rounds of heavy coastal rain and mountain snow for
the Northwest...

...Much below normal temperatures for the north-central U.S. and
accumulating snow from the Appalachians to the Northeast late
week...


...General Pattern Overview...

The upper level pattern over the CONUS during the medium range
period should remain fairly amplified but also progressive.
Troughing sweeping through the East Thursday into Friday should
give way to a brief period of upper ridging this weekend as an
arctic air mass settles into the north-central U.S. in the wake of
the strong cold front. Meanwhile, a strong atmospheric river may
bring another round of heavy rain and mountain snows to the
Northwest late this week with the upper trough sliding eastward
into the Central U.S. and eventually the Great Lakes/Northeast and
ridging beginning to build again over the West. Another trough may
approach the West Coast by next Monday.


...Guidance assessment and uncertainty...

The 00z/06z model guidance continues to show fairly good synoptic
scale agreement through at least Saturday, with some lingering
mesoscale timing and amplitude differences with individual
shortwaves. Regarding the early period East Coast low, the 06z/12z
GFS continues to be faster/more offshore with the track while the
bulk of the rest of the guidance suggests something closer to the
coast and a more impactful winter storm from the lower Ohio Valley
into the Northeast. By Sunday, the 06z GFS was considerably
stronger with a cut off upper low over the Southwest, which did
not have much ensemble support, but it appears the 12z has backed
off somewhat with that. By day 7, there are also some timing
differences with the next system moving towards the West Coast.

The WPC forecast was based primarily on a multi-deterministic
model blend through Saturday. After this, the GFS was dropped due
to the issues in the West described above, and contributions from
the ensemble means were increased to account for growing late
period uncertainties. This approach provided a relatively
consistent forecast compared to the previous WPC blend.


...Sensible Weather...

There will be multiple Pacific storm systems that will affect the
Pacific Northwest and inland across portions of the Great Basin
and the Northern Rockies. This will result in heavy rain and heavy
mountain snow for Thursday and Friday, with a likely atmospheric
river event for northern Oregon and southwest Washington during
this time. A drying trend should commence in time for the weekend
across much of the West as high pressure builds back into the
region. Meanwhile, an area of accumulating snow is possible north
and west of a low pressure system tracking across the Mid-Atlantic
and deepening off the Northeast Coast Thursday-Friday. The latest
guidance shows the best potential for at least a couple of inches
across the central Appalachians/lower Ohio Valley into the
northern Mid-Atlantic and New England. More showers and storms are
likely to make a return to the Gulf Coast region and into the
Tennessee Valley by Sunday ahead of the next front.

Temperatures are expected to be much below normal across the
central/northern Plains to the Upper Midwest through the end of
the week with a large surface high of arctic origin governing the
weather pattern for this region. Subzero highs are once again
likely for portions of eastern Montana, North Dakota, and northern
Minnesota, and highs in the teens settling as far south as Kansas
on Thursday. Some moderation of the severe cold may come across
this region on Saturday ahead of the next arctic surge into the
northern tier states on Sunday, which is not expected to be as
intense as the earlier arctic blast. Elsewhere, seasonably cold
conditions are expected west of the Continental Divide with
readings generally within 10 degrees of climatological averages,
and mild across the southern Plains and Deep South with highs
running 5 to 15 degrees above average this weekend.

...General Pattern Overview...

The upper level pattern over the continental U.S. through the
beginning of next week should remain fairly amplified but also
progressive.  A strong shortwave trough and associated Nor'easter
will exit the East Coast Friday, and this should give way to a
Canadian surface high and cold weather settling across the
east-central U.S. in the wake of the strong cold front.  By the
weekend, another cold front crosses the Plains with a renewed
surge of arctic air for the north-central U.S., and a surge of
moisture ahead of it across the Gulf Coast region.  Upper level
ridging sets in across the West by early next week.


...Guidance assessment and uncertainty...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in very good synoptic scale
agreement through the weekend with some mesoscale timing and
amplitude differences with the individual shortwave passages.  The
GFS is slightly more amplified with the trough originating from
the West Coast Saturday as it tracks eastward across the Plains
Sunday, and also a bit more potent with a northern stream
shortwave dropping south from the Hudson Bay region late on
Monday, although excellent agreement with the large scale trough
expected to be over the East by that time.  There are also some
modest differences with a southern stream closed low near southern
California, but close enough to support a general model blend.

The WPC forecast was based primarily on a multi-deterministic
model blend through Saturday, and then gradually increasing use of
the ECENS and GEFS means through early next week.


...Sensible Weather...

After an active period of weather during the short range period
across the Pacific Northwest, some lingering rain and mountain
snow is still likely from northern California to western
Washington, and snow for the Northern Rockies, on Friday.  A
drying trend should commence in time for the weekend across much
of the West as high pressure builds back into the region.
Meanwhile, an intensifying nor'easter off the New England Coast
may still produce some lingering snow showers for much of the
Northeast states, with the heaviest QPF likely offshore by Friday
morning.  More showers and storms are likely to make a return to
the Gulf Coast region and into the Tennessee Valley by Sunday
ahead of the next front.

Temperatures are expected to be quite cold across the
central/northern Plains to the Upper Midwest through the end of
the week with a large surface high of arctic origin governing the
weather pattern for this region.  Highs in the teens settling as
far south as central Indiana and Illinois are likely on Friday.
Some moderation of the severe cold may come across this region on
Saturday ahead of the next arctic surge into the northern tier
states on Sunday, which is not expected to be quite as intense as
the earlier arctic blast.  Elsewhere, seasonably cold conditions
are expected west of the Continental Divide with readings
generally within 10 degrees of climatological averages, and mild
across the southern Plains and Deep South with highs running 5 to
15 degrees above average this weekend.

...Heavy snow for the Cascades, Northern/Central Rockies and
Intermountain West through Wednesday...

...Deepening winter storm to produce heavy snowfall over parts of
The Upper Midwest/Great Lakes beginning today...

...Cold air pours down into Great Plains through mid-week;
Critical Risk of Fire Weather for parts of Southern Plains today...

...Potentially disruptive winter weather to impact parts of the
Tennessee Valley on Thursday...

Persistent upper-level troughing and the shortwave energy that
rides along it in the West will be the impetus for heavy snow
across the Northwest mountains over the next few days. Moist
Pacific air will stream into the Northwest and interact with
surface fronts draped across the region today leading to heavy
snow potential for the Cascades, Northern/Central Rockies and
Intermountain West. This steady stream of moisture will allow for
this heavy snow threat to spread out over the course of a few
days. An organized area of low pressure will emerge over the
Pacific Northwest on Wednesday leading to more snowfall for the
Cascades and Olympics. Generally, between 2-4 feet of snow can be
expected for the Cascades down through the Central Rockies by
Wednesday night. Low elevation showers, with locally heavy
rainfall, will also impact portions of the Oregon/northern
California coast today before the next system shifts the focus for
precipitation into northern Oregon and Washington on Wednesday.

A low pressure system will eject from the Northern Rockies today
and begin strengthening almost immediately. This system will
spread snow and gusty winds across parts of the Upper Midwest
tonight before spreading into the Upper Great Lakes by Wednesday
morning. Anywhere between 4-8 inches of snow can be expected
across the Upper Midwest while parts of the Upper Great Lakes may
see higher totals closer to a foot by Thursday morning. The cold
front associated with this system will fly across the Great Plains
from north to south over the next couple of days, ushering in a
very cold airmass on its backside. An area of low pressure will
develop once the aforementioned front arrives along the central
Gulf coast on Thursday. This low pressure will pull Gulf moisture
into the region in the form of showers and isolated thunderstorms
while spreading snowfall over parts of the Tennessee Valley. Highs
over parts of the Northern/Central Plains on Wednesday will be
between 25-40 degrees below normal with highs over central and
eastern Montana peaking between -5 to -15 degrees. Dry conditions
caused by downsloping and strong winds generated by a lee trough
and mid-level jet will contribute to a Critical Risk of fire
weather today over parts of eastern New Mexico and the Texas
panhandle.

0141 AM CST Tue Jan 04 2022

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A low amplitude trough and strong mid-level jet streak will move
across the Central Rockies and Plains through the day. As strong
flow overspreads the region, a lee low and trough should develop
supporting strong westerly flow across the central and southern High
Plains. Warming temperatures and drying conditions will likely
support elevated and critical fire weather potential through the
afternoon.

...Southern High Plains...
Enhanced by flow aloft from the aforementioned jet and surface
troughing in the lee of the Rockies, west/southwesterly flow should
increase through the day across portions of eastern NM into portions
of west TX and OK. Warming temperatures during the day should
overlap with a very dry airmass supporting diurnal RH minimums of
8-15% across much of the southern High Plains. While recent
precipitation and cold temperatures have tempered fuels somewhat
across the region, fine fuels have shown a fair bit of drying over
the last several days. With surface gusts of 20-30 mph expected
through the afternoon, additional drying of the low RH airmass and
fine fuels should support a risk for elevated and critical fire
weather conditions across portions of eastern NM and the TX
Panhandle.

A low-end risk for locally elevated fire weather conditions may also
extended across the central Plains where stronger westerly downslope
flow should develop during the afternoon. On the fringes of the
warmer airmass and within recent precipitation, humidity values may
struggle to reach near critical criteria. However drying fine fuels
and gusty west winds may support a few hours of dry and breezy
conditions.

0153 AM CST Tue Jan 04 2022

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Mostly zonal flow will persist into Day2/Wednesday with strong flow
aloft meandering slowly northward across the Rockies and central
CONUS. At the surface, a cold front will move south early in the day
across the southern High Plains before southerly flow returns in the
afternoon. A second much stronger front moving south through the
northern Rockies should also arrive later in the evening and early
morning hours of Day3/Thursday. Across much of the High Plains,
moderated temperatures and marginally dry humidity should develop
along with gusty, but confined surface winds of 15-20 mph. Fuels
will be drier after several days of dry and windy conditions, but
the quick shot of cool air may temper fine fuels enough to cause
some availability issues. Given the potential for a more moist
boundary layer with RH in the 25-30% range, the probability of
sustained elevated fire weather conditions appears low. However, a
few hours of localized elevated conditions may develop especially
across the northern TX/OK Panhandles and elevated probabilities will
be reevaluated should model guidance trend drier and more widespread
with gusty winds.

If you are located in this coastal area, move off the
beach and out of harbors and marinas.

Tsunami advisories mean that a tsunami capable of producing
strong currents or waves dangerous to persons in or very near
the water is expected or is already occurring.  Areas in the
advisory should not expect widespread inundation.  Tsunamis
are a series of waves dangerous many hours after initial
arrival time.  The first wave may not be the largest.

At 827 PM Pacific Standard Time on January 14 an earthquake with
preliminary magnitude 1.0 occurred
near the Tonga Islands.

The tsunami advisory will remain in effect until further notice.

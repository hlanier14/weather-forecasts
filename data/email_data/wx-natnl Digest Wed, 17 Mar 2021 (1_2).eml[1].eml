1038 AM CDT Tue Mar 16 2021

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN/EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND
PORTIONS OF WEST TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. No changes are needed.

..Wendt.. 03/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0139 AM CDT Tue Mar 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
A potent compact upper low and mid-level jet streak will rotate
across the southern Four Corners and eject eastward across the
southern High Plains through today. Strong pressure falls at the
surface are expected across the Texas panhandle as a lee low
develops rapidly this afternoon and evening. Strong winds and low
humidity across portions of the southern High plains will support
widespread critical fire weather conditions.

...Eastern New Mexico and west Texas...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions are expected across
portions of the Stacked Plains and west Texas as an area of low
pressure in the lee of the Rockies ejects eastward across the
southern Plains. Regional model soundings show a very dry airmass in
place with daytime humidity values as low 3 to 4% across southern
New Mexico. The extremely dry conditions will be accompanied by very
strong westerly winds of 30-40 mph, resulting from momentum
transport from an 80-90 kt mid-level jet streak aloft. Fuel dryness
remains above average thanks to little recent precipitation. This
suggests widespread critical fire weather conditions are likely. The
nature of the dry/windy conditions also indicates that locally
extremely critical conditions may develop for a couple hours where
fine fuels have cured further. Fuel dryness remains too low at this
time to introduce more widespread extremely critical conditions.

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 161738
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 16 2021

SYNOPSIS: Model guidance shows one surface cyclone over the Central U.S. at
the
beginning of the forecast period, with another developing near the Southern
Rockies. This setup appears likely to bring two chances for heavy rain to
portions of the southern U.S. during the first half of Week-2. Beyond these
systems, mid-level high pressure forecast off the West Coast is likely to k=
eep
the remainder of the country fairly dry during the period. Mid-level low
pressure is forecast across Alaska throughout Week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Central and Southern Plains,
Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and the
Southeast, Wed-Thu, Mar 24-25.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 19 - TUESDAY MARCH 23:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!sMFLayKCAtY_TFLQRKqvKee9elCUMzNB7bT5wct8g8cunt4sss0-MAZMMTI3p=
7Rj7Qs0d97Z$

FOR WEDNESDAY MARCH 24 - TUESDAY MARCH 30: Week-2 continues to appear fairl=
y
quiet, tied to a deamplifying synoptic pattern coupled with the transition
season timing limiting temperature hazard considerations in the absence of
substantial circulation anomalies. Model differences persist regarding the
evolution of anomalous 500-hPa troughing across the Central U.S. at the
beginning of the forecast period. The GEFS has trended toward the more
suppressed trough of the ECMWF, although it remains more progressive. The
timing differences between the two model suites appear tied to the ECMWF
closing off the mid-level low, leading to a less transient pattern at the
start
of the period. Around the periphery of the longwave pattern, shortwave
disturbances are likely to trigger multiple surface disturbances. The first=
 is
likely to be lifting toward the Great Lakes at the start of the period, whi=
le
the next round of lee cyclogenesis occurs downstream of the Southern Rockie=
s.



A slight risk of heavy precipitation is maintained for portions of the Grea=
t
Plains eastward through the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and over portions of
the
Southeast during March 24-25. This area represents different timing and
cyclone
impacts between the aforementioned GEFS and ECMWF model differences. The GE=
FS
focuses heavy rain tied to the advancing cold front from the initial cyclon=
e
over the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley on the 24th across
roughly the eastern half of the highlighted hazard area. The ECMWF instead
highlights heavy rain potential on the 24th and 25th that slowly shifts
eastward across the targeted region tied to the second system tracking
eastward
out of the Southern Rockies. Given the different model perspectives, the ar=
ea
highlighted for a slight risk of heavy rain accordingly represents the
greatest
confluence of these two forecast outcomes regarding the chance of an inch o=
f
rain falling during 24 hours. While not highlighted on the forecast map giv=
en
the anticipated lack of broad impacts, localized river flooding is possible=
 to
continue into Week-2 across portions of the Missouri River Basin from
antecedent rainfall that could be somewhat exacerbated by additional rain f=
rom
these two cyclones. For more information on flood outlooks please refer to
your
local River Forecast Center via
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://water.weather.gov/ahps/rfc/rfc.php__;!!=
DZ3fjg!sMFLayKCAtY_TFLQRKqvKee9elCUMzNB7bT5wct8g8cunt4sss0-MAZMMTI3p7Rj7d9H=
3DbR$ .



Anomalous 500-hPa troughing forecast across Alaska during Week-2 supports a
fairly cool and wet pattern across the state. While onshore flow from the
Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska likely support locally heavy precipitation,
typical predictability concerns for the higher latitudes limit confidence i=
n
targeting any periods of widespread heavy precipitation. Modest forecast
temperature anomalies, coupled with warming climatological minimum
temperatures
during Spring, limit any Week-2 cold weather concerns. While no hazards are
anticipated for Alaska during the forecast period, the relatively cool and =
wet
period favored during Week-2 would suggest increased concern for eventual
break
up of river ice later during April due to the buildup of snow water.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
211 PM EDT Tue Mar 16 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 19 2021 - 12Z Tue Mar 23 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging will continue a stead shift eastward Friday through
the weekend starting from over the High Plains and southern Canada
on Friday and reaching Labrador and the East Coast by Monday. A
trough over the East Coast Friday will lift northeastward but
trailing energy will likely linger over the Southeast through
Monday before slowing shifting offshore, keeping an active pattern
for Florida. A system over the Pacific Northwest Friday will shift
east to the northern Great Plains by Monday, but a reinforcing
trough will dig over the Southwest this weekend before turning
northeast over the central part of the CONUS by Tuesday as another
low pressure system tracks from the Gulf of Alaska to the Pacific
Northwest.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A deterministic blend of the 00Z ECMWF/06Z GFS was preferred
through the weekend for the trough exiting the Northeast Friday
night and the trough over the Northwest and the amplifying trough
over the Southwest this weekend. The 00Z Canadian was much
stronger with the east coast trough/low as it moves offshore. Out
west the 00Z CMC was faster with the progression in the Northwest
and the 00Z UKMET was more amplified with the trough in the
Southwest.

Early next week there were timing and strength differences with
the next wave from the Gulf of Alaska with the 00Z ECMWF stronger
and more progressive than the 06Z GFS and 00Z CMC, so the
preference favors the 00Z ECENS mean and 06Z GEFS mean for Days 6
and 7.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A slow exiting cold front over the Southwest looked to maintain
precip chances along the coastal portions of the Southeast into
Florida over the weekend and maybe Monday (for south Florida)
depending on how close any systems that develop along the front
may be. High pressure over the northern Mid-Atlantic will maintain
cool temperatures this weekend for the Carolinas into Florida
while return flow over the central part of the country makes for
above normal temperatures (up to 20 degrees above normal) to
spread east from the northern Plains Friday across the Great Lakes
this weekend and the Northeast next week. Near record high
temperatures are possible this weekend over the far northern
Plains.

The western system will spread low elevation rain and higher
elevation snow from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern/Central
Rockies and northern Great Basin into Monday as the southern
portion of the upper trough slows the system progression.
Precipitation will expand eastward as surface low pressure
organizes to the lee of the Rockies and lifts northeastward,
drawing in Gulf moisture ahead of the front. The next low pressure
system brings precipitation mainly to the Pacific Northwest on
Monday. Cooler than normal temperatures along the West Coast
expand east to the Rockies behind the front.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTH TEXAS RIO GRANDE VALLEY...

Given the potential for near 10% RH, particularly along the lower
Rio Grande Valley, critical highlights have been added for most of
South Texas along and near the Valley. Portions of Deep South Texas
are the most likely to see RH below 20% for the longest duration.
With 850 mb winds of 30-45 mph during the early afternoon, there is
a brief period where sustained winds could exceed 20 mph; however,
15-20 mph will be more common. TICC fuel guidance shows cured
grassed with above average fuel loading which increases confidence
in the potential for larger fires.

..Wendt.. 03/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CDT Tue Mar 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
A deep mid-level low is forecast to move across Texoma toward the
ArkLaTex and become negatively tiled by early evening. At the
surface, a strong area of low pressure will move rapidly east
northeast, trailing a Pacific cold front across much of the southern
Plains. Gusty winds and dry conditions behind the low may support
elevated to local critical fire weather conditions through the day.


...Rio Grande Valley...
Behind the departing upper low, gusty northwesterly winds are likely
across much of southwestern Texas. The passage of the cold front
overnight and through the early morning hours will reduce surface RH
somewhat given cooler temps. However, widespread RH of 20-25% is
expected from diurnal mixing and the modified dry continental
airmass. Elevated fire weather conditions appear likely with the
possibility of locally critical conditions where terrain enhancement
may support stronger sustained winds.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue March 16 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 22 - 26 2021

Today's models are in good agreement on the longwave 500-hPa height pattern
across the forecast domain during the 6-10 day period. An amplified pattern=
 is
predicted, featuring anomalous ridging centered south of the Aleutians, ove=
r
the Eastern Pacific, and across the eastern CONUS, with anomalous troughing
forecast over Mainland Alaska and the southwest CONUS.

A strong west-to-east mid-level flow forecast over the Bering Sea and into
southwest Alaska supports an active storm track across much of Alaska,
increasing chances of above normal precipitation across the Mainland south =
of
the Brooks Range, and for the Aleutians and Alaska Peninsula. North of this
storm track, negative height anomalies are predicted which, coupled with
relatively cold easterly low-level flow from Canada, favor below normal
temperatures across the state.

Downstream of ridging over the eastern Pacific, storm activity is forecast =
to
be suppressed, enhancing the likelihood of near to below normal precipitati=
on
for western parts of the Lower 48. A trough is forecast to amplify downstre=
am
of this ridge, favoring near to below normal temperatures for much of the
western CONUS. Within this trough, a storm system is predicted to develop o=
ver
parts of the Four Corners region, amplifying and moving eastward during the
period. This leads to increased chances of above normal precipitation for t=
he
Southwest and central U.S., east to near the Appalachians. Ahead of the
trough,
strong southerly low-level flow favors above normal temperatures for most o=
f
the eastern half of the CONUS. Probabilities are especially high across the
Great Lakes region and Northeast, where forecast positive height anomalies =
are
large and temperature tools are in good agreement. The cold front predicted=
 to
move eastward during the period is expected to encounter anomalous ridging =
in
the eastern U.S., which would help to suppress precipitation as it approach=
es
the coast. This increases chances of near to below normal precipitation alo=
ng
the Eastern Seaboard.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5=
,
due to excellent model agreement on the large-scale pattern, combined with
good
agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 24 - 30 2021

Models remain in fairly good agreement on the large-scale pattern forecast
across the domain during the week-2 period. The pattern over the CONUS is
forecast to shift eastward, compared to the 6-10 day period, as well as
deamplify somewhat (due to natural uncertainty in longer leads, coupled wit=
h a
more progressive pattern). The height pattern forecast over the Alaska regi=
on
is very similar to the 6-10 day period. Unlike the 6-10 day period, the las=
t
several deterministic GFS runs have poor run-to-run continuity, and don't
align
well with their respective ensemble run. This indicates that there is some
uncertainty in the week-2 pattern. The uncertainty is largest over the cent=
ral
and eastern CONUS, where models disagree on the amount of troughing that
persists over the CONUS from the 6-10 day period to week2. Today's manual
500-hPa blend features troughing centered from the Four Corners region,
northeastward to the Great Lakes region. However, the associated 500-hPa
anomalies are small.

The week-2 forecast temperature and precipitation probabilities across Alas=
ka
align closely with the 6-10 day forecast, as the 500-hPa pattern is expecte=
d
to
persist into week-2 (though probabilities are lower due to increased
uncertainty). Ridging and positive height anomalies are forecast to move
further onshore over the western CONUS, leading to increased chances of abo=
ve
normal temperatures in the West, and favoring above normal temperatures fro=
m
the West Coast, east to the Northern Plains. Troughing forecast to move acr=
oss
the central U.S. enhances the likelihood of near to below normal temperatur=
es
from the Four Corners region to the Central and Southern Plains. One or mor=
e
storm systems predicted to form near the trough, and expand east and north,
favor above normal precipitation for parts of the Southwest, Southern Plain=
s,
and throughout most of the eastern CONUS. Despite the forecast trough movin=
g
into parts of the East, very large and persistent positive temperature
anomalies are predicted earlier in the week-2, favoring above normal averag=
e
temperatures across the eastern half of the CONUS during week-2.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Yesterday's
operational 18z GFS centered on Day 10, and 50% of Today's 0z European
Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the dynamical models for most of the domain, and fairl=
y
good agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools, offset somewh=
at
by larger uncertainty in the anomaly pattern forecast over parts of the
central
and eastern U.S.

In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=

...Widespread thunderstorms causing dangerous severe weather and
flash flooding are forecast for central/southern portions of the
Plains into the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys and Deep South through
Thursday...

...Another round of snow expected for the central/southern parts
of the Rockies and High Plains through tomorrow morning...

...Critical fire weather threat continues through tomorrow in the
Southern Plains...

As the low pressure system that has caused the wintry weather
across the Rockies and central U.S. over the past few days
continues to weaken, another energetic upper-level trough is
forecast to cause another surface low to strengthen and spread
additional active weather to the central and eastern U.S. over the
next couple of days. Through tonight, this low pressure system is
forecast to track over the Southern Plains with convection
spreading ahead of it. Thunderstorms across the south-central U.S.
could be severe, and the Storm Prediction Center has a widespread
Slight Risk in place with a localized Enhanced Risk for portions
of northern Oklahoma and south-central Kansas. Meanwhile, a
Moderate Risk of flash flooding is located over the Deep South
today, where ongoing heavy rain is likely to continue over a
narrow corridor of southern Mississippi and Alabama along and
south of a stationary front serving to focus the storms.
Additionally, on the backside of the surface low, snow is once
again possible for the Rockies and spreading into portions of the
Plains, though amounts are forecast to be lower and focus south
compared to this past storm. However, 6-12 inches of snow can be
expected across the higher elevations of southern Colorado to
northern New Mexico through tonight, and accumulating snow of a
few inches is also possible for the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles.
A Blizzard Warning is in place for far southeastern Colorado as
winds increase as well.

As the low pressure system tracks eastward Wednesday,
thunderstorms will again be widespread ahead of it across the
southeastern quadrant of the country. A Moderate Risk of severe
weather is forecast for parts of the Lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys and into the Southeast through Wednesday night,
with tornadoes, high winds, and large hail all dangerous threats
that can be expected. Also, with rainfall totals of 2-4 inches
across parts of the Central Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley
and into the Tennessee Valley and Southeast, flash flooding is
another concern. A large Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in
place for these areas for Wednesday and Wednesday night. Light
mixed precipitation or snow is possible along the northern edge of
the precipitation shield, and light accumulations are possible for
parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley. The low system will
continue shifting eastward Thursday, and could cause severe
weather across eastern portions of the Ohio Valley toward the
Southeast and Carolinas--currently an Enhanced Risk of severe
weather is in place. Locally heavy rain is also possible Thursday.

In the Southern Plains, low humidities and gusty winds as well as
dry ground could lead to fire danger today in the Southern High
Plains and over southern Texas/the Rio Grande Valley tomorrow, so
Critical Risks are outlooked by the Storm Prediction Center and
Red Flag Warnings are in place. Elsewhere, the Pacific Northwest
and the northern half of California can expect precipitation
chances to increase by Thursday morning as an upper-level low and
frontal system move slowly toward the region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
511 PM EDT Tue Mar 16 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 19 2021 - 12Z Tue Mar 23 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging will continue a stead shift eastward Friday through
the weekend starting from over the High Plains and southern Canada
on Friday and reaching Labrador and the East Coast by Monday. A
trough over the East Coast Friday will lift northeastward but
trailing energy will likely linger over the Southeast through
Monday before slowing shifting offshore, keeping an active pattern
for Florida. A system over the Pacific Northwest Friday will shift
east to the northern Great Plains by Monday, but a reinforcing
trough will dig over the Southwest this weekend before turning
northeast over the central part of the CONUS by Tuesday as another
low pressure system tracks from the Gulf of Alaska to the Pacific
Northwest.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A deterministic blend of the 00Z ECMWF/06Z GFS was preferred
through the weekend for the trough exiting the Northeast Friday
night and the trough over the Northwest and the amplifying trough
over the Southwest this weekend. The 00Z Canadian was much
stronger with the east coast trough/low as it moves offshore. Out
west the 00Z CMC was faster with the progression in the Northwest
and the 00Z UKMET was more amplified with the trough in the
Southwest.

Early next week there were timing and strength differences with
the next wave from the Gulf of Alaska with the 00Z ECMWF stronger
and more progressive than the 06Z GFS and 00Z CMC, so the
preference favors the 00Z ECENS mean and 06Z GEFS mean for Days 6
and 7.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A slow exiting cold front over the Southwest looked to maintain
precip chances along the coastal portions of the Southeast into
Florida over the weekend and maybe Monday (for south Florida)
depending on how close any systems that develop along the front
may be. High pressure over the northern Mid-Atlantic will maintain
cool temperatures this weekend for the Carolinas into Florida
while return flow over the central part of the country makes for
above normal temperatures (up to 20 degrees above normal) to
spread east from the northern Plains Friday across the Great Lakes
this weekend and the Northeast next week. Near record high
temperatures are possible this weekend over the far northern
Plains.

The western system will spread low elevation rain and higher
elevation snow from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern/Central
Rockies and northern Great Basin into Monday as the southern
portion of the upper trough slows the system progression.
Precipitation will expand eastward as surface low pressure
organizes to the lee of the Rockies and lifts northeastward,
drawing in Gulf moisture ahead of the front. The next low pressure
system brings precipitation mainly to the Pacific Northwest on
Monday. Cooler than normal temperatures along the West Coast
expand east to the Rockies behind the front.

0134 AM CDT Wed Mar 17 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN RIO GRANDE VALLEY...

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low will mature and move rapidly northeast across
Oklahoma and Texas through the day today. a 100 kt mid-level jet
will move east with the low across the mid-south. A cold front
trailing from the surface low across western Missouri will move
across Texas reaching the coast by this afternoon. Critical fire
weather conditions will be possible along the southern Rio Grande
Valley in the dry post front airmass.

...Rio Grande Valley...
Northwesterly flow behind the departing cold front and upper-low
will bring dry downslope air to much of south Texas. Surface RH of
7-15% will be accompanied by sustained surface winds of 20-30 mph.
With dry fuels in place, critical fire weather conditions are
expected. Elevated conditions will extend northwestward to west
Texas, but increasing humidity from cooler air behind the front will
limit the potential for more robust fire weather conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CDT Wed Mar 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
In the wake of the fast moving upper low Day1/Wednesday high
pressure will build quickly across the western and central portions
of the CONUS. Troughing will continue across the East where
widespread precipitation and cooler temperatures are expected. The
high pressure will serve to limit wind speeds across the Southwest.
This along with cooler temperatures behind the departing storm
system should result in conditions unfavorable for widespread
organized fire weather on Day2.

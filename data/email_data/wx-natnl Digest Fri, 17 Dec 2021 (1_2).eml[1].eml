30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR JANUARY 2022

The January 2022 temperature and precipitation outlooks are based on the
predicted patterns for the Week 3-4 period from the multiple linear regress=
ion
tool, a subset of dynamical models for the Week 3-4 period, La Ni=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDa
composites,
lagged MJO composites, and dynamical model guidance.  The outlook reflects =
the
ongoing La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa, as below-average sea surface temperatures=
 continue across
the
central and eastern equatorial Pacific, while suppressed convection was
observed near and west of the Date Line this past month. The oceanic and
atmospheric observations reflect La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions which =
are likely to
persist
through the winter. The MJO strengthened recently, and may be a major facto=
r
in
the January temperature and precipitation patterns over Alaska and the CONU=
S.



La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites would generally favor colder than norma=
l conditions across
the northern tier, and warmer conditions across the southern tier of the
CONUS.
 The dynamical model guidance from the NMME and C3S generally reflects that
pattern, though a bit warmer than expected over the eastern CONUS compared =
to
composites.  Lagged impacts from the MJO, currently in phase 7, would favor=
 a
colder first half the month for much of the CONUS. That signal is also part=
ly
reflected in the Week 3-4 MLR tool and many of the Week 3-4 dynamical model=
s.
A continuation of a robust MJO signal through Phases 8,1, and 2 would resul=
t
in
a pattern flip for the latter half of the month, and that increases
uncertainty
for this outlook. The increased uncertainty is reflected in modest
probabilities and low coverage where signals are destructive and patterns a=
re
most likely to flip mid-month.



The temperature outlook has a broad area of EC in the Plains, where the NMM=
E
and C3S dynamical models strongly favor above normal temperatures, but MJO
composites and shorter-term guidance favor a colder start to the month, so =
the
official outlook is colder than the models across much of the central and
eastern CONUS. MJO impacts to temperature from the Rockies to the West Coas=
t
are usually smaller (lower correlations in the lagged composites), so the w=
arm
signal was retained for the Southern Rockies and the cool signal for the
Pacific Northwest. There are some tools that would indicate below normal
temperatures across the Northern Plains as well, but those signals are weak=
 in
the monthly outlooks, and transient if related to MJO, so the cool signal f=
rom
the Pacific Northwest is not translated eastward. Lagged MJO composites and
the
MLR tool favor some relative warmth to start the month for western Alaska, =
so
probabilities for below normal temperatures from the dynamical models and L=
a
Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites are muted there. Signals for below normal =
temperatures are
retained for southern Mainland Alaska and parts of the Alaska Peninsula as
those areas have less destructive interference from the intraseasonal
variability to offset the whole-month guidance and reflection of seasonal
scale
influences.



The precipitation outlook largely resembles La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa compos=
ites and dynamical
model guidance, though a bit drier in the Ohio and Tennessee Valley due to =
the
potential early month cold/trough leading to a southward push of the mean
storm
track early in Jan 2022. Odds for below normal precipitation across the
southern tier are more modest due to the early month potential for impacts
from
the MJO to have some tropical connections for moisture and troughing near t=
he
West Coast. Lagged MJO composites favor storminess shifted northward across
the
Bering Sea early in the month, so above normal precipitation is favored for
the
western Coast of Alaska, and below normal precipitation probabilities are
slightly elevated for the southern coast of Mainland Alaska. That forecast
pattern represents a small shift from the monthly dynamical model guidance.

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EST Thu Dec 16 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

The January-February-March (JFM) 2022 temperature outlook favors above-norm=
al
seasonal mean temperatures for the south-central and eastern U.S. The large=
st
probabilities (above 50 percent) for above-normal temperatures are forecast
across much of the Gulf Coast States and parts of New England. Probabilitie=
s
of
below-normal temperatures are elevated for parts of the northern High Plain=
s,
northern Rockies, Pacific Northwest, northern California, and most of Alask=
a.
The JFM 2022 precipitation outlook favors below-normal seasonal precipitati=
on
amounts from southern California and the Southwest east to the southern Gre=
at
Plains along with parts of the Southeast. Below-normal precipitation is
slightly favored for coastal southern Alaska. Above-normal seasonal
precipitation amounts are most likely across the Great Lakes, Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys, northern Rockies, Pacific Northwest, and western Mainlan=
d
Alaska. Equal chances (EC) are forecast among areas where seasonal mean
temperatures and seasonal accumulated precipitation amounts are expected to=
 be
similar to climatological probabilities.



La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions are present across the equatorial Pacif=
ic Ocean, as
represented in current oceanic and atmospheric observations. The official C=
PC
ENSO forecast indicates that La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions are likely=
 to persist through
the winter and early spring. The influence of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa cont=
inued to play a
major
role in the temperature and precipitation outlooks during
January-February-March and February-March-April 2022.

BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS

FUgOEuOoMeZpGuW8ys145qGDBjdXcyJp$

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

Oceanic and atmospheric observations reflect La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa condi=
tions  During the
past four weeks (Nov 14 =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD Dec 11), sea surface te=
mperatures were below
(above)-
average across the equatorial eastern and central (western) Pacific. The
latest
Nino-3.4 index is -1.1 degrees C. Negative subsurface temperature anomalies
continue to persist at a depth of 150 meters near and to the east of the Da=
te
Line. Integrated upper-ocean heat anomalies from 180 to 100W declined rapid=
ly
during September and early October and then weakened in magnitude from late
October to early November. Suppressed convection remains anchored across th=
e
central equatorial Pacific where enhanced trade winds continue along with
anomalous upper-level westerlies. The coupled ocean-atmospheric system is
consistent with La Nina conditions.



The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) strengthened during late November and i=
ts
enhanced phase propagated eastward to the West Pacific by early December. A=
s
the MJO destructively interfered with the ongoing La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa,=
 the MJO became
less
coherent during mid-December. Although the MJO could influence the mid-
latitude
circulation pattern over North America heading into January, large uncertai=
nty
exists as the well-established La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa may disrupt the typ=
ical forcing
associated with an eastward propagating MJO over the Pacific.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

The CPC SST consolidation for the Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo-3.4 region depicts =
negative SST
anomalies remaining at or below -0.5 degrees C through FMA and then near
average from the late spring through the summer. The North American Multi
Model
Ensemble (NMME) ensemble mean forecast for the Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo-3.4 SS=
T anomaly depicts a
slightly slower transition to near average during the next six months. Base=
d
on
the observational and model forecast indicators as of early December 2021, =
the
official CPC/IRI ENSO outlook favors La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions pe=
rsisting through
FMA
2022 with a transition to ENSO-neutral becoming more likely by AMJ 2022.



PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa temperature and precipitation composites were a ma=
jor tool relied
upon
through FMA 2022. Dynamical model guidance such as the North American
Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and the Calibration, Bridging, and Merging (CBa=
M)
version of the NMME were used. The consolidation tool, which includes NMME
input and various statistical tools, was also used especially after the
predicted transition to ENSO-neutral conditions by late spring. Given the
expectation of drought across the southern Great Plains heading into the
spring, low soil moisture conditions were considered for this region,
beginning
in MAM when lower soil moisture can have a warming influence on surface
temperatures. At later leads, decadal trends in temperature and precipitati=
on
were the primary tool used in creating the seasonal outlooks.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - JFM 2022 TO JFM 2023

TEMPERATURE

Only minor adjustments were made to the previous temperature outlooks,
released
on November 18, as La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa continues to be the major contr=
ibutor to the
predicted climate state during JFM and FMA 2022. Given the ongoing MJO and =
its
potential influence on the mid-latitude circulation pattern over North Amer=
ica
not only heading into January but also continuing through March, probabilit=
ies
are tempered. Decadal trends, nearby positive SST anomalies, and an expecte=
d
mean seasonal storm track to the west enhance probabilities for above-norma=
l
temperatures across parts of New England. Probabilities, exceeding 50 perce=
nt,
for above-normal temperatures are also forecast across much of the Gulf Coa=
st
States and parts of the Southeast, based on La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa compos=
ites along with
good
model agreement and continuity. Compared to last month, the coverage of EC =
was
expanded over the north-central CONUS during JFM and FMA due to the likelih=
ood
of a highly variable temperature pattern through the early spring. Also,
decadal trends are neutral or lean slightly cold for this region during the=
se
three-month periods. Below-normal temperatures are most likely across the
northern High Plains, northern Rockies, Pacific Northwest, and much of Alas=
ka
through FMA due to good agreement among dynamical and statistical tools. Si=
nce
La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa may continue to favor below-normal temperatures th=
rough at least the
early spring, probabilities of below-normal temperatures are slightly eleva=
ted
for the Pacific Northwest along with southern Mainland Alaska and the Alask=
a
Panhandle during MAM. Compared to the previous release on Nov 18,
probabilities
for above-normal temperatures were slightly increased across the southern
Great

PRECIPITATION

The precipitation outlooks for JFM and FMA 2022 are consistent with La Ni=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
composites which favor below-normal precipitation across the southern tier =
of
the CONUS with above-normal precipitation more likely from the Great Lakes
south to the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys along with the Pacific Northwest an=
d
northern Rockies. The wet signal across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys,
related
to La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa, becomes strongest during the late winter and e=
arly spring. During
JFM and FMA, the latest dynamical model guidance backed off on favored dryn=
ess
across much of California. The more recent model output and consideration o=
f
the likely wet pattern during mid to late December prompted a decrease in
coverage and probabilities of below normal precipitation for California fro=
m
JFM to FMA. These three month time periods are one of the wettest in the
seasonal precipitation cycle. Another modification from the previous outloo=
k
on
Nov 18 was a slight increase of probabilities for below normal precipitatio=
n
across the Florida Peninsula during JFM and FMA, based on good model agreem=
ent
along with a strong dry signal in La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites. Dyna=
mical models are in
good agreement for elevated probabilities of below (above)-normal
precipitation
across parts of southern coastal Alaska (western and northern Mainland Alas=
ka)
during JFM, FMA, and MAM. The NMME and the CPC consolidation tool were
primarily used for the precipitation outlooks during AMJ and MJJ. Beyond th=

time period, decadal trends in precipitation became the primary tool.

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor changes. Low-end
elevated conditions will persist across portions of the southern
High Plains where lingering gusty winds and dry fuels overlap for a
few hours this afternoon. The Elevated area was expand southward
slightly where slightly warmer and drier conditions may develop. See

Surface lee troughing will intensify across the central High Plains
as a mid-level trough approaches the central CONUS. Modestly dry and
breezy conditions will develop during the afternoon, with some
threat for fire spread apparent. Despite cool temperatures and RH
struggling to dip below 20 percent, widespread 15+ mph sustained
southerly winds atop extremely dry fuels will foster at least
low-end Elevated conditions by afternoon peak heating.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The period begins Friday with a vigorous shortwave moving through
the Northeast U.S. with surface low pressure exiting the coast.
Meanwhile, a southern stream shortwave will move through the
Southern Plains this weekend, eventually into the Southeast, with
a potentially well organized coastal low developing in the Gulf of
Mexico and sliding across Florida on Tuesday and into the western
Atlantic by Wednesday. Elsewhere, weaker shortwaves move through
the flow across the far northern tier of the U.S. with upper level
troughing becoming established off/over the West Coast early next
week.

Overall, the guidance is in good agreement with the synoptic
pattern through much of the period. The UKMET seemed a bit faster
with systems than the rest of the guidance, so it was not included
in todays blend. Otherwise, a general model blend between the 06z
GFS and the 00z ECMWF and CMC worked well for days 3-5 within a
pattern with above average forecast confidence. By days 6-7, some
bigger questions begin to emerge regarding details of an organized
surface low near the Southeast early next week and its proximity
to the coast. There are also differences out west with evolution
of a system in the eastern Pacific and interactions with the West.
Generally, these are typical differences for that late in the
period and so a roughly 50/50 blend of the ensemble means with the
deterministics seemed to offer a good starting point consistent
with the previous WPC forecast.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Northern stream upper trough passage and an exiting frontal low
may support some lingering snows Sun over northern New England and
off the lower Great Lakes. Locally enhanced rain should focus with
waves along a trailing/stalling front sunk through the Gulf Coast
and Southeast into early next week. The heaviest rains should stay
off the Gulf Coast on Monday, but a period of moderate to heavy
rain will likely impact portions of Florida by Tuesday. Depending
on proximity of the surface low to the coast, locally heavy
rainfall may clip portions of the Southeast coast as the low moves
out into the western Atlantic.

An upper trough and surface system passage will support lingering
terrain enhanced precipitation over the Northwest on Sunday.
Details remain less certain upstream over the eastern Pacific, but
there remains a good guidance signal that an amplified upper
trough digging early next week would offer potential to focus
ingredients for moderate to heavy precipitation for north-central
CA considering slow system approach, a developing moisture plume,
and favored southern facing terrain enhancement. Some heavier
model qpf solutions would favor local runoff/flooding issues. The
main precipitation focus, including heavy Shasta and Sierra snows,
is set to spread down across central-southern CA into midweek,
with additional activity spreading across the Great Basin terrain
to the Rockies with inland shortwave system progression. There is
also then an emerging guidance signal for upper trough energy to
dig from Alaska to renew precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
by next Wed/Thu.

Upper ridging across the nations midsection should spread above
normal temperatures (though not nearly as extreme as current
values) from the northern/central Plains southward towards the
Gulf Coast with daytime highs potentially 15 to 20F above normal
for the southern High Plains by next Thursday. Elsewhere,
temperatures through the medium range should be near seasonal
averages for much of the East, with slightly below normal temps
associated with weak shortwaves through the northern tier and also
the shortwave through the Southeast early in the period.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject into the Plains states
tomorrow/Friday, with a surface cold front expected to sag southward
across the central U.S. In the post-cold frontal environment, a
window of dry and breezy conditions amid 50+ F surface temperatures
may develop across portions of the central High Plains, where fuels
are expected to remain extremely dry and very conducive to fire
spread. Similar to Day 1, RH may struggle to dip below 20 percent
along the Colorado/Kansas border eastward. However, widespread 15+
mph sustained northwesterly surface winds should compensate to
support a low-end Elevated wildfire-spread threat given the
extremely dry fuels.

...Quasi-stationary boundary to produce heavy rain and potentially
severe thunderstorms from the Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley
through Saturday morning ...

...Moderate to heavy snow and freezing rain to impact interior New
England on Saturday...

...Elevated Fire Weather Risk for the Southern High Plains into
the weekend...

...Temperatures expected to remain well above average from the
Southern Plains to the Northeast...

The deep low pressure system at the center of yesterday's historic
weather has since exited the CONUS and is presently located over
central Ontario, Canada. Though no longer stateside, high winds on
the backside of this system, with gusts up to 60 mph, can still be
felt over and around the Great Lakes. As such, High Wind Warnings
are currently in effect over portions of Michigan, Storm Warnings
are in effect from Lake Superior to Lake Huron, and Wind
Advisories have been put into effect over the Upper and Lower
Great Lakes through tomorrow morning. As the system progresses to
the northeast overnight light snow is expected to linger over the
Upper Midwest. In the meantime, showers and thunderstorms will
form along a strong cold front draping from the Northeast to the
Southern Plains. Ample atmospheric moisture will allow for 1-3
inches of rain to fall over the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys where already saturated soils will heighten the risk of
flash floods, prompting the issuance of a Marginal Risk of
Excessive Rainfall by the Weather Prediction Center through Friday
morning. In addition to the flood risk ample instability over the
Lower Mississippi Valley will support the development of severe
thunderstorms that may produce damaging winds and large hail,
therefore, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk
of Severe Thunderstorms for the region through Friday morning.

The aforementioned cold front is forecast to become a
quasi-stationary boundary overnight, settling primarily over a
region extending from the Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley. With
the boundary remaining virtually motionless over a 24 hour period,
any associated heavy rain will fall over the same area, saturating
the already wet soils with an additional 1-3 inches of rain and
heightening the risk for flash flooding. To account for this the
Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall from northeast Texas to the western Ohio Valley effective
Friday morning to Saturday morning. On the western periphery of
this Slight Risk area lies a concurrent area highlighting a
Marginal Risk for Severe Thunderstorms issued by the Storm
Prediction Center given the chance that damaging winds and hail
develop in thunderstorms that form over the region. By Saturday
the risk of flash flooding and severe thunderstorm development
will diminish as high pressure building over the Great Plains
quickly ushers the front to the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard.
As the front is pushed ahead a new low pressure wave will develop
and lift to the north, reaching the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic
by Saturday evening. To the north of this wave light snow is
forecast to fall over the Upper Midwest, while more moderate
snowfall is expected over the interior Northeast. As warm air is
pulled north by a warm front extending to the east of the low
pressure system the snow is expected to quickly change over to
freezing rain, leaving behind a thin layer of ice extending east
from Lake Erie to central Massachusetts that will make road
conditions hazardous.

In the Southern High Plains modestly dry and breezy conditions are
forecast to persist over extremely dry fuels through Friday
morning, while similar conditions are expected to arise Friday
morning to Saturday morning over the Central High Plains. Given
the fact these conditions are conducive to fire spread, the Storm
Prediction Center has issued an Elevated Risk of Fire Weather for
the Southern High Plains through tomorrow morning and the Central
High Plains Friday morning through Saturday morning.

Elsewhere, a stationary boundary meandering through the Northern
and Central Rockies will support heavy snowfall over the regions'
high elevation mountain ranges through Friday morning. The
eastward progression of shortwave instability at the surface will
guide this snowfall out of the mountains and into the Northern
Plains on Friday where light to moderate accumulations are
expected. In the Pacific Northwest, a system moving onshore
Saturday is forecast to bring rainfall to the coast and low
elevation areas, while heavy snow is expected over Olympics and
northern Washington Cascades before spreading east into the
Northern Rockies Saturday evening.

Temperature-wise, unseasonably warm record-breaking weather is
forecast to persist from the Southern Plains to the Northeast into
the weekend. With today's daily highs sitting 20 to 30 degrees
above normal, 56 daily high temperature records throughout the
eastern half of the country have already fallen. A handful of
tomorrow and Saturday's daily high temperature records will also
be put to the test as highs are forecast to reach a modest 10 to
20 degrees above normal. In stark contrast to the east,
temperatures out west have dropped moderately to 5 to 10 degrees
below normal. An even larger departure from normal is expected
over the Northern High Plains, where daily highs could drop to as
low as 20 degrees below normal on Friday.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The period begins Friday with a vigorous shortwave moving through
the Northeast U.S. with surface low pressure exiting the coast.
Meanwhile, a southern stream shortwave will move through the
Southern Plains this weekend, eventually into the Southeast, with
a potentially well organized coastal low developing in the Gulf of
Mexico and sliding across Florida on Tuesday and into the western
Atlantic by Wednesday. Elsewhere, weaker shortwaves move through
the flow across the far northern tier of the U.S. with upper level
troughing becoming established off/over the West Coast early next
week.

Overall, the guidance is in good agreement with the synoptic
pattern through much of the period. The UKMET seemed a bit faster
with systems than the rest of the guidance, so it was not included
in todays blend. Otherwise, a general model blend between the 06z
GFS and the 00z ECMWF and CMC worked well for days 3-5 within a
pattern with above average forecast confidence. By days 6-7, some
bigger questions begin to emerge regarding details of an organized
surface low near the Southeast early next week and its proximity
to the coast. There are also differences out west with evolution
of a system in the eastern Pacific and interactions with the West.
Generally, these are typical differences for that late in the
period and so a roughly 50/50 blend of the ensemble means with the
deterministics seemed to offer a good starting point consistent
with the previous WPC forecast.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Northern stream upper trough passage and an exiting frontal low
may support some lingering snows Sun over northern New England and
off the lower Great Lakes. Locally enhanced rain should focus with
waves along a trailing/stalling front sunk through the Gulf Coast
and Southeast into early next week. The heaviest rains should stay
off the Gulf Coast on Monday, but a period of moderate to heavy
rain will likely impact portions of Florida by Tuesday. Depending
on proximity of the surface low to the coast, locally heavy
rainfall may clip portions of the Southeast coast as the low moves
out into the western Atlantic.

An upper trough and surface system passage will support lingering
terrain enhanced precipitation over the Northwest on Sunday.
Details remain less certain upstream over the eastern Pacific, but
there remains a good guidance signal that an amplified upper
trough digging early next week would offer potential to focus
ingredients for moderate to heavy precipitation for north-central
CA considering slow system approach, a developing moisture plume,
and favored southern facing terrain enhancement. Some heavier
model qpf solutions would favor local runoff/flooding issues. The
main precipitation focus, including heavy Shasta and Sierra snows,
is set to spread down across central-southern CA into midweek,
with additional activity spreading across the Great Basin terrain
to the Rockies with inland shortwave system progression. There is
also then an emerging guidance signal for upper trough energy to
dig from Alaska to renew precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
by next Wed/Thu.

Upper ridging across the nations midsection should spread above
normal temperatures (though not nearly as extreme as current
values) from the northern/central Plains southward towards the
Gulf Coast with daytime highs potentially 15 to 20F above normal
for the southern High Plains by next Thursday. Elsewhere,
temperatures through the medium range should be near seasonal
averages for much of the East, with slightly below normal temps
associated with weak shortwaves through the northern tier and also
the shortwave through the Southeast early in the period.

...Quasi-stationary boundary to produce heavy rain and potentially
severe thunderstorms from the Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley
through Saturday morning ...

...Moderate to heavy snow and freezing rain to impact interior New
England on Saturday...

...Elevated Fire Weather Risk for the Southern High Plains into
the weekend...

...Temperatures expected to remain well above average from the
Southern Plains to the Northeast...

The deep low pressure system at the center of yesterday's historic
weather has since exited the CONUS and is presently located over
central Ontario, Canada. Though no longer stateside, high winds on
the backside of this system, with gusts up to 60 mph, can still be
felt over and around the Great Lakes. As such, High Wind Warnings
are currently in effect over portions of Michigan, Storm Warnings
are in effect from Lake Superior to Lake Huron, and Wind
Advisories have been put into effect over the Upper and Lower
Great Lakes through tomorrow morning. As the system progresses to
the northeast overnight light snow is expected to linger over the
Upper Midwest. In the meantime, showers and thunderstorms will
form along a strong cold front draping from the Northeast to the
Southern Plains. Ample atmospheric moisture will allow for 1-3
inches of rain to fall over the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys where already saturated soils will heighten the risk of
flash floods, prompting the issuance of a Marginal Risk of
Excessive Rainfall by the Weather Prediction Center through Friday
morning. In addition to the flood risk ample instability over the
Lower Mississippi Valley will support the development of severe
thunderstorms that may produce damaging winds and large hail,
therefore, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk
of Severe Thunderstorms for the region through Friday morning.

The aforementioned cold front is forecast to become a
quasi-stationary boundary overnight, settling primarily over a
region extending from the Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley. With
the boundary remaining virtually motionless over a 24 hour period,
any associated heavy rain will fall over the same area, saturating
the already wet soils with an additional 1-3 inches of rain and
heightening the risk for flash flooding. To account for this the
Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall from northeast Texas to the western Ohio Valley effective
Friday morning to Saturday morning. On the western periphery of
this Slight Risk area lies a concurrent area highlighting a
Marginal Risk for Severe Thunderstorms issued by the Storm
Prediction Center given the chance that damaging winds and hail
develop in thunderstorms that form over the region. By Saturday
the risk of flash flooding and severe thunderstorm development
will diminish as high pressure building over the Great Plains
quickly ushers the front to the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard.
As the front is pushed ahead a new low pressure wave will develop
and lift to the north, reaching the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic
by Saturday evening. To the north of this wave light snow is
forecast to fall over the Upper Midwest, while more moderate
snowfall is expected over the interior Northeast. As warm air is
pulled north by a warm front extending to the east of the low
pressure system the snow is expected to quickly change over to
freezing rain, leaving behind a thin layer of ice extending east
from Lake Erie to central Massachusetts that will make road
conditions hazardous.

In the Southern High Plains modestly dry and breezy conditions are
forecast to persist over extremely dry fuels through Friday
morning, while similar conditions are expected to arise Friday
morning to Saturday morning over the Central High Plains. Given
the fact these conditions are conducive to fire spread, the Storm
Prediction Center has issued an Elevated Risk of Fire Weather for
the Southern High Plains through tomorrow morning and the Central
High Plains Friday morning through Saturday morning. Red Flag
warnings are currently in effect for portions of southeast
Colorado.

Elsewhere, a stationary boundary meandering through the Northern
and Central Rockies will support heavy snowfall over the regions'
high elevation mountain ranges through Friday morning. The
eastward progression of shortwave instability at the surface will
guide this snowfall out of the mountains and into the Northern
Plains on Friday where light to moderate accumulations are
expected. In the Pacific Northwest, a system moving onshore
Saturday is forecast to bring rainfall to the coast and low
elevation areas, while heavy snow is expected over Olympics and
northern Washington Cascades before spreading east into the
Northern Rockies Saturday evening.

Temperature-wise, unseasonably warm record-breaking weather is
forecast to persist from the Southern Plains to the Northeast into
the weekend. With today's daily highs sitting 20 to 30 degrees
above normal, 56 daily high temperature records throughout the
eastern half of the country have already fallen. A handful of
tomorrow and Saturday's daily high temperature records will also
be put to the test as highs are forecast to reach a modest 10 to
20 degrees above normal. In stark contrast to the east,
temperatures out west have dropped moderately to 5 to 10 degrees
below normal. An even larger departure from normal is expected
over the Northern High Plains, where daily highs could drop to as
low as 20 degrees below normal on Friday.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu December 16 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 22 - 26 2021

Today's dynamical models have a good agreement regarding the amplified 500-=
hPa
geopotential height patterns across the forecast domain. A very high amplit=
ude
ridge and associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over th=
e
North Pacific extending northward into the Bering Sea. There is a slight
retrogression of this ridge relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs 6-10 day forecasts.
Ensemble model solutions from the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian depict a  high
amplitude trough extending from western Canada into the eastern Pacific Oce=
an
near the west coast of the CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights over mos=
t
of
the western CONUS eastward to part of the Northern Plains. Ridging and
positive
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast from parts of the Southwest across th=
e
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley. Troughing and negative 500-hP=
a
height anomalies are predicted over much of the Northeast and parts of the
Mid-Atlantic.

Above normal temperatures are favored over the western Aleutians under the
predicted ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
temperatures are favored for Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle under
forecast anomalous mid-level northerly flow and easterly low-level flow fro=
m
western Canada. Below normal temperatures are favored for parts of the Paci=
fic
Northwest eastward across the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains to parts=
 of
the Great Lakes region, under negative 500-hPa height anomalies associated
with
the predicted trough. Near to below normal temperatures are favored for muc=
h
of
the Northeast under forecast below normal heights. Near to above normal
temperatures are favored for the rest of the CONUS, with the highest
probability (exceeding 80%) over the Southern High Plains under a predicted
ridge and also consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Onshore flow favors above normal precipitation for northern Mainland Alaska=
,
although precipitation anomalies are predicted to be small. Below normal
precipitation is favored for the south coast of Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle
under anomalous northerly mid-level flow ahead of the ridge. Above normal
precipitation is favored for most of the western third of the CONUS, as wel=
l
as
for parts of the Northern Plains and western Great Lakes region, ahead of a=
n
amplified trough. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for the res=
t
of
the CONUS underneath forecast above normal 500-hPa heights and also support=
ed
by the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on the circulation forecast over North America, and go=
od
agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools, offset by some
disagreement among the forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 24 - 30 2021

A similar 500-hPa flow pattern to the 6-10 day period forecast is predicted=
 to
continue into week 2 with some de-amplification of the predicted circulatio=
n
patterns and a slight eastward progression over the forecast domain.

Near to below normal temperatures are favored for much of Mainland Alaska a=
nd
the Alaska Panhandle under anomalous northerly flow and easterly low-level
flow
from western Canada. Under the amplifying trough and below normal 500-hPa
height anomalies, below normal temperature probabilities are enhanced over =
the
far northwestern CONUS and across the northern tier into the Upper Mississi=
ppi
Valley and parts of the Great Lakes. Above normal temperatures are likely f=
or
most of the remaining areas of the CONUS, under positive 500-hPa height
anomalies, with probabilities exceeding 80% over parts of the Southern Grea=
t
Plains, while near to below normal temperatures are favored for parts of th=
e
Northeast under negative 500-hPa height anomalies.

Above normal precipitation continues to be slightly favored for parts of th=
e
northern Alaska Mainland in week 2. Below normal precipitation is favored f=
or
the southern Alaska Mainland and the Alaska Panhandle, under anomalous
northerly mid-level flow. Above normal precipitation is favored for the
western
third of the CONUS, as the trough is predicted to amplify. Above normal
precipitation is slightly favored for parts of the Northern Plains and part=
s
of
the Midwest, while below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the
Southern and Central Plains eastward to much of the Eastern Seaboard,
supported
by the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=
0%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement on an amplified 500-hPa circulation pattern, and good agreem=
ent
among the temperature and precipitation tools over most of the forecast
domain.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on

the period. Enhanced onshore flow associated with the mid-level low pressur=
e
over the West Coast increases the potential for heavy precipitation and hig=
h
elevation snowfall across the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and the northern

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY DECEMBER 19 - THURSDAY DECEMBER 23:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!rDdNMnBe9bC8yJWzFN2iBTT149XXk9eVnabvrKdWQ70InpCFqx8BhglHiBD8E=
JZUrAtsqDfD$

FOR FRIDAY DECEMBER 24 - THURSDAY DECEMBER 30: There is good agreement amon=
g
the dynamical models featuring highly amplified ridging over the northern
Pacific, with downstream negative mid-level height departures over the east=
ern
Pacific and into the western and north-central CONUS. Both the GEFS and ECM=
WF
ensemble model guidance favors a deamplification of the overall pattern dur=
ing
week-2. However, the ECMWF ensemble maintains a more amplified pattern for =
a
longer duration, increasing uncertainty in the evolution of the pattern.
Despite this uncertainty, ensemble guidance favors the persistence of a bro=
ad
area of surface high pressure over western Canada, extending into eastern
Alaska, which is expected to advect anomalous cold air into the northwester=
n
and north-central CONUS and southeastern Alaska during the period.



The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict a broad region from the Pacific
Northwest to the Upper Mississippi Valley of at least a 20% chance of minim=
um
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below 0 degrees F, thus =
a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures is issued for the entirety of
week-2. Higher probabilities (>40%) for minimum temperatures falling below =
the
15th percentile and below 0 degrees F are indicated extending from Montana =
to
North Dakota during much of the first half of the period, supporting the
continuation of moderate risk of much below normal temperatures from Dec 25=
 to
29 for the region. The decrease in spatial coverage is noted in today=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
forecast, as both the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble guidance has backed off on th=
e
cold signals across the Northern Tier of the lower 48. With this decrease i=
n
the cold signals, a removal of the high risk for much below normal minimum
temperatures along the Canadian border was also warranted in today=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
forecast.
In Alaska, the forecast ridge/trough pattern over the North Pacific is
expected
to bring anomalously cold temperatures, with an increased likelihood for mu=
ch
below normal temperatures over the southeastern Mainland and Panhandle.
Reforecast tools indicate at least a 60% chance of minimum temperatures
falling
below the 15th percentile across portions of the central and lower Panhandl=
e,
thus a corresponding high risk area for much below normal temperatures Dec =
24
to 27. A moderate risk of much below normal temperatures remains posted acr=
oss
the entire Panhandle and extends into extreme southeastern Mainland Alaska =
Dec
24 to 27, and a broader slight risk area remains issued and extends from th=
e
Kenai Peninsula, northeastward to the Yukon Flats, and through the Panhandl=
e
Dec 24 to 29.



Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model runs depict a continuation of the a=
mplified ridge/trough
pattern
over the North Pacific in the mean mid-level height fields. Additionally,
these
ensemble runs also favor stronger anomalous mid-level ridging over the
Southern
Tier of the CONUS. Despite the aforementioned uncertainty in the evolution =
of
the long-wave pattern across western North America, increased chances for
onshore flow across much of the West Coast continues for the period. A
moderate
risk of heavy precipitation remains issued for the Central Valley of
California
and surrounding mountain ranges for Dec 24-26. The slight risk area remains
posted Dec 24-28 extending from southern California into the Pacific Northw=
est
where reforecast guidance shows higher chances for 3-day amounts exceeding =
2
inches during the first half of the period.



As supported by the latest deterministic and ensemble mean solutions, there=
 is
also an increased potential for high elevation snowfall across much of the
western U.S. A moderate risk of heavy snow is posted for the Sierra Nevada
Mountains and Klamath Basin in northern and central California for Dec 24-2=
6,
and a broader slight risk area is posted extending northward into the Casca=
des
of the Pacific Northwest Dec 24-28. A slight risk of heavy snow is also iss=
ued
across northern Idaho and the Bitterroot Mountains of the northern Rockies =
for
the first half of week-2 (Dec 24-28), where there is increased support in t=
he
model guidance for snowfall totals reaching hazardous thresholds for the we=
ek
as a whole, which may complicate holiday travel, particularly in the passes=
.
The overall increase in available moisture across the West during week-2 is
expected to help the ongoing drought recovery (much of the West is still
experiencing extreme to exceptional drought conditions). However, enhanced
precipitation may trigger localized flooding in the lower elevation areas a=
nd
may exacerbate travel difficulties during the upcoming holidays.



Strong surface pressure gradients featured in the ensembles as well as
elevated
chances for sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile in the ECMWF and
GEFS
reforecast tools throughout much of the West supports the addition of a sli=
ght
risk of high winds Dec 24-28. This area was expanded to include more of the
Central and Southern Plains, with an increased potential for high winds
associated with lee-side cyclogenesis east of the Rockies in the first half=
 of
the period. Above normal temperatures and high winds have exacerbated droug=
ht
conditions throughout these areas in recent months, further warranting the
expansion of the slight risk area. An increased risk for high winds also
elevates dust storm fire weather potential.



Across the southern and eastern CONUS, persistent mid-level ridging is like=
ly
to lead to a relatively drier and warmer pattern during week-2. Additionall=
y,
the mid-level pattern is favored to become more zonal across the lower 48
toward the end of week-2, indicating a more progressive pattern with the
potential for a shift toward more troughing in the eastern CONUS.

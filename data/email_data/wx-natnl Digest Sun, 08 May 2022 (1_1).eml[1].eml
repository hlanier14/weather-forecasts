Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1155 AM CDT Sat May 07 2022

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST...SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS...AND CENTRAL ROCKIES....

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments for
the latest guidance. The Critical area was expanded westward along
the CO Front Range to better capture critical conditions within dry
fuels across the foothills and central Rockies. A slow moving cold
front may limit the temporal extent of the most northern sections of
the Critical area across northeastern CO. However, a few hours of
critical conditions are still expected early this afternoon and
fuels remain quite dry. Elsewhere the forecast remains unchanged,
see the prior discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 05/07/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Sat May 07 2022/

...Synopsis...
The first in a series of active fire weather days is expected to
unfold across the Southwest into the southern High Plains today. A
broad upper trough will gradually amplify across the western CONUS,
and surface low development will occur over the central High Plains
this afternoon. Gradient flow and downward momentum transport
support widespread 20+ mph sustained westerly surface winds, from
the Nevada/Arizona border into the southern High Plains. 5-15
percent RH will coincide with this strong wind field for several
hours during the afternoon, warranting the introduction of fire
weather highlights. Critical highlights are in place where the
aforementioned surface winds/RH will overlap with critically dry
fuels (i.e. forecast ERCs approaching or exceeding the 90th
percentile).

...Blocky pattern next week to support record heat over the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest along
with episodes of central U.S. convection and an emerging onshore
rains focus to the Carolinas...


...Overview...

It remains the case that guidance shows a blocky pattern during
the period. Mean ridging aloft will support a prolonged period of
well above normal temperatures (challenging daily records over
some areas) over the Mississippi Valley/central-southern Plains
extending into New England. At the same time mean troughing
containing a couple separate features will produce chilly and
unsettled weather over the West, with waves/fronts and a dry line
promoting episodes of rain and thunderstorms between these two
regimes. Meanwhile a retrograding upper ridge over the Atlantic
will likely push an initial western Atlantic upper low back toward
the southern part of the East Coast, bringing an increase of
moisture to central and southern portions of the East late week
into the weekend.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance differences in the forecast are mainly with features
within the western mean trough, with varying ideas for the
combination of a sharper trough/embedded low along or just inland
from the West Coast through midweek and trailing northeastern
Pacific energy that should reach the Northwest after midweek. Even
with some differences in handling of the trailing energy among
recent runs, the GFS and especially the CMC have been on the
faster side of the envelope with ejection of the leading system.
ECMWF runs have been slower, but has been gradually trending
faster in recent runs due to trending faster with the trailing
flow. Recent UKMET runs have been the slowest to bring in the
upstream troughing, leading to slow progression of the leading
feature and a rather far south track of the upper low by late
Thursday. By day 7 Saturday there has also been quite a bit of
variability in the models for how amplified the trailing energy
becomes as it crosses the West.

Overall, the WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived
from a blend of the near middle of the forecast envelope cluster
of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean, WPC
continuity and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. Latest 12 UTC
guidance trends generally remain in line.

In the East, the upper low retrograding back to the East Coast,
along with associated surface low and warm front, exhibit typical
detail differences in the guidance, with the aforementioned
consensus approach also offering a reasonable starting point and
decent continuity. However, a manual adjustment was applied to
limit some northward expansion of organized QPF heading into next
weekend considering a southward closed low trend.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Strong upper ridging will lead to persistent much above normal
temperatures over the central-southern Plains and most of the
Mississippi Valley through the week, with some of this warmth also
expanding through the Great Lakes and Northeast. Expect a broad
area of highs/morning lows 10-20F above normal with some localized
areas reaching higher than that. Numerous daily records are likely
through the week over the southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley, and may also extend into the central Plains/Midwest
especially around Tuesday/Wednesday. Temperatures could also
challenge record highs over a few places in the Northeast late in
the week. Highest heat index values will be over southern Texas on
Tuesday but the combination of heat and humidity may still produce
maximum heat index values over 100F at some locations just inland
from the western Gulf Coast through at least Friday. Excessive
heat, gusty winds, and dry conditions should lead to an elevated
fire weather threat across parts of the southern High Plains
through at least mid-week.

The West will see unseasonably cool and unsettled conditions next
week, albeit with a gradual moderating trend as upper troughing
becomes less amplified. Coldest anomalies will be on
Tuesday/Wednesday over California and the western Great Basin with
highs 10-20F or so below normal. Temperatures may rebound to
moderately above normal levels over California and the Southwest
by next Saturday while locations farther north may be see only
single-digit negative anomalies for highs. Periods of rain and
higher elevation snow will tend to be light to moderate, but a
system arriving late in the week may enhance totals somewhat over
favored terrain in the Northwest. Details of this system are still
somewhat uncertain though.

Between these two regimes, the central U.S. will see periods of
rain and thunderstorms. A leading front should stall between the
Upper Midwest and central Plains, lifting back was a warm front
ahead of a ejecting from the West after midweek. This system will
then push a north-south front into the Plains, with timing and
wave details of the front dependent on specifics of trailing
dynamics flowing through the West. These fronts and the ejecting
western system may produce at least localized areas of significant
rainfall that would be a runoff threat over northern tier areas
that already have very wet soil. The late-week system requires
monitoring for strong convection, with details becoming more
evident in coming days.

Most rainfall with the system off the East Coast should stay just
offshore early next week, but is likely to expand back to the west
and lead to some moderate amounts late next week as the vertically
stacked low and warm front to the north of the surface low
retrograde back toward the coast and inland into next Saturday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat May 07 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...Wet and dreary Saturday evening to give way to drier, but
abnormally cool, conditions along the Mid-Atlantic coast Sunday
into Monday...

...Wet and stormy pattern to take shape across the North-Central
U.S.; Colder and wet in the West for accumulating mountain
snowfall in the Northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest...

...First heat wave of the season to take hold of the southern &
central Plains; daily rounds of Critical fire weather conditions
to stick around parts of the Southwest & southern High Plains...

A pesky coastal low off the Eastern Seaboard continues to inundate
the Mid-Atlantic with thick cloud cover and dreary conditions. The
wettest conditions will be along the Mid-Atlantic coast tonight as
the wave of low pressure slowly inches east farther into the
Atlantic Ocean. Occasionally gusty winds will stick around with
the strongest wind gusts along the Mid-Atlantic coast, prompting
the issuance of Coastal Flood Warnings along the New Jersey and
DelMarVa coasts. The low moves just far enough off the coast to
allow for sunshine to return for areas west on I-95 in the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Sunday. A few scattered showers are
possible along the immediate coastal areas but drier conditions
return Sunday night. High pressure building in from the west
ensures a mostly dry Monday for nearly all of the East Coast but
seasonally cooler than normal temperatures will hang on up and
down the I-95 corridor the first half of the week. In fact, a few
daily record cold maximums are possible in the Mid-Atlantic where
highs struggle to get higher than the low 50s on Sunday.

While the a more tranquil weather pattern settles in to start the
week east of the Mississippi, the pattern will be most active in
the West and North-Central U.S.. The Storm Prediction Center
maintains a Slight Risk for severe storms in central South Dakota
and central Nebraska as a frontal boundary tracks across the
region this evening. The storm track will remain active across the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest thanks to a large longwave
trough in the Northwest and a persistent upper level ridge over
the Lower Mississippi Valley. The result is a series of frontal
boundaries setting up shop in these regions with daily episodes of
showers and thunderstorms. Both the Storm Prediction Center and
Weather Prediction Centers have Marginal Risks for either severe
weather or Excessive Rainfall in parts of these regions through
Monday evening. The latest precipitation forecast (through Monday
evening) shows the wettest conditions occurring in northern
Nebraska and the eastern Dakotas into northern Minnesota where
rainfall amounts surpassing 2 inches are possible. Farther west,
much below normal temperatures may break daily record cold
maximums in parts of the Northwest. The anomalously cold
conditions extend as far south as southern California on Monday
where a few daily record low minimum temperatures could be broken.
Along with the cold temperatures, passing showers will make for
damp conditions in parts of the Pacific Northwest and the
Intermountain West. Temperatures will be cold enough to support
snow from the Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada on east into the
Northern Rockies. Winter Weather Advisories have been issued for
portions of western Oregon and northern California where snow
totals through Monday evening could exceed a foot. The Absoroka of
southern Montana also have a chance to accumulate over a foot of
snow between now and Monday evening.

In the Nation's Heartland, the first heat wave of the season is
forecast to build across the Southern Plains this weekend with its
footprint of 90+ degree highs expanding into the Central Plains by
Sunday. Portions of the Midwest could see highs begin to eclipse
90 degrees by Monday. The hottest temperatures versus normal will
be centered in the High Plains of northern Texas and central
Oklahoma where daily temperature anomalies will routinely range
between 15 and 25 degrees. Numerous daily record high temps
spanning through Monday are anticipated from Louisiana and
southern Texas on north into Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Kansas. Along
with the heat, the combination of gusty winds, very low relative
humidity levels, and dry fuels keep conditions ripe for dangerous
fire weather potential Red Flag warnings currently extend from the
Lower Colorado River Valley on east into the Texas and Oklahoma
Panhandles. The Storm Prediction Center has issued Critical Risks
for fire weather for almost the entirety of New Mexico and
portions of northern Arizona, southeast Colorado, southwest
Kansas, and into the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles on Sunday. A
Critical Risk for fire weather is likely to continue for most of
the southern High Plains and parts of the Southwest on Monday.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND
NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS....

*Long duration, critical to extremely critical fire weather
conditions possible Sunday*

...Northeastern into central New Mexico...
As southwesterly flow aloft increases over the Desert Southwest
early Sunday, an embedded shortwave trough and 50-70 kt mid-level
jet are progged to move eastward out of the Four Corners and cross
the southern/central Rockies Sunday. Within a broad area of very dry
and windy conditions across the Southwest and southern High Plains,
a corridor of enhanced low-level flow (30-40 mph and higher gusts)
appear likely to develop across portions of central and eastern NM
early Sunday. The strong winds will likely remain in place through
much of the day and into the night Sunday, with the potential for
strong mountain wave activity to support extreme gusts through the
higher terrain gaps. As the upper jet continues to sag southward
across much of northern New Mexico Sunday, strong down sloping and
warm temperatures will support diurnal minimum RH values from the
low teens to single digits. While RH maybe somewhat greater within
the higher terrain where temperatures will be cooler, very dry fuels
remain in place across much of the Sangre de Cristos and central
Highlands of NM with ERC values in the 95-98th+ percentile range.
Large fire activity has already been noted in may of these areas
over the past several weeks, lending high confidence to volatile
fuel states. Given the extremely dry fuels, expected/extended strong
winds and warm/dry conditions, Extremely Critical highlights have
been added to portions of northeastern New Mexico.

..Lyons.. 05/07/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CDT Sat May 07 2022/

...Synopsis...
The next and perhaps more potent round in a series of significant
fire weather days will take place tomorrow/Sunday across the
Southwest into the southern High Plains as the western U.S. upper
trough further amplifies and overspreads the Southwest with 60-80 kt
mid-level flow. The surface mass response will be the development of
another cyclone across the southern High Plains, with widespread
25-35 mph sustained westerly surface winds (and higher gusts)
coinciding with 5-15 percent RH tomorrow afternoon. Critical
highlights have been introduced across much of New Mexico into the
southern High Plains, where the very dry/windy conditions will
overlap with critically dry fuels. Given the anomalously dry fuels
amid an exceptional drought and the very strong winds/gusts, at
least locally Extremely Critical conditions are expected. The
Critical highlights introduced this outlook are considered high-end.
An Extremely Critical area may be delineated in future outlooks if a
coherent area of overlapping 30+ mph winds, under 10 percent RH, and
the driest fuels becomes evident.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN NEW
MEXICO...SOUTHEAST COLORADO...WESTERN OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS
PANHANDLES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Significant wildfire-spread concerns are expected across portions of
the Southern High Plains today. An 80+ kt mid-level jet streak will
impinge on the southern Rockies as a broad mid-level trough
continues to amplify across the western/central U.S. Rapid
surface-low intensification is also expected to occur across the
central High Plains. Strong gradient flow from the intensifying
surface cyclone, and downward momentum transport of the stronger
flow aloft via a well-mixed boundary layer, will both promote very
windy, dry surface conditions conducive to dangerous wildfire
spread.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
As the boundary layer mixes through the afternoon, widespread 25+
mph sustained west-southwesterly winds will develop as RH dips below
15 percent on a widespread basis. Widespread Elevated to Critical
fire weather conditions are expected to overspread much of the
Southwest into the southern High Plains. However, a corridor exists
across much of central/eastern New Mexico into southeast Colorado
and the western Texas Panhandle where 25+ mph sustained winds (with
higher gusts) will overlap with single-digit RH and anomalously dry
fuels for at least a few hours this afternoon. These dangerous
conditions will support very rapid wildfire spread with any new
starts and exacerbate existing fires, perhaps supporting extreme
fire behavior, warranting the expansion of Extremely Critical
highlights across the southern High Plains.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL INTO
NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO...WESTERN OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS PANHANDLES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Broad upper troughing will prevail across the western and central
U.S., with an embedded mid-level impulse ejecting into the northern
Plains and a second, less pronounced mid-level impulse impinging on
the Rockies tomorrow/Monday. The approach of this second impulse
will encourage surface low development across the central/southern
High Plains, supporting another dangerous day of dry/windy
conditions conducive to rapid wildfire spread across the
Southwest/southern High Plains.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Similar to today, boundary-layer mixing and gradient flow will
encourage the development of widespread 20+ mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds and 10-15 percent RH across much of
the Southwest into the southern High Plains tomorrow, warranting
both the maintenance and expansion of Elevated/Critical highlights.
Guidance consensus also depicts a corridor of 25+ mph sustained
winds (with higher gusts) overlapping with 10 percent RH (perhaps
locally lower in spots) and anomalously dry fuels, promoting
dangerous conditions supporting extreme fire behavior. Extremely
Critical highlights were introduced where the most volatile surface
meteorological conditions and receptive fuels will coincide for at
least a few hours Monday afternoon.

...Blocky pattern next week to support record heat over the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest along
with episodes of central U.S. convection and an emerging onshore
rainfall focus to the Carolinas...


...Overview...

Latest models and ensembles maintain the idea of a blocky pattern
through late week.  An upper ridge will support a prolonged period
of well above normal temperatures (challenging daily records over
some areas) over the Mississippi Valley/central-southern Plains
extending into New England.  At the same time, mean troughing
containing a couple separate features will produce chilly and
unsettled weather over the West while waves/fronts and a dry line
will promote episodes of rain and thunderstorms between these two
regimes.  A retrograding upper ridge over the Atlantic will likely
push an initial western Atlantic upper low back toward the
southern part of the East Coast, increasing rainfall over central
and southern portions of the East.  Most guidance suggests that
the pattern will open up during next weekend, leading to a ridge
building over the West and a mean trough axis reaching the
Plains/Mississippi Valley.  This would finally bring a drying
trend over the northern Plains and vicinity and increasing
rainfall coverage over the eastern half of the country.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance continues to display some meaningful differences with
important forecast details.  The interaction among an ejecting
western U.S. trough/possible embedded upper low and incoming
Pacific flow has been a persistent uncertainty over recent days,
with the character of the Pacific energy as it continues across
the lower 48 also in question.  Meanwhile the models appear to
have become a little worse over the past day in terms of spread
and run-to-run variability for the upper low expected to
retrograde into the Southeast.

On the positive side for the western evolution through late week,
previously fast GFS/slow ECMWF runs have now trended closer to
each other (GFS starting its slower trend in its 18Z run) in
bringing the initial California upper low into the northern Plains
by early Friday--leading to similarly deep surface low pressure in
18Z/00Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF runs.  CMC runs have tended to be an
eastern extreme with this system.  The new 00Z run is still well
east of those GFS/ECMWF runs but at least not to such a pronounced
degree as the prior 12Z version.  On the other hand the latest
UKMET runs have been tracking the upper low extremely far south
from late Thursday onward due to being flatter with the arriving
Pacific flow.  Based on guidance available through the 18Z cycle,
a blend emphasizing the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF (tempered a bit due to
uncertainty) offered the most reasonable starting point for the
forecast.  The new 00Z ECMWF is just a bit faster/weaker aloft,
resulting in weaker/eastward adjustment for the northern Plains
surface low.

By next weekend the operational models have been varying with the
details of the overall trough reaching the central U.S. as an
upper ridge builds into the West.  While not perfectly consistent
over the past couple days, the ensemble means have been more
stable than individual model runs so the preference was to add
steadily more ensemble mean weight later in the forecast.

As for the Atlantic upper low tracking into the Southeast, the
track and timing appear to have become more sensitive to embedded
shortwave details.  As of the 12Z/18Z cycles, the GFS/ECMWF and
their respective means provided the best clustering for most of
the period while the UKMET strayed farther west and the CMC was to
the east.  In the new 00Z runs the UKMET/CMC look more reasonable
into Friday while GFS is farther northeast, but then the CMC
strays increasingly northward.  The new 00Z ECMWF has also made a
pronounced northward adjustment from Friday onward.
Progression/opening of the low will depend on unresolved details
of the trough reaching the Plains/Mississippi Valley.

Above guidance comparisons/preferences led to starting the updated
forecast with a blend of the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF early in the period
followed by gradually more input from their ensemble means,
reaching a total of 40-60 percent by next weekend.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Strong upper ridging will lead to persistent much above normal
temperatures over the central-southern Plains and most of the
Mississippi Valley through the week, with some of this warmth also
extending through the Great Lakes and Northeast.  Expect a broad
area of highs/morning lows 10-20F above normal with some pockets
of anomalies reaching higher than that.  Numerous daily records
are likely through the week over the southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley, and may also extend into the central
Plains/Midwest especially around midweek.  Temperatures could also
challenge record highs over a few places in the Northeast late in
the week.  Highest heat index values will tend to be from the
Lower Mississippi Valley into southern Texas with maximum values
approaching or reaching 100F at some locations.  The excessive
heat, gusty winds, and dry conditions leading to an elevated fire
weather threat across parts of the southern High Plains into
midweek should moderate thereafter.  Weakening of the upper ridge
and an approaching cold front should help to start a cooler trend
over the Plains/Mississippi Valley by the weekend.

Over the West, the initial system beginning to push inland should
bring highs of 10-15F below normal to parts of Nevada and
California on Wednesday and then incoming Pacific energy will
bring a brief episode of minus 5-15F anomalies for highs over the
Northwest/northern Rockies Thursday-Friday.  Otherwise the region
will see a warming trend as an upper ridge builds in by next
weekend, bringing highs up to 10-15F or so above normal over and
just east of California at that time.  Highs over the Southwest
could even approach daily records at a few places on Sunday.
Periods of rain and higher elevation snow will tend to be light to
moderate, but a system arriving around Thursday may enhance totals
somewhat over favored terrain in the Northwest.

Between the two contrasting regimes through late week, the central
U.S. will see periods of rain and thunderstorms.  Initial focus on
Wednesday will be along a warm front lifting through the northern
Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley, followed by a system emerging
from the West and tracking over the northern Plains
Thursday-Friday. This system will then push a wavy north-south
front across the central U.S. with timing and wave details (and
thus specifics of highest rainfall totals) still dependent on
specifics of trailing dynamics flowing through the West.  These
fronts and the ejecting western system may produce some areas of
significant rainfall that would be a runoff threat over northern
tier areas that already have very wet soil.  Some areas over the
central U.S. may see a threat for strong to severe convection,
with details likely to become more clear over coming days.

The western Atlantic upper low forecast to retrograde into the
Southeast should start to spread moisture farther inland around
Friday.  Expect moisture to expand in coverage during the weekend
as the upper low lifts northward and opens up in response to the
upper trough reaching the central U.S.  Currently expect the
highest rainfall totals to be over portions of the Carolinas into
Virginia.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 AM EDT Sun May 08 2022

Valid 12Z Wed May 11 2022 - 12Z Sun May 15 2022

...Blocky pattern next week to support record heat over the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest along
with episodes of central U.S. convection and an emerging onshore
rainfall focus to the Carolinas...


...Overview...

Latest models and ensembles maintain the idea of a blocky pattern
through late week.  An upper ridge will support a prolonged period
of well above normal temperatures (challenging daily records over
some areas) over the Mississippi Valley/central-southern Plains
extending into New England.  At the same time, mean troughing
containing a couple separate features will produce chilly and
unsettled weather over the West while waves/fronts and a dry line
will promote episodes of rain and thunderstorms between these two
regimes.  A retrograding upper ridge over the Atlantic will likely
push an initial western Atlantic upper low back toward the
southern part of the East Coast, increasing rainfall over central
and southern portions of the East.  Most guidance suggests that
the pattern will open up during next weekend, leading to a ridge
building over the West and a mean trough axis reaching the
Plains/Mississippi Valley.  This would finally bring a drying
trend over the northern Plains and vicinity and increasing
rainfall coverage over the eastern half of the country.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance continues to display some meaningful differences with
important forecast details.  The interaction among an ejecting
western U.S. trough/possible embedded upper low and incoming
Pacific flow has been a persistent uncertainty over recent days,
with the character of the Pacific energy as it continues across
the lower 48 also in question.  Meanwhile the models appear to
have become a little worse over the past day in terms of spread
and run-to-run variability for the upper low expected to
retrograde into the Southeast.

On the positive side for the western evolution through late week,
previously fast GFS/slow ECMWF runs have now trended closer to
each other (GFS starting its slower trend in its 18Z run) in
bringing the initial California upper low into the northern Plains
by early Friday--leading to similarly deep surface low pressure in
18Z/00Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF runs.  CMC runs have tended to be an
eastern extreme with this system.  The new 00Z run is still well
east of those GFS/ECMWF runs but at least not to such a pronounced
degree as the prior 12Z version.  On the other hand the latest
UKMET runs have been tracking the upper low extremely far south
from late Thursday onward due to being flatter with the arriving
Pacific flow.  Based on guidance available through the 18Z cycle,
a blend emphasizing the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF (tempered a bit due to
uncertainty) offered the most reasonable starting point for the
forecast.  The new 00Z ECMWF is just a bit faster/weaker aloft,
resulting in weaker/eastward adjustment for the northern Plains
surface low.

By next weekend the operational models have been varying with the
details of the overall trough reaching the central U.S. as an
upper ridge builds into the West.  While not perfectly consistent
over the past couple days, the ensemble means have been more
stable than individual model runs so the preference was to add
steadily more ensemble mean weight later in the forecast.

As for the Atlantic upper low tracking into the Southeast, the
track and timing appear to have become more sensitive to embedded
shortwave details.  As of the 12Z/18Z cycles, the GFS/ECMWF and
their respective means provided the best clustering for most of
the period while the UKMET strayed farther west and the CMC was to
the east.  In the new 00Z runs the UKMET/CMC look more reasonable
into Friday while GFS is farther northeast, but then the CMC
strays increasingly northward.  The new 00Z ECMWF has also made a
pronounced northward adjustment from Friday onward.
Progression/opening of the low will depend on unresolved details
of the trough reaching the Plains/Mississippi Valley.

Above guidance comparisons/preferences led to starting the updated
forecast with a blend of the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF early in the period
followed by gradually more input from their ensemble means,
reaching a total of 40-60 percent by next weekend.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Strong upper ridging will lead to persistent much above normal
temperatures over the central-southern Plains and most of the
Mississippi Valley through the week, with some of this warmth also
extending through the Great Lakes and Northeast.  Expect a broad
area of highs/morning lows 10-20F above normal with some pockets
of anomalies reaching higher than that.  Numerous daily records
are likely through the week over the southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley, and may also extend into the central
Plains/Midwest especially around midweek.  Temperatures could also
challenge record highs over a few places in the Northeast late in
the week.  Highest heat index values will tend to be from the
Lower Mississippi Valley into southern Texas with maximum values
approaching or reaching 100F at some locations.  The excessive
heat, gusty winds, and dry conditions leading to an elevated fire
weather threat across parts of the southern High Plains into
midweek should moderate thereafter.  Weakening of the upper ridge
and an approaching cold front should help to start a cooler trend
over the Plains/Mississippi Valley by the weekend.

Over the West, the initial system beginning to push inland should
bring highs of 10-15F below normal to parts of Nevada and
California on Wednesday and then incoming Pacific energy will
bring a brief episode of minus 5-15F anomalies for highs over the
Northwest/northern Rockies Thursday-Friday.  Otherwise the region
will see a warming trend as an upper ridge builds in by next
weekend, bringing highs up to 10-15F or so above normal over and
just east of California at that time.  Highs over the Southwest
could even approach daily records at a few places on Sunday.
Periods of rain and higher elevation snow will tend to be light to
moderate, but a system arriving around Thursday may enhance totals
somewhat over favored terrain in the Northwest.

Between the two contrasting regimes through late week, the central
U.S. will see periods of rain and thunderstorms.  Initial focus on
Wednesday will be along a warm front lifting through the northern
Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley, followed by a system emerging
from the West and tracking over the northern Plains

front across the central U.S. with timing and wave details (and
thus specifics of highest rainfall totals) still dependent on
specifics of trailing dynamics flowing through the West.  These
fronts and the ejecting western system may produce some areas of
significant rainfall that would be a runoff threat over northern
tier areas that already have very wet soil.  Some areas over the
central U.S. may see a threat for strong to severe convection,
with details likely to become more clear over coming days.

Southeast should start to spread moisture farther inland around
Friday.  Expect moisture to expand in coverage during the weekend
as the upper low lifts northward and opens up in response to the
upper trough reaching the central U.S.  Currently expect the
highest rainfall totals to be over portions of the Carolinas into
Virginia.

...Wet and dreary weather across the Mid-Atlantic will give way to

coast...

A pesky low pressure system responsible for the dreary and wet
weather lately over parts of the eastern U.S. is forecast to
gradually slide off the East Coast today.  This will result in the
cool rain to gradually taper off to drizzle near the coast while
the interior sections will have a chance to dry out later today.
However, an increasingly stagnant weather pattern across the U.S.
will keep the low pressure system spinning fairly close to the
East Coast for the next couple days and beyond.  Persistent gusty
winds from the northeast have prompted the issuance of Coastal
Flood Warnings along the New Jersey and DelMarVa coasts.  A high
pressure ridge will provide a mostly dry Monday for nearly all of
the East Coast but  temperatures will remain much cooler than
normal up and down the East Coast for at least the first half of
the week.  In fact, a few daily record cold maximums are possible
in the Mid-Atlantic where highs will struggle to get higher than
the low 50s today.

Meanwhile, a rather active weather pattern is in store across the
western U.S. and into the northern Plains as back-to-back
disturbances move through an amplified upper-level trough.  The
result will be a series of frontal boundaries passing through
these areas with daily episodes of showers and thunderstorms.
Both the Storm Prediction Center and Weather Prediction Centers
have Marginal Risks for either severe weather or Excessive
Rainfall in parts of these regions through Monday evening.  The
latest precipitation forecast (through Monday evening) shows the
wettest conditions occurring in northern Nebraska and the eastern
Dakotas into northern Minnesota where rainfall amounts surpassing
2 inches are possible. Farther west, much below normal
temperatures may break daily record cold maximums in parts of the
Northwest.  The anomalously cold conditions extend as far south as
southern California on Monday where a few daily record low minimum
temperatures could be broken.  Along with the cold temperatures,
passing showers will make for damp conditions in parts of the
Pacific Northwest and the Intermountain West. Temperatures will be
cold enough to support snow from the Cascades and northern Sierra
Nevada on east into the Northern Rockies.  Winter Weather
Advisories have been issued for portions of western Oregon and
northern California where snow totals through Monday evening could
exceed a foot.  The Absoroka of southern Montana also have a
chance to accumulate over a foot of snow between now and Monday
evening.

Over the central and southern Plains, the first heat wave of the
season is forecast to build across the Southern Plains this
weekend with its footprint of 90+ degree highs expanding into the
Central Plains by Sunday.  Portions of the Midwest could see highs
begin to eclipse 90 degrees by Monday.  The hottest temperatures
versus normal will be centered in the High Plains of northern
Texas and central Oklahoma where daily temperature anomalies will
routinely range between 15 and 25 degrees. Numerous daily record
high temps spanning through Monday are anticipated from Louisiana
and southern Texas on north into Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Kansas.
Along with the heat, the combination of gusty winds, very low
relative humidity levels, and dry fuels keep conditions ripe for
dangerous fire weather potential Red Flag warnings currently
extend from the Lower Colorado River Valley on east into the Texas
and Oklahoma Panhandles. The Storm Prediction Center has issued
Critical Risks for fire weather for almost the entirety of New
Mexico and portions of northern Arizona, southeast Colorado,
southwest Kansas, and into the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles on
Sunday.  A Critical Risk for fire weather is likely to continue
for most of the southern High Plains and parts of the Southwest on
Monday.

evening.

Over the central and southern Plains, the first heat wave of the

its footprint of 90+ degree highs expanding through the central
Plains by Monday afternoon, possibly reaching into the Midwest.
The hottest temperatures versus normal will be centered in the
High Plains of northern Texas and central Oklahoma where daily
temperature anomalies will routinely range between 15 and 25
degrees.  Numerous daily record high temps spanning through Monday
are anticipated from Louisiana and southern Texas on north into
Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Kansas.  Along with the heat, the
combination of gusty winds, very low relative humidity levels, and
dry fuels will keep conditions ripe for dangerous fire weather

Panhandles.  The Storm Prediction Center has issued Critical Risks
for fire weather for almost the entirety of New Mexico and
portions of northern Arizona, southeast Colorado, southwest
Kansas, and into the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles today and Monday,
with little change in the prevailing conditions expected by

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0120 AM CDT Mon May 16 2022/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel ridge will begin to weaken today as a series of
upper-level shortwave troughs move across parts of the
central/southern Rockies. A weak surface low is expected to develop
across the central High Plains, with a lee trough potentially
extending southward into parts of NM and west TX.

...Parts of NM/CO into the central/southern High Plains...
Gradually increasing low/midlevel flow will support sustained winds
of 15-20 mph (locally higher) across much of NM/west TX into
southern CO and parts of the High Plains. These winds, in
conjunction with RH dropping below 15% across NM/west TX, and
potentially into the 20-25% range across southeast CO/western KS,
will support elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions.

High-based thunderstorms are expected to develop by late afternoon
from eastern NM into southeast CO. Some locally higher precipitation
amounts are possible with the strongest storms, but widespread
wetting rainfall is not expected, and the potential for lightning
activity amid very receptive fuels continues to merit an isolated
dry-thunderstorm delineation across this area. Gusty outflow winds
may become rather widespread by early evening across the area as
well.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF WEST INTO NORTHWEST TX...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, and only minor
adjustments were made with this update.

..Weinman.. 05/16/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0122 AM CDT Mon May 16 2022/

...Synopsis...
A weak upper-level trough will remain in place across much of the
western CONUS on Tuesday, as multiple embedded shortwave troughs
move from the central/southern Rockies into the High Plains. A
surface low is forecast to deepen across southeast CO, with a
dryline expected to extend southward across portions of west TX.

...Parts of NM/west TX into the southern High Plains...
While the primary Pacific cold front/dryline may remain over west TX
during the afternoon, strong heating/mixing ahead of this feature
will result in the development of a secondary dryline further east
from southwest OK into central TX. The strongest low-level flow is
expected immediately to the west of this secondary dryline,
associated with a rather strong low-level jet. Areas from the TX
South Plains into the Big Country and Permian Basin may see
sustained winds of 20-25 mph as RH drops below 15%, resulting in
critical fire-weather conditions. Near-critical conditions may
extend into portions of southeast NM, though low-level flow is
currently expected to be somewhat weaker in this area.

In addition to the critical wind/RH threat, isolated high-based
thunderstorms will be possible across parts of the southern High
Plains during the late afternoon/evening, with very limited rainfall
potential, so an isolated dry-thunderstorm area has been included
for parts of this region.

...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. through this week with anomalous heat expanding into the East
this weekend...

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding possible near a strong
northern tier system on Thursday...


...Overview...

A digging trough over the West and rising heights across the East
late this week will result in a more amplified pattern across the
lower 48, yielding cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in
the West and a continued hot regime for the South and East. A
closed low initially along the U.S.-Canadian border on Thursday
could open up soon thereafter but either way a deepening low
pressure system tracking from the northern tier/Upper Great Lakes
into Canada will push a strong cold front eastward, bringing
chances for heavy rainfall and severe weather to some areas from
the eastern Plains/Mississippi Valley into the East. The upper
trough will reach into the central and eastern U.S. during the
weekend into the first part of next week (possibly becoming a
little more shallow with time) while guidance has become
indecisive with details upstream. A northward surge of tropical
moisture will also increase rain/thunderstorm chances across
Florida late this week and into the weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Even in the first half of the period, guidance exhibits some
noticeable spread and continuity changes for the initial upper low
along the Canadian border and upper trough extending through the
West. In general the 00Z/06Z model runs have trended toward an
earlier opening of the upper low and thus far the 12Z runs have
followed through on this change. Meanwhile recent GFS runs have
been on the amplified side of the spread for the overall trough.
The 06Z GFS was particularly strong with some of its trailing
energy, ultimately leading to a slower trough than the majority of
guidance and even a closed low over the Upper Mississippi Valley
by early day 6 Sunday. The 00Z GFS was closer to consensus and the
new 12Z run has returned to a more moderate feature.

From the weekend into early next week the most prominent source of
uncertainty becomes how quickly upper low energy and surrounding
flow escape from the North Pacific (part of a longer term blocky
regime over the Pacific and Bering Sea/Alaska). The 00Z ECMWF
deviated significant from its prior run and most other guidance in
being rather fast to bring the North Pacific energy into western
North America. On the opposite side of the spectrum, GFS runs have
tended to build the strongest upper ridge just off the West Coast
by Sunday-Monday to yield more Rockies/High Plains troughing by
next Monday. The 12Z GFS has tempered its late-period ridge-trough
pattern a little bit. Diverse ensemble members average out to a
modest ridge-trough pattern in the GEFS/CMCens while the ECens
mean is nearly zonal. How the details from the Pacific into the
West work out will eventually affect the forecast of the trough
moving into the East, with the majority of guidance at least
suggesting the eastern trough will become less amplified than seen
in the 00Z ECMWF (with corresponding effects on surface frontal
position). The new 12Z ECMWF has trended closer to what consensus
exits for most aspects of the late-period pattern.

Based on the review of 00Z/06Z guidance, the updated forecast
started with the 00Z GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/CMC early in the period to
represent latest trends for the northern tier system and to avoid
the less confident aspects of the 06Z GFS. Question marks in both
the GFS and ECMWF during the latter half of the period led to a
rapid transition to 50-70 percent total weight of the 06Z GEFS/00Z
ECMWF means, yielding a solution as close to continuity as could
be hoped in light of the spread and variability of models/ensemble
members.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial upper ridging across the southern Plains and rising
heights farther east over the Deep South will continue to promote
a broad area of heat into Saturday. The greatest and most lasting
anomalies should be over Texas (persisting from the short range
time frame) where some locations could see highs up to 15-25F
above normal, with numerous daily record highs likely. The heat
across Texas should finally begin to moderate from north to south
by next weekend an upper trough pressing through the West supports
an arriving cold front. However, warm to hot temperatures will
extend into the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. with potential
for daily record highs, and warmer than average temperatures by
10-20F or so should expand in coverage across the Ohio Valley to
Eastern Seaboard by later in the week.

A warm front lifting through the Ohio Valley/Appalachians on
Thursday will continue to provide a focus for showers and storms
on Thursday, with a very localized flood threat particularly if
heavy rainfall falls in areas that are already sensitive.
Meanwhile, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is likely on
Thursday in association with a deepening northern tier storm
system that should lift away from the Upper Great Lakes on Friday.
The system's evolution is somewhat complex and guidance is still
adjusting with some specifics. Currently the best potential for
flooding/flash flooding exists over parts of North Dakota and
northern Minnesota where antecedent conditions are the wettest. A
separate band of enhanced rainfall may exist farther
south/southeast where greater instability exists. By
Friday-Saturday, above average moisture and instability will allow
for rain and thunderstorms to spread along the frontal boundary as
it pushes through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley/Mississippi Valley
and then into the East. Locally heavy rainfall is possible but
additional time is needed to resolve areas of greatest potential.
The Storm Prediction Center highlights a threat for severe weather
over some of the same areas with heavy rainfall potential along
and ahead of the cold front Thursday and Friday. Behind this
front, unseasonably cool temperatures will slide across the
Northwest/northern Rockies on Thursday into the north-central U.S.
Friday and Saturday, with highs generally 10-20F below normal.
Parts of the northern-central High Plains could be colder than
that on Friday. This cold spell should lower snow levels and
possibly allow for some light snow to fall even in northern parts
of the High Plains. The Northwest will be fairly dry late this
week but may see some moisture return during the weekend or early
next week, with uncertain flow details keeping confidence low for
specifics of timing/coverage/amounts of any precipitation. The
southern half of the West should see a warming trend expand from
west to east Saturday-Monday with California seeing the warmest
high temperature anomalies of plus 10-15F. Elsewhere, guidance
agrees that tropical moisture should surge northward across the
Florida peninsula late this week into the weekend, bringing a
round of heavy rainfall to portions of the Sunshine State.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon May 16 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 22 - 26 2022

Today's model solutions are in fairly good agreement in predicting a 500-hPa
height pattern consistent with the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation
(AO) early in the period. On day 6, below normal heights are forecast across
most of the higher latitudes of North America with troughs extending southward
to eastern Alaska and the north-central CONUS. Near to above normal heights
are
forecast farther to the south across the southern CONUS, punctuated by a ridge
near California. As time progresses, the positive AO pattern is forecast to
weaken with heights returning to near normal across much of the higher
latitudes of North America. Corresponding to this forecast pattern transition
across higher latitudes, the flow pattern over the CONUS is generally
predicted
to become more zonal by the end of the period. Farther to the north, troughing
is forecast to persist across much of Mainland Alaska for most of the period,
while ridging is predicted upstream over the Aleutians.

Cool, Canadian surface high pressure predicted early in the period favors
below
normal temperatures for the Great Lakes as well as the Upper and Middle
Mississippi Valley. A weak tilt toward below normal temperatures extends
westward along the northern tier of the CONUS as dynamical model guidance
forecasts modest height falls for the northwestern CONUS by the end of the
period. Near to above normal temperatures are favored farther to the south,
across the southern tier of the CONUS, underneath predicted near to above
normal heights. Probabilities of near to above normal temperatures are also
enhanced across the Eastern Seaboard, ahead of a mean trough forecast over the
east-central CONUS. The highest probabilities of above normal temperatures
(exceeding 50 percent) are indicated for California, due to predicted ridging,
and for Florida, to the south of a frontal boundary forecast early in the
period. Conversely, cooler than normal temperatures are most likely for
northern and eastern Alaska due to persistent troughing while a slight tilt
toward above normal temperatures are indicated for southwestern Alaska due to
predicted upstream ridging.

An active pattern is favored for the Gulf and East coasts around the periphery
of a mean trough predicted over the east-central CONUS. The greatest
likelihood
of above normal precipitation (greater than 50 percent) is indicated for the
central and eastern Gulf Coast region and parts of the Southeast, due to the
potential for enhanced moisture advection from the nearby Gulf and Atlantic
combined with a predicted stalled frontal boundary in the vicinity. Near to
below normal precipitation is most likely for most of the Northern and Central
Plains as well as for much of the Middle and Upper Mississippi Valley, due to
predicted surface high pressure early in the period. A tilt toward near to
below normal precipitation extends westward to much of the West Coast, due to
predicted ridging near California. Weak troughing leads to enhanced
probabilities of above normal precipitation farther to the north, across parts
of the Pacific Northwest, the Alaska Panhandle, and eastern portions of
Mainland Alaska. Ridging predicted over the Aleutians leads to a slight tilt
toward below normal precipitation for southwestern Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
fairly
good agreement on a positive AO pattern early in the period offset by a
transition to a less amplified pattern late.



8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 24 - 30 2022

During week-2, a transition to a low amplitude pattern is expected with only
modest 500-hPa height anomalies forecast over most of North America by the
middle of the period. Therefore, the mean 500-hPa pattern for the period as a
whole features weak anomalies across most of the forecast domain with a slight
tilt toward below normal heights forecast for parts of the northern tier of
the
CONUS and near to slightly above normal heights forecast for most of the
southern tier. Height departures are generally larger across Alaska relative
to
the CONUS as a trough is forecast to persist over the Mainland for most of the
period with upstream ridging continuing over the Aleutians

Low amplitude flow predicted across the CONUS is expected to lead to enhanced
north-south temperature gradients. Correspondingly, below normal temperatures
are slightly favored across most of the Northern Tier while above normal
temperatures are most likely for most of the southern third of the CONUS.
Increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast across most of the
Alaska Mainland as well as the Panhandle due to persistent troughing.

The potential for a stalled frontal boundary combined with enhanced moisture
advection from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic leads to elevated chances
of
above normal precipitation for the Gulf Coast Region, Lower Mississippi
Valley,
and much of the Southeast. Above normal precipitation is also favored for the
Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, and parts of the
Northeast, due to the likelihood of enhanced north-south temperature gradients
and associated frontal activity. A slight tilt toward above normal
precipitation is also indicated for parts of the Great Basin and the Central
Rockies due to potential trough development over the southwestern CONUS toward
the middle and end of the period. Persistent cyclonic flow leads to elevated
chances of above normal precipitation across eastern Alaska and parts of the
Pacific Northwest. Conversely, predicted ridges lead to increased chances of
below normal precipitation for much of California and parts of southwestern
Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered on
Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 35%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
predicted weak mean 500-hPa anomalies across most of the forecast domain.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 16 2022

SYNOPSIS: The mid-level height pattern is anticipated to be fairly weak for
much of week-2, with the possibility of more amplified mid-level low pressure
forming over the western Lower 48 toward the end of the period. Positive
mid-level height departures south-central and southwestern contiguous U.S.
(CONUS) increases the potential for episodes of excessive heat across the
region during the period. Possible surface low formation across the central
CONUS may support enhanced wind speeds across the western CONUS. Ample
moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico ahead of this low may support heavy precipitation
across the southwestern CONUS at the beginning of week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of episodes excessive heat for eastern portions of the Central and
Southern Plains, Tue-Mon, May 24 to 30.

Slight risk of episodes of excessive heat for portions of the Central Great
Basin, Southern Rockies, Southwest, western portions of the Central and
Southern Plains, and California, Tue-Fri, May 24-27.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Lower and Middle
Mississippi, and Tennessee Valleys, and Southeast, Tue-Thu, May 24-26.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across parts of the Great Plains,
Central
and Southern Rockies, Central Great Basin, and Southwest, Tue-Sat, May 24-29.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible along parts of northern Minnesota.

Flooding possible for parts of the Tanana Basin in Mainland Alaska.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MAY 19 - MONDAY MAY 23:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!-Xe9KRtej4TukQqKjJrDXuo7E_hsatGTuPCtYPz7d0uTJKe0TT0qjEEz0qCVsbwZgPgzkubppKw_GXGM2qPpLX-L-GQ$

FOR TUESDAY MAY 24 - MONDAY MAY 30: Significant model differences in the 0Z
GEFS, ECMWF Canadian ensemble means' depiction of the mid-level height pattern
are expected to continue from the end of week-1 into the outset of week-2. The
0Z GEFS ensemble mean indicates mid-level troughing across the northwestern
and
central CONUS at the beginning of the period, whereas the ECMWF and Canadian
favors weak shortwave troughing centered across the northwestern CONUS and
western Four Corners region. By day 11 there is better model agreement with
the
0Z GEFS showing the aforementioned ECMWF and Canadian pattern. Toward the end
of the period, these models generally show mid-level troughing across the
western CONUS with varying degrees of amplitude (ECMWF and Canadian more
amplified than the GEFS). High uncertainty and fairly weak mid-level flow
translates to generally lower certainty in the hazards outlook.



Positive 500 hPa height departures are indicated by multiple ensemble means
across the southwestern and south-central CONUS at the beginning of week-2
supporting anomalous warmth across much of the region. The ECMWF ensemble mean
indicates more widespread positive height departures, translating to a greater
signal for excessive heat across the region. The ECMWF reforecast tool
indicates parts of this area having at least a 60% chance of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile, whereas the GEFS mostly limits
these probabilities to less than 40% (except for over southern Texas). Despite
these differences, a slight chance of episodes of excessive heat is posted for
parts of the Central Great Basin, Southern Rockies, Southwest, California, and
western portions of the Central and Southern Plains, May 24 to 27, where there
is fairly good agreement of both reforecast tools indicating at least a 20%
chance of temperatures reaching hazardous threshold. A slight risk of episodes
of excessive heat is designated for the Central and Southern Plains throughout
week-2, where a longer duration of heat potential exists in the tools. The
heat
signal is further supported by uncalibrated model ensemble means,
deterministic
temperature solutions, as well as the calibrated heat tool.



A stationary front stretching across the Gulf Coast and Florida is anticipated
to continue from the end of week-1 into the beginning of week-2. This feature,
combined with possible surface low formation over the central CONUS and ample
moist southerly flow from the Gulf of Mexico associated with surface high
pressure over the Atlantic and eastern CONUS increases the likelihood for
enhanced precipitation across parts of the eastern CONUS. Furthermore, across
the tropics, there continues to be good model support for a convectively
coupled Kelvin wave aloft traversing the western Hemisphere during week-2,
which is conducive for possible early season tropical cyclone formation.
Several runs of the GEFS and GFS continue to be more supportive of tropical
cyclogenesis compared to the ECMWF, however; the 12Z deterministic ECMWF now
shows the potential for a surface disturbance forming in the Bay of Campeche.
Given the various sources of possible enhanced precipitation, a slight risk of
heavy precipitation is posted across parts of the Lower and Middle
Mississippi,
and Tennessee Valleys, and Southeast, May 24 to 26. The reforecast tools are
in
good agreement indicating at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall exceeding
the
85th percentile and one inch across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Florida
during the 8 to 10 day period. This precipitation risk is extended slightly
further north to Missouri due to the uncalibrated ECMWF and GEFS ensemble
indicating enhanced precipitation in this region.



There continues to be good multi-model depiction in both the ensembles and
deterministic solutions indicating surface low formation across the central
CONUS and eastern Four Corners region from the beginning to middle of week-2.
A
slight risk of episodes of high winds is highlighted for parts of the Great
Plains, Central and Southern Rockies, Central Great Basin, and Southwest, May
24 to 29, based on where reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph and/or where recent
deterministic GFS and ECMWF runs show wind speeds possibly exceeding 25 mph. A
moderate risk of high winds is not included due to the anticipation that the
mid-level trough across the West is favored to be weaker compared to the end
of
last week's outlook. The continued potential for high winds, combined with
expected dry and hot conditions, is likely to sustain an elevated wildfire
risk
during the outlook period across many parts of the Four Corners region where
multiple large wildfires are currently ongoing. The Hermits Peak and Calf
Canyon fire continues to be the largest wildfire incident, located east of
Santa Fe, which has burned over 298,000 acres (as of May 16) with less than
half containment. According the U.S. Forest Service this is the largest
wildfire in New Mexico's history.



Flooding is likely to persist throughout week-2 in the Red River Valley of the
North, and extending into part of the James River basin due to saturated soils
and above-normal precipitation favored during week-1 and week-2. An additional
area of possible flood is included for northern Minnesota given the enhanced
precipitation anticipated for weeks 1 and 2 and increasing number of locations
in the highest 10th percentile of streamflow and because the North Central
River Forecast Center now indicates significant river flooding occurring in
their 5-day significant river outlook.



Across Alaska, below-normal temperatures are predominately favored throughout
much of the Mainland. Although anomalously cold temperatures may slow the rate
of springtime snowmelt and ice-river breakup, above freezing temperatures
supports a possible flood hazard across Tanana Basin in Mainland Alaska,
primarily in areas that have above normal snowpack. The possible flood area
has
been slightly reduced taking into account areas that have less concerns
regarding drainage.



Anomalous hot conditions across Texas combined with little to no precipitation
during week-1 and week-2 could lead to small areas of abnormally dry areas
degrading to moderate drought across western Texas. However, due to the
anticipation of this risk being highly localized, a related rapid onset
drought
risk is not designated at this time.

...Severe weather and flash flooding concerns remain across parts
of the East Coast into early tonight...

...Record heat forecast throughout the southern Plains and Deep
South...

...Next round of active weather to enter the central Plains and
Mid-Mississippi Valley on Tuesday...

A strengthening low pressure system entering southern Quebec this
evening and a potent cold front pushing toward the East Coast will
continue to lead to a threat of severe thunderstorms and flash
flooding into early tonight. Damaging wind gusts will be the main
concern, with large hail, isolated tornadoes, and localized flash
flooding also possible. SPC has highlighted an area between
Upstate New York and the Northern Neck of Virginia as having the
greatest chances for severe weather. Additionally, flash flooding
is most likely over northern New York and northern Vermont, where
rainfall totals could exceed 1 inch in a short period of time.
Most storms should weaken and exit into the western Atlantic by
tonight, with tranquil weather in store for much of the eastern
U.S. on Tuesday.

Upper-level ridging over the southern tier will continue to allow
for an early-season heatwave to grasp much of the southern Plains
and Deep South through this week. Highs on Tuesday are once again
forecast to soar into the mid-to-upper 90s, with triple digits
expected in the southern High Plains and central Texas. By
Wednesday, mid-90s will extend farther east into the Deep South
and Southeast. Daily high temperature records could be threatened
in this region, highlighting the abnormally warm temperatures for
mid-May. Residents are advised to follow proper heat safety by
staying hydrated and avoiding strenuous outdoor activities. Along
with the above average temperatures, Critical Fire Weather is
anticipated for west/northwest Texas on Tuesday. Low relative
humidity, gusty winds, and the possibility of dry thunderstorms
could lead to conditions conducive for new and/or old wildfires to
spread uncontrollably. Red Flag Warnings are also in effect.

Elsewhere, the next round of organized showers and thunderstorms
will impact the central Plains and Mid-Mississippi Valley on
Tuesday as a low pressure system forms along a stationary
boundary. A few storms could turn severe, as well as contain heavy
rainfall rates, from roughly southern Nebraska to northern
Missouri. The unsettled weather is expected to extend into the
Ohio Valley on Wednesday, with additional threats for scattered
severe thunderstorms and flash flooding. For the Pacific
Northwest, a potent frontal system traversing the region on
Wednesday should bring moderate precipitation amounts and below
average temperatures. Winter will make a return to parts of the
northern Cascades as snowfall accumulations could exceed 6 inches
across the highest elevations.

...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. through this week with anomalous heat expanding into the East
this weekend...

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding possible near a strong
northern tier system on Thursday...


...Overview...

A digging trough over the West and rising heights across the East
late this week will result in a more amplified pattern across the
lower 48, yielding cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in
the West and a continued hot regime for the South and East. A
closed low initially along the U.S.-Canadian border on Thursday
could open up soon thereafter but either way a deepening low
pressure system tracking from the northern tier/Upper Great Lakes
into Canada will push a strong cold front eastward, bringing
chances for heavy rainfall and severe weather to some areas from
the eastern Plains/Mississippi Valley into the East. The upper
trough will reach into the central and eastern U.S. during the
weekend into the first part of next week (possibly becoming a
little more shallow with time) while guidance has become
indecisive with details upstream. A northward surge of tropical
moisture will also increase rain/thunderstorm chances across
Florida late this week and into the weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Even in the first half of the period, guidance exhibits some
noticeable spread and continuity changes for the initial upper low
along the Canadian border and upper trough extending through the
West. In general the 00Z/06Z model runs have trended toward an
earlier opening of the upper low and thus far the 12Z runs have
followed through on this change. Meanwhile recent GFS runs have
been on the amplified side of the spread for the overall trough.
The 06Z GFS was particularly strong with some of its trailing
energy, ultimately leading to a slower trough than the majority of
guidance and even a closed low over the Upper Mississippi Valley
by early day 6 Sunday. The 00Z GFS was closer to consensus and the
new 12Z run has returned to a more moderate feature.

From the weekend into early next week the most prominent source of
uncertainty becomes how quickly upper low energy and surrounding
flow escape from the North Pacific (part of a longer term blocky
regime over the Pacific and Bering Sea/Alaska). The 00Z ECMWF
deviated significant from its prior run and most other guidance in
being rather fast to bring the North Pacific energy into western
North America. On the opposite side of the spectrum, GFS runs have
tended to build the strongest upper ridge just off the West Coast
by Sunday-Monday to yield more Rockies/High Plains troughing by
next Monday. The 12Z GFS has tempered its late-period ridge-trough
pattern a little bit. Diverse ensemble members average out to a
modest ridge-trough pattern in the GEFS/CMCens while the ECens
mean is nearly zonal. How the details from the Pacific into the
West work out will eventually affect the forecast of the trough
moving into the East, with the majority of guidance at least
suggesting the eastern trough will become less amplified than seen
in the 00Z ECMWF (with corresponding effects on surface frontal
position). The new 12Z ECMWF has trended closer to what consensus
exits for most aspects of the late-period pattern.

Based on the review of 00Z/06Z guidance, the updated forecast
started with the 00Z GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/CMC early in the period to
represent latest trends for the northern tier system and to avoid
the less confident aspects of the 06Z GFS. Question marks in both
the GFS and ECMWF during the latter half of the period led to a
rapid transition to 50-70 percent total weight of the 06Z GEFS/00Z
ECMWF means, yielding a solution as close to continuity as could
be hoped in light of the spread and variability of models/ensemble
members.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial upper ridging across the southern Plains and rising
heights farther east over the Deep South will continue to promote
a broad area of heat into Saturday. The greatest and most lasting
anomalies should be over Texas (persisting from the short range
time frame) where some locations could see highs up to 15-25F
above normal, with numerous daily record highs likely. The heat
across Texas should finally begin to moderate from north to south
by next weekend an upper trough pressing through the West supports
an arriving cold front. However, warm to hot temperatures will
extend into the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. with potential
for daily record highs, and warmer than average temperatures by
10-20F or so should expand in coverage across the Ohio Valley to
Eastern Seaboard by later in the week.

A warm front lifting through the Ohio Valley/Appalachians on
Thursday will continue to provide a focus for showers and storms
on Thursday, with a very localized flood threat particularly if
heavy rainfall falls in areas that are already sensitive.
Meanwhile, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is likely on
Thursday in association with a deepening northern tier storm
system that should lift away from the Upper Great Lakes on Friday.
The system's evolution is somewhat complex and guidance is still
adjusting with some specifics. Currently the best potential for
flooding/flash flooding exists over parts of North Dakota and
northern Minnesota where antecedent conditions are the wettest. A
separate band of enhanced rainfall may exist farther
south/southeast where greater instability exists. By
Friday-Saturday, above average moisture and instability will allow
for rain and thunderstorms to spread along the frontal boundary as
it pushes through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley/Mississippi Valley
and then into the East. Locally heavy rainfall is possible but
additional time is needed to resolve areas of greatest potential.
The Storm Prediction Center highlights a threat for severe weather
over some of the same areas with heavy rainfall potential along
and ahead of the cold front Thursday and Friday. Behind this
front, unseasonably cool temperatures will slide across the
Northwest/northern Rockies on Thursday into the north-central U.S.
Friday and Saturday, with highs generally 10-20F below normal.
Parts of the northern-central High Plains could be colder than
that on Friday. This cold spell should lower snow levels and
possibly allow for some light snow to fall even in northern parts
of the High Plains. The Northwest will be fairly dry late this
week but may see some moisture return during the weekend or early
next week, with uncertain flow details keeping confidence low for
specifics of timing/coverage/amounts of any precipitation. The
southern half of the West should see a warming trend expand from
west to east Saturday-Monday with California seeing the warmest
high temperature anomalies of plus 10-15F. Elsewhere, guidance
agrees that tropical moisture should surge northward across the
Florida peninsula late this week into the weekend, bringing a
round of heavy rainfall to portions of the Sunshine State.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
355 PM EDT Mon May 16 2022

Valid 12Z Thu May 19 2022 - 12Z Mon May 23 2022

...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. through this week with anomalous heat expanding into the East
this weekend...

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding possible near a strong
northern tier system on Thursday...


...Overview...

A digging trough over the West and rising heights across the East
late this week will result in a more amplified pattern across the
lower 48, yielding cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in
the West and a continued hot regime for the South and East. A
closed low initially along the U.S.-Canadian border on Thursday
could open up soon thereafter but either way a deepening low
pressure system tracking from the northern tier/Upper Great Lakes
into Canada will push a strong cold front eastward, bringing
chances for heavy rainfall and severe weather to some areas from
the eastern Plains/Mississippi Valley into the East. The upper
trough will reach into the central and eastern U.S. during the
weekend into the first part of next week (possibly becoming a
little more shallow with time) while guidance has become
indecisive with details upstream. A northward surge of tropical
moisture will also increase rain/thunderstorm chances across
Florida late this week and into the weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Even in the first half of the period, guidance exhibits some
noticeable spread and continuity changes for the initial upper low
along the Canadian border and upper trough extending through the
West. In general the 00Z/06Z model runs have trended toward an
earlier opening of the upper low and thus far the 12Z runs have
followed through on this change. Meanwhile recent GFS runs have
been on the amplified side of the spread for the overall trough.
The 06Z GFS was particularly strong with some of its trailing
energy, ultimately leading to a slower trough than the majority of
guidance and even a closed low over the Upper Mississippi Valley
by early day 6 Sunday. The 00Z GFS was closer to consensus and the
new 12Z run has returned to a more moderate feature.

From the weekend into early next week the most prominent source of
uncertainty becomes how quickly upper low energy and surrounding
flow escape from the North Pacific (part of a longer term blocky
regime over the Pacific and Bering Sea/Alaska). The 00Z ECMWF
deviated significant from its prior run and most other guidance in
being rather fast to bring the North Pacific energy into western
North America. On the opposite side of the spectrum, GFS runs have
tended to build the strongest upper ridge just off the West Coast
by Sunday-Monday to yield more Rockies/High Plains troughing by
next Monday. The 12Z GFS has tempered its late-period ridge-trough
pattern a little bit. Diverse ensemble members average out to a
modest ridge-trough pattern in the GEFS/CMCens while the ECens
mean is nearly zonal. How the details from the Pacific into the
West work out will eventually affect the forecast of the trough
moving into the East, with the majority of guidance at least
suggesting the eastern trough will become less amplified than seen
in the 00Z ECMWF (with corresponding effects on surface frontal
position). The new 12Z ECMWF has trended closer to what consensus
exits for most aspects of the late-period pattern.

Based on the review of 00Z/06Z guidance, the updated forecast
started with the 00Z GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/CMC early in the period to
represent latest trends for the northern tier system and to avoid
the less confident aspects of the 06Z GFS. Question marks in both
the GFS and ECMWF during the latter half of the period led to a
rapid transition to 50-70 percent total weight of the 06Z GEFS/00Z
ECMWF means, yielding a solution as close to continuity as could
be hoped in light of the spread and variability of models/ensemble
members.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial upper ridging across the southern Plains and rising
heights farther east over the Deep South will continue to promote
a broad area of heat into Saturday. The greatest and most lasting
anomalies should be over Texas (persisting from the short range
time frame) where some locations could see highs up to 15-25F
above normal, with numerous daily record highs likely. The heat
across Texas should finally begin to moderate from north to south
by next weekend an upper trough pressing through the West supports
an arriving cold front. However, warm to hot temperatures will
extend into the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. with potential
for daily record highs, and warmer than average temperatures by
10-20F or so should expand in coverage across the Ohio Valley to
Eastern Seaboard by later in the week.

A warm front lifting through the Ohio Valley/Appalachians on
Thursday will continue to provide a focus for showers and storms
on Thursday, with a very localized flood threat particularly if
heavy rainfall falls in areas that are already sensitive.
Meanwhile, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is likely on
Thursday in association with a deepening northern tier storm
system that should lift away from the Upper Great Lakes on Friday.
The system's evolution is somewhat complex and guidance is still
adjusting with some specifics. Currently the best potential for
flooding/flash flooding exists over parts of North Dakota and
northern Minnesota where antecedent conditions are the wettest. A
separate band of enhanced rainfall may exist farther
south/southeast where greater instability exists. By
Friday-Saturday, above average moisture and instability will allow
for rain and thunderstorms to spread along the frontal boundary as
it pushes through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley/Mississippi Valley
and then into the East. Locally heavy rainfall is possible but
additional time is needed to resolve areas of greatest potential.
The Storm Prediction Center highlights a threat for severe weather
over some of the same areas with heavy rainfall potential along
and ahead of the cold front Thursday and Friday. Behind this
front, unseasonably cool temperatures will slide across the
Northwest/northern Rockies on Thursday into the north-central U.S.
Friday and Saturday, with highs generally 10-20F below normal.
Parts of the northern-central High Plains could be colder than
that on Friday. This cold spell should lower snow levels and
possibly allow for some light snow to fall even in northern parts
of the High Plains. The Northwest will be fairly dry late this
week but may see some moisture return during the weekend or early
next week, with uncertain flow details keeping confidence low for
specifics of timing/coverage/amounts of any precipitation. The
southern half of the West should see a warming trend expand from
west to east Saturday-Monday with California seeing the warmest
high temperature anomalies of plus 10-15F. Elsewhere, guidance
agrees that tropical moisture should surge northward across the
Florida peninsula late this week into the weekend, bringing a
round of heavy rainfall to portions of the Sunshine State.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0136 AM CDT Tue May 17 2022

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Weak high pressure will build into the Southwest on Wednesday with
weak flow aloft. This should keep wind concerns mostly muted across
the region. Dry and breezy conditions are possible across portions
of southern and southeast Wyoming, but fuels are not that dry in
this region.

Some dry thunderstorms are possible across portions of southern
Colorado and northeast New Mexico on Wednesday. Most CAM guidance
shows isolated to scattered storms developing on the higher terrain
before moving eastward in an environment with PWAT around 0.6
inches. Therefore, these storms should be dry and may result in new
fire starts.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 AM CDT Tue May 17 2022

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A weak mid-level shortwave trough will traverse the Southwest today.
This will lead to increasing mid-level flow across New Mexico and
the southern High Plains. In addition, lee cyclogenesis is expected
which will tighten the surface pressure gradient across the
Southwest and southern High Plains. As a result, breezy conditions
will develop amid 5 to 13 percent relative humidity. At this time,
the strongest winds are forecast east of the dryline beneath a
strengthening low-level jet. A dry environment with deep mixing is
expected immediately east of the dryline which should allow some of
this stronger flow to mix to the surface.

In addition, some dry and breezy conditions are expected in northern
and northeastern Montana. While fuels remain mostly unreceptive
across Montana, ERC values are nearing or exceeding the 90th
percentile in portions of north-central Montana. Therefore, a small
elevated delineation has been added across this area for this small
region of more favorable fuels.

Thunderstorms are expected to form in the vicinity of a dryline
across west Texas into the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles this afternoon.
These storms will develop in an airmass with PWAT around 0.6 to 0.75
inches. Therefore, these storms should be drier, especially
initially, with the threat for lightning induced fire starts.

...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. through this week with anomalous heat expanding into the East
this weekend...

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding possible near a strong
northern tier system on Thursday...


...Overview...

The pattern across the lower 48 will amplify again by the start of
the medium range period on Friday with a digging trough over the
West/north-central U.S. and rising heights in the East. This
yields cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in the West
and a continued hot regime for the South and East late this week.
A deepening low pressure system tracking from the northern
tier/Upper Great Lakes into Canada will push a strong cold front
eastward, with increasing chances for heavy rainfall and severe
weather along and ahead of it. The front/trough will eventually
reach the East this weekend as the guidance continues to be very
uncertain with details upstream across the Northwest into early
next week. A northward surge of tropical moisture will also
increase rain/thunderstorm chances across Florida late this week
and into the weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Overall, guidance continues to show a more open shortwave across
the northern Plains/upper Mississippi Valley on Friday, although
the 00z UKMET came in showing a compact closed low again, so some
uncertainty remains with that particular feature. Regardless, the
models show good agreement (with some minor timing differences) on
amplified troughing sliding into the East by the weekend. After
Saturday/day 4, the most prominent source of uncertainty continues
to be flow evolution across the West. The GFS and many GEFS
members continue to be much stronger/more pronounced with energy
on the backside of the trailing trough into the Northwest this
weekend, which eventually results in another fairly amplified
shortwave into the Intermountain West/Rockies by early next week.
On the other extreme, recent runs of the ECMWF are rather
flat/more ridgy with the flow over the West late period. This all
seems to stem from differences in how quickly energy from the
North Pacific moves into western North America. The ECMWF is much
faster to break down the East Pacific ridge which allows the
energy to slide inland, while the GFS tends to maintain a more
blocky ridge allowing for more amplification downstream across the
West. Yesterday 12z CMC was more like the ECMWF, although todays
00z run is more amplified like the 18z/00z GFS. The ensemble means
themselves seem to agree with their deterministic counterparts,
although there are a fair number of members showing both
possibilities. In other words, this aspect of the forecast remains
very uncertain.

WPCs forecast for tonight used a general blend of the
deterministic models through day 5, with a quicker than usual
transition towards the ensemble means days 6-7 (with smaller parts
of the both the ECMWF and GFS for a little more definition to
individual systems). This resulted is a good middle ground
compromise for the Western U.S. flow, which also maintained good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast through day 6.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The relentless heat across the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley should finally break after Friday, though much warmer than
normal temperatures continue across the East into Saturday.
Numerous daily records could be met or exceeded still on Friday
across Texas/Louisiana and the Southeast on Friday, with a handful
of record values on Saturday in the East.

A strong cold front will spread for rain and thunderstorms to
spread through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley/Mississippi Valley on
Friday and into the East on Saturday. Heavy rainfall as well as
severe weather is possible along this boundary given above normal
moisture and instability present. Flooding and flash flooding
could be an issue as well, particularly in places that may be
sensitive to additional rainfall given wet antecedent conditions.
Behind this front, unseasonably cool temperatures will slide into
the north-central U.S. Friday and Saturday, with highs generally
10-20F below normal. Parts of the northern-central High Plains
could be colder than that on Friday. This cold spell should lower
snow levels and possibly allow for some light snow to fall even in
northern parts of the High Plains. The Northwest will be fairly
dry late this week but may see some moisture return during the
weekend or early next week, with uncertain flow details keeping
confidence low for specifics of timing/coverage/amounts of any
precipitation. The southern half of the West should see a warming
trend expand from west to east Saturday-Monday with California
seeing the warmest high temperature anomalies of plus 10-15F.
Elsewhere, guidance agrees that tropical moisture should surge
northward across the Florida peninsula late this week into the
weekend, bringing a round of heavy rainfall to portions of the
Sunshine State.

...Relentless record-breaking heat continues through Friday across
the South with anomalous heat into the East this weekend...

...Heavy rainfall and severe weather likely along a cold front
from the Midwest to the East Friday and Saturday...


...Overview...

The pattern across the lower 48 will amplify again by the start of
the medium range period on Friday with a digging trough over the
West/north-central U.S. and rising heights in the East. This
yields cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in the West
and a continued hot regime for the South and East late this week.
A deepening low pressure system tracking from the northern
tier/Upper Great Lakes into Canada will push a strong cold front
eastward, with increasing chances for heavy rainfall and severe
weather along and ahead of it. The front/trough will eventually
reach the East this weekend as the guidance continues to be very
uncertain with details upstream across the Northwest into early
next week. A northward surge of tropical moisture will also
increase rain/thunderstorm chances across Florida late this week
and into the weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Overall, guidance continues to show a more open shortwave across
the northern Plains/upper Mississippi Valley on Friday, although
the 00z UKMET came in showing a compact closed low again, so some
uncertainty remains with that particular feature. Regardless, the
models show good agreement (with some minor timing differences) on
amplified troughing sliding into the East by the weekend. After
Saturday/day 4, the most prominent source of uncertainty continues
to be flow evolution across the West. The GFS and many GEFS
members continue to be much stronger/more pronounced with energy
on the backside of the trailing trough into the Northwest this
weekend, which eventually results in another fairly amplified
shortwave into the Intermountain West/Rockies by early next week.
On the other extreme, recent runs of the ECMWF are rather
flat/more ridgy with the flow over the West late period. This all
seems to stem from differences in how quickly energy from the
North Pacific moves into western North America. The ECMWF is much
faster to break down the East Pacific ridge which allows the
energy to slide inland, while the GFS tends to maintain a more
blocky ridge allowing for more amplification downstream across the
West. Yesterday 12z CMC was more like the ECMWF, although todays
00z run is more amplified like the 18z/00z GFS. The ensemble means
themselves seem to agree with their deterministic counterparts,
although there are a fair number of members showing both
possibilities. In other words, this aspect of the forecast remains
very uncertain.

The WPC forecast for tonight used a general blend of the
deterministic models through day 5, with a quicker than usual
transition towards the ensemble means days 6-7 (with smaller parts
of the both the ECMWF and GFS for a little more definition to
individual systems). This resulted is a good middle ground
compromise for the Western U.S. flow, which also maintained good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast through day 6.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The relentless heat across the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley should finally break after Friday, though much warmer than
normal temperatures continue across the East into Saturday.
Numerous daily records could be met or exceeded still on Friday
across Texas/Louisiana and the Southeast on Friday, with a handful
of record values on Saturday in the East.

A strong cold front will spread for rain and thunderstorms to
spread through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley/Mississippi Valley on
Friday and into the East on Saturday. Heavy rainfall as well as
severe weather is possible along this boundary given above normal
moisture and instability present. Flooding and flash flooding
could be an issue as well, particularly in places that may be
sensitive to additional rainfall given wet antecedent conditions.
Behind this front, unseasonably cool temperatures will move from
the Rockies into the north-central U.S., lowering snow levels
across the Rockies and even allowing for some light snow in
northern parts of the High Plains. The Northwest will be fairly
dry late this week but may see some moisture return during the
weekend or early next week, with uncertain flow details keeping
confidence low for specifics of timing/coverage/amounts of any
precipitation. The southern half of the West should see a warming
trend expand from west to east Saturday-Monday with California
seeing the warmest high temperature anomalies of plus 10-15F.
Elsewhere, guidance agrees that tropical moisture should surge
northward across the Florida peninsula late this week into the
weekend, bringing a round of heavy rainfall to portions of the
Sunshine State.

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding likely over portions of
the Middle/Upper Mississippi Valley and Central Plains today and
Wednesday...

...Record breaking heat to persist across the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley through midweek...

...Critical Fire risk for parts of west-central Texas today...

Showers and scattered thunderstorms will spread across the
Northern/Central Plains and Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley today
as a low pressure system glides through the area. Some locally
heavy rainfall leading to flash flooding are possible along a
quasi-stationary warm front that will slide across northeastern
Kansas and northern Missouri. Severe thunderstorms capable of
producing large hail, wind damage and a few tornadoes are expected
to materialize across portions of the Central Plains and
Lower/Middle Missouri Valley this afternoon and evening. An
enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms is in effect for parts of
southeastern Nebraska, northeastern Kansas northwestern Missouri
and southwestern Iowa. Meanwhile, relatively warm, dry and windy
conditions will contribute to a critical fire weather threat over
west-central Texas today.

Showers and thunderstorms move into the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic
on Wednesday. Fortunately, severe thunderstorm and flash flooding
risks will be marginal. A new system will arrive over the Pacific
Northwest on Wednesday morning, spreading rain over the coast and
lower elevations as well as light mountain snow over the northern
Cascades. Showers and isolated thunderstorms develop over the
Northern Rockies and the foothills of Montana by Wednesday
afternoon and evening. Meanwhile, scattered to isolated
thunderstorm activity may also materialize over parts of the
western Central/Southern Plains.

Record breaking heat is expected to expand beneath a ridge of high
pressure situated over the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley through late week. Widespread high temperature records are
forecast to be tied or broken in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana
through Thursday. Highs in Texas are likely to be in the 90s and
100s over the next several days, which will pose a health risk to
those who are heat sensitive or are without adequate air
conditioning. There will be little relief over night when lows
will only drop into the upper 60s and 70s. High temperatures will
be between 20-30 degrees above average for much of central
Texas/Oklahoma during this period.

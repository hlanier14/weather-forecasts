...Bitterly cold temperatures to continue Thursday-Saturday across
portions of the Northern Plains...

...Heavy rain across across parts of the Tennessee/Ohio Valley New
Year's Eve/New Year's Day...


...Overview and Guidance...
An amplified ridge will be anchored over the northern Pacific
Ocean through this period, which will continue to support an upper
trough over the western U.S.; this pattern will favor very brisk
temperatures. A separate piece of energy within the larger scale
trough should track a little offshore southern California
Thursday-Friday. The overall pattern will begin to transition by
the weekend as a new ridge builds farther west, leading to a
deepening trough over the Northeast Pacific and renewed moisture
feed into the Northwest U.S. The trough and associated moisture
will track into the central and eastern part of the country. A
much weaker wavy frontal system will depart from the East late
this week.

The latest model guidance continues to have similar patterns and
evolution through the extended therefore choose to take a
multi-model approach; this also helps maintain continuity from the
previous forecast. The WPC blend used the 12Z ECWMF/CMC/UKMET,
12/18Z GFS initially and gradually increased the use of the EC
ensemble means and the GEFS means trough the middle and later
periods.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Lingering showers are expected across parts of the Southeast near
a wavy cold front  along with snow over the Northeast near the
parent low pressure. Scattered to widespread showers and
thunderstorms will move across the Plains towards the eastern U.S.
as a low pressure system and associated fronts develops. A plume
of deep moisture will accompany this system and intensify over the
Tennessee Valley; where conditions will be very favorable for
moderate to heavy rainfall to occur. There will be an elevated
risk for local flooding concerns as this region has had recent
soaking rains to lower local flash flood guidance. Expect some
wintry weather in the northern side of the precipitation
shield--from parts of the Northern/Central Plains through the
Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast. The intensity and storm
track, along with any waves along the boundary, will determine the
the location and amounts.

Heavy mountain snow will spread across the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies Thursday ahead of an approaching shortwave.
Abundant moisture will be directed onshore southern California
with the upper trough/possible closed low positioned offshore.
Moderate to locally heavy rainfall may be possible in the lower
elevations; with snow spreading across the higher terrain
especially over the Colorado Rockies with the merging of northern
and southern stream upper systems. A third system nearing the
Pacific Northwest will usher in an additional round of heavy
mountain snow by the weekend. Lower elevation rain could become
moderate to heavy from the Pacific Northwest into northwestern
California by early next week.

The frigid airmass over the northern tier should persist through
at least Saturday with the daily readings averaging 20 to 35
degrees below average for the end of the year. A few locations in
far northern North Dakota and Montana may stay below 0 F even into
next weekend, despite temperatures moderating slightly as the week
progresses. Gusty winds will create some dangerous wind chill
values of below 0 F. Temperatures are also likely to be below
normal by about 5-15 degrees across the rest of the western U.S.
through Sunday. Warm and mild weather is expected across the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic into Sunday, with daily temperature
readings of 15 to 25 degrees warmer than normal from the Southern
Plains to the Ohio Valley and east into the Mid-Atlantic region.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CST Tue Dec 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist into Wednesday for parts of the
southern Plains as a second upper-level disturbance transverses the
region. A shortwave trough, currently noted in water-vapor imagery
off the OR coast, is forecast to propagate across the southern
Rockies and into the south-central Plains early Wednesday. Current
indications suggest a similar synoptic evolution to Tuesday may
occur in which 20+ mph sustained winds exit the region prior to peak
diurnal heating. Nonetheless, the regional pressure gradient will
maintain 15-20 mph winds across the broader region throughout the
day.

Across the Southwest, dewpoint temperatures are generally within the
50-75th percentiles compared to climatology for late December. While
this moisture is not anomalously high, it will gradually filter into
the southern High Plains/southern Plains over the next 48 hours and
may limit the potential for sub-20% RH. An additional mitigating
factor is a gradual cooling trend that is depicted in most ensemble
members. However, mostly clear skies may support sufficient
boundary-layer warming/mixing to yield areas of RH values in the
15-20% range (as suggested by a few drier solutions). Additionally,
some uncertainty exists regarding the northeastern extent of the
fire weather concern as a stalled cold front across KS begins to
shift south through the day. Overall, these trends in observations
and guidance point towards reasonably high potential for elevated
fire weather conditions with the possibility of localized/transient
critical conditions.

...Spring like temperatures persist in the South and East;
elevated fire weather risk for parts of the Southern Plains;
bitterly cold wind chills in the northern Rocking and High Plains
today...

...Wintry weather to cause treacherous travel conditions from the
Midwest to the interior Northeast today; Slight Risks for severe
storms and Excessive Rainfall posted in parts of the Deep South
Wednesday...

...Heavy snow for parts of the Sierra Nevada and Central/Southern
Rockies...

The jet stream pattern heading into the middle of the week
continues to indicate troughing in the west and ridging in the
Southeast. The result is a distinct separation of air-masses;
winter is in full control in the West while spring-like
temperatures are firmly entrenched in the South and East Central
U.S.. Numerous record high temps and warm daily lows are expected
throughout much of the South with daily temperature departures
ranging between 25 to 35 degrees above normal. The mixture of
anomalous heat, very dry conditions, and gusty winds keeps an
Elevated Risk area for fire weather conditions in place atop the
southern High Plains. The anomalous warmth backs off slightly in
the South by Thursday, but lows that are warmer than the normal
highs for late December will be common up and down the East Coast
Thursday morning. In the West, much colder temperatures are
expected with the coldest temperatures in the Northwest, northern
Rockies, and northern High Plains. Daily low temperatures will
fall below -20 degrees in parts of Montana and North Dakota, which
combined with gusty winds cause wind chills to plummet as low as
50 degrees below zero through Tuesday morning. Even daytime highs
will struggle to get above zero in these regions. The West Coast
has the best chance to witness record cold max temperatures
through Wednesday.

As upper level disturbances track through the Intermountain West
and head east into the Plains, unsettled weather will become
increasingly more common in parts of the South and East. The first
storm system is beginning to unfold this morning in the central
Plains with precipitation blossoming from the Texas Panhandles to
the Midwest. Light but still potentially hazardous wintry weather
is on tap from the Midwest and Great Lakes to the northern
Mid-Atlantic. Winter Weather Advisories have been posted not just
for up to a few inches of snow, but also an icy wintry mix of
snow, sleet, and freezing rain that could result in up to a tenth
of an inch of ice accumulation in some of these regions. Within
the storm's warm sector, periods of rain are expected from the
Middle Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley. Rain may fall
heavily at times and could lead to localized flash flooding, thus
prompting the issuance of a Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall.
Farther south, thunderstorms are in the forecast for the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys with a Marginal Risk for severe
storms in southeast Louisiana. As a new upper level disturbance
ejects out of New Mexico on Wednesday morning, it will support and
even more favorable environment for severe weather and excessive
rainfall later in the day on Wednesday. This has prompted the
issuance of Slight Risks for both potential hazards in the
Tennessee Valley and Deep South.

The ongoing troughing pattern out West will keep generating wintry
weather from the Sierra Nevada to the southern and central
Rockies. The heaviest snowfall accumulations will be confined to
the Mogollon Rim of Arizona and the Rockies of Colorado and
northern New Mexico. Snowfall totals in the highest peaks will
generally average 1 to 2 feet today with locally higher amounts
possible. Lighter accumulations compared to recent days are
anticipated today along the West Coast, but the next upper level
feature diving through the West Coast will usher in yet another
round of heavy snow to the Sierra Nevada late Tuesday into
Wednesday. By early Thursday morning, another 1 to 2 feet of snow
will have fallen in throughout much of the Sierra Nevada with
locally higher totals in the tallest peaks. Expect more hazards
travel conditions in these mountain ranges through the middle of
the week.

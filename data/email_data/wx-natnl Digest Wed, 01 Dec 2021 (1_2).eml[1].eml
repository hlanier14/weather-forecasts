Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CST Tue Nov 30 2021

Valid 301700Z - 011200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes were made
with this outlook. Locally breezy offshore flow combined with
diurnal heating/mixing will result in Elevated fire-weather
conditions across the coastal ranges and adjacent foothills of
southern California this afternoon and evening, where a dry
antecedent airmass exists. Brief Critical conditions will also be
possible across terrain-favored areas late in the period, especially
across portions of Ventura County where offshore winds will be
enhanced. Poor overnight RH recoveries and a continuation of modest
offshore flow will support Elevated fire-weather conditions into Day
2/Wednesday.

..Weinman/Bentley.. 11/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1235 AM CST Tue Nov 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad northwest flow will persist aloft over much of the CONUS
through the forecast period. A weak cutoff low off over Baja CA will
continue to meander along the coast and maintain northeasterly flow
off the southern CA coast. This will support another day of fire
weather concerns within the coastal mountains. Elsewhere, localized
fire weather concerns are possible for parts of the southern High
Plains while dry conditions persist across the Southeast.

...Coastal Southern California...
Early morning surface observations show relatively poor overnight
relative humidity recovery with RH values in the teens and low 20s
for many mountainous locations. Continued downslope flow through the
day and daytime heating will foster RH reductions into the low teens
by this afternoon. A modest offshore pressure gradient should
support elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions as
winds gust to 15-30 mph within the coastal mountains (and possibly
up to 40 mph for more wind-prone locations).

...Central and Southern High Plains...
A weak cold front draped from the Great Lakes into the central
Plains will continue to push south through the day. Breezy
post-frontal winds will likely reach 15 to 20 mph across eastern NM
and adjacent areas of western TX. Drier air will filter into the
region, but dewpoints in the low 20s (noted in upstream
observations) will remain within the seasonal range. Combined with
weak cold advection, RH reductions into the 20-35% range are
expected. Localized elevated conditions are possible given dry fine
fuels, but confidence in the duration and coverage of the fire
weather threat remains too low for highlights.

...Southeast...
Dry conditions are expected again today with RH reductions to near
30%, and perhaps as low as 25%, from southern GA into the Carolinas.
Although fuels are somewhat dry, weak surface flow over the region
and poor alignment of low-level and stronger mid-level winds will
limit the potential fire weather concerns.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 PM EST Tue Nov 30 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Dec 03 2021 - 12Z Tue Dec 07 2021

...Overview...

During the Friday-Tuesday period expect an eastern Pacific mean
ridge aloft to support varying degrees of cyclonic flow across
southern Canada and portions of the lower 48, with the overall
mean trough axis tending to extend from central Canada into the
Great Lakes/Northeast.  Upper troughing should be fairly shallow
late this week and then become somewhat more amplified after
Saturday.  This pattern will carry along a series of surface waves
and frontal systems, most of which should produce light to
moderate precipitation.  A front reaching the West early next week
may support a period of heavier activity from the Pacific
Northwest into the Rockies.  Meanwhile one or more pieces of
energy over the eastern Pacific/far southwest corner of the U.S.
may consolidated into an upper low that settles near Baja
California.  This feature should not produce much significant
weather during the period.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The most prominent uncertainties over the lower 48 seem to arise
from question marks with a couple streams of flow within a general
trough to the south of Alaska.  A leading shortwave reaches the
Pacific Northwest by early Saturday and there are already
amplitude differences at that time with even more significant
spread for the corresponding surface pattern off the Pacific
Northwest coast.  A preferred intermediate solution would have a
moderate wave not far from the 00Z ECMWF mean position but
somewhat weaker than it or the 00Z ECMWF/12Z CMC.  The latest
GFS/UKMET are quite weak and suppressed.

Early differences with this shortwave and then differences in how
streams interact within the trough south of Alaska cascade lead to
rapidly increasing spread for low pressure tracking from the

Latest GFS/GEFS runs and the 12Z UKMET dig the incoming shortwave
energy rather strongly into the east-central U.S., leading to

Additional energy should drop into the western half of the country

The new 12Z GFS is on the deep side of guidance by early Tuesday.
Also note that 06Z/12Z GFS runs are on the eastern side of the
full guidance spread for the upper low near Baja California by
Sunday.

A blend of the 00Z/06Z GFS runs and past two ECMWF runs, along
with modest 00Z CMC/UKMET input, provided a good representation of
forecast preferences during the first half of the period.  The
forecast transitioned to a mix of the aforementioned GFS/ECMWF/CMC
runs and 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means thereafter.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A wavy front progressing from the West/Plains through the East
along with another wavy front farther north will bring relatively
light precipitation to the Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast
late this week into the weekend.  Moisture increasing ahead of the
cold front extending into the southern Plains should produce
scattered showers and a few thunderstorms from the Deep South to
the Ohio Valley over the weekend, but amounts are not likely to be
excessive.  A shortwave and frontal system may brush the extreme
northern Pacific Northwest/Rockies with some precipitation during
the weekend.  This system could then produce a band of
precipitation from the northern Plains through the Northeast into
early next week.  However confidence is low for exact
timing/track/depth of the surface low, so it will take additional
time to resolve precipitation type and amounts across this broad
area.  A shortwave and cold front reaching the Pacific Northwest
by early next week should bring an episode of moderate to locally
heavy rain and mountain snows to western Washington and Oregon.
Expect some of this moisture to reach farther inland through the
West, with best potential for heavy snow over the northern
Rockies--including the higher elevations of northern Idaho,
western Montana, and western Wyoming.

Temperatures will be above normal for early December across most
of the nation through early next week.  The greatest positive
anomalies should be over the central and southern Plains on Friday
with highs forecast to be 15-25F above average.  Another episode
of well above normal temperatures is likely for parts of the
Plains next Monday-Tuesday ahead of the next cold front with a
broad area of highs and morning lows at least 10-20F above normal.
 A few locations may approach daily record highs with these mild
temperatures.  The Northeast U.S. will be an exception to the
generally warm theme as mean troughing aloft will keep
temperatures fairly cold with highs running up to 10 degrees below
normal through the weekend.  However, no major arctic airmass
intrusions are expected during this forecast period.

...Overview...

During the Friday-Tuesday period expect an eastern Pacific mean
ridge aloft to support varying degrees of cyclonic flow across
southern Canada and portions of the lower 48, with the overall
mean trough axis tending to extend from central Canada into the
Great Lakes/Northeast.  Upper troughing should be fairly shallow
late this week and then become somewhat more amplified after
Saturday.  This pattern will carry along a series of surface waves
and frontal systems, most of which should produce light to
moderate precipitation.  A front reaching the West early next week
may support a period of heavier activity from the Pacific
Northwest into the Rockies.  Meanwhile one or more pieces of
energy over the eastern Pacific/far southwest corner of the U.S.
may consolidated into an upper low that settles near Baja
California.  This feature should not produce much significant
weather during the period.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The most prominent uncertainties over the lower 48 seem to arise
from question marks with a couple streams of flow within a general
trough to the south of Alaska.  A leading shortwave reaches the
Pacific Northwest by early Saturday and there are already
amplitude differences at that time with even more significant
spread for the corresponding surface pattern off the Pacific
Northwest coast.  A preferred intermediate solution would have a
moderate wave not far from the 00Z ECMWF mean position but
somewhat weaker than it or the 00Z ECMWF/12Z CMC.  The latest
GFS/UKMET are quite weak and suppressed.

Early differences with this shortwave and then differences in how
streams interact within the trough south of Alaska cascade lead to
rapidly increasing spread for low pressure tracking from the
Plains into eastern Canada/Northeast U.S. by Sunday-Monday.
Latest GFS/GEFS runs and the 12Z UKMET dig the incoming shortwave
energy rather strongly into the east-central U.S., leading to
strong low pressure over the Great Lakes/southeastern Canada by
early Monday.  In contrast the 00Z ECMWF and latest CMC runs are
more progressive and less amplified, leading to weaker and farther
east/southeast low pressure.  Highlighting the uncertainty,
individual ensemble members are very diverse and GFS/ECMWF runs
have occasionally switched places in recent days.  For example a
number of recent ECMWF runs had some similarity to the GFS but the
00Z ECMWF happened to be similar to yesterday's 00Z GFS that was
on the weaker/suppressed side versus most GFS runs.  Prefer to
maintain a compromise approach that is fairly close to continuity.

Additional energy should drop into the western half of the country
by next Tuesday but with considerable differences for specifics.
The new 12Z GFS is on the deep side of guidance by early Tuesday.
Also note that 06Z/12Z GFS runs are on the eastern side of the
full guidance spread for the upper low near Baja California by
Sunday.

A blend of the 00Z/06Z GFS runs and past two ECMWF runs, along

300 PM EST November 30 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast to move across Alaska early in
week-2, resulting in a period of below normal temperatures across the weste=
rn
Mainland. This feature is likely to result in enhanced Pacific flow across =
the
Northwest contiguous U.S., bringing rounds of heavy precipitation (coastal
rain
and high elevation snow) to parts of the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California. There is considerable uncertainty in the dynamical guidance in
terms of the mid-level height pattern evolution across the eastern U.S. The=
 0z
ECMWF ensemble depicts stronger and more progressive mid-level low pressure
moving through the East compared to the 0z and 6z GEFS ensembles. While the
ECMWF solution would favor a colder and drier pattern across portions of th=
e
Midwest and Northeast, the slower GEFS supports a frontal system moving
through
the eastern CONUS early in the period increasing precipitation chances.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Pacific Northwest an=
d
Northern California, Wed-Fri, Dec 8-10.

Slight risk of heavy snow across parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern
Great Basin, Wed-Thu, Dec 8-9.

FOR WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 08 - TUESDAY DECEMBER 14: Longwave troughing is
forecast
across north-central Canada and the southern Arctic during week-2 associate=
d
with negative 500-hPa height anomalies over most of Canada and extending
through the North Atlantic. Further south across the CONUS, the mid-level
height pattern is predicted to be more tranquil, with near to above normal
heights generally forecast for most areas for the period as a whole,
especially
over the Southeast. The greatest uncertainty is related to the propagation =
of
a
shortwave trough out of the mean longwave trough over Canada early in week-=
2.
The 0z ECMWF ensemble is fairly robust with this potential, showing an area=
 of
negative 500-hPa height anomalies shifting from the Upper Midwest late in
week-1 to the Northeast by day-9 (12/9). The ECMWF solution would also resu=
lt
in a period of anomalously cold temperatures across the Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley, and Northeast on the backside of the trough. Conversely, the 0z and=
 6z
GEFS are weaker and slower with this shortwave feature, but still indicate =
the
potential for a cold front to push through the eastern U.S. early in week-2=
.
The GEFS reforecast tool indicates a broad area of the East with probabilit=
ies
exceeding 20% for 3-day precipitation exceeding the 85th percentile, and so=
me
of this would likely be snow across parts of the Great Lakes and New Englan=
d.
The ECMWF reforecast tool does not depict these enhanced precipitation
probabilities, likely due to its more progressive solution with any
precipitation impacts more likely to occur prior to the start of week-2, an=
d
only lingering chances existing across the Northeast on day-8 (12/8). Altho=
ugh
the GEFS indicates some anomalously cold temperatures across portions of th=
e
Upper Midwest and Great Lakes behind the front, the Eastern Seaboard is spa=
red
from these colder temperatures. Due to the large amount of uncertainty betw=
een
the guidance, no related temperature or precipitation hazards are highlight=
ed
across the East in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook.



There is greater model consensus upstream, where troughing is forecast to m=
ove
across Alaska and the Northeast Pacific, and eventually into the West Coast=
 of
the CONUS toward the middle of the period. This trough supports enhanced
moisture flow over the northwestern CONUS early in week-2, with the GEFS an=
d
ECMWF ensembles indicating elevated probabilities (40-60%) of integrated va=
por
transport exceeding 250 kg/m/s. This would favor enhanced chances of heavy
precipitation across the Pacific Northwest and northern California, support=
ing
a slight risk of heavy precipitation over these areas from 12/8 to 12/10. T=
he
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day liq=
uid
equivalent totals exceeding the 85h percentile and 2 inches over parts of t=
he
highlighted region. Heavy rainfall is anticipated for lower elevation areas=
,
whereas higher elevation areas may receive heavy snow. As the trough moves
closer to the West Coast, surface low development over the Rockies may
increase
chances for heavy snow over the higher elevations of the Northern Great Bas=
in
and Northern Rockies, and a corresponding slight risk of heavy snow is issu=
ed
for 12/8 and 12/9.



As the aforementioned troughing moves across Alaska early in the period,
enhanced northerly mid-level flow on its backside is likely to result in a
period of below normal temperatures over western Mainland and the Alaska
Peninsula, with minimum temperature anomalies reaching -10 deg F in some ar=
eas
according to the uncalibrated ECMWF and GEFS guidance. The 0z and 6z
deterministic GFS runs are particularly aggressive with the cold depicting
some
areas having temperatures fall below -20 deg F. Therefore, a slight risk of
much below normal temperatures is maintained across portions of western
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula for 12/8 and 12/9. The GEFS is mor=
e
amplified with ridging over the Aleutians and southwestern Mainland compare=
d
to
the ECMWF ensemble, and would favor a moderation in temperatures over the
western Mainland by the middle of week-2. The ECMWF maintains higher
probabilities of below normal temperatures throughout the period. Anomalous=
ly
cold air temperatures are also forecast to develop over the Panhandle later=
 in
week-2 as the downstream troughing continues to progress to the east.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 PM CST Tue Nov 30 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

No changes have been made to the previous forecast. Periods of
Elevated to brief Critical fire-weather conditions are still
anticipated across primarily terrain-favored areas of southern
California on Wednesday. The best overlap of breezy northeasterly
surface winds and critically low RH (8-20%) is expected on Wednesday
morning into the early afternoon -- when the offshore pressure
gradient should peak in intensity with strengthening flow aloft.

Farther east across portions of the central High Plains, locally
Elevated fire-weather conditions may develop during the afternoon
hours, aided by downslope warming/drying and modest westerly surface
winds. These conditions appear too marginal for fire-weather
highlights at this time.

..Weinman/Bentley.. 11/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CST Tue Nov 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level flow regime will largely remain in place through the
end of the Day 2/Wednesday period. The weak upper-level low
currently over Baja CA will persist off the southern CA coast, but
is forecast to weaken through the day. As a result, offshore
pressure gradient winds will persist from late Tuesday into
Wednesday morning, but will gradually diminish through the late
afternoon/evening. With dry fuels already in place, another day of
fire weather concerns is expected. Elsewhere, fire weather concerns
will be limited due to questionable overlap of strong winds and dry
conditions.

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient is expected to linger into early
Wednesday morning, and may strengthen slightly between the 12-18 UTC
period per some model solutions. However, ensemble means suggest
strong downslope winds will likely remain confined to the higher
coastal terrain with gusts between 15 to 30 mph. Downslope effects
will maintain reduced RH values in the teens, which will continue to
support at least elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions - especially across Los Angeles and Ventura counties
where probabilities for sustained critical conditions are relatively
higher. The spatially limited nature of the threat precludes
Critical risk highlights, but ensemble guidance and observations
will continue to be monitored for trends towards windier solutions.

30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR DECEMBER 2021

The updated December 2021 temperature and precipitation outlooks are based =
on
the Weather Prediction Center=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecasts for the=
 first week of the month,
the
Climate Prediction Center=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs Week-2 outlooks, Week=
 3-4 model guidance, and
daily
CFS model runs initialized during late November. La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa c=
omposites and
decadal
trends continue to play a role in the December outlooks. Dynamical models
depict a better defined and eastward propagation of the Madden-Julian
Oscillation (MJO) over the Pacific during the next two weeks. This MJO
evolution would typically lead to an increased chance of anomalously cold
temperatures overspreading the CONUS by week 3. However, large uncertainty
remains on how much, if any, the MJO influences the mid-latitude circulatio=
n
pattern over North America as the MJO destructively interferes with the
well-established La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa. The week 3-4 (Dec 15-28) model s=
olutions depict
elevated probabilities for below normal temperatures across the Pacific
Northwest, northern Rockies, northern Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley.
Above normal temperatures are generally favored across these areas during t=
he
first two week of December as the Arctic Oscillation is forecast to be in a
positive phase with anomalous cold remaining north of the U.S.-Canada borde=
r.
Given the potential for this anomalous cold to shift south during the latte=
r
half of December, equal chances (EC) of below, near, or above normal
temperatures are forecast across much of the northwestern and north-central
CONUS. EC is also forecast for most of the Northeast where a variable
temperature pattern is expected throughout the month. Probabilities of belo=
w
normal temperatures are slightly elevated across northwest Oregon and weste=
rn
Washington since week-2 tools have recently trended colder there and week 3=
-4
model solutions favor below normal temperatures. Elsewhere across the lower
48,
temperature tools feature increased chances of above normal temperatures
throughout December.



A relatively dry start to the month is likely due to fast, progressive flow
prevailing, but by week-2 model guidance depicts very weak precipitation
signals. Week 3-4 precipitation tools are generally consistent with La Ni=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
composites. Based on the latest precipitation tools, no major revisions wer=
e
required for the updated December precipitation outlook. The coverage for
favored dryness across southern California and the Southwest was reduced si=
nce
model solutions are depicting a developing longwave trough over the western
CONUS by mid-December. Probabilities for below normal precipitation were
increased across the Southeast given the good model agreement and consisten=
cy
at all time scales.



The anomalously cold pattern across much of Alaska is likely to persist int=
o
December with a continuation of negative 500-hPa height anomalies and remai=
n
for much of the month as even week 3-4 tools are depicting increased chance=
s
of
below normal temperatures. The larger probabilities of below normal
temperatures were not extended east to include the Alaska Panhandle due to
positive sea surface temperature anomalies offshore. Precipitation tools
depict
weak signals across Alaska, but the favored dryness across southern Mainlan=
d
Alaska is consistent with the temperature outlook.





----------The initial discussion released on Nov 18 follows----------





The December 2021 temperature and precipitation outlooks are based on the
predicted evolving pattern from Week-2, Weeks 3-4 model consensus, dynamica=
l
model output for December, La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites, and decadal=
 trends.
Below-average sea surface temperatures continue across the central and east=
ern
equatorial Pacific, while suppressed convection was observed near and west =
of
the Date Line this past month. The oceanic and atmospheric observations
reflect
La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions which are likely to persist through the=
 winter. The
Madden-Julian Oscillation is forecast to remain weak during the next two we=
eks
and is unlikely to influence the mid-latitude circulation at this time.



The highest forecast confidence in the December temperature outlook exists
across the Southwest and southern Great Plains where above temperatures are
most likely, based on good agreement among inputs to the North American
Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) along with support from La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
a composites and
decadal trends. Probabilities for above normal temperatures decrease farthe=
r
to
the north across the Great Basin and to the east along the Gulf Coast due t=
o
weaker signals among dynamical models. During late November, a large positi=
ve
500-hPa height anomaly center is likely to become centered over Greenland a=
nd
the northern Atlantic as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) becomes
negative.
The ECMWF ensemble mean depicts this anomalous ridging persisting into the
beginning of December and a majority of GFS ensemble members feature a
continuation of a negative NAO heading into December.  The week 3-4 model
consensus for the 500-hPa height pattern, using the GEFS, CFS, ECMWF,
Canadian,
and JMA models initialized on Nov 15, depicts this negative phase of the NA=
O
ending sometime during early December. Due to uncertainty on when the
anomalous
ridging downstream over the north Atlantic weakens and the associated negat=
ive
NAO ends, a large area of equal chances (EC) of below, near, or above norma=
l
temperatures is necessary for the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, Northeast, and
Mid-Atlantic. Also, inputs to the NMME vary largely for these areas. The EC
forecast for the northern Great Plains, northern Rockies, and Pacific
Northwest
is related to the lack of a signal in the calibrated NMME and conflicting
signals between model output and wintertime La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa compos=
ites.



Dynamical models and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites favor below (above=
) normal
precipitation across the southern tier of the CONUS (Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies). The slightly elevated probabilities for above normal
precipitation forecast for the Great Lakes is consistent with La Ni=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDa
composites but also given the above normal Great Lakes temperatures, any co=
ld
air advection would likely lead to enhanced lake-effect precipitation.
Although
there is some support among dynamical models for a larger area of elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation across the north-central CONUS,
large uncertainty at this time lead results in an EC forecast. The northern
Great Plains and upper Mississippi Valley will be reevaluated for the updat=
ed
monthly outlook (to be issued on Nov 30) when storm track predictability
improves. Due to anomalous ridging predicted by the ECMWF and Canadian
ensemble
means heading into the beginning of December, the favored area of wetness f=
or
the Pacific Northwest is slightly reduced in coverage compared to what La
Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
composites would typically support. This region, along with northern
California, will be reassessed on Nov 30 when the longwave pattern over the
northeast Pacific and western North America is better known.



Negative sea surface temperature anomalies and the calibrated NMME support
increased probabilities of below normal temperatures across southern Mainla=
nd
Alaska and the Aleutians. The favored area of dryness forecast for
south-central Alaska is consistent with the predicted colder-than-normal
temperatures. Elsewhere, across Alaska, precipitation tools feature little =
to
no signal.

...Widespread record breaking temperatures likely from Northwest
into Great Plains through Thursday; Elevated Fire Weather Risk for
Southern California...

...Atmospheric river to maintain moderate to heavy rainfall over
portions of the Pacific Northwest through Wednesday morning;
elevated flood and debris flow risk...

...Light rain and snow showers over portions of the Great Lakes
and Northeast through midweek...

High pressure dominance in the West will contribute to record
breaking mild weather to begin December. High temperatures 30-40
degrees above average will build across the West into the Northern
Plains Wednesday before spreading into the Southern Plains
Thursday. Ultimately, temperatures this warm translate to
Spring-like highs in the 60's and mid-low 70's. Hazardous gusty
winds associated with the rapid warm-up are possible through
Wednesday along the lee of the Rockies in West-Central Montana,
where High Wind Warnings and Watches are in effect. Moreover, the
abnormally warm weather may exasperate fire weather conditions in
Southern California, where the Storm Prediction Center highlights
an Elevated Risk of fire weather today and tomorrow as dry
offshore flow takes hold. Looking ahead to the beginning of the
weekend, the record warmth is forecast to moderate somewhat as it
spreads toward the Southeast, although a few high temperature
records may be threatened on Thursday in the South.

Meanwhile, the very wet weather continues across the Pacific
Northwest. An ongoing Atmospheric River event is forecast to begin
winding down this evening into tomorrow, although an additional 3
to 5 inches of rainfall are possible in higher elevation areas
atop inundated soils. The additional heavy rain atop increasingly
hydrophobic terrain will support an elevated floods and debris
flow risk across Northwest Washington, where Flood Watches are in
effect through Thursday morning. In contrast with the Northwest,
the rest of the Lower 48 is forecast to remain relatively quiet
precipitation-wise through this week. A pair of low pressure
systems traversing southern Canada will produce light to isolated
moderate snow downwind of the Great Lakes and interior Northeast
over the next couple of days. General totals are forecast to
remain below a couple inches, but areas downwind of Lake Ontario
may see upwards of 3-5 inches through Wednesday morning where a
small Winter Weather Advisory remains. Some rain may get mixed in
as the warm front associated with the second, more organized
system moves into the Great Lakes on Wednesday night. Shower
activity may develop as far south as the Ohio Valley and Central
Appalachians as the quasi-stationary front sags into the area on
Wednesday morning.

300 PM EST Tue November 30 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 06 - 10 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in fairly good agreem=
ent in depicting an
amplified
500-hPa flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean 500-hPa mid-le=
vel
height field, strong ridging near the southwestern Aleutians is forecast,
leading to anticipated troughing downstream across Alaska. Above normal hei=
ght
are likely farther to the south across much of the western CONUS and parts =
of
the central CONUS. Mean troughing is predicted along the Northeast to Great
Lakes region with below normal 500-hPa heights over the northeastern CONUS.

Troughing forecast over much of Alaska leads to increased chances of below
normal temperatures across most of the state. Ridging over the western CONU=
S
during the period favors above normal temperatures from the West Coast,
eastward across most of the central CONUS, and to much of the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic. Conversely, troughing over the northeastern CONUS leads to
increased chances of near to below normal temperatures over parts of the Gr=
eat
Lakes region and Northeast.

The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of above-normal
precipitation over much of the northwestern CONUS and most of the Northern
Plains. Positive height anomalies are expected across much of the western a=
nd
central CONUS during the period, favoring below normal precipitation over
parts
of the Central and Southern Plains. Near to above normal precipitation is
favored over most of the Midwest, Northeast and parts of the Tennessee Vall=
ey
due to the forecast troughing over the region. Above normal precipitation i=
s
also favored for central and southern Alaska related to mean surface low
pressures predicted over the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Offshore flow t=
o
the northwest of this low leads to increased chances of below normal
precipitation across northern Mainland Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=

ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 15% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean cente=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
a good agreement on a predicted amplified 500-hPa flow pattern early in the
period, offset by increased uncertainty later in the period associated.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 08 - 14 2021

In the week-2 period, fair agreement is seen among the model solutions. Mod=
els
are in agreement on a slight de-amplification of the overall pattern across
much of the CONUS for the period. Troughing over Alaska is likely to persis=
t
into week-2 but with high uncertainty as to the evolution of this feature
later
in the period.

Increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast in week-2 for
Alaska underneath predicted below normal 500-hPa heights. Forecast near to
above normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased chances of above normal
temperatures across much of the CONUS, with the highest probabilities over
parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast. This is also consisten=
t
with the consolidation forecast tool.

Above normal precipitation is favored across the northwestern CONUS, eastwa=
rd
to parts of the Northern Rockies and Great Basin, due to enhanced Pacific f=
low
predicted across much of the Northwest Coast. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored over parts of the Great Plains due to the forecast
above normal heights. Above normal precipitation is slightly favored over
parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, Midwest and Northeast due to
forecast frontal passages. Probabilities of above normal precipitation are
slightly elevated for most of central and southern Mainland Alaska, and the
Alaska Panhandle, underneath mean cyclonic mid-level flow.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=

 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=

...Overview...

During the Friday-Tuesday period expect an eastern Pacific mean
ridge aloft to support varying degrees of cyclonic flow across
southern Canada and portions of the lower 48, with the overall
mean trough axis tending to extend from central Canada into the
Great Lakes/Northeast.  Upper troughing should be fairly shallow
late this week and then become somewhat more amplified after
Saturday.  This pattern will carry along a series of surface waves
and frontal systems, most of which should produce light to
moderate precipitation.  A front reaching the West early next week
may support a period of heavier activity from the Pacific
Northwest into the Rockies.  Meanwhile one or more pieces of
energy over the eastern Pacific/far southwest corner of the U.S.
may consolidate into an upper low that settles near Baja
California.  This feature should not produce much significant
weather during the period.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The most prominent uncertainties over the lower 48 seem to arise
from question marks with a couple streams of flow within a general
trough to the south of Alaska.  A leading shortwave reaches the
Pacific Northwest by early Saturday and there are already
amplitude differences at that time with more significant spread
for the corresponding surface pattern off the Pacific Northwest
coast.  A preferred intermediate solution would have a moderate
wave not far from the 00Z ECMWF mean position but somewhat weaker
than it or the 00Z ECMWF/12Z CMC.  The latest GFS/UKMET are quite
weak and suppressed while the 12Z ECMWF is weaker/south versus the
prior run.

Early differences with this shortwave and then differences in how
streams interact within the trough south of Alaska lead to rapidly
increasing spread for low pressure tracking from the Plains into
eastern Canada/Northeast U.S. by Sunday-Monday.  Latest GFS/GEFS
runs and the 12Z UKMET dig the incoming shortwave energy rather
strongly into the east-central U.S., leading to strong low
pressure over the Great Lakes/southeastern Canada by early Monday.
 In contrast the 00Z ECMWF and latest CMC runs are more
progressive and less amplified, leading to weaker and farther
east/southeast low pressure.  Highlighting the uncertainty,
individual ensemble members are very diverse and GFS/ECMWF runs
have occasionally switched places in recent days.  For example a
number of recent ECMWF runs had some similarity to the GFS but the
00Z ECMWF happened to be similar to yesterday's 00Z GFS that was
on the weaker/suppressed side versus most GFS runs.  The 12Z ECMWF
trended much stronger and a little northwestward with intermediate
timing.  Prefer to maintain a compromise approach that is fairly
close to continuity.

Additional energy should drop into the western half of the country
by next Tuesday but with considerable differences for specifics.
The new 12Z GFS is on the deep side of guidance by early Tuesday.
Also note that 06Z/12Z GFS runs are on the eastern side of the
full guidance spread for the upper low near Baja California by
Sunday.

A blend of the 00Z/06Z GFS runs and the past two ECMWF runs
through the 00Z cycle, along with modest 00Z CMC/UKMET input,
provided a good representation of forecast preferences during the
first half of the period.  The forecast transitioned to a mix of
the aforementioned GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs and 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means
thereafter.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A wavy front progressing from the West/Plains through the East
along with another wavy front farther north will bring relatively
light precipitation to the Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast
late this week into the weekend.  Moisture increasing ahead of the
cold front extending into the southern Plains should produce
scattered showers and a few thunderstorms from the Deep South to
the Ohio Valley over the weekend, but amounts are not likely to be
excessive.  A shortwave and frontal system may brush the extreme
northern Pacific Northwest/Rockies with some precipitation during
the weekend.  This system could then produce a band of
precipitation from the northern Plains through the Northeast into
early next week.  However confidence is low for exact
timing/track/depth of the surface low, so it will take additional
time to resolve precipitation type and amounts across this broad
area.  A shortwave and cold front reaching the Pacific Northwest
by early next week should bring an episode of moderate to locally
heavy rain and mountain snows to western Washington and Oregon.
Expect some of this moisture to reach farther inland through the
West, with best potential for heavy snow over the northern
Rockies--including the higher elevations of northern Idaho,
western Montana, and western Wyoming.

Temperatures will be above normal for early December across most
of the nation through early next week.  The greatest positive
anomalies should be over the central and southern Plains on Friday
with highs forecast to be 15-25F above average.  Another episode
of well above normal temperatures is likely for parts of the
Plains next Monday-Tuesday ahead of the next cold front with a
broad area of highs and morning lows at least 10-20F above normal.
 A few locations may approach daily record highs with these mild
temperatures.  The Northeast U.S. will be an exception to the
generally warm theme as mean troughing aloft will keep
temperatures fairly cold with highs running up to 10 degrees below
normal through the weekend.  However, no major arctic airmass
intrusions are expected during this forecast period.

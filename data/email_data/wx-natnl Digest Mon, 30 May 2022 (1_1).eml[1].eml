...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NEW MEXICO INTO THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

No changes to the previous forecast. See the previous discussion for
more detail.

..Wendt.. 05/29/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Sun May 29 2022/

...Synopsis...
Southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to increase ahead of a
strengthening mid-level trough diving across the Southwest and
Great Basin. At the surface, a cold front will stall across the
southern Great Basin, while a lee low deepens in response to lift
from the approaching trough. Widespread strong surface winds are
expected ahead of the trough from the southern Great Basin to the
High Plains. The strong winds will overlap with a warm and very dry
airmass supporting widespread critical fire weather concerns within
dry fuels.

...Southwest and southern Great Basin...
Strong flow aloft associated with the fast moving upper trough/jet
streak is forecast to overspread much of NM and the southern Four
Corners early today. At the same time, a lee low across southeastern
CO should intensify, bolstering low-level southwesterly winds to
25-35 mph. In addition to the strong boundary-layer flow, area
soundings show very warm temperatures and low to very low relative
humidity. The favorable overlap of strong surface winds, low
humidity and dry fuels will support widespread critical fire weather
concerns. A few hours of localized extremely critical conditions
also appear possible mainly across portions of eastern and central
NM where the greatest potential for 30+ mph winds and sub-10%
humidity may briefly coexist. Confidence in prolonged extremely
critical conditions remains low owing to limited spatial and
temporal coverage and slightly moderated fuels due to recent
precipitation.

Across the southern Great Basin, model guidance shows a few hours of
stronger surface winds of 15-20 mph overlapping with humidity of
10-15% south of the stalled cold front. While coverage and duration
of the stronger winds and lower surface humidity is expected to be
limited, a few hours of elevated to near critical fire weather
conditions will likely develop within areas of dry fuels.

...Southern High Plains...
As the lee low begins to move eastward into the central Plains, a
trailing dryline and associated surface trough should aid in the
strengthening southwesterly low-level winds across much of the
southern High Plains. While widespread critical meteorological
conditions are expected, recent precipitation has moderated some
fuels. This will limit the potential for more vigorous fire weather
activity, particularly across portions of the southern and eastern
TX Panhandle. A Critical Area will be maintained where the best
overlap in 20-25 mph surface winds, surface RH below 15% and the
most supportive fuels exists.

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NEW MEXICO INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Some modification was made to the Critical area. Strong surface
winds are expected farther east into southwestern Kansas given the
presence of a strong mid-level jet. Since winds may approach 30 mph,
Critical conditions are expected despite some fuel moderation by
recent rainfall. Elsewhere, only minor adjustments have been made.
See the previous discussion for further detail.

..Wendt.. 05/29/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Sun May 29 2022/

...Synopsis...
A prominent shortwave trough embedded within the strong
southwesterly flow will move from the Great Basin onto the Plains
early Monday. Flow aloft will weaken through the day as the
shortwave lifts to the north and east. As the trough moves away, a
cold front will slide south into portions of the Four Corners and
NM. The lingering flow aloft should support gusty surface winds
within a dry airmass across much of the southern/central High Plains
Monday.

...New Mexico into the southern/central High Plains...
Strong mid-level flow will remain in place across much of the
Southwest and High Plains through early Monday as the main shortwave
is forecast to eject to the northeast. Aided by momentum transfer
and mixing from the stronger flow aloft and a weak lee low/surface
pressure trough to the east, gusty downslope winds of 20-25 mph will
likely develop by midday, especially in the lee of the higher
terrain. Warm temperatures and the downslope drying will favor low
RH below 15%. Widespread critical fire weather conditions appear
likely across much of the western High Plains. Fire weather concerns
should quickly abate later in the evening as a cold front approaches
from the northwest and the stronger flow aloft begins to slacken.
While some elevated conditions may linger at higher altitudes into
the evening, overall fire weather concerns should quickly diminish
after the frontal passage.

...Northern Sacramento Valley Foothills...
As the aforementioned western US trough shifts to the east,
northerly flow is forecast to move over the Sacramento Valley and
the surrounding foothills. Downvalley winds should increase along
with warm and dry surface conditions. Fuels across the foothills are
receptive to fire spread, suggesting elevated fire weather concerns
are possible.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 29 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
20090512 - 19940612 - 19900605 - 19570612 - 20070519


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 7 day periods centered on the following dates:

...Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall/convection forecast to focus
across the south-central Plains near a front late
Tuesday-Thursday...
...Late week heavy rain threat increasing over southern Florida
ahead of a tropical system...

...Overview...

A cold front extending from a deep upper low over south-central
Canada is forecast to become nearly stationary across the
south-central Plains where multiple rounds of convection with
heavy rainfall are forecast to impact the area from late Tuesday
to Thursday.  Additional rounds of convection/heavy rain are
possible over the central Plains by the weekend.  The front could
trigger areas of heavy rain over interior New England and the
Mid-Atlantic Wednesday and Thursday.  Meanwhile, tropical moisture
can be expected to increase across southern Florida through the
medium-range period as a subtropical jet is forecast to interact
with moisture coming up from tropical cyclone Agatha currently
located in the eastern Pacific.  Elsewhere, upper-level ridging is
forecast to build across the interior West while an East Pacific
upper low produces troughing and unsettled weather into the
Northwest.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance this morning are in reasonably good agreement with
one another regarding the synoptic evolution across the U.S.
through the medium-range period.  The 00Z ECMWF was notably slower
than the rest of the guidance regarding the southward progression
of the cold front moving through the central Plains on Wednesday
into Thursday, resulting in the associated heavy rainfall axis
being noticeably farther to the north.  On the other hand, the 00Z
EC mean was farther south with the frontal placement.  Thus the
slow ECMWF solution is not preferred.  Across the Northeast,
models continue to trend toward a flatter flow regime as a frontal
wave forms just off the northern Mid-Atlantic coast and moves out
to sea.  Along the West Coast, models are in good agreement with
the timing of  the arrival of the next round of moisture late this
week.  The EC solutions favor a reinforcing surge of moisture into
northern California and northward during the weekend, a scenario
not as prominently indicated in the GFS, GEFS, as well as the CMC
solutions.  By next weekend, ensemble means are in general
agreement for a warm front to lift northward into the central
Plains as cooler air edges southward into the northern Plains.

Farther south, models are more consistent with bringing tropical
moisture northeastward into southern Florida from the eastern
Pacific late week into the weekend with the approach of a tropical
system.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

A surface low well into central Canada by Wednesday will send its
trailing cold front across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley
Wednesday and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Thursday-Friday. Rain
and thunderstorms can be expected along this front, after some
initial showers in parts of the Northeast Wednesday near a
backdoor front. However, the back end of the main front is
forecast to move more slowly through central and southern parts of
the Plains and Mississippi Valley, and will provide a focus for
rain and thunderstorms for multiple days around Tuesday-Thursday.
Flash flooding is possible especially where storms repeat over the
same area, which at this point appears most likely to occur around
Kansas, Oklahoma, and possibly Missouri. Uncertainty remains with
the axis of the convection each day/night, but a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall in WPC's experimental day 4 outlook seemed
warranted given moisture and instability will be abundant along
with a focus for lift with the front in place, and considering
antecedent conditions could be quite wet with Tuesday's rain.

There is increasing forecast agreement for tropical cyclone Agatha
over the eastern Pacific to turn northeastward and move across
Mexico over the next few days. Scattered showers and thunderstorms
are expected to become more frequent and widespread across
southern Florida later next week although the specifics are not
clear at this time. Factors that influence the timing and amounts
of rainfall will include (a) the interaction of a subtropical jet
with tropical moisture coming from Agatha, and the cyclone's
subsequent track and intensity after crossing Central America, (b)
the proximity of an upper low forecast to gradually gain tropical
characteristics near and northeast of the Bahamas midweek, and (c)
possible interaction with a tropical wave moving into the western
Caribbean Sea.

Additionally, rain chances are expected to increase in the
Northwest during the latter half of the week given the trough axis
near the West Coast and a couple of frontal systems. The Southwest
should remain dry and hot though. Rounds of rain are possible in
the central U.S. next weekend, but with considerable uncertainty
in the details at this point.

Upper ridging ahead of the central U.S./Canada trough/low will
promote above average temperatures by 10-20F over the Midwest/Ohio
Valley and parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Wednesday, with the
exception of parts of New England due to the backdoor front.
Meanwhile upper troughing will bring continued cool temperatures
across the Rockies and central High Plains through midweek with
highs forecast to be 10-20F or below normal. The flattening
pattern aloft will push the cold front eastward, leading to a
moderating trend for below normal temperatures over the central
U.S., with mostly single-digit negative anomalies by
Thursday-Friday, though around 10F below normal in rain-cooled
Kansas and Oklahoma. The East should see shrinking coverage of
warm temperatures on Thursday and especially Friday into the
weekend. The West Coast and into the Great Basin can expect warmer
than normal temperatures by around 5-15F Wednesday and beyond,
followed by a modest cooling trend on Friday-Sunday along the
immediate West Coast with the arrival of a Pacific front.

warranted given moisture and instability will be abundant along
with a focus for lift with the front in place, and considering
antecedent conditions could be quite wet with Tuesday's rain.

There is increasing forecast agreement for tropical cyclone Agatha
over the eastern Pacific to turn northeastward and move across
Mexico over the next few days. Scattered showers and thunderstorms
are expected to become more frequent and widespread across
southern Florida later next week although the specifics are not
clear at this time. Factors that influence the timing and amounts
of rainfall will include (a) the interaction of a subtropical jet
with tropical moisture coming from Agatha, and the cyclone's
subsequent track and intensity after crossing Central America, (b)
the proximity of an upper low forecast to gradually gain tropical
characteristics near and northeast of the Bahamas midweek, and (c)
possible interaction with a tropical wave moving into the western
Caribbean Sea.

Additionally, rain chances are expected to increase in the
Northwest during the latter half of the week given the trough axis
near the West Coast and a couple of frontal systems. The Southwest
should remain dry and hot though. Rounds of rain are possible in
the central U.S. next weekend, but with considerable uncertainty
in the details at this point.

Upper ridging ahead of the central U.S./Canada trough/low will
promote above average temperatures by 10-20F over the Midwest/Ohio
Valley and parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Wednesday, with the
exception of parts of New England due to the backdoor front.
Meanwhile upper troughing will bring continued cool temperatures
across the Rockies and central High Plains through midweek with
highs forecast to be 10-20F or below normal. The flattening
pattern aloft will push the cold front eastward, leading to a
moderating trend for below normal temperatures over the central
U.S., with mostly single-digit negative anomalies by
Thursday-Friday, though around 10F below normal in rain-cooled
Kansas and Oklahoma. The East should see shrinking coverage of
warm temperatures on Thursday and especially Friday into the
weekend. The West Coast and into the Great Basin can expect warmer
than normal temperatures by around 5-15F Wednesday and beyond,
followed by a modest cooling trend on Friday-Sunday along the
immediate West Coast with the arrival of a Pacific front.

...Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall/convection forecast to focus
across the south-central Plains near a front late
Tuesday-Thursday...
...Late week heavy rain threat increasing over southern Florida
ahead of a tropical system...

...Overview...

A cold front extending from a deep upper low over south-central
Canada is forecast to become nearly stationary across the
south-central Plains where multiple rounds of convection with
heavy rainfall are forecast to impact the area from late Tuesday
to Thursday.  Additional rounds of convection/heavy rain are
possible over the central Plains by the weekend.  The front could
trigger areas of heavy rain over interior New England and the
Mid-Atlantic Wednesday and Thursday.  Meanwhile, tropical moisture
can be expected to increase across southern Florida through the
medium-range period as a subtropical jet is forecast to interact
with moisture coming up from tropical cyclone Agatha currently
located in the eastern Pacific.  Elsewhere, upper-level ridging is
forecast to build across the interior West while an East Pacific
upper low produces troughing and unsettled weather into the
Northwest.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance this morning are in reasonably good agreement with
one another regarding the synoptic evolution across the U.S.
through the medium-range period.  The 00Z ECMWF was notably slower
than the rest of the guidance regarding the southward progression
of the cold front moving through the central Plains on Wednesday
into Thursday, resulting in the associated heavy rainfall axis
being noticeably farther to the north.  On the other hand, the 00Z
EC mean was farther south with the frontal placement.  Thus the
slow ECMWF solution is not preferred.  Across the Northeast,
models continue to trend toward a flatter flow regime as a frontal
wave forms just off the northern Mid-Atlantic coast and moves out
to sea.  Along the West Coast, models are in good agreement with
the timing of  the arrival of the next round of moisture late this
week.  The EC solutions favor a reinforcing surge of moisture into
northern California and northward during the weekend, a scenario
not as prominently indicated in the GFS, GEFS, as well as the CMC
solutions.  By next weekend, ensemble means are in general
agreement for a warm front to lift northward into the central
Plains as cooler air edges southward into the northern Plains.

Farther south, models continue to show more consistency with
bringing tropical moisture northeastward into southern Florida
from the eastern Pacific late week into the weekend with the
approach of a tropical system.  The recent CMC solutions were the
fastest among the guidance, taking the center of this system
across the Florida Peninsula over the weekend.

The WPC medium range forecast was based on a multi-model and
ensemble blend of 40% from the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 40% from the 00Z
ECMWF/EC mean, and 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, transitioning to
mostly the ensemble means by Day 7, discounting the 00Z CMC by Day
5.  The results are comparable to previous WPC forecasts.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

A surface low well into central Canada by Wednesday will send its
trailing cold front across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley
Wednesday and then across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
Thursday-Friday.  Rain and thunderstorms can be expected along
this front where locally heavy rain is possible over interior New
England and the Mid-Atlantic.  However, the trailing portion of
the main front is forecast to move much more slowly through
central and southern parts of the Plains, and will provide a focus
for rain and thunderstorms for multiple days around
Tuesday-Thursday.  Flash flooding is possible especially where
storms repeat over the same area, which at this point appears most
likely to occur around southern Kansas to Oklahoma.  Uncertainty
remains with the axis of the convection each day/night, but a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall in WPC's experimental day 4
outlook seemed warranted given moisture and instability will be
abundant along with a focus for lift with the front in place, and
considering antecedent conditions could be quite wet with
Tuesday's rain.  Some additional rounds of heavy rain is possible
on Thursday slightly farther south across Oklahoma.  By the
weekend, the front is forecast to lift northward as a warm front
while cooler air from Canada is forecast to edge southward into
the northern Plains.  This scenario will help spark additional
rounds of enhanced rainfall over the central Plains during the
weekend.

There is increasing forecast agreement for tropical cyclone Agatha
over the eastern Pacific to move northeastward across Mexico over
the next few days.  Scattered showers and thunderstorms are
expected to become more frequent and widespread across southern
Florida later next week.  Factors that influence the timing and
amounts of rainfall will include (a) the interaction of a
subtropical jet with tropical moisture coming from Agatha, and the
cyclone's subsequent track and intensity after crossing Central
America, (b) the proximity of an upper low forecast to gradually
gain some tropical characteristics near and northeast of the
Bahamas midweek, and (c) possible interaction with a tropical wave
moving into the western Caribbean Sea.

Additionally, rain chances are expected to increase in the
Northwest during the latter half of the week given the trough axis
near the West Coast and a couple of frontal systems. The Southwest
should remain dry and hot though. Rounds of rain are possible in
the central U.S. next weekend, but with considerable uncertainty
in the details at this point.

Upper ridging ahead of the central U.S./Canada trough/low will
promote above average temperatures by 10-20F over the Midwest/Ohio
Valley and parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Wednesday, with the
exception of parts of New England due to the backdoor front.
Meanwhile upper troughing will bring continued cool temperatures
across the Rockies and central High Plains through midweek with
highs forecast to be 10-20F or below normal. The flattening
pattern aloft will push the cold front eastward, leading to a
moderating trend for below normal temperatures over the central
U.S., with mostly single-digit negative anomalies by
Thursday-Friday, though around 10F below normal in rain-cooled
Kansas and Oklahoma. The East should see shrinking coverage of
warm temperatures on Thursday and especially Friday into the

than normal temperatures by around 5-15F Wednesday and beyond,
followed by a modest cooling trend on Friday-Sunday along the

...There is an Enhance to Moderate Risk of severe storms over
parts of the Plains and Upper Midwest Sunday evening through
Tuesday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Northern/Central Plains and Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley...

...There is a threat of heavy snowfall for the highest elevations
of the Northern Rockies...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southwest/Southern Rockies and Southern High Plains...

A front extending from Upper Mississippi Valley roughly
southwestward to the Southwest/Southern California will slowly
move eastward to the Great Lakes to the Southern Plains by
Tuesday. The boundary will destabilize the atmosphere as moisture
pools along the front, producing showers and thunderstorms over
the Plains and Upper Midwest Sunday evening through Tuesday
morning. Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Northern/Central Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley through Monday morning. The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. In addition,
there will be an increased threat of severe wind gusts over 65
knots and two-inch diameter hail. There is also a Marginal Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Upper Midwest. The associated
heavy rain will create localized areas of flash flooding,
affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.

The severe thunderstorm threat increases on Monday. Therefore, the
SPC has issued a Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts
of the Upper Mississippi Valley from Monday into Tuesday morning.
The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes. In addition, there will be an increased threat of EF2
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD EF5 tornadoes, severe wind gusts over 65 knots or greate=
r, and
two-inch diameter hail. Furthermore, there will be an increased
threat of excessive rainfall over the Upper Midwest and Middle
Mississippi Valley. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Northern/Central Plains and
Upper Mississippi Valley and a second area over parts of the
Middle Mississippi Valley/Central Plains from Monday through
Tuesday morning. The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams the most vulnerable.

As the front moves eastward, the threat of severe thunderstorms,
likewise, moves eastward. Therefore, on Tuesday, the SPC issued an
Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Middle
Mississippi Valley and Central Plains. The hazards associated with
these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. The threat of excessive
rainfall decreased to a Marginal Risk over parts of the Western
Ohio/Middle Mississippi Valleys and the Central/Southern Plains.
The associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain.

Meanwhile, overnight Sunday, the upper-level trough deepens over
the Northwest, developing rain and higher elevation snow over
parts of the Pacific Northwest to the Northern/Central Rockies. As
a result, heavy wet snow will develop over the higher elevations
of the Northern Intermountain Region and the Northern Rockies from
Sunday evening into Tuesday. However, the rain over parts of the
Pacific Northwest will start to end late Monday afternoon and end
by Tuesday morning.

Next, there is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southwest/Southern Rockies and Southern High Plains from Sunday
evening into Tuesday morning. The threat is due to strong gusty
winds, dry fuels, and low humidity.

...Late week heavy rain threat increasing over southern Florida
ahead of a tropical system...

...Overview...

The medium range period will see a fairly stagnant mid-upper
pattern as a closed low spins across south-central Canada, sending
periods of low amplitude troughing across the central and eastern
U.S. along with surface fronts that could provide foci for
convection. Meanwhile, tropical moisture is expected to increase
through the period across southern Florida streaming northward
from tropical cyclone Agatha currently located in the eastern
Pacific. Energy from Agatha may combine with additional Caribbean
energy in a large and complex area of low pressure near the
Yucatan to form a tropical system in the northwestern Caribbean or
Gulf of Mexico late week, but with high levels of uncertainty at
this time. Elsewhere, upper-level ridging is forecast to build
across the interior West while a northeastern Pacific upper low
produces troughing and unsettled weather into the Northwest.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent model guidance is in reasonably good agreement for the
overall synoptic pattern at least in the northern stream late week
into early next week. The centroid of the central Canada upper low
shows fairly good consensus between the 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF
and UKMET, while the 12Z CMC sunk the low a bit farther south. The
00Z CMC has come in with somewhat better alignment. The details of
troughing stemming from the low and thus placement of the surface
fronts and axes for rain/convection are more uncertain. A
multi-model blend of mainly the deterministic guidance, though
with less influence from the CMC and increasing influence from the
GEFS/EC ensemble means later in the period, seems the best way to
handle the smaller-scale differences for now. This also worked
well for the upper low spinning offshore British Columbia and its
troughing influence into the West Coast. GFS runs have been more
aggressive than the ECMWF/CMC at a shortwave ejecting into the
northern Rockies by next Monday, which may be too fast.

More notable differences continue to be seen farther south with
tropical moisture and energy that could affect Florida in
particular. Models continue to show the potential for energy in
the Bay of Campeche/Yucatan/western Caribbean to consolidate into
a forming tropical system with a general track northeastward.
However, there are ample differences in deterministic models and
ensemble members with particularly the timing of this ejection
northeastward (on the order of days), but also with its strength
and track. GFS and CMC runs have both tended to be on the fast
side of the envelope, and with the GFS on the southern side along
the Florida Straits and the CMC more north crossing Florida and
making its way into the western Atlantic. The ECMWF on the other
hand has been on the slower side and more favored, including the
12Z run, though notably its new 00Z run has sped up considerably
with its low track, though not to the speed of the GFS/CMC runs.
The WPC forecast has continued to take a conservative (in
strength) and slower approach with the low at this point and will
continue to coordinate with the National Hurricane Center for
updates.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

A cold front is forecast to press across the East late this week,
with rain and thunderstorms expected along it. While there is some
uncertainty with the placement of heaviest rainfall, it appears
that areas of the eastern Mid-Atlantic could see locally heavy
rainfall and an isolated flash flood threat Thursday. However, the
trailing portion of the front is forecast to move much more slowly
through southern parts of the Plains and cause multiple days of
convection from the short range period lasting into Thursday and
possibly Friday. Flash flooding is possible especially where
storms repeat over the same area, and with likely wet soils by the
time the medium range period begins Thursday, this will lessen the
amount of rain needed to get flash flooding. The best chance for
flash flooding issues looks to be across Oklahoma and northern
parts of Texas. By the weekend, the front is forecast to lift
northward as a warm front while cooler air from Canada is forecast
to edge southward into the northern Plains. These fronts will
continue to spark additional rounds of enhanced rainfall across
the central U.S. this weekend, but with low confidence in the
details.

There is increasing forecast agreement for tropical cyclone Agatha
over the eastern Pacific to move northeastward across Mexico over
the next couple of days. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are
expected to become more frequent and widespread across southern
Florida later this week, first with the moisture from Agatha
streaming northeast and then with the potential for energy
consolidating into a possible tropical system tracking
northeastward. The timing and amounts of rainfall will be
dependent on the interaction of a subtropical jet with tropical
moisture coming from Agatha, then any remaining energy stemming
from Agatha after crossing Mexico and the possibility it could
combine with tropical wave energy over the western Caribbean to
produce a tropical cyclone.

Additionally, rain chances are expected to increase in the
Northwest during the latter half of the week given the trough axis
near the West Coast and a couple of frontal systems. The Southwest
should remain dry and hot though.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the more amplified
short range period should produce lesser temperature anomalies
late this week into early next week. Cooler than average spots
will be across the central/southern Plains Thursday into Friday
with rain cooled air, but should switch to above normal in Texas
by about 10F by early next week. Periodic troughing in the
northern tier should lead to slightly below average temperatures
by 5-10F there. The western U.S. could be warmer than normal by
5-10F late in the workweek but cooler temperatures are forecast by
the weekend under the troughing influence. Warm temperatures
across the Southeast Thursday will moderate closer to normal late
week behind a cold frontal passage.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NEW MEXICO AND THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS....

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a fast-moving upper trough will mature as it
ejects quickly northeastward across the Plains and upper Midwest. A
belt of stronger flow will move with the trough, overspreading much
of the Southwest, Southern Rockies and High Plains Monday. At the
surface, a lee low will rapidly deepen, pulling a cold front south
toward the Four Corners. The overlap of strong winds and low
humidity will support elevated and critical fire weather concerns
across New Mexico and the High Plains.

...New Mexico and the central and southern High Plains...
As the mid-level trough quickly ejects to the north and east, 60-80
kt mid-level flow will bolster low-level southwesterly flow across
much of NM onto the High Plains. Widespread 20-30 mph surface winds
should extended northeastward as far as western KS in the wake of
the fast moving lee low and trailing dryline. Downslope drying of
the warm continental airmass should result in widespread sub 15%
humidity, with a few pockets below 10% also possible. While fuels
have been somewhat moderated by recent precipitation farther to the
east, higher-end critical meteorological conditions suggest high
confidence in critical fire weather concerns through this evening.

...Northern California...
As the upper-level trough departs to the east, strong mid-level flow
will turn more northerly across much of the West Coast. Low-level
downvalley winds are forecast to increase in response to the flow
aloft across the northern Sacramento Valley and surrounding
foothills. Downslope drying and relatively warm conditions should
support RH below 20%, along with surface winds of 15-20 mph. The dry
nature of area fuels suggests elevated fire weather conditions are
likely.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0119 AM CDT Mon May 30 2022

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
In the wake of the departing mid-level trough, stronger flow aloft
should gradually weaken through the day, Tuesday, across the
southern Rockies and High Plains. At the same time, a surface cold
front will begin to move south, reaching southern CO and northern NM
by evening. Gusty winds will remain possible along and south of the
front supporting a few hours of elevated fire weather potential
Tuesday afternoon.

...Southern Rockies...
Residual flow aloft along the base of the departing trough should
linger over portions of the southern Rockies Tuesday. Beneath the
enhanced mid-level flow, a few hours of stronger surface winds along
and south of a slow moving surface cold front are possible. Dry
surface conditions will remain in place prior to the cold frontal
passage, with mean boundary-layer RH likely below 15%. Gusty surface
winds to 15-20 mph within the dry fuels may support a few hours of
elevated fire weather concerns. The fire weather threat will quickly
diminish with the passage of the cold front in the evening as
surface winds weaken and RH recovers.

...An outbreak of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes is likely on
this Memorial Day across parts of northeast South Dakota,
southeast North Dakota, and western and northern Minnesota...

...Severe weather concerns will shift from the northern Plains and
upper Mississippi Valley today down to the southern High Plains
and lower Missouri Valley on Tuesday...

...Colder temperatures and unsettled weather will continue across
parts of the Intermountain West with locally heavy snowfall today
for the northern Rockies...

...Critical fire weather concerns will remain in place today
across the Southern Rockies and Southern High Plains...

The big story for this Memorial Day holiday will the likelihood of
a significant severe weather outbreak across parts of the northern
Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley as a strong upper trough
ejecting across the Intermountain West edges east out across the
Plains and allows for a very strong area of low pressure for this
time of the year to advance from western Kansas this morning
northward up across the Red River Valley tonight before moving
into southwest Ontario on Tuesday.

Widespread showers and thunderstorms are expected along and east
of the path of this low center, and there is the expectation of
seeing these thunderstorms turn severe given the strength of low
pressure and its interaction with very moist and unstable air
surging north ahead of a cold front. In fact, numerous severe
thunderstorms are expected that will likely produce large to giant
hail, damaging winds and tornadoes, including the potential for a
couple of intense and long-track tornadoes. The area with the
greatest risk of seeing these hazards will be across areas of
northeast South Dakota, southeast North Dakota and through western
and northern Minnesota where the Storm Prediction Center has
highlighted a Moderate Risk of severe weather for today and
tonight.

In addition to the severe weather, the showers and thunderstorms
will produce heavy rainfall and there will be concerns for areas
of flash flooding across the central and northern Plains and
especially the Red River Valley area where the Weather Prediction
Center has indicated a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall.
Locally a few inches of rain is expected across parts of central
and eastern North Dakota and possibly reaching into parts of
northwest Minnesota as this low center approaches and crosses the
region going through tonight. The threat for severe weather and
locally heavy rainfall will shift south on Tuesday and will
include areas of the southern Plains northeastward through the
lower Missouri Valley as a cold front makes progress advancing off
the east across the Plains and Midwest.

Meanwhile, a broad upper trough is forecast to remain in place
across much of the Intermountain West through Tuesday, and this
will maintain a large area of below normal temperatures and
unsettled weather. In fact, high temperatures today will be much
as 20 to 30 degrees below normal across areas of the northern
Great Basin and the northern Rockies. Widespread and locally heavy
shower activity is expected, and with the colder temperatures and
lowering snow levels, heavy snowfall will continue for the higher
terrain. Storm total snowfall amounts going through Tuesday of 1
to 3 feet are expected for parts of the Absoroka and Big Horn
mountains where the heaviest precipitation is expected. Gradually
warming temperatures and a drying trend are expected for these
areas by the middle of the week as the upper trough weakens and
the energy pulls away to the northeast.

Some of the cooler temperatures across the West over the next
couple of days will be spilling down through the southern High
Plains and the southern Rockies which will be welcome news as
there remains at least one more day of critical fire weather
concerns given hot and very dry conditions along with gusty winds.
As a cold front crosses the region, lowering temperatures will
help to reduce the fire danger heading toward the middle of the
week.

Elsewhere, aside from some scattered showers and thunderstorms
across the Florida Peninsula, and the Gulf Coast, generally dry
and tranquil weather will remain in place across the East for a
couple more days. However, the heat and humidity will be on the
increase as high pressure offshore of the East Coast drives
southerly flow up from the Gulf of Mexico. This will yield
widespread above normal temperatures with many areas seeing
temperatures ranging from the upper 80s to the mid 90s. The front
upstream across the Plains and Midwest that will be driving severe
weather concerns over the next couple of days will encroach on the
East by midweek, and this will eventually increase the threat of
showers and thunderstorms. While many areas of the East will be
briefly rather hot, cooler temperatures will be noted over New
England as a backdoor cold front slowly sinks south from southeast
Canada.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
355 AM EDT Fri Apr 02 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 02 2021 - 12Z Sun Apr 04 2021

...Widespread freezing temperatures and record-breaking cold are
expected from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the Northeast...

...Remarkably dry conditions are expected over the contiguous U.S.
for the next couple of days, with some Elevated Risks of fire
weather...

Over the eastern U.S., an upper-level trough and a surface high
pressure system coming in behind a cold front will lead to
unseasonably cold temperatures today and Saturday morning but
moderating closer to normal by Sunday. Temperatures are forecast
to be 10 to 25 degrees below normal for much of the eastern third
of the country, and many daily records for low minimum and maximum
temperatures could be set. Freeze/Hard Freeze Warnings and Watches
and Frost Advisories are widespread from eastern Oklahoma into the
Middle/Lower Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys into the
Southeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic, as these cold
temperatures in early April could cause damage to early-season
crops and plants. Gusty winds along the East Coast will make it
feel even colder at times.

On the other hand, the western and north-central U.S. can expect
much warmer conditions through the weekend, with much above
average and possibly record-breaking warm temperatures. The Desert
Southwest should see temperatures in the upper 90s, while 80s are
forecast for northern and central portions of the Plains. However,
these warm temperatures combined with dry soils and low relative
humidities will lead to Elevated Risks of fire weather for parts
of the Plains, as delineated by the Storm Prediction Center. There
is also an Elevated Risk of fire danger across the western Florida
coast given some gusty post-frontal winds and dry land conditions.

Only light precipitation is expected across the contiguous U.S.
over the next couple of days. Showers and isolated thunderstorms
are possible across the Southwest today and moving into Texas
tonight and Saturday, but totals will remain light. Light snow
showers may occur across parts of the Northeast today, but with
hardly any accumulations, and portions of the Florida peninsula
could see isolated rain showers. Slightly higher precipitation
amounts could come into the Northwest late Saturday into Sunday
given a frontal boundary coming through. Also, today snowmelt and
ice jams could lead to flooding in northern Maine, where there is
a Flood Watch in effect.

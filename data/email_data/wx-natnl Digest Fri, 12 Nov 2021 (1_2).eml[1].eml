Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1030 AM CST Thu Nov 11 2021

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

The elevated risk was expanded into western Kansas, where
significant precipitation has not occurred in the last few days. The
strong, gusty winds and low relative humidity discussed in the
previous forecast (below) will allow the drying of fine fuels.
Seasonably cool temperatures (generally below 60 F) will limit more
widespread drying of fuels, but elevated fire weather concerns will
exist.

..Marsh.. 11/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CST Thu Nov 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will evolve into an upper-level cut-off low
across the central CONUS, with a surface low expected to meander
around the Upper Mississippi Valley today. By afternoon, over 80 kts
of 500 mb northwesterly winds will pivot around the backside of the
upper trough and coincide with dry west-northwesterly surface flow,
promoting dry and breezy conditions across the central and southern
High Plains.

While the lowest RH/highest surface winds are expected across
portions of the central Plains, fuels remain mediocre for fire
spread, precluding fire weather highlights. However, drier fine
fuels do exist across portions of the Colorado Front Range, where 15
mph sustained westerly surface winds are expected to overlap with
20-25% RH, hence the introduction of Elevated highlights. Locally
Elevated fire conditions may also be observed across the southern
High Plains, but a weaker surface wind field along with poorly
receptive fuels suggest that fire weather highlights are not
necessary in this region.

eastern and central U.S. during the period. An area of mid-level high
pressure,
centered over the Bering Strait and southern Arctic Ocean, is likely to res=

in below normal temperatures across much of Alaska for most of week-2. Onsh=

flow is forecast to increase over the Alaska Panhandle and northwestern
contiguous U.S., with the exact orientation dependent on the strength of
ridging in the Northeast Pacific. Models continue to differ regarding the
degree of amplification of the overall pattern leading to a low confidence

FOR FRIDAY NOVEMBER 19 - THURSDAY NOVEMBER 25: The largest amplification in
the
500-hpa height forecast is forecast across the North Pacific in week-2, whe=
re
the ECMWF, GEFS and Canadian ensembles depict anomalous ridging over the
Bering
Strait and Arctic Ocean, troughing to the south of the Aleutians, and ridgi=
ng
across the Northeast Pacific and western CONUS. The ECMWF and Canadian
ensembles are more amplified with these features compared to the GEFS. The
mid-level flow pattern is generally less amplified across the central and
eastern CONUS, although weak troughing is forecast to develop across the Ea=
st,
likely a result of the forecast downward trend in both the North Atlantic
Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation indices, in addition to the ridging favo=
red
upstream over the West. This pattern may continue to allow waves of
anomalously
cold air to dive into the eastern U.S. during late November, as well as
increased chances for cyclogenesis in the East, although exact timing and
location is very uncertain.



The anomalous mid-level heights forecast across the Bering Sea, and associa=
ted
surface high pressure over the Arctic, favor anomalously cold temperatures
across Mainland Alaska. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is
posted for parts of Mainland Alaska where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecas=
t
tools depict at least a 20% chance minimum temperatures drop below the 15th
climatological percentile. Probabilities are higher in the ECMWF reforecast
tool, with some areas having chances greater than 40%. Both reforecast tool=
s
also depict increased chances (40-60%) for minimum temperatures dropping be=
low
-20 deg F over the eastern and central interior Mainland, especially early =
in
the period. Toward the end of the period, troughing is forecast to shift
closer
to the state, which favors a more southerly flow developing over the Mainla=
nd.
The dynamical models indicate some moderation in temperatures by the end of
week-2, particularly across the eastern Mainland, and the hazard is therefo=
re
discontinued after 11/23. This trough also favors an increase in onshore fl=
ow
across the Panhandle and southeastern Mainland toward the middle of the
period,
leading to areas of heavy rain along the coast and snow for the higher
elevations. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts some of these areas having at
least a 20% chance for 3-day liquid-equivalent precipitation tools to excee=
d
the 85th climatological percentile. However, probabilities are lower in the
GEFS, with the decreased amplification favoring the greatest onshore flow t=
o
be
focused to the south of the state, and a related precipitation hazard is no=
t
included at this time.



The timing of when enhanced onshore flow and associated precipitation and w=
ind
hazards returns to the Pacific Northwest remains highly uncertain due to th=
e
differences in amplification in the model ensembles. The ECMWF and Canadian
ensembles continue to support stronger ridging over the West, which would
favor
keeping the largest onshore flow north of the Canadian Border. The GEFS, on
the
other hand, is weaker with the ridge, and depicts more troughing over the
Northeast Pacific, allowing for an increase in onshore flow and heavy
precipitation chances beginning around the middle of week-2 across the Paci=
fic
Northwest. Due to this uncertainty, no related hazards are issued at this
time.



A cold front is forecast to move through the eastern U.S. late in week-1,
which
will result in a relatively cool air mass setting up across the Midwest
through
the Eastern Seaboard during week-2 as weak troughing develops over the area=
.
However, minimum temperature anomalies are not forecast to be high enough t=
o
warrant any hazards, with overnight low temperatures ranging from the 20s d=
eg
F
(Midwest), to the 30s deg F (closer to the East Coast). Most of these areas
have already experienced their first freeze, reducing the chances of any
significant impacts to agriculture. By the start of week-2, surface high
pressure is forecast to move into the east-central CONUS, with a decreasing
pressure gradient over most areas compared to the end of week-1. Therefore =
the
high wind and heavy snow hazards are discontinued, although some lake effec=
t
snow showers cannot be ruled out on day-8 (11/19) originating from Lakes
Michigan and Superior.

...Moderate to heavy precipitation for the Pacific Northwest
Sunday-Monday...

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Sunday with upper ridging over the
Southwest, with onshore flow bringing enhanced precipitation to
the Pacific Northwest, and general troughing over the eastern half
of the country with lake effect/enhanced snow/rain showers. This
pattern moves fairly progressively after that, as troughing comes
into the Northwest by Tuesday, flattening the western pattern and
producing a notable surface low moving across south-central
Canada. This low should spread gusty winds to the north-central
U.S. behind it as well as eventually some rain to the
Mississippi/Ohio/Tennessee Valleys along its trailing cold front
for midweek onward.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

00/06Z model guidance is in generally good agreement with the
large-scale pattern described above, though there are some
differences in the details. Aspects of the pattern where models
vary include the potential for and timing of a mid-upper low to
close off within the eastern trough and potentially more impactful
differences in strength/depth of shortwave energy coming into the
Pacific Northwest tracking eastward. The latter creates
differences in the surface pattern with the track of the southern
Canada low--the ECMWF and CMC runs have appeared more consistent
with the low track, while GFS runs have varied more, with the 00Z
run farther north compared to consensus and the new 12Z run
perhaps a bit quick/east. This has trended south a bit compared to
the previous forecast. But overall deterministic models were
fairly well clustered, and for the WPC medium range forecast, a
mainly deterministic blend of the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET
was able to be used, phasing out the UKMET and phasing in small
proportions of the GEFS and EC ensemble means by the latter part
of the period.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

For the Pacific Northwest, a long fetch of Pacific moisture
directed onshore will lead to moderate to locally heavy
precipitation during the early part of the week. Precipitation
should begin as all rain even in higher elevations of the Olympics
and Cascades on Sunday into Monday, but snow levels should lower
Monday night as a cold front comes through. Precipitation will be
enhanced over the Olympics and Cascades, with locally heavy rain
possible. Some precipitation is likely to spill into the northern
Rockies late Monday into Wednesday, with higher elevation snow.

Shortwave troughs moving through the southwest side of a broad
trough over the eastern half of the U.S. and cold northwest flow
will lead to lake effect/enhanced precipitation downwind of the
Great Lakes through around Tuesday, along with a weak low pressure
system bringing light rain and higher elevation/interior Northeast
snow. Then as the surface low pressure system moves through
southern Canada Monday through Thursday, gusty winds are expected
on its backside, especially for the northern High Plains on
Tuesday. Moisture should increase ahead of the low's trailing cold
front from midweek onward, leading to increasing rain chances for
portions of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys along
with additional precipitation for the Great Lakes region.

Mild temperatures that are considerably above normal are forecast
for the western half of the country early next week, with
temperatures 15-25F above normal for the High Plains on Monday and
Tuesday. After the cold frontal passage, cool high pressure will
drop into the western and central parts of the CONUS and drop the
temperatures to slightly below normal. Meanwhile, expect
temperatures of 5-15F cooler than average in the eastern U.S.
early in the week to push eastward Tuesday and offshore by
Wednesday, replaced by normal to slightly above normal
temperatures.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 PM CST Thu Nov 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

As the mid-upper-level low evolves across the central United States
on Friday, a belt of enhanced mid-level flow accompanying another
shortwave trough will move across the central United States. This
enhanced flow will mix down to the surface, yielding widespread
strong and gusty winds across the Plains. These strong winds,
coupled with relative humidity in the teens, will support drying of
fine fuels, with ERC percentiles forecast to be greater than 60%
across portions of the Plains. A corridor of elevated fire weather
concern should develop on the southwestern flank of the stronger
mid-level winds, where the coupling of strong winds and low relative
humidity will occur. An area delineating this elevated fire weather
potential was added and ultimately will be delimited to the north
and northeast by cooler surface conditions.

..Marsh.. 11/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CST Thu Nov 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
As an upper-level low evolves into a progressive open wave and moves
across the eastern U.S. with a surface low, a secondary mid-level
impulse is expected to pivot around the open wave and traverse the
Plains states tomorrow/Friday. Subsequently, high pressure will
build into the central Plains, fostering a bout of dry northwesterly
surface flow Friday afternoon. At least Elevated to locally Critical
conditions are expected across portions of the central Plains.
However, finer fuels across the region marginally support
wildfire-spread potential. As such, fire weather highlights have
been withheld this outlook. An Elevated area may need to be added in
forecast updates if stronger, drier flow is anticipated,
compensating for mediocre fuel status.

...Moderate to heavy snow coupled with high winds expected over

isolated blizzard conditions possible...

...Flash flooding potential to continue over the Pacific Northwest
through Saturday morning as onslaught of heavy rainfall
continues...

...A sweeping cold front will drop temperatures well below normal
from the Plains to the Appalachians...

An occluded low pressure/frontal system centered over the Upper
Midwest will be the focus of a snow storm set to impact the region
and the neighboring Northern Plains through late Friday evening.
Cold air advection to the north/west of the system, an influx of
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, and deep layer ascent due to
coupling with a cut-off low aloft will all contribute to the
development of a favorable environment for moderate to heavy
snowfall. Widespread accumulations of 2-6 inches are likely, with
higher totals of 6-8+ inches expected in northern Minnesota and
along the Canadian border in eastern North Dakota. Winter Weather
Advisories are currently in effect for portions of the Dakotas,
Minnesota, and northern Iowa while Winter Storm Warnings have been
issued for portions of northern Minnesota. In addition to the snow
a tight pressure gradient on the western edge of this system will
generate high winds with gusts reaching 60-70 mph over the
Northern Plains, where both High Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories
are in effect. While hazardous enough on their own, these high
winds are forecast to impact some areas where moderate snowfall
rates and accumulations are expected. Due to the potential for
these strong winds to blow snow around and significantly reduce
visibility, a Blizzard Warning has been issued for portions of
northeast South Dakota and west-central Minnesota.

On the warmer eastern edge of this system showers and
thunderstorms focused around and ahead of the trailing cold front
will deliver moderate to heavy rain from the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys to the Eastern Seaboard through Friday night. The heaviest
rainfall is expected over the northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast,
where high rain rates could lead to isolated instances of runoff
and flash flooding. As such, the Weather Prediction Center has
issued a Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of the
Northeast effective Friday morning through Saturday morning.

Shifting focus out west, onshore moisture flow from a modest
atmospheric river will bring moderate to heavy rainfall to
portions of the Pacific Northwest. Another 2-4 inches of rain have
been forecast for the region over the next 24 hours and rainfall
rates over some areas may be as high as 0.5-0.75 inches per hour.
Given the already saturated soils from the previous days' rain and
the concern for the development of rapid run-off and urban
flooding, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk
of Excessive Rainfall for portions of the Pacific Northwest
through Friday morning. Though the onshore moisture flow from the
atmospheric river is expected to begin tapering off on Friday,
thus dropping 24 hour rainfall totals to around 1-2 inches over
the region, the potential for high rainfall rates and associated
flooding issues will continue through Friday afternoon prompting
the maintenance of a Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall over the
Pacific Northwest through Saturday morning.

In the Central/Southern Plains, dry and breezy conditions
coinciding with low values of relative humidity across portions of
Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas has prompted the issuance of an
Elevated Risk of fire weather by the Storm Prediction Center
through Friday morning, as these conditions could allow any fires
that ignite to spread rapidly.

Temperature-wise, daily highs across much of the country are
forecast to sit near or moderately (within 10 degrees) above
normal. However, for those areas that find themselves to the
west/southwest of the occluded low pressure system the opposite
holds true. Significant cold air advection behind the system,
aided by the cut off low aloft, will force temperatures to drop
well below normal behind a cold front set to develop across the
central US this evening. On Friday the Central Plains and Middle
Mississippi Valley will be hit the hardest as highs are expected
to fall into the 30s and 40s, around 10 to 15 degrees below
normal. As the Plains warm up on Saturday with the advancement of
a warm front through the region, cooler temperatures are expected
to settle into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys with the eastward
progression of the cold front. With temperatures sitting 10 to 20
degrees below normal, daily highs in these areas will be unable to
escape the 40s and 50s.

300 PM EST Thu November 11 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 17 - 21 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions depict a variable 500-hPa=
 flow pattern across most
of
the forecast domain, and quickly progress it eastward during the 6 to 10 da=
y
period. Model ensemble solutions are in relatively better agreement across
Alaska as an amplified upstream ridge over Eastern Siberia will likely prom=
ote
troughing and anomalous northerly mid-level flow across most of the Mainlan=
d
Alaska. The 500-hPa manual height blend, based primarily on the ensemble me=
ans
from the GEFS and ECMWF, generally features below normal heights over the
north-central CONUS and near to above normal heights across the rest of the
CONUS, consistent with the expected variable pattern. Above normal heights =
are
favored for western Alaska and the Panhandle with near to below normal heig=
hts
forecast across eastern Mainland Alaska.

Anomalous northerly mid-level flow forecast downstream of the eastern Siber=
ia
ridge and near surface easterly flow from western Canada leads to increased
odds of below normal temperatures across Alaska. Surface high pressure
predicted over northwestern Canada and the western CONUS will likely lead t=
o a
trend toward below normal temperatures for parts of the Pacific Northwest.
Near
normal temperatures are favored for the rest of the northwestern and
north-central CONUS. Forecast southeasterly low-level flow leads to enhance=
d
probabilities of above normal temperatures across the remainder of the West=
.
Conversely, the southerly low-level flow on the west side of a forecast
surface
high pressure area over the eastern CONUS tilts the odds toward above norma=
l
temperatures across most of the eastern CONUS.

Anomalous northerly mid-level flow and offshore low-level flow are expected=
 to
combine to favor a dry pattern for most of Alaska. Farther to the south, me=
an
onshore flow is expected, favoring an active pattern with elevated
probabilities for above normal precipitation across parts of southeastern
Alaska and the Panhandle. Mean surface high pressure is forecast across muc=
h
of
the remainder of the CONUS, favoring below normal precipitation over most
areas. However, as surface high pressure progresses eastward across the
Southeast, return moisture flow and a forecast front may enhance precipitat=
ion
across parts of the western Gulf Coast and Mississippi Valley.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a
variable pattern predicted across most of the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 19 - 25 2021

During the week-2 period, a low-amplitude mean 500-hPa pattern is forecast
across most of the CONUS due to the continued variable pattern forecast and
resultant high model uncertainty. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual =
500-hPa height blend is
based
primarily on the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble mean. The resultant pattern featur=

cyclonic flow across most of the CONUS and Alaska. Positive height anomalie=
s
are depicted across much of the western CONUS, with near to below normal
heights favored over the eastern and central CONUS. Near normal heights are
forecast for most of Alaska, except for the western Mainland and Panhandle
where positive height anomalies are favored.

Anomalous northerly mid-level flow forecast downstream of the eastern Siber=
ia
ridge and surface high pressure over northwestern Canada and northeastern
Alaska favor increased below-normal temperature probabilities across Alaska=
.
Near to above normal temperatures are favored across much of the CONUS, wit=
h
the highest probabilities over the southwestern CONUS, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool.

Mean surface high pressure over northwestern Canada and northeastern Alaska
increases chances of below-normal precipitation across much of Alaska.
However,
a positively tilted trough is forecast to dig across the Mainland, leading =
to
a
potential for an increasingly active pattern downstream across parts of
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, with associated elevated
chances of above normal precipitation. Likewise, predicted enhanced Pacific
Flow increases odds for above-normal precipitation across the northwestern
CONUS and parts of the Northern Plains. Below normal precipitation is forec=
ast
across much of the southwestern CONUS northeastward to parts of the Midwest=
,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Elevated probabilities of
above-normal precipitation are also favored across the Southern Plains, par=

of the Lower Mississippi Valley, and Southeast, with potential return moist=

flow behind departing surface high pressure forecast over the Southeast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a variable pattern predicted across most of the forecast domain.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

Valid 00Z Fri Nov 12 2021 - 00Z Sun Nov 14 2021

...Moderate to heavy snow coupled with high winds expected over
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest through Friday evening;
isolated blizzard conditions possible...

...Flash flooding potential to continue over the Pacific Northwest
through Saturday morning as onslaught of heavy rainfall
continues...

...A sweeping cold front will drop temperatures well below normal
from the Plains to the Appalachians...

An occluded low pressure/frontal system centered over the Upper
Midwest will be the focus of a snow storm set to impact the region
and the neighboring Northern Plains through late Friday evening.
Cold air advection to the north/west of the system, an influx of
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, and deep layer ascent due to
coupling with a cut-off low aloft will all contribute to the
development of a favorable environment for moderate to heavy
snowfall. Widespread accumulations of 2-6 inches are likely, with
higher totals of 6-8+ inches expected in northern Minnesota and
along the Canadian border in eastern North Dakota. Winter Weather
Advisories are currently in effect for portions of the Dakotas,
Minnesota, and northern Iowa while Winter Storm Warnings have been
issued for portions of northern Minnesota. In addition to the snow
a tight pressure gradient on the western edge of this system will
generate high winds with gusts reaching 60-70 mph over the
Northern Plains, where both High Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories
are in effect. While hazardous enough on their own, these high
winds are forecast to impact some areas where moderate snowfall
rates and accumulations are expected. Due to the potential for
these strong winds to blow snow around and significantly reduce
visibility, a Blizzard Warning has been issued for portions of
northeast South Dakota and west-central Minnesota.

On the warmer eastern edge of this system showers and
thunderstorms focused around and ahead of the trailing cold front
will deliver moderate to heavy rain from the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys to the Eastern Seaboard through Friday night. The heaviest
rainfall is expected over the northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast,
where high rain rates could lead to isolated instances of runoff
and flash flooding. As such, the Weather Prediction Center has
issued a Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of the
Northeast effective Friday morning through Saturday morning.
Furthermore, due to the potential for thunderstorms that develop
over the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England to become severe,
producing damaging wind gusts and possibly a tornado or two, the
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk of Severe
Thunderstorms for these regions effective Friday morning through
Saturday morning.

Shifting focus out west, onshore moisture flow from a modest
atmospheric river will bring moderate to heavy rainfall to
portions of the Pacific Northwest. Another 2-4 inches of rain have
been forecast for the region over the next 24 hours and rainfall
rates over some areas may be as high as 0.5-0.75 inches per hour.
Given the already saturated soils from the previous days' rain and
the concern for the development of rapid run-off and urban
flooding, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk
of Excessive Rainfall for portions of the Pacific Northwest
through Friday morning. Though the onshore moisture flow from the
atmospheric river is expected to begin tapering off on Friday,
thus dropping 24 hour rainfall totals to around 1-2 inches over
the region, the potential for high rainfall rates and associated
flooding issues will continue through Friday afternoon prompting
the maintenance of a Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall over the
Pacific Northwest through Saturday morning.

In the Central/Southern Plains, dry and breezy conditions
coinciding with low values of relative humidity has prompted the
issuance of an Elevated Risk of fire weather by the Storm
Prediction Center through Saturday morning, as these conditions
could allow any fires that ignite to spread rapidly.

Temperature-wise, daily highs across much of the country are
forecast to sit near or moderately (within 10 degrees) above
normal. However, for those areas that find themselves to the
west/southwest of the occluded low pressure system the opposite
holds true. Significant cold air advection behind the system,
aided by the cut off low aloft, will force temperatures to drop
well below normal behind a cold front set to develop across the
central US this evening. On Friday the Central Plains and Middle
Mississippi Valley will be hit the hardest as highs are expected
to fall into the 30s and 40s, around 10 to 15 degrees below
normal. As the Plains warm up on Saturday with the advancement of
a warm front through the region, cooler temperatures are expected
to settle into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys with the eastward
progression of the cold front. With temperatures sitting 10 to 20
degrees below normal, daily highs in these areas will be unable to
escape the 40s and 50s.

...Moderate to heavy precipitation for the Pacific Northwest
Sunday-Monday...

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Sunday with upper ridging over the
Southwest, with onshore flow bringing enhanced precipitation to
the Pacific Northwest, and general troughing over the eastern half
of the country with lake effect/enhanced snow/rain showers. This
pattern moves fairly progressively after that, as troughing comes
into the Northwest by Tuesday, flattening the western pattern and
producing a notable surface low moving across south-central
Canada. This low should spread gusty winds to the north-central
U.S. behind it as well as eventually some rain to the
Mississippi/Ohio/Tennessee Valleys along its trailing cold front
for midweek onward.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

00/06Z model guidance is in generally good agreement with the
large-scale pattern described above, though there are some
differences in the details. Aspects of the pattern where models
vary include the potential for and timing of a mid-upper low to
close off within the eastern trough and potentially more impactful
differences in strength/depth of shortwave energy coming into the
Pacific Northwest tracking eastward. The latter creates
differences in the surface pattern with the track of the southern
Canada low--the ECMWF and CMC runs have appeared more consistent
with the low track, while GFS runs have varied more, with the 00Z
run farther north compared to consensus and the new 12Z run
perhaps a bit quick/east. This has trended south a bit compared to
the previous forecast. But overall deterministic models were
fairly well clustered, and for the WPC medium range forecast, a
mainly deterministic blend of the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET
was able to be used, phasing out the UKMET and phasing in small
proportions of the GEFS and EC ensemble means by the latter part
of the period.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

For the Pacific Northwest, a long fetch of Pacific moisture
directed onshore will lead to moderate to locally heavy
precipitation during the early part of the week. Precipitation
should begin as all rain even in higher elevations of the Olympics
and Cascades on Sunday into Monday, but snow levels should lower
Monday night as a cold front comes through. Precipitation will be
enhanced over the Olympics and Cascades, with locally heavy rain
possible. Some precipitation is likely to spill into the northern
Rockies late Monday into Wednesday, with higher elevation snow.

Shortwave troughs moving through the southwest side of a broad
trough over the eastern half of the U.S. and cold northwest flow
will lead to lake effect/enhanced precipitation downwind of the
Great Lakes through around Tuesday, along with a weak low pressure
system bringing light rain and higher elevation/interior Northeast
snow. Then as the surface low pressure system moves through
southern Canada Monday through Thursday, gusty winds are expected
on its backside, especially for the northern High Plains on
Tuesday. Moisture should increase ahead of the low's trailing cold
front from midweek onward, leading to increasing rain chances for
portions of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys along
with additional precipitation for the Great Lakes region.

Mild temperatures that are considerably above normal are forecast
for the western half of the country early next week, with
temperatures 15-25F above normal for the High Plains on Monday and
Tuesday. After the cold frontal passage, cool high pressure will
drop into the western and central parts of the CONUS and drop the
temperatures to slightly below normal. Meanwhile, expect
temperatures of 5-15F cooler than average in the eastern U.S.
early in the week to push eastward Tuesday and offshore by
Wednesday, replaced by normal to slightly above normal
temperatures.

fairly well clustered, and for the WPC medium range forecast, a
mainly deterministic blend of the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET
was able to be used, phasing out the UKMET and phasing in small
proportions of the GEFS and EC ensemble means by the latter part
of the period.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

For the Pacific Northwest, a long fetch of Pacific moisture
directed onshore will lead to moderate to locally heavy
precipitation during the early part of the week. Precipitation
should begin as all rain even in higher elevations of the Olympics
and Cascades on Sunday into Monday, but snow levels should lower
Monday night as a cold front comes through. Precipitation will be
enhanced over the Olympics and Cascades, with locally heavy rain
possible. Some precipitation is likely to spill into the northern
Rockies late Monday into Wednesday, with higher elevation snow.

Shortwave troughs moving through the southwest side of a broad
trough over the eastern half of the U.S. and cold northwest flow
will lead to lake effect/enhanced precipitation downwind of the
Great Lakes through around Tuesday, along with a weak low pressure
system bringing light rain and higher elevation/interior Northeast
snow. Then as the surface low pressure system moves through
southern Canada Monday through Thursday, gusty winds are expected
on its backside, especially for the northern High Plains on
Tuesday. Moisture should increase ahead of the low's trailing cold
front from midweek onward, leading to increasing rain chances for
portions of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys along
with additional precipitation for the Great Lakes region.

Mild temperatures that are considerably above normal are forecast
for the western half of the country early next week, with
temperatures 15-25F above normal for the High Plains on Monday and
Tuesday. After the cold frontal passage, cool high pressure will
drop into the western and central parts of the CONUS and drop the
temperatures to slightly below normal. Meanwhile, expect
temperatures of 5-15F cooler than average in the eastern U.S.
early in the week to push eastward Tuesday and offshore by
Wednesday, replaced by normal to slightly above normal
temperatures.

...Moderate to heavy precipitation over the Pacific Northwest
continues into Monday...

...Overview...

Expect the western ridge/eastern trough upper pattern as of the
start of the week to transition toward progressive and broadly
cyclonic mean flow. As this transition begins, Pacific energy
about to enter western North America will direct an axis of
moisture into the Pacific Northwest while under the eastern trough
aloft the chilly low level flow around a system tracking into the
Canadian Maritimes will promote lake effect/enhanced rain or snow.
Over the course of the week the Pacific shortwave will continue
across the continent, supporting a strong southern Canada surface
low and trailing cold front that ultimately crosses much of the
lower 48--along with some strong/gusty winds over parts of the
northern tier and later some rain over the east-central U.S. Well
above normal temperatures from the West into the Plains and cool
conditions over the East early in the week should moderate later
in the week with the flatter trend for the mean pattern.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A composite of 18Z/12Z operational models provided a good
representation of significant systems during the first half of the
period and incorporating some 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF mean input along
with the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF reflected the most common ideas of
guidance thereafter. There are still some finer-scale details to
be resolved for one or two low centers that will consolidate into
a stronger Canadian Maritimes system by early Tuesday. Some spread
persists for the upper trough crossing the continent and
associated Canadian low pressure/lower 48 cold front but
clustering has been gradually improving, with GFS adjustments over
the past 12 hours generally contributing to that trend. The new
00Z GFS/GEFS mean are a bit on the amplified side as the trough
comes into/through the West but the 00Z ECMWF has strongly
adjusted this way too. Later in the week there is decent agreement
for the cold front reaching the East Coast but not much support
for the 18Z GFS wave that would produce significant rainfall over
parts of Florida (so that aspect of the 18Z GFS was downplayed).
However the flatter mean flow farther west rapidly reduces
confidence in specifics, with individual model runs varying for
details of shortwaves that could be embedded within separate
Pacific streams. The preferred model/mean blend yielded a
conservative approach while awaiting improved agreement.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A band of enhanced moisture along a wavy front heading into the
Northwest will produce locally heavy precipitation into the early
part of the week. Precipitation should be all rain even in higher
elevations of the Olympics and Cascades into Monday but snow
levels should lower Monday night as the cold front comes through.
Expect the highest precipitation totals over the Olympics and
Cascades with locally heavy rain possible. Some rain and higher
elevation snow should spill into the northern Rockies late Monday
through Tuesday. Meanwhile shortwaves moving through the southwest
side of the initial eastern U.S. upper trough and cold
northwesterly low level flow behind a consolidating system
tracking into the Canadian Maritimes will produce lake
effect/enhanced precipitation downwind of the Great Lakes through
Tuesday. The surface system itself could bring light rain and
higher elevation/interior Northeast snow. The surface low tracking
across southern Canada Monday onward will bring a period of
strong/gusty winds to northern tier areas, especially the northern
High Plains on Tuesday. Moisture should increase ahead of the
low's trailing cold front from midweek onward, leading to
increasing rain chances for portions of the Mississippi, Ohio, and
Tennessee Valleys along with additional precipitation for the
Great Lakes region. Most of this activity should be light to
moderate.

Well above normal temperatures will prevail over the West and into
the Plains Monday-Tuesday with a broad area of plus 10-25F
anomalies. Some readings could reach daily record values, perhaps
with a slightly better chance for warm lows relative to highs. At
the same time the East will be on the cool side, with Monday
seeing the best potential for some highs 10-15F below normal. Cold
frontal passage will spread slightly below normal temperatures
from west to east across the lower 48 mid-late week. Leading warm
anomalies reaching the South and East Wednesday-Thursday will be
only in the plus 5-15F range.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CST Fri Nov 12 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level low over the Great Lakes will move eastward
through the day today as a strong mid-level jet along the backside
of the low moves over the southern Plains. At the surface, a
developing cold front is forecast to move south with dry and windy
conditions expected behind the front. While fuel conditions are
marginal, strong winds and low humidity may support elevated fire
weather potential over portions of the southern Plains this
afternoon.

...Southern Plains...
As the aforementioned cold front develops and moves south early this
morning, surface flow should veer to the northwest and increase as
pressure gradients tighten. Bolstered by deep mixing from an 80 kt
mid-level jet, northwesterly surface winds of 20-30 mph, and higher
gusts, are expected through much of the day across the Plains. While
temperatures will be modest, the downslope nature of the flow and
dry continental air behind the cold front will support surface
humidity values in the teens and low 20s through the afternoon. As
such, elevated fire weather conditions may develop across portions
of the southern Plains before RH begins to increase after sunset.

...Southern California...
Periodic offshore flow is expected across portions of southern
California this morning as surface pressure gradients strengthen in
response to increasing pressure over the Great Basin and Rockies.
Surface conditions are not forecast to be overly dry with daytime
humidity values around 20%. As such, locally elevated fire weather
conditions may occur across the higher terrain of the southern
California coastal ranges, but widespread fire weather concerns are
not anticipated.

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime is forecast to continue
Day2/Saturday as the Great Lakes upper low weakens and continues
eastward. A second shortwave trough within northwesterly flow over
the Rockies is forecast to intensify as it moves southeastward
through the day. At the surface, high pressure will build over the
Great Basin and Rockies in the wake of a cold front sweeping through
the eastern half of the country. Given cooler and drier conditions
along with modest available fuels, fire weather potential is
forecast to remain low with only locally elevated conditions
possible across portions of southern California where weak offshore
flow may develop late in the day.

Valid 12Z Sat Jan 15 2022 - 12Z Mon Jan 17 2022

...Snow for parts of the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee Valleys, and
Southern Appalachians on Saturday...

...Pockets of rain/freezing rain over parts of the Carolinas and
Southern Appalachians on Saturday...

...Heavy snow for parts of the Lower Great Lakes/Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, Central/Southern Appalachians on Sunday...

...Significant rain/freezing rain for parts of the Mid-Atlantic
and the Central/Southern Appalachians on Sunday...

A strong developing storm over the Lower Mississippi Valley will
move eastward to the Southeast by Sunday morning then head
northeastward to the northern Mid-Atlantic by Monday. On Saturday,
the system will produce snow and rain over parts of the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley. The rain will move into the
Southeast as the snow starts falling over parts of the
Central/Southern Appalachians by Saturday evening. Overnight
Saturday, as the rain moves into the Carolinas, pockets of
rain/freezing rain will develop over southern
Mid-Atlantic/Southern Appalachians. On Sunday, heavy snow will
develop over parts of the Central/Southern Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic. Significant areas of rain/freezing rain will also
develop Mid-Atlantic and the Central/Southern Appalachians on
Sunday. Overnight Sunday, the heavy snow will move into parts of
the Lower Great Lakes/Ohio Valley, with areas of rain/freezing
rain moving into the northern Mid-Atlantic. The combination of
snow and ice may cause hazardous driving conditions on roads.

Meanwhile, a boundary over Central Canada will move into the Upper
Midwest by Sunday. The system will produce light snow over parts
of the Upper Mississippi Valley and the Upper Great Lakes for
Sunday and begin to wane by Monday morning. The snow will result
in reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1146 AM CDT Tue Apr 05 2022

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST MONTANA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Widespread critical to extremely critical winds are already being
observed across most of the High Plains from near the Mexico border
to near the Canadian Border. Relative humidity is already critically
dry across much of the southern High Plains with additional warming
needed in the central High Plains and northeast Montana before
critical conditions are observed there.

Only change to this outlook was a slight eastward expansion of the
elevated across western Oklahoma and southern Kansas. Elevated to
locally critical conditions are expected in the wake of the cold
front after it moves through this area with poor recoveries expected
through the overnight hours in this region.

..Bentley.. 04/05/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0120 AM CDT Tue Apr 05 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather threats are expected to increase this afternoon along
much of the High Plains. A strong upper-level jet is noted in
early-morning water vapor imagery and latest RAP analyses across the
Pacific Northwest. This features will dig slightly into the central
Plains through the day and help shift a strong surface low, noted in
the lee of the northern Rockies, into the upper MS river valley by
late afternoon. An attendant cold front will sweep southeast across
the Plains this morning with a continental air mass in its wake,
resulting in widespread dry, windy conditions.

...Central High Plains...
Latest surface observations from eastern WY already show strong
downslope 25-30 mph winds on the west side of the lee trough. These
conditions are yielding poor overnight RH recovery with RH values
holding steady in the 30-35% range. As the cold front pushes east
this morning, downslope winds will become more widespread across the
central Plains. Latest guidance continues to show high probability
for widespread sustained 20-30 mph winds from the Dakotas into
northern KS. Deep boundary-layer mixing up to 700-600 mb and a
unidirectional wind profile will support the potential for 40-50 mph
wind gusts - especially over the NE/CO/WY tri-state region where the
strongest low to mid-level flow is expected. Despite the deep
mixing, cold advection and scattered cloud cover (and potentially
light showers) may limit overall RH reductions. RH values may drop
into the 15-20% range under persistent cloud breaks, but 20-25% RH
values appear more probable. Given very receptive fuels over the
region, widespread critical, and localized extremely critical,
conditions are expected.

...Southern High Plains...
A secondary surface low is expected to deepen over western
OK/northwest TX through the afternoon. 20-25 mph westerly winds
behind the low and attendant dryline will have trajectories
emanating from the southern Rockies. Downslope warming and drying
will support widespread critical conditions as RH values fall into
the low teens. Extremely critical conditions are possible across far
eastern NM and the southwestern TX Panhandle where the overlap of
the low-level thermal ridge and 850-700 mb wind maxima will be
maximized. However, poor ensemble probabilities for sustained 30+
mph winds suggests such conditions will be localized and brief.
Portions of northwest TX within the Critical risk area have received
well over 0.5 inches of rain over the past 24 hours, which has
likely mitigated fuel receptiveness to a degree. However, the
critical wind/RH conditions will support fire spread outside of the
narrow swaths that received higher amounts.

...Northern Montana...
Widespread 20-30 mph winds (gusting to 50+ mph at times) are
expected behind the cold front by early afternoon. Due to cold air
advection and lingering cloud cover, RH reductions are expected to
be meager, falling to 25-35%. Despite this, very dry fuels combined
with strong winds will support critical fire weather concerns this
afternoon.

300 PM EDT April 05 2022

SYNOPSIS: A rapid change in the mid-level height pattern is predicted acros=
s
North America during week-1, with mid-level low (high) pressure becoming
dominant across the western (eastern) contiguous U.S. at the outset of week=
-2.
Surface low pressure is forecast to eject out of the Rockies resulting in a
variety of impacts to be ongoing across the contiguous U.S. at the start of
the
period. This includes the potential for a late-season snow storm across
portions of the Great Plains and Upper Midwest, and heavy rain across much =
of
the east-central U.S, including the Southeast. Although unseasonably warm
weather is possible over parts of the East initially, the forecast progress=
ion
of mid-level low pressure across the contiguous U.S. favors increased chanc=
es
of below normal temperatures expanding eastward by the middle of the period=
.
Easterly surface flow is indicated across Alaska, favoring increased chance=
s
for below normal temperatures over most of the state.

HAZARDS

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 08 - TUESDAY APRIL 12:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!ro-fvg8_jhs9d7yMgxUcaIRaXHYmZTdEkkGUdnzljHqJD-jLnpQW9wKI0q3T4=
MMGWcvX-edN$

FOR WEDNESDAY APRIL 13 - TUESDAY APRIL 19: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles all support a rapid flip of the 500-hPa height pattern across the
CONUS between week-1 and week-2. By the outset of week-2, an amplified heig=
ht
pattern is forecast, with anomalous troughing (ridging) depicted across the
West (East). This is consistent with a forecast negative phase of the
Pacific-North American Pattern (PNA), as well as the ongoing La Nina. As a
result, anomalously cold temperatures are predicted across much of the west=
ern
half of the CONUS, with the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools depicting at le=
ast
a 20 percent chance that minimum temperatures drop below the 15th percentil=
e
and freezing over the region, with an eastward progression throughout the
period. This favors a trend toward warmer temperatures in the West later in
week-2, and cooler temperatures in the central and eastern CONUS. A broad
slight risk for much below normal temperatures is indicated for much of the
western and north-central CONUS for all of week-2. Both reforecast tools
indicate higher probabilities for minimum temperatures falling below the 15=
th
climatological percentile (greater than 40 percent) across portions of the
Southwest, Great Basin, Rockies, and Great Plains where a moderate risk for
much below normal temperatures is highlighted from 4/13-4/14. Minimum
temperatures are forecast to be in the single digits and teens deg F across
high elevation areas of the Rockies and Great Basin, and in the 20s and 30s
deg
F across parts of the southwestern CONUS.



Conversely, the increased ridging in the East favors a quick transition to
above normal temperatures, with a summer-like preview possible across the
Eastern Seaboard early in week-2 due to deep southerly flow ahead of upstre=
am
troughing to the west. The GEFS reforecast tool indicates at least a 20
percent
chance maximum temperatures exceed 85 deg F across portions of the central =
and
southern Mid-Atlantic, with the ECMWF reforecast tool backing off on these
enhanced probabilities compared to yesterday. For many of these areas, this
would be the first significant warming of the season, and while temperature=
s
in
the 70s and 80s deg F would not be considered hazardous for the most part,
consideration was given due to it being only mid-April. Additionally, the v=
ery
quick transition from a relatively colder pattern to a much warmer pattern =
in
the East may increase health related impacts among more sensitive groups. F=
or
this reason, a slight risk of much above normal temperatures is indicated
across portions of the Mid-Atlantic for 4/13-4/14. Abnormally dry, to in so=
me
cases moderate drought, is ongoing across the region, and it is possible th=
at
an extended period of anomalously warm weather could result in an expansion=
 of
these drought conditions, especially given that the heaviest precipitation
totals are favored upstream.



Anomalously warm temperatures are also possible across portions of southern
Texas at the outset of week-2, underneath increased deep southerly flow ahe=
ad
of troughing to the west, and also due to very dry conditions over the regi=
on
favoring increased surface heating. Uncalibrated guidance from the ECMWF an=
d
GEFS ensemble indicate maximum temperatures in the 95-100 deg F range over =
the
region, with the corresponding reforecast tools also depicting elevated
chances
for daytime temperatures exceeding 95 deg F. Therefore, a slight risk of mu=
ch
above normal temperatures is highlighted across southern Texas on 4/13 with=
 a
quick moderation favored thereafter as troughing shifts eastward. Above nor=
mal
temperatures, combined with severe to exceptional drought conditions observ=
ed
in the Southern Plains, are likely to increase the potential for wildfires =
in
the region.



Troughing over the West, along with the tight temperature gradient predicte=
d
between the western and eastern CONUS, favors surface low pressure to eject
out
of the Rockies and track across the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley ear=
ly
in the week-2 period. A variety of impacts are possible depending on locati=
on.
Heavy rain and frontally focused convection would be possible across the
east-central CONUS in the warm-sector, with a potential late-season snowsto=
rm
possible on the northwestern flank of the storm track, across the Central
Rockies into the north-central CONUS and Upper Midwest. A slight risk of he=
avy
precipitation is highlighted over much of the east-central CONUS from
4/13-4/17. While the bulk of the rainfall is forecast early in the period,
there are some indications that the trailing front may stall across the
Southeast later in week-2, prolonging rainfall chances. The ECMWF and GEFS
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance 3-day precipitation
exceeds the 85th climatological percentile and 1-inch early in the period,
with
the ECMWF continuing these elevated probabilities throughout the period. A
moderate risk for heavy precipitation is posted across portions of the Lowe=
r
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and Southeast fro=
m
4/13-4/14 given the good model agreement regarding the initial surface low
pressure and increased potential for convective precipitation and
thunderstorms
over these areas, despite lower probabilities for reaching hazards threshol=
ds
in the reforecast tools. Additionally, a slight risk of heavy snow is poste=
d
across parts of the Central Rockies, Northern and Central Plains, and Upper
Mississippi Valley from 4/13-4/14 to account for increased potential for sn=
ow
to the northwest of the storm track, and where the GEFS reforecast tool
depicts
around a 20 percent chance snow water equivalent exceeds the 85th
climatological percentile early in week-2. Following recent runoff from
snowmelt, spring flooding is ongoing along portions of the Red River of the
North and the Illinois River, and is expected to continue into week-2 due t=
o
additional precipitation forecast over both regions. Therefore, a flooding
possible hazard is indicated over parts of these river valleys.



Increased wind speeds will also be possible ahead of the troughing, with a
more
eastward progression compared to yesterday. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools
depict at least a 20 percent chance wind speeds exceed the 85th climatologi=
cal
percentile and 20-mph across much of the east-central CONUS early in the
period
given anomalous southerly flow predicted, corresponding with a slight risk =
for
high winds from 4/13-4/14. Increased wind speeds are also possible across t=
he
Great Plains on the backside of the departing surface low, and therefore, t=
his
region is included in the slight risk as well.



Strong easterly surface flow is forecast over much of Alaska during week-2,
supporting cold, Arctic air advecting into the state. A slight risk of much
below normal temperatures is posted for much of the southern two-thirds of
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle for all of week-2, where the GEFS and ECM=
WF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance minimum temperatures
fall below the 10th climatological percentile, with uncalibrated guidance
depicting minimum temperature anomalies of at least -10 deg F in some areas=
.
Both reforecast tools increase the probabilities for temperatures falling
below
the 10th climatological percentile to above 40 percent across parts of the
southeastern Mainland and the Kenai Peninsula early in the period, where a
moderate risk is posted from 4/13-4/16. Subzero or positive single digit de=
g F
minimum temperatures are possible in this moderate risk region. While
temperatures are not expected to be as cold as during the peak of winter, a=
n
extended period of anomalously cold temperatures during mid-April is likely=
 to
slow river ice break up across Alaska.

Added an extremely critical area for tomorrow. 12Z guidance has come
in with consistent 30 mph sustained northwesterly winds from
southeast Colorado to western Oklahoma. Winds may be even stronger
northeast of this area, but relative humidity will be lower and
temperatures a bit cooler. Temperatures are not ideal for extremely
critical (Upper 50s to near 60F), but the winds and relative
humidity should be consistent with extremely critical conditions in
a region which is in exceptional drought, has not started greenup
yet, and has seen less than a half an inch of precipitation in the
last month.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0209 AM CDT Tue Apr 05 2022/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level wave currently moving into the northern Rockies is
forecast to amplify over the central Plains and upper MS River
Valley over the next 48 hours as an attendant surface low occludes
over MN. A tight pressure gradient across the Plains will maintain
strong northwesterly low to mid-level flow from west TX into the
Dakotas Wednesday afternoon. These strong winds, combined with dry
conditions, will support another day of widespread fire weather
concerns for parts of the High Plains.

...Central to southern High Plains...
Ensemble guidance continues to show high probability for 20-30 mph
sustained wind across much of the high Plains. Cold advection and
mid-level clouds will mute diurnal RH reductions for most locations
north of northeast CO and northern KS. Further south, limited cloud
cover and a stronger downslope wind component off the central
Rockies will yield RH reductions into the 15-25% range. Deep mixing
up to 700 mb should allow for frequent wind gusts up to 35-45 mph by
late afternoon, which may support periods of extremely critical fire
weather conditions from far southeast CO into the OK/TX Panhandles
where RH values may fall to near 10%. Given antecedent dry fuel
status across much of the region, elevated to critical fire weather
conditions appear likely.

...New Mexico...
Regional pressure gradient winds will gradually increase through the
day as a surface high builds across the northern Great Basin.
Sustained 15-25 mph winds will likely see frequent gusts up to 25-30
mph by late afternoon amid deep diurnal mixing. Fuels across
northwest NM are only modestly receptive, but given the increasing
winds and RH reductions into the single digits to low teens, at
least elevated fire weather concerns are expected. A Critical risk
area may be needed in subsequent outlooks depending on how fuel
status trends over the next 48 hours.

257 PM EDT Tue Apr 05 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 08 2022 - 12Z Tue Apr 12 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period will see an amplified and reasonably
progressive pattern in the upper levels, beginning late week with
an upper low/trough tracking through the East before a gradual but
dramatic switch to western troughing and eastern ridging through
the early part of next week. This evolution will lead to some
dramatic temperature changes during the period as much above
normal temperatures over the West on Friday trend toward well
below normal readings by the first part of next week, while chilly
temperatures over the eastern half of the country Friday into the
weekend rebound to above normal levels by Monday-Tuesday.
Meanwhile rain and higher elevation snow will spread over the West
and low level Gulf inflow should eventually contribute to rainfall
over the Mississippi Valley and vicinity. A showery pattern over
the East during Friday-Saturday under the upper trough should give
way to drier weather thereafter.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance continues to show good agreement with the
amplified pattern described above, so confidence is reasonably
high for the overall pattern, but there are lingering
uncertainties with the smaller-scale details. One notable detail
difference occurs by early Sunday with shortwave energy within the
western trough. There have been some run to run variations with a
possible shortwave on the eastern side of the base of the trough
around the northern Plains, causing differences in the progression
of the northern stream cold front. The 00/06Z guidance cycle
indicated support for the eastern shortwave, aside from the UKMET,
while the newer 12Z guidance is not as excited about it. These are
somewhat small differences for a day 5 forecast, but could be
marginally impactful since it affects the cold frontal position,
but given the small scale of the feature it may take a while
longer to resolve.

The western trough is forecast to gradually deepen through day
7/next Tuesday, with a possible embedded upper low over the Great
Basin originating from energy over the Gulf of Alaska at the start
of the period. The exact evolution of the deepening trough remains
uncertain, particularly considering differences with digging
energy on the west side of the trough. The ECMWF may be the most
consistent of the guidance, while the 12Z CMC trended deeper than
its 00Z run but the 12Z GFS trended flatter with the trough's
depth due to uncertain shortwave depth and progression. With the
overall good agreement especially for the first half of the
period, the WPC forecast was based on a multi-model deterministic
blend early on, with addition of some EC and GEFS ensemble mean
guidance by the latter part of the period given typically
increasing detail uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A coastal/triple point low pressure system forming near New
England early Friday will support organized rainfall there, which
should taper off by Saturday as the low moves away. However, cold
air aloft associated with the upper trough will likely promote
areas of diurnally enhanced showers from the Midwest/Great Lakes
and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys into the Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast through especially Saturday. Some
precipitation could be in the form of snow, with the best chances
across the peaks of the Central Appalachians in West Virginia.
Meanwhile, precipitation should begin late this week in the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies and spread southeastward
into next week underneath and just ahead of the incoming upper
trough, eventually reaching California and the Southwest. Lower
elevation/coastal rain and higher elevation snow are forecast,
with enhancement of totals in higher terrain, first in the
Cascades and then into the Rockies early next week as upslope flow
may add to precipitation amounts. Precipitation could be in the
form of snow even for northern/central parts of the High Plains as
well by around Monday-Tuesday, but confidence in the details is
lacking at this point. Farther southeast in the warm sector,
expect rain to develop over the Mississippi Valley and vicinity
during the first half of next week as Gulf moisture inflow
increases.

The West will see one more day of very warm to hot temperatures on
Friday with highs reaching 15-25F above normal especially from
California into the Great Basin, with some daily records for
highs/warm lows. Then the upper trough steadily deepening over the
region will bring a pronounced cooling trend. Much of the
Northwest/northern Rockies may see highs of 10-15F below normal by
Sunday, and highs of 10-20F below normal should be common over a
majority of the West as well as northern High Plains by next
Tuesday. Meanwhile the eastern half of the country will trend from
mostly below normal temperatures (up to minus 10-20F anomalies)
Friday-Saturday, with potential for a late frost across parts of
the southeastern quadrant of the country, to above normal readings
(plus 5-15F anomalies) from west to east by next Sunday-Tuesday.

difference occurs by early Sunday with shortwave energy within the
western trough. There have been some run to run variations with a
possible shortwave on the eastern side of the base of the trough
around the northern Plains, causing differences in the progression
of the northern stream cold front. The 00/06Z guidance cycle
indicated support for the eastern shortwave, aside from the UKMET,
while the newer 12Z guidance is not as excited about it. These are
somewhat small differences for a day 5 forecast, but could be
marginally impactful since it affects the cold frontal position,
but given the small scale of the feature it may take a while
longer to resolve.

The western trough is forecast to gradually deepen through day
7/next Tuesday, with a possible embedded upper low over the Great
Basin originating from energy over the Gulf of Alaska at the start
of the period. The exact evolution of the deepening trough remains
uncertain, particularly considering differences with digging
energy on the west side of the trough. The ECMWF may be the most
consistent of the guidance, while the 12Z CMC trended deeper than
its 00Z run but the 12Z GFS trended flatter with the trough's
depth due to uncertain shortwave depth and progression. With the
overall good agreement especially for the first half of the
period, the WPC forecast was based on a multi-model deterministic
blend early on, with addition of some EC and GEFS ensemble mean
guidance by the latter part of the period given typically
increasing detail uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A coastal/triple point low pressure system forming near New
England early Friday will support organized rainfall there, which
should taper off by Saturday as the low moves away. However, cold
air aloft associated with the upper trough will likely promote
areas of diurnally enhanced showers from the Midwest/Great Lakes
and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys into the Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast through especially Saturday. Some
precipitation could be in the form of snow, with the best chances
across the peaks of the Central Appalachians in West Virginia.
Meanwhile, precipitation should begin late this week in the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies and spread southeastward
into next week underneath and just ahead of the incoming upper
trough, eventually reaching California and the Southwest. Lower
elevation/coastal rain and higher elevation snow are forecast,
with enhancement of totals in higher terrain, first in the
Cascades and then into the Rockies early next week as upslope flow
may add to precipitation amounts. Precipitation could be in the
form of snow even for northern/central parts of the High Plains as
well by around Monday-Tuesday, but confidence in the details is
lacking at this point. Farther southeast in the warm sector,
expect rain to develop over the Mississippi Valley and vicinity
during the first half of next week as Gulf moisture inflow
increases.

The West will see one more day of very warm to hot temperatures on
Friday with highs reaching 15-25F above normal especially from
California into the Great Basin, with some daily records for
highs/warm lows. Then the upper trough steadily deepening over the
region will bring a pronounced cooling trend. Much of the
Northwest/northern Rockies may see highs of 10-15F below normal by
Sunday, and highs of 10-20F below normal should be common over a
majority of the West as well as northern High Plains by next
Tuesday. Meanwhile the eastern half of the country will trend from
mostly below normal temperatures (up to minus 10-20F anomalies)
Friday-Saturday, with potential for a late frost across parts of
the southeastern quadrant of the country, to above normal readings
(plus 5-15F anomalies) from west to east by next Sunday-Tuesday.

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 08 2022 - 12Z Tue Apr 12 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period will see an amplified and reasonably
progressive pattern in the upper levels, beginning late week with
an upper low/trough tracking through the East before a gradual but
dramatic switch to western troughing and eastern ridging through
the early part of next week. This evolution will lead to some
dramatic temperature changes during the period as much above
normal temperatures over the West on Friday trend toward well
below normal readings by the first part of next week, while chilly
temperatures over the eastern half of the country Friday into the
weekend rebound to above normal levels by Monday-Tuesday.
Meanwhile rain and higher elevation snow will spread over the West
and low level Gulf inflow should eventually contribute to rainfall
over the Mississippi Valley and vicinity. A showery pattern over
the East during Friday-Saturday under the upper trough should give
way to drier weather thereafter.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance continues to show good agreement with the
amplified pattern described above, so confidence is reasonably
high for the overall pattern, but there are lingering
uncertainties with the smaller-scale details. One notable detail

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue April 05 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 11 - 15 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Amplified ridges and associated above normal 500-hPa heigh=
ts
are predicted near the Bering Strait and over the North Pacific well off th=
e
west coast of the CONUS. A deep trough associated with below normal 500-hPa
heights are forecast over the western and central CONUS. Ridging with above
normal 500-hPa heights are predicted to be situated over the eastern CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are likely over the western half of the CONUS
underneath predicted troughing and enhanced northerly mid-level flow. Ridgi=
ng
and above normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased odds of above normal
temperatures for most of the eastern CONUS. Below normal temperatures are
likely over Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, while above normal
temperatures are favored over the Aleutians, supported by most of the
dynamical
forecast tools.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored for most of the western and
central CONUS eastward to the Ohio Valley, due to a predicted deep trough o=
ver
the western and central CONUS. Exceptions are for parts of California,
southeastern New Mexico, and western Texas, where below normal precipitatio=
n
is
favored, consistent with the consolidation precipitation tool. Near to belo=
w
normal precipitation is most likely for much of the East Coast of the CONUS=
,
associated with predicted riding over the eastern CONUS. Predicted mid-leve=
l
ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights favor below normal precipitation o=
ver
most of Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and in
the
forecast temperature and precipitation fields in the forecast tools.



8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 13 - 19 2022

During the 8-14 day period, the predicted week-2 mean 500-hPa circulation
pattern features below normal heights associated with deep troughing foreca=
st
over the central CONUS. Conversely, ridging and associated positive 500-hPa
heights anomalies are forecast over both the West and East Coast of the CON=
US.
Ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights are also forecast over the Bering
Sea,
the Aleutians and western Mainland Alaska extending southward into the
adjacent
North Pacific.

Ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights increase the likelihood of above
normal temperatures for parts of California and much of the East Coast of t=
he
CONUS. Below normal temperatures are likely over most of the remainder of t=
he
CONUS, associated with  predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa height=
s
over the central CONUS. Elevated probabilities of below normal temperatures
are
forecast over Alaska, supported by most of the dynamical forecast tools.

Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the eastern half of the
CONUS, due to a predicted trough over the central CONUS and likelihood for =
a
robust return flow of Gulf moisture advecting northward to the west of surf=
ace
high pressure forecast over the Atlantic. Above normal precipitation is
slightly favored across the Alaska Panhandle and parts of Washington, while
near to below normal precipitation is more likely over the remainder of the
western half of the CONUS, consistent with the consolidation precipitation
tool. Below normal precipitation is most likely for the Aleutians and weste=
rn
Mainland Alaska associated with predicted ridging and above normal 500-hPa
Heights.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and in
the
forecast temperature and precipitation fields in the forecast tools.



FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic through Thursday...

...Multi-day wet snow event over the Upper Midwest...

...There is an Elevated to Extreme Risk of fire weather over parts
of the Plains...

Deep low pressure over the Upper Midwest and the Southern Plains,
along with a strong area of high pressure over the Pacific
Northwest and the North Pacific, will combine to produce a very
strong pressure gradient over the Northern/Central Rockies and
Northern/Central High Plains, prompting High Wind Warnings over
the Region through Wednesday morning and afternoon.

Furthermore, a strong front over the Upper Midwest to the Southern
High Plains, along with a wave of low pressure on the associated
warm front over the Mid-Atlantic, will produce rain and snow over
the Upper Midwest and showers and thunderstorms over the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley to the Southeast and southern
Mid-Atlantic overnight Tuesday into Thursday. In addition,
upper-level energy over the Southeast will destabilize the
atmosphere over the area, creating conditions favorable for severe
thunderstorms. Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Central Gulf Coast and
Southeast through Wednesday morning. The hazards associated with
these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Moreover, there is a
greater chance of EF2-EF5 tornadoes over parts of the Southeast
during this time. In addition, heavy rain will be associated with
these thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall through Wednesday morning. The associated
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.

The Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms continues on Wednesday
over parts of the Southeast and Southern Appalachians; producing
hazards with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Likewise, the
threat of excessive rainfall continues over parts of the Southeast
as the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with
these thunderstorms over the region. The associated heavy rain
will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban
areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.

On Thursday, the threat of severe thunderstorms moves to the
Mid-Atlantic Coast. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Mid-Atlantic Coast on
Thursday. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.

Meanwhile, multi-day wet snow event will develop over the Upper
Mississippi Valley and the Upper Great Lakes, with some areas
getting 12 inches of snow with the favorable flow off Lake
Superior. Additionally, rain and snow will start over the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday afternoon into
evening, then changes over to wet snow. The snow will continue
over the region through Thursday evening.

Gusty winds, low humidity, and dry fuels will contribute to the
SPC issuing a Critical Risk of fire weather over most of the High
Plains on Tuesday into Wednesday morning. However, the fire
weather threat increases to an Extreme Risk over the Southern High
Plains in Texas and Oklahoma on Wednesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0123 AM CDT Wed Apr 06 2022

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR SOUTHEAST COLORADO
INTO NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough is apparent in early morning water vapor
imagery over the central CONUS. At the surface, a low is beginning
to occlude over MN with an attendant cold front arcing southwestward
into north TX. This low will largely remain in place today with the
associated surface trough/cold front shifting east through the
morning. To the west, surface high pressure will continue to build
amid broad upper-level ridging. Consequently, pressure gradient
winds will remain elevated overnight and increase through the day as
boundary-layer mixing increases. This will support Critical to
Extreme fire weather conditions for parts of the southern High
Plains where active wildfires have been noted over the past 24
hours.

...Southern High Plains...
Early morning surface observations show a dry, continental air mass
moving from the northern/central Plains (where dewpoints are in the
single digits) into the southern High Plains. The strong low-level
flow is maintaining boundary-layer mixing near the surface and poor
overnight RH recovery from southeast WY into the OK/TX Panhandles.
This air mass will undergo further drying today as winds increase in
response to the tightening pressure gradient and downslope flow off
the CO Rockies increases. Afternoon RH values are expected to fall
into the 15-20% range from eastern CO into central OK and northern
TX. Ensemble guidance continues to show high probability for
widespread critical fire weather conditions across this region with
20-30 mph sustained winds. Extremely critical conditions remain
likely across the OK/TX Panhandles where deep mixing will allow for
single-digit RH and wind gusts up to 40-50 mph. ERCs across this
region remain elevated near the 90th percentile, and these
conditions will likely impact recent fires across the OK Panhandle.
Similar wind speeds are probable further north into eastern CO and
western KS, but confidence in extremely critical RH is lower.

...Southern Texas...
Dry, post-frontal air will sweep across southern TX through the
morning hours. Mostly clear skies will allow for strong diurnal
warming and boundary-layer mixing, which should allow RH values into
fall into the 20-25% range. Frequent wind gusts up to 20-25 mph will
support periods of critical fire weather conditions, but widespread
elevated conditions appear more probable. Despite patchy rainfall
over the past two days, fuels across the majority of the region
remain very receptive and will support a fire weather concern across
most of southern TX.

...New Mexico...
Northwesterly pressure-gradient winds are expected to increase to
15-25 mph this afternoon from the Four Corners region into southern
NM. A dry air mass currently over parts of the Great Basin (where
dewpoints are in the low teens) will shift into the Four Corners/NM
region by late afternoon. Downslope affects will support additional
drying with RH values in the low teens to single digits likely.
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions are expected, but
modest fuel status (ERCs between the 50-70th percentile) will
preclude a greater concern.

...Overview...

Guidance continues to show an amplified but reasonably progressive
upper pattern from the weekend into the middle of next week. A
deepening trough over the West will spread rain/higher elevation
snow and well below normal temperatures across the region, with
the colder air and rain/snow reaching into parts of the northern
and central Plains by early-mid week. Ahead of the upper trough
and associated wavy surface front, moisture flowing northward from
the Gulf of Mexico should promote rainfall of varying intensity
over the eastern Plains/Mississippi Valley next week. Meanwhile a
deep upper trough crossing the East during the weekend will
produce cool weather with showers over some areas. An upper ridge
moving into the region from the central U.S. will bring warmer
temperatures to the eastern half of the country after the weekend.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Confidence remains fairly good for the overall pattern evolution
and most aspects of the departing eastern trough. However in some
respects the forecast for details of the western trough may be
getting more complicated. Timing/evolution differences for energy
initially over the Alaska Panhandle/Gulf of Alaska and forecast to
contribute to a possible upper low within the western trough have
persisted over multiple runs, with some influence on leading
shortwave energy crossing the northern tier U.S. and southern
Canada. Now models/ensembles are also diverging with specifics of
flow over the northeastern Pacific/northwestern North America by
around Monday and this issue has downstream effects on the western
trough by late in the period.

Looking at the 12Z/18Z guidance contributing to the updated
forecast, the 18Z GFS generally trended closer to the
model/ensemble mean average versus the 12Z run for leading flow
across the northern tier U.S./southern Canada and the upper trough
digging into the West. Guidance has become split for timing the
arrival of Gulf of Alaska energy that could form a closed low as
the 12Z UKMET sided with the slower GFS while the ECMWF/CMC were
faster. Toward the end of the period next Wednesday the ensemble
means supported an upper trough progression (its axis reaching the
Rockies/Plains) near an average of the 18Z GFS and somewhat faster
12Z ECMWF. The 12Z CMC had similar timing but with an upper low
track well south of other guidance. Plus its broad upper low
centered over the Alaska Panhandle did not have much support. A
blend of the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET early followed by
trending to the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF with their respective ensemble
means provided the most reasonable depiction and continuity for
the western-central U.S. evolution as well as for the departing
eastern U.S. upper trough.

The most dramatic change from the new 00Z guidance is in the CMC.
First it has trended slower with the Gulf of Alaska
energy--joining the GFS/UKMET. This cluster would have a much
stronger surface system reaching somewhere along the northern half
of the West Coast than previously forecast. Then upstream changes
in the CMC lead to a much faster and northward path for the core
of the western upper trough, straying eastward beyond other
solutions over the Plains. In contrast the 00Z ECMWF has
maintained remarkable continuity given the differences and/or
changes in the other models. It did trend just a bit slower,
leading to a day 7 Wednesday trough progression that now matches
the means.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper trough currently expected to amplify into the West and
approach or reach the Plains by next Wednesday will first bring
rain and higher elevation snow into the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies during the weekend. Most totals should be in the
light to moderate range though some localized enhancement is
possible over favored terrain. A more favorable combination of
upper trough dynamics and low level upslope flow should increase
precipitation over the northern-central Rockies and High Plains
during the first part of next week, with the High Plains possibly
seeing some snow in addition to the Rockies. There are still
important uncertainties over the details of the upper trough so
confidence is not great in southward extent and amounts of
precipitation across central/southern parts of the West--and to
some degree over the Rockies/Plains--at this time. There will also
be increasing coverage and intensity of rainfall over the eastern
Plains/Mississippi Valley with the establishment of moist low
level flow from the Gulf of Mexico. Farther east, cold air aloft
associated with the upper trough crossing the East during the
weekend will promote areas of diurnally enhanced showers from the
Ohio Valley/Appalachians into the Northeast especially on
Saturday. Some precipitation could be in the form of snow, with
the best chances across the peaks of the Central Appalachians in
West Virginia.

Colder air moving into the West will initially bring highs down to
as much as 10-15F below normal over the Northwest/northern Rockies
during the weekend. An area of minus 10-20F anomalies for highs
should then reach into the Intermountain West, Rockies, and
northern-central Plains by next Tuesday-Wednesday. Sunday may
provide the best potential for some locations in the Northwest to
see max temperatures near or below current record cold highs.
Meanwhile the eastern half of the country will trend from mostly
below normal temperatures (up to minus 10-20F anomalies Saturday),
and potential for a late frost across parts of the southeastern
quadrant of the country, to mostly above normal readings (plus
5-15F anomalies) spreading from west to east after the weekend.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0210 AM CDT Wed Apr 06 2022

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS INTO NORTHERN
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
The surface low currently over MN will meander east/southeast
towards the Great Lakes over the next 48 hours. To the west, a
surface high will build into the inter-mountain West, maintaining a
tight pressure gradient across the Plains. Another day of strong
northwesterly winds is expected with widespread sustained 20-30 mph
sustained winds from the Dakotas into central Texas. While
increasing cloud cover for much of the plains will mute diurnal RH
reductions, clear skies and downslope flow will resulting in another
day of widespread fire weather concerns for the southern High
Plains.

...Southern High Plains to central Texas...
Latest deterministic and ensemble guidance suggests that much of the
southern High Plains will remain under mostly clear skies through
the day Thursday. This will maximize diurnal heating and support
deep mixing. Low-level trajectories emanating from the central
Rockies will lead to additional warming/drying, resulting in RH
values between 15-20% from southeast CO into northern TX.
Probabilities for 20-25 mph winds across this region remain high,
and drier/windier solutions suggest sustained winds near 30-35 mph
are possible. Single digit RH may not be as widespread as compared
to Wednesday, but brief periods of extremely critical wind/RH may
develop across the TX Panhandle into northwest TX. Outside of the
Critical risk area, windy conditions are expected with widespread
20-30% RH from the CO/WY/NE tri-state region to the TX Gulf Coast.
Confidence in the fire weather potential decreases with northern and
eastern extent due to uncertainties in cloud cover. Clearing skies
by early afternoon may result in lower RH than currently forecast,
and may warrant an expansion of the risk areas given the strong
winds.

...An expansive low pressure system will deliver persistent wet
snow over the upper Midwest, strong to severe thunderstorms across
the Southeast, and areas of heavy rain along the East Coast...

...Widespread strong/high winds continue through Thursday from the
Rockies to much of the Plains with elevated to extreme fire risk
over the central to southern High Plains...

...Heat is expected to challenge high temperature records over
California...

A deep low pressure system centered over the upper Midwest this
morning is forecast to further expand its influence as it engulfs
much of the eastern two-thirds of the country through the next
couple of days.  Widespread high winds gusting to hurricane force
have already been impacting much of the northern and central
Rockies and out into the northern and central Plains.  The
expansive circulation of the cyclone against a strong area of high
pressure centered over the Northwest will combine to sustain
strong to high winds through much of the Plains into late week.
Closer to the center of the cyclone, wet snow is forecast to
persist for a couple of days from the upper Midwest into the upper
Great Lakes as the cyclone meanders in the same vicinity with some
areas receiving 6 to 12 inches of accumulation possible.  Colder
than normal temperatures behind the huge circulation will dive all
the way down to the Gulf Coast.  Under the continued impact of
high winds and dry air flowing down the Rockies, fire weather
threat is expected reach extreme levels over the southern High
Plains today and will remain at elevated levels into late week.

Furthermore, a strong front over the Upper Midwest to the Southern
High Plains, along with a wave of low pressure on the associated
warm front over the Mid-Atlantic, will produce rain and snow over
the Upper Midwest and showers and thunderstorms over the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley to the Southeast and southern
Mid-Atlantic overnight Tuesday into Thursday. In addition,
upper-level energy over the Southeast will destabilize the
atmosphere over the area, creating conditions favorable for severe
thunderstorms. Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Central Gulf Coast and
Southeast through Wednesday morning. The hazards associated with
these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Moreover, there is a
greater chance of EF2-EF5 tornadoes over parts of the Southeast
during this time. In addition, heavy rain will be associated with
these thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall through Wednesday morning. The associated
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.

The Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms continues on Wednesday
over parts of the Southeast and Southern Appalachians; producing
hazards with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Likewise, the
threat of excessive rainfall continues over parts of the Southeast
as the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with
these thunderstorms over the region. The associated heavy rain
will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban
areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.

On Thursday, the threat of severe thunderstorms moves to the
Mid-Atlantic Coast. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Mid-Atlantic Coast on
Thursday. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a

A deep low pressure system centered over the upper Midwest this
morning is forecast to further expand its influence as it engulfs
much of the eastern two-thirds of the country through the next
couple of days.  Widespread high winds gusting to hurricane force
have already been impacting much of the northern and central
Rockies and out into the northern and central Plains.  The
expansive circulation of the cyclone against a strong area of high
pressure centered over the Northwest will combine to sustain
strong to high winds through much of the Plains into late week.
Closer to the center of the cyclone, wet snow is forecast to
persist for a couple of days from the upper Midwest into the upper
Great Lakes as the cyclone meanders in the same vicinity with some
areas receiving 6 to 12 inches of accumulation possible.  Colder
than normal temperatures behind the huge cyclonic circulation will
dive all the way down to the Gulf Coast.  Under the continued
impact of high winds and dry air flowing down the Rockies, fire
weather threat is expected reach extreme levels over the southern
High Plains today and will remain at elevated levels into late
week.

On the warm side of the cyclone, a couple of days of active
weather can be expected to sweep through the eastern half of the
country.  In fact, a more compact low pressure system is
delivering rain up the Mid-Atlantic coast toward New England this
morning.  As the low begins to move off the Mid-Atlantic coast,
the rain associated with the system is forecast to move out to sea
by later this afternoon.  However, showers and thunderstorms
associated with the expansive cyclone will quickly make their way
through the Midwest and Ohio Valley today before reaching the East
Coast on Thursday.  The highest threat of heavy rain and severe
thunderstorms will be across southeastern U.S. today as Gulf
moisture is destabilized and lifted near a warm front.  The
hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes.  In addition, heavy rain associated with these
thunderstorms could create localized areas of flash flooding from
the Florida Panhandle to southern Georgia today.

By Thursday, the threat of severe thunderstorms is forecast to
reach the Mid-Atlantic Coast ahead of a strong cold front.  A low
pressure wave is forecast to develop along the front later on
Thursday and move up the Mid-Atlantic coast toward New England.
This wave is forecast to bring some enhanced rainfall onshore into
New England Thursday night into Friday morning where a slight risk
of excessive rain is forecast, along with gusty winds.  In
addition, interior higher elevations of New England could see
wintry precipitation during this time frame.

In stark contrast with the stormy weather in the eastern
two-thirds of the country, strong winds are expected to diminish
as the high pressure system settles across the Rockies.  A strong
ridge of high pressure aloft is forecast to build across the
western U.S. into late week.  This ridge will dispel the cold and
windy weather up north as heat will progressively builds across
the Southwest.  In fact, high temperatures are forecast to
challenge records by Thursday afternoon in California, with
readings possibly reaching the century mark near Los Angeles.
Gusty Santa Ana winds could also make an appearance as the Rockies
high pressure system builds southward.  More record high
temperatures are forecast for Friday as the next Pacific cold
front reaches the West Coast with rain/snow reaching the Pacific
Northwest Thursday night/Friday morning.

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance still to show remarkably good agreement for the flow
pattern evolution through medium range time scales. This is
highlighted aloft by an amplified eastern Pacific/Alaskan ridge
and a deep longwave trough centering over the central/eastern
U.S., with an anomalous closed low north of the Great Lakes. This
allows significant intrusions of Arctic air overspread and hold a
firm grip on central and eastern U.S. much below normal
temperatures. The upper trough may begin to flatten by next
midweek as more progressive flow emerges from the Pacific.

Considering the better than average guidance clustering, the WPC
medium range product suite was derived from a composite blend of
the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS, 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian/ECMWF ensemble
mean and the 01 UTC National Blend of Models, albeit with
increasing emphasis on the ensembles by day 6/7 (next Tue/Wed)
consistent with gradually decreasing system predictability. This
maintains good WPC product continuity and latest 00 UTC model and
ensemble guidance overall seems well in line with this scenario.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Lead energetic low pressure exiting New England Saturday and
cyclonic flow/cold surge out from the Great Lakes offers some
lingering enhanced snows, including lake effect, along with
blustery/windy conditions on the backside. Meanwhile upstream,
expect upslope snows over the northern Rockies as shortwaves cross
over the region and as potent Arctic blasts surge southward. This
energy and subsequent systems will dive into an amplified central
U.S. upper trough position this weekend into next week and produce
periodic snow swaths in the reinforced Arctic air. A lingering
lead front over the Southeast/FL should focus Superbowl weekend
showers/thunderstorms. A Southeast coast low developing off the
front should lift northward Sunday/Monday and spread precipitation
across the cooling Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic and Northeast to
include an interior snow/ice threat. There is uncertainty with
phasing of this low and mid/upper level energy. Impulses running
on the base of the upper trough early-mid next week offer
potential for swaths of overrunning precipitation including a
snow/ice threat deeper into the cold post-frontal airmass over
much of the south-central states and Southeast where modest
amounts have an enhanced impact.

...Heavy snow for the U.P. of Michigan on Thursday into Friday...

...Snow for the Cascades and the Northern/Central Rockies through
Friday...

...Areas of rain/freezing rain from the Upper Midwest to the Lower
Great Lakes/northern Mid-Atlantic through Friday...

Lingering light snow showers from the Northeast into the Central
Appalachians will slowly end by Thursday morning.  A weak system
moving into the Pacific Northwest will dissipate by this evening.
Today, the system will produce rain and higher elevation snow over
the Pacific Northwest into Northern California, ending by tonight.


A developing storm over the Northern Plains will move to the Upper
Great Lakes by Friday.  The upper-level energy east of the
Northwest system will produce snow over the Northern Intermountain
Region into parts of the Northern/Central Rockies today.  Tonight,
snow will develop over parts of the Northern Plains, with pockets
of rain/freezing rain developing over portions of the Upper
Mississippi Valley.  Snow and rain/freezing rain areas will move
into the Upper Great Lakes on Thursday morning, while rain and
snow move into the Middle Mississippi Valley.  Rain will develop
over parts of the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys
by Thursday evening.  Snow, which may be heavy at times, will
develop over the Upper Great Lakes overnight Thursday as snow and
rain move into the Mid-Atlantic and Central Appalachians.  Pockets
of rain/freezing rain will also develop over parts of the Lower
Great Lakes/northern Mid-Atlantic overnight Thursday into Friday
morning with rain approaching the Southeast.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, weak onshore flow over the Pacific
Northwest will aid in producing coastal rain and higher elevation
snow over parts of the Northwest, with snow developing over the
Northern Rockies into the Central Rockies by Friday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1124 AM CDT Wed Apr 13 2022

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

The forecast remains mostly on track. The primary change was to
adjust the Elevated area in the central Plains. Some locations may
not observe humidity near critical thresholds given persistent
mid/upper clouds, particularly in southwest Kansas. Duration of fire
weather concerns in east-central/northeast Colorado may be short,
but conditions are still expected to be briefly Critical as stronger
downslope winds develop.

..Wendt.. 04/13/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0203 AM CDT Wed Apr 13 2022/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper low and active mid-level jet over the center of the
CONUS will continue to amplify today, keeping strong flow over the
Southwest and southern High Plains. At the surface, a cold front
moving through the Plains early this morning will scour surface
moisture resulting in very dry airmass. Strong westerly winds and
dry conditions will support active fire weather conditions within
dry fuels.

...Southern High Plains into west Texas...
As the upper trough/low over the Plains/Midwest continues to lift
away, strong northwesterly flow aloft will fill in across the
Southwest and southern High Plains. Progression of the upper-level
system has generally been slower than previous guidance, suggesting
some misalignment between the strongest winds and diurnal heating.
While winds will be slightly weaker/delayed, frequent gusts to 35
mph along with strong subsidence and downsloping should still favor
extremely dry surface conditions. Model soundings showing mean
mixed-layer RH values as low as 2-3% coincident with the winds which
should support widespread Critical fire weather conditions within
extremely dry fuels. The highest confidence in winds of 30+ mph
appears to be across far eastern NM closer to the ejecting mid-level
jet. While confidence is lower, a few hours of localized Extremely
Critical conditions may occur within a corridor from eastern NM
through the southwestern TX Panhandle.

...Central High Plains...
Dry and windy conditions should develop for a few hours across the
central High Plains and lee of the Rockies in the dry post-frontal
airmass as strong flow aloft lingers over the Rockies. While surface
temperatures should be cooling, low relative humidity and gusty
winds should support downsloping and drying with RH of 10-20%
likely. Elevated and Critical fire weather conditions are possible
for a few hours before the arrival of cooler temperatures and higher
humidity later in the evening and overnight.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 13 2022

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is expected to shift inland from the
northeastern Pacific to the western U.S. from April 21 to 23. This pattern
increases the chances for high winds from the West Coast east to the Great
Plains, late season snowfall at the higher elevations of the West, and
eventually thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall across the Great Plains
and Mississippi Valley. No hazardous weather is anticipated for Alaska during
week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Pacific Northwest and
northern California, Thu-Sat, Apr 21-23.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the Cascades, Klamath Mountains, and Northern
Sierra Nevada Mountains, Thu-Sat, Apr 21-23.

Moderate risk of high winds for parts of the Southwest and Great Plains,
Fri-Sat, Apr 22-23.

Slight risk of high winds expanding east from the West Coast to the Great
Plains, Thu-Sun, Apr 21-24.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Great Plains and
Mississippi Valley, Sat-Mon, Apr 23-25.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of California, Oregon,
and Nevada, Sat-Mon, Apr 23-25.

Flooding possible along parts of the Illinois River and Red River of the
North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 16 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 20:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!qJw3F3GtkJmlwpALNlV-nbeCH_a_qMNhlzgmczFkGHexUj4xWn3yY5NUhMVlBbfGpVzSbljd$

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 21 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 27: Early in week-2, the ensemble
means
are in good agreement and remain consistent that a 500-hPa trough progresses
from the northeastern Pacific to the western U.S. Initially, the highly
amplified trough for April and enhanced onshore flow support a slight risk of
heavy precipitation across parts of the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California. Since models continue to trend towards a more southward storm
track, the slight risk of heavy snow was expanded to include the Klamath
Mountains and Northern Sierra Nevada Mountains. Accumulating snow is also
expected to overspread the higher elevations of the Central Rockies, but
uncertainty on amounts preclude designation of a snow hazard at this time.



As the 500-hPa trough axis shifts eastward during week-2, surface cyclogenesis
with a dryline is likely to develop across the central to southern high
Plains.
This predicted 500-hPa and surface pattern are very favorable for another high
wind event for the Southwest and Central to Southern Great Plains. Given the
good model continuity, pattern recognition, and time of year, a moderate risk
of high winds is posted for parts of the West and Central to Southern Great
Plains on Apr 22 and 23. Any enhancement of surface winds across the Southwest
and Great Plains is likely to result in elevated to high wildfire danger due
to
the ongoing drought conditions. Also, blowing dust is expected to accompany
the
gusty winds from New Mexico east to the central and southern high Plains.



Downstream of the trough, the potential for thunderstorms with locally heavy
rain is expected to increase later in week-2. Based on the likelihood of
returning low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, good model agreement on
a
500-hPa trough axis shifting east towards the central U.S., and 24-hour
precipitation amounts from the ensemble means, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is posted for parts of the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley
from Apr 23-25. Models have trended towards a faster eastward progression of
the upstream trough so this risk of hazardous precipitation was shifted one
day
earlier.



As 500-hPa heights increase rapidly in response to the amplified trough
entering the West, temperatures are forecast to moderate throughout the
central
and eastern U.S. at the beginning of week-2. Based on the ECMWF reforecast
tool, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures (Apr 23-25) is posted
for
parts of California, Oregon, and Nevada where there is a 20 percent chance of
minimum temperatures falling into the 15th percentile of the climatological
distribution and below 40 degrees F.



Moderate flooding continues along parts of the Illinois River and Red River of
the North. Based on recent precipitation and forecasts from the Advanced
Hydrologic Prediction Service, a flooding possible hazard is maintained for
the
Illinois River and Red River of the North through week-2.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CDT Wed Apr 13 2022/

...Synopsis...
As the mid-level pattern de-amplifys in the wake of the earlier
upper trough, zonal flow will linger over the Rockies and
central/southern High Plains. Lee troughing and westerly flow will
continue to support dry and breezy conditions in the post-frontal
airmass across the central CONUS. Fuels remain dry and a few hours
of Elevated to near-Critical fire weather conditions appear likely
Thursday.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Dry and breezy conditions behind the initial cold front are expected
Thursday with surface lee troughing supporting gusty downslope
surface winds. While the airmass will remain relatively cool, little
moisture and diurnal mixing should support RH below 25%. With winds
of 15-20 mph and some higher gusts likely closer to the higher
terrain of the central Rockies, Elevated fire weather conditions
appear likely within dry fuels.

Farther south across portions of eastern NM and the western TX
Panhandle, slightly stronger winds may develop owing to better flow
aloft within the southern stream of the mid-level jet. Model
soundings show boundary-layer max winds of 20-25 mph along with low
relative humidity of 10-15%. Widespread Elevated to near-Critical
fire weather conditions appear likely with extremely dry fuels.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
256 PM EDT Wed Apr 13 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 16 2022 - 12Z Wed Apr 20 2022

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment..

Relatively low amplitude mean flow aloft should prevail over the
lower 48 through the weekend, in the wake of a departing deep
upper low working from the Great Lakes/Northeast to the Canadian
Maritimes. Guidance shows a gradually amplifying shortwave trough
and associated rain/snow focusing system progressing into and
through the West during the weekend onward to the north-central
U.S. by early next week.

However, the pattern over the lower 48 is then expected to
transition to more amplified flow, likely in part due to effect
from the upstream progression as a deep extratropical low to the
Aleutians of current west Pacific Typhoon Malakas. As such, an
amplified upper trough reaching the West Coast by Tuesday would
build downstream upper ridging to also allow potential to
dig/carve out a closed low over the Great Lakes/Midwest that is
expected to work in earnest into the Northeast by midweek.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of the 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and
ECMWF ensemble mean that offer a decently clustered overall
solution that is on the more amplified side of the full envelope
of guidance soltuions. Latest 12 UTC guidance is trending toward a
more common pattern amplitude evolution. This raises forecast
confidence to a degree, albeit with overall flow not quite as
amplified as the earlier derived WPC guidance blend, but more
amplified than the 00/06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The departing low pressure system north of the Great Lakes should
continue to produce some generally light to moderate precipitation
across the Great Lakes/Northeast as a secondary surface low lifts
off the coast. Moisture and instability interacting with a warm
front lifting through the South/Southeast this weekend and
approach of a cold front from the north should bring areas of
moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of those areas, but
for now with low confidence in exact placement of heaviest totals.
Farther west, a system forecast to reach the West by Saturday
should continue to focus rain/mountain snow over the central and
northern West Coast into the northern Rockies late this week into
the weekend. Moisture should spread east beyond the Rockies Sunday
onward as low pressure/fronts reach the central/eastern U.S.. At
least some precipitation across the northern tier may be in the
form of snow, again. Guidance is trending signifcantly upward the
precipitation potential/intensity over the East. This seems
especially evident over New England as the expected approach of
the aforementioned upper low may spawn deep surface cyclogenesis.
This will offer the potential for runoff issues outside of
northern areas in an emerging threat area for wrapping/windy
spring snows.

meanwhile, the central Rockies/High Plains could see a brief
period of strong winds around Sunday with system passage.
Upstream, expect another episode of precipitation from the Pacific
Northwest/northern California into the northern Rockies through
early next week, with some enhanced totals possible over favored
coastal/terrain areas. Precipitation potential may increase into
next midweek with approach of another amplified upper trough and
frontal progression.

The core of below normal temperatures across the northern Plains
and vicinity will likely persist into early next week, with
daytime highs generally 20-30F below normal, and moderating slowly
with time. Over the West, temperatures should moderate in between
systems as a period of upper ridging moves through. Saturday will
feature chilly readings over the northern half of the region
(minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) and closer to normal
temperatures farther south. As the upper ridge builds over the
region by the start of next week, northern locations should trend
toward normal and southern areas above normal. The Great Basin and
Southwest could see highs as warm as 10-15F above normal. The East
should stay near normal on Saturday, but the system potentially
reaching the Midwest/East early next week could draw some of the
chilly northern Plains air southward and eastward behind it, with
expanding coverage of minus 10-20F anomalies. The southern Plains
will see highs 10-15F above normal next weekend followed by a
cooling trend.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed April 13 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 19 - 23 2022

Today's model solutions are generally in good agreement on the overall
predicted large-scale 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America and
surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period. A trough and associated
negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the northeast Pacific.
Downstream, a mean ridge is predicted with associated positive 500-hPa height
anomalies over the southwestern and central CONUS. A mean trough is forecast
over the northeastern CONUS.

Near to below normal temperatures are likely over parts of the western CONUS
under predicted below normal 500-hPa heights. Near to above normal
temperatures
are favored for most of the southwestern CONUS northward into parts of the
Great Basin and Central and Southern Rockies, as a ridge is predicted to push
into the region during the period. Near to below normal temperatures are
favored for parts of the northern High Plains and much of the eastern CONUS,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Near to below normal
temperatures are likely over most of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle
underneath predicted near to below normal 500-hPa heights, while above normal
temperatures are favored over parts of southwestern Alaska, due to forecast
low-level southerly flow.

Above normal precipitation is favored for much of the western CONUS eastward
to
the western Great Lakes region, near and ahead of the predicted mean trough
over the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Near to below normal precipitation is
favored over parts of the Central Plains and most of the eastern CONUS, under
forecast positive 500-hPa heights and supported by the dynamical forecast
tool.
Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of the northeastern CONUS,
ahead of a predicted trough over the eastern Great Lakes region. Above normal
precipitation is favored for the Rio Grande Valley, due to forecast southerly
moisture flow. Above normal precipitation is slightly favored across the
southern Alaska Panhandle, while near to below normal precipitation is most
likely over the remainder of Alaska, supported by the precipitation
consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and among
the temperature and precipitation tools, in addition to uncertainty due to a
changing pattern.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 21 - 27 2022

During the 8-14 day period, the circulation pattern over the North American
region is generally consistent with an evolution of the predicted pattern for
the 6-10 day period, with de-amplified anomalies and increased uncertainty. A
trough is predicted to de-amplify over the Gulf of Alaska and expand into the
northwestern CONUS, while the downstream weak ridge and trough are predicted
to
progress eastward over the eastern CONUS. The 500-hPa circulation pattern
indicates negative 500-hPa height anomalies over Alaska and near to above
normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over much of the CONUS.

Near to below normal temperatures are likely for much of the western CONUS and
parts of the Northern Plains, supported by the dynamical forecast tools. Near
to above normal temperatures are favored for the remainder of CONUS, due to
the
predicted above normal 500-hPa heights and supported by the consolidation
forecast tools. Elevated probabilities of near to below normal temperatures
are
forecast for much of Alaska, except parts of western Mainland Alaska where
above normal temperatures are likely, supported by the dynamical model
temperature tools.

Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the western CONUS eastward
to
the Great Plains and parts of the western Great Lakes region, due to several
predicted short wave systems affecting these regions during the period. Near
to
below normal precipitation is favored over most of the eastern CONUS,
underneath forecasted above normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal precipitation
is likely across parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, while near to below normal precipitation is favored for the
remainder of Alaska, supported by the precipitation consolidation forecast
tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
only fair agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and
among the temperature and precipitation tools, in addition to uncertainty due
to a changing pattern.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Major winter storm continues for parts of the Northern Plains
through Thursday...

...Isolated severe weather and flooding possible from New England
to the Gulf Coast...

...Chilly, sub-freezing, well below normal temperatures for the
Central and Northern Plains...

...Active period continues from the Rockies to the Pacific
Northwest as low elevation rain and mountain snow impact the
region...

A deep upper-level trough will rotate a potent surface low
pressure system through the eastern half of the country through
Friday. Tuesday's major winter storm will continue for the
Northern Plains, tapering off first in eastern Montana by
Wednesday evening and North Dakota through the day Thursday. A few
more inches of snow are possible, bringing storm total
accumulations to around 15-20 inches, with isolated higher
amounts. A Blizzard Warning remains in effect from eastern Montana
into western and central North Dakota, where the combination of
snow with strong/gusty winds will mean blizzard conditions are
likely with blowing or drifting snow and dangerously low
visibility. Travel will remain difficult to impossible. Snow
showers will also overspread portions of the Red River Valley from
eastern North Dakota into northern Minnesota Thursday, where
around a couple inches of snow is forecast.

Widespread showers and thunderstorms will persist within the warm
sector of the dynamic winter storm as a cold front continues
eastward Thursday and moves from the Midwest to the East Coast.
Isolated instances of severe weather and flash flooding are
possible. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk
(level 2/5) for severe thunderstorms for portions of the northern
Mid-Atlantic and southern New England Thursday as gusty winds are
possible with the strongest thunderstorms. There is also a
Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of heavy rain for portions of the
northern Mid-Atlantic as well as the Central Gulf Coast. Storms
along the cold front will likely move through quickly, but given
the potential for heavy downpours over saturated soils, isolated
instances of flooding may still be possible.

Behind the cold front, very chilly, below normal temperatures will
continue. Lows Thursday and Friday morning will be below freezing
for most of the Central and Northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
Freeze warnings are in effect for portions of northeastern Kansas
and northwestern Missouri. Highs on Thursday and Friday will be in
the 50s and 60s for the Central Plains and around freezing for the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Further south in the Southern
Plains, temperatures will moderate much more quickly as warmer air
returns northward, with highs in the 70s and 80s Thursday reaching
into the 90s for portions of western Texas on Friday. Dry and
windy conditions will continue in the lee of the Rockies across
portions of the Central and Southern High Plains Thursday. While
the wildfire risk will be lower compared to previous days, the
Storm Prediction Center has still highlighted an Elevated Risk for
fire weather.

A lingering stationary front across the Northern and Central
Rockies and through the northern Great Basin as well as a slow
moving Pacific storm system approaching the West Coast will drive
the chance for coastal rain and higher elevation/interior snow
showers through the forecast period (Friday evening). Any snow
accumulations should generally remain light outside of the
mountains. Heavier snow is forecast for the southern Cascades in
Oregon overnight Wednesday as well as in the northern Sierra
Nevada in California and Teton Range in Wyoming Thursday. Rainfall
should also remain relatively light, except for some higher totals
of over an inch possible along the coast of Northern California
through Thursday.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment..

Relatively low amplitude mean flow aloft should prevail over the
lower 48 through the weekend, in the wake of a departing deep
upper low working from the Great Lakes/Northeast to the Canadian
Maritimes. Guidance shows a gradually amplifying shortwave trough
and associated rain/snow focusing system progressing into and
through the West during the weekend onward to the north-central
U.S. by early next week.

However, the pattern over the lower 48 is then expected to
transition to more amplified flow, likely in part due to effect
from the upstream progression as a deep extratropical low to the
Aleutians of current west Pacific Typhoon Malakas. As such, an
amplified upper trough reaching the West Coast by Tuesday would
build downstream upper ridging to also allow potential to
dig/carve out a closed low over the Great Lakes/Midwest that is
expected to work in earnest into the Northeast by midweek.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of the 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and
ECMWF ensemble mean that offer a decently clustered overall
solution that is on the more amplified side of the full envelope
of guidance soltuions. Latest 12 UTC guidance is trending toward a
more common pattern amplitude evolution. This raises forecast
confidence to a degree, albeit with overall flow not quite as
amplified as the earlier derived WPC guidance blend, but more
amplified than the 00/06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The departing low pressure system north of the Great Lakes should
continue to produce some generally light to moderate precipitation
across the Great Lakes/Northeast as a secondary surface low lifts
off the coast. Moisture and instability interacting with a warm
front lifting through the South/Southeast this weekend and
approach of a cold front from the north should bring areas of
moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of those areas, but
for now with low confidence in exact placement of heaviest totals.
Farther west, a system forecast to reach the West by Saturday
should continue to focus rain/mountain snow over the central and
northern West Coast into the northern Rockies late this week into
the weekend. Moisture should spread east beyond the Rockies Sunday
onward as low pressure/fronts reach the central/eastern U.S.. At
least some precipitation across the northern tier may be in the
form of snow, again. Guidance is trending signifcantly upward the
precipitation potential/intensity over the East. This seems
especially evident over New England as the expected approach of
the aforementioned upper low may spawn deep surface cyclogenesis.
This will offer the potential for runoff issues outside of
northern areas in an emerging threat area for wrapping/windy
spring snows.

meanwhile, the central Rockies/High Plains could see a brief
period of strong winds around Sunday with system passage.
Upstream, expect another episode of precipitation from the Pacific
Northwest/northern California into the northern Rockies through
early next week, with some enhanced totals possible over favored
coastal/terrain areas. Precipitation potential may increase into
next midweek with approach of another amplified upper trough and
frontal progression.

The core of below normal temperatures across the northern Plains
and vicinity will likely persist into early next week, with
daytime highs generally 20-30F below normal, and moderating slowly
with time. Over the West, temperatures should moderate in between
systems as a period of upper ridging moves through. Saturday will
feature chilly readings over the northern half of the region
(minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) and closer to normal
temperatures farther south. As the upper ridge builds over the
region by the start of next week, northern locations should trend
toward normal and southern areas above normal. The Great Basin and
Southwest could see highs as warm as 10-15F above normal. The East
should stay near normal on Saturday, but the system potentially
reaching the Midwest/East early next week could draw some of the
chilly northern Plains air southward and eastward behind it, with
expanding coverage of minus 10-20F anomalies. The southern Plains
will see highs 10-15F above normal next weekend followed by a
cooling trend.

expanding coverage of minus 10-20F anomalies. The southern Plains
will see highs 10-15F above normal next weekend followed by a
cooling trend.

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 17 2022 - 12Z Thu Apr 21 2022

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment..

Compared to what has been a pretty amplified and active weather
pattern the past few days, relatively low amplitude mean flow
should continue through about Sunday or Monday across much of the
lower 48. This features shortwave energy through the Northeast,
with a possible closed low development over the Canadian
Maritimes, while a shortwave and associated surface low pressure
system moves over the northern tier. Chances are increasing that
this may bring another round of spring snow to parts of the
Northern Plains on Sunday into Monday. After this, the pattern is
expected to transition to a more amplified flow, as an upper
trough/closed low reaching the West Coast by Tuesday should act to
build a downstream ridge and amplify the northern tier shortwave
as it digs through the Great Lakes and Northeast by mid next week.
Meanwhile, as the Western U.S. trough energy progresses through
the Northwest, it could again face amplification in response to
yet another upper low/amplified trough towards the West Coast next
Wednesday-Thursday.

The latest 12z/18z (Apr 13) suite of guidance shows good agreement
on the large scale through day 4/Monday, with plenty of lingering
uncertainties in the details. A general deterministic model blend
however sufficed for this period and helped to smooth out those
differences. Amplification of the next system through the Northern
Plains into the Great Lakes is of course highly dependent on
uncertain details of the West Coast upper low/trough on Monday
into Tuesday. The notable outlier here is the UKMET which is
quicker to close off a low over the Northeast on Tuesday, and also
farther south. As such, it was not included in the blend tonight.
The GFS and GEFS mean both get fast with this energy on Wednesday
as it swings through the Canadian Maritimes. Timing and detail
differences become more apparent by next Tuesday as the West Coast
trough shifts inland. The GFS is faster with the energy, but the
ECMWF is quite a bit farther north, with the CMC forming a decent
middle ground solution. These differences continue into Wednesday
and Thursday too as the system slides across the Great Lakes.
However, for a day 6-7 forecast and given continued run to run
uncertainties, neither model presents a clear outlier. The blend
for the latter periods transitioned more towards the ensemble
means (ECENS mean and NAEFS) to account for the detail
differences, but also continued slight majority of the
deterministic GFS/ECMWF/CMC for added system definition.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moisture and instability interacting with a warm front lifting
through the South/Southeast this weekend and approach of a cold
front from the north should bring areas of moderate to locally
heavy rainfall to parts of those areas, but with lower confidence
in exact placement of heaviest totals. Farther north, a low
pressure system into the Northern Plains on Sunday may again bring
a round of accumulating spring snow to northern locations, with
rainfall farther south along the attendent cold front into the
Midwest. Moisture reaches the East early next week, with some
potential for enhanced rainfall along the Carolina coast as well
as precipitation (maybe some snow) north and west of a surface low
developing off the New England Coast. Some gusty winds are also
possible across the Northeast Tuesday into Wednesday. Out West,
expect another episode of precipitation from the Pacific
Northwest/northern California into the northern Rockies through
early next week, with some enhanced totals possible over favored
coastal/terrain areas. Precipitation potential may increase again
into next midweek with approach of another amplified upper trough
and frontal progression.

The core of below normal temperatures across the northern Plains
and vicinity will likely persist into early next week, with
daytime highs generally 20-30F below normal, and moderating slowly
with time. The system reaching the Midwest/East early next week
could draw some of the chilly northern Plains air southward and
eastward behind it, with expanding coverage of minus 10-20F
anomalies Sunday-Tuesday. Warm anomalies across the Southern
Plains and Southwest on Sunday should progress slowly north and
eastward as upper level ridging builds and moves through.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 AM CDT Thu Apr 14 2022

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
Largely zonal flow will continue across the western CONUS in the
wake of a de-amplifying mid-level low across the eastern US. Lee
troughing will gradually strengthen surface winds supporting
downslope flow from the central High Plains to southern NM. Dry
surface conditions and gusty winds will support Elevated fire
weather concerns for a few hours this afternoon.

...Southern High Plains...
Within the modified post-frontal airmass across the central US,
westerly flow will dominate the atmosphere in the absence of
stronger mid-level perturbations. Subtle lee troughing should
develop by mid morning, enhancing downslope flow across the
southern/central Plains. Very dry surface conditions are again
expected with RH values in the low single digits possible. Wind
fields will be relatively modest (less than 20 mph) owing to
relatively poor phasing of stronger flow aloft and the lack of
stronger surface troughing. However, the extremely dry conditions
and very dry fuels will likely still support widespread Elevated and
near-Critical conditions from eastern NM into portions of west TX.

Farther north across the central High Plains, low-level wind fields
will be somewhat stronger beneath the zonal flow aloft. Winds of
15-25 mph may support brief Critical conditions within 15-20% RH and
dry fuels. However, confidence in sustained Critical conditions is
lower within the cooler airmass where a limited duration of Critical
wind/RH conditions are expected.

0155 AM CDT Thu Apr 14 2022

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow across the southwestern and central US will persist, but
weaken Friday as mid-level heights rise ahead of a subtle mid-level
ridge. A weak lee low over the TX Panhandle will bolster low-level
southwesterly flow across portions of the southern High Plains ahead
of a cold front sliding south through Kansas. The dry and breezy
conditions will support a few hours of Elevated fire weather
potential across the southern High Plains Friday.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
Dry and breezy conditions should continue Friday with westerly
downslope flow across portions of eastern NM and west TX. Surface
winds are again expected to be relatively modest as flow aloft
weakens in response to the subtle sub-tropical ridge. Somewhat
stronger winds (15-20 mph) may develop within proximity to the weak
lee cyclone over the western TX Panhandle, but with relatively
limited duration. Warming surface temperatures and continued
downsloping will however support an extremely dry airmass with low
single digit RH values like across much of the southern High Plains.
Given the crisis state of fuels across much of the region, Elevated
to locally Critical conditions are expected for a few hours despite
the weak winds. The highest confidence in near-Critical conditions
is expected across parts of eastern NM where winds maybe somewhat
stronger (15-20+ mph) supporting a locally greater fire weather
threat.

...Major winter storm winds down over the Northern Plains today...

...Isolated severe weather and flooding possible for parts of the
Northeast today...

...Chilly, sub-freezing, well below normal temperatures for
northern tier states as East Coast and Deep South warm up...

...Active period continues from the Rockies to the Pacific
Northwest as low elevation rain and mountain snow impact the
region...

A deep upper-level trough will rotate a potent surface low
pressure system through the eastern half of the country through
Friday. Tuesday's major winter storm will begin tapering off in
North Dakota and Minnesota today. A few more inches of snow are
possible. Blizzard Warnings remains in effect from eastern Montana
into western and central North Dakota, where the combination of
snow and strong wind gusts will produce dangerously low
visibilities, with significant blowing and drifting of snow. Some
snow squalls are possible across portions of central Minnesota and
into northern Wisconsin this afternoon. Travel will remain very
hazardous today, with some additional power outages possible. Road
conditions should improve by Friday.

Showers and thunderstorms will persist within the warm sector of
this dynamic winter storm as a cold front continues to surge
eastward through the East Coast today. Isolated instances of
severe weather and flash flooding are possible. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) for severe
thunderstorms over portions of the I-95 corridor extending from
the Philadelphia metro area to western Massachusetts today. Gusty
winds and marginal hail are possible with the strongest
thunderstorms. Heavy rainfall may develop along the central Gulf
Coast this morning as the aforementioned cold front slowly through
the region.

Temperatures will continue to remain well below average for much
of the Northwest and Northern Plains, as frigid air settles in on
the backside of the departing winter storm this weekend. High
temperatures will be between 20-30 degrees below average for much
of the Northern Plains, as places struggle to make it above
freezing today and Friday. Much of the East Coast will experience
a second day of well above average temperatures before the cold
front sweeps through on Friday and moderates the airmass a bit.
Highs will be in the 70s and 80s across the eastern seaboard
today. The southern tier states will begin warming up again on
Friday as an approaching system pulls warm air into the region.

A meandering stationary front in the West and arriving low
pressure system will generate additional coastal/low elevation
rain showers as well as mountain snow for much of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies over the next couple of days. Parts
of the northern Sierra and Northern Rockies will pickup another
6-12 inches of snow by Saturday morning. Elevated fire weather
risks continue over portions of the Central/Southern Plains
through Friday.

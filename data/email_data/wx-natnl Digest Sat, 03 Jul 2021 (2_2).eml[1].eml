Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Sat Jul 03 2021 - 12Z Mon Jul 05 2021

...Excessive heat to continue across the Northwest and Northern
Plains...

...Locally heavy rain likely along a frontal boundary draped
across the Gulf Coast with monsoonal moisture likely across the
Southwest and southern High Plains...

...Slight risk for severe thunderstorms from northeast Colorado
into western Nebraska...

Excessive heat is expected to continue through the Holiday weekend
across the Northwest and Northern parts of the country. Saturday
should be the hottest, with daytime highs well into the 90s or low
100s for many from the northern Great Basin into the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest. A handful of daily record highs are
possible across these regions as well on Saturday. By Sunday and
Monday, the heat should subside somewhat, however temperatures are
still expected to be well above normal for some locations which
would only prolong the heat stress. Excessive heat warnings and
heat advisories remain in effect for parts of the Northwest and
eastern Montana.

Showers and thunderstorms are likely along a nearly stationary
frontal boundary which should settle along the Gulf Coast through
much of the period. Moderate to locally heavy to excessive
rainfall is possible from northern Florida to eastern Texas.
Farther west, monsoonal moisture will bring diurnally driven
showers and storms into parts of the Southwest and southern High
Plains each day. Again, there is a threat for moderate to locally
heavy rainfall and isolated flash flooding particularly for parts
of southern Arizona where WPC has a slight risk for excessive
rainfall on Saturday. Elsewhere, scattered showers and storms will
extend northward into the central High Plains and the Dakotas
along a slow moving warm front and ahead of a cold front dropping
into the Northern tier states. SPC highlights a small area from
northeast Colorado into Western Nebraska within a slight risk for
severe weather. Across the Northeast, unsettled weather will
continue as a surface low deepens offshore.

While the Northern and Western parts of the country continue to
bake, the remainder of the U.S. should be more comfortably near or
below normal through the weekend. The greatest below normal
anomalies should center across parts of the southern High Plains,
and especially the Northeast on Saturday where daytime highs 10 to
20 degrees below normal are possible with daily record low max
temps challenged. The southern and eastern states should warm up
by the Fourth of July holiday with much above normal temperatures
seeping into the Midwest/Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic states by
Monday.

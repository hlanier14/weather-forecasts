...Over 100 million Americans are under Winter Storm Warnings,
Winter Storm Watches, or Winter Weather Advisories as another
round of impactful winter weather tracks from the Southern Plains
to the East Coast...

...Developing winter storm to produce heavy snow and treacherous
ice accumulations from the South Central U.S. to Mid-Atlantic...

...Arctic air-mass to begin loosening its grip over the Heartland,
but more bitterly cold temperatures expected to continue...

...Showers and thunderstorms to track across the Southeast;
Pacific storm system ushers in valley/coastal rain and heavy
mountain snow to the Northwest...

A potent upper level trough tracking into the Southern Plains is
responsible for areas of snow and freezing rain enveloping much of
the South Central U.S. this morning. As the trough advances east,
so will the shield of snowfall as it extends from Arkansas and the
Mid-South to the central Appalachians with accumulations of 3 to 6
inches likely. Heavier amounts over 8 inches are possible in parts
of south-central Arkansas. Just south of the snow zone,
significant ice accumulations are expected from east Texas and the
Lower Mississippi Valley to the Virginia and North Carolina
Piedmont by Wednesday night. Ice accumulations of a quarter to a
half inch are forecast in parts of east Texas, northern Louisiana,
southern Arkansas, and western Mississippi with crippling totals
over a half inch also possible. The same range of ice
accumulations are anticipated in the North Carolina and Virginia
Piedmont Wednesday night into Thursday with even some localized
amounts as high as three-quarters of an inch. In the areas that
contend with these devastating ice accumulations, residents can
expect dangerous travel conditions, numerous power outages, and
extensive tree damage. Meanwhile, periods of moderate-to-heavy
snow will breakout across the northern Mid-Atlantic Thursday with
some locations switching over to sleet and/or freezing rain. Heavy
snow may work its way as far north as southern New England
Thursday afternoon and persist into Thursday night. While snowfall
totals are subject to how much sleet and freezing rain mixes in,
the sheer amount of wintry precipitation will cause treacherous
travel conditions and many travel delays. The heaviest snow totals
are likely to occur in the Appalachians of Virginia and West
Virginia where as much as a foot is possible.

The dangerous Arctic blast over the Nation's Heartland begins to
moderate in the coming days. While that means the number of record
cold maximum and minimum temperatures will not be as common (the
bulk of which occurring in the South Central U.S.), temperatures
themselves will still remain 20 to 35 degrees below normal
throughout the Plains, Mississippi Valley, and lower Great Lakes.
Morning lows in the single digits or below zero look to continue
both today and Thursday in parts of the Great Plains. Bitterly
cold temperatures have pushed east into the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast ahead of the impending winter storm that arrives
Thursday morning. High temperatures will struggle to eclipse the
freezing mark both today and Thursday in these regions. The
warmest location in the country is the state of Florida where
highs look to soar into the 80s on Thursday.

Elsewhere, within the warm sector of the impending winter storm
will be widespread showers and thunderstorms tracking across the
Southeast. Heavy rainfall is possible and some thunderstorms could
be severe, which has led to the issuance of a Slight Risk area
along the central Gulf Coast today and from the Florida Panhandle
to southern Georgia on Thursday. Out West, areas of mountain snow
across the Intermountain West will dissipate as high pressure over
the West Coast moves in Wednesday night. After a day of tranquil
weather on Wednesday, a Pacific storm system ushers in another
round of valley/coastal rain and mountain snow on Thursday.
Locally heavy rainfall is possible in far northwestern California
and far southwestern Oregon on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Cascades
are likely to receive another foot of snow from this system with
heavy snow working its way into the northern Rockies Thursday
night and continuing into Friday morning.

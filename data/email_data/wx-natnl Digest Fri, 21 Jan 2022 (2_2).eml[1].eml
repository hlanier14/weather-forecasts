...Significant icing across the coastal plains of the Carolinas
today and tonight; wintry weather this morning from southern Texas
to the western Gulf Coast...

...Arctic chill continues across much of the central and eastern
U.S....

...Light snow across the northern Plains will move toward the
upper Great Lakes as snow showers across central Rockies move
toward the southern Rockies...

An arctic air mass has settled into much of the central and
eastern U.S. where much below normal temperatures are expected to
prevail through the next couple of days.  Bitterly cold conditions
with subzero wind chills are expected across much of the Upper
Midwest and interior New England where Wind Chill Advisories are
in effect until early this morning.  Meanwhile, below freezing
daytime temperatures are forecast to be as far south as upstate
South Carolina today.  As the next upper level trough from the
central U.S. approaches the arctic front located just off the
southeast U.S., freezing rain and sleet are expected to develop
across the coastal plains of the Carolinas today and continue into
tonight, resulting in significant accumulations of up to a quarter
of an inch possible.  These locations are most at risk of downed
trees and power lines.  Farther north into eastern North Carolina
into southeastern Virginia, snow and some ice are expected to
result in a few inches of wintry precipitation accumulation before
the system moves out to sea Saturday morning.

Meanwhile, southwesterly flow aloft overrunning the arctic air
mass in the South will generate icy precipitation from South Texas
and the central Gulf Coast to the Carolinas.  Ice accumulations of
a tenth of an inch and under an inch of snow are possible in South
Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast this morning before the system
shifts farther out into the Gulf of Mexico later today.

Elsewhere, an upper level disturbance tracking south through the
Intermountain West into the Great Basin will be relatively
moisture starved, limiting snowfall to the higher elevations of
the Rockies with totals surpassing 6" most likely in the highest
peaks. Some light rain and snow showers are possible in the
Pacific Northwest early on this evening before drying out as high
pressure build in for Friday. The aforementioned upper trough
becomes a cut-off low in the Desert Southwest on Saturday, keeping
any rain and snow shower activity confined to primarily Arizona
and New Mexico. Lastly, farther north, a fast moving frontal
system will trigger snow showers throughout the upper Great Lakes
on Saturday with light snow accumulations expected. Another wave
of low pressure follows on its heels as it tracks into the Dakotas
Saturday evening with more snow showers for the North Central U.S..

Great Lakes on Saturday with light snow accumulations expected.
Another wave of low pressure follows on its heels across the
Dakotas Saturday evening will bring more snow showers across the
northern Plains reaching the lower Great Lakes by Sunday morning.

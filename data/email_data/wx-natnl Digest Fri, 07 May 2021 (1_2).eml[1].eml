Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1123 AM CDT Thu May 06 2021

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

Surface observations from central North Dakota into the Red River
Valley indicate areas of near-elevated conditions ongoing.
Temperatures are already slightly warmer than RAP/HRRR have
suggested. Locally critical conditions do appear possible,
particularly just east of the Missouri River where cloud cover will
remain more limited and a pocket of drier low-level air looks to
advect in from Saskatchewan. The elevated area has been marginally
expanded to better capture the expected conditions this afternoon.

The rest of the forecast remains unchanged. See the previous
discussion for greater details.

..Wendt.. 05/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Thu May 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
Across the CONUS, broad troughing will continue in the Northeast as
the mid-level flow pattern gradually becomes more amplified. A ridge
of high pressure over the Rockies will intensify, while a shortwave
trough is forecast to move onshore across California. At the
surface, a cold front will push east through the western Great Basin
while high pressure becomes established over the central Plains.

...Red River Valley/Northern Plains...
A belt of strong mid-level flow is expected to develop over the
region on the backside of the broad trough across the northeastern
US. A weak front will move south out of Canada through the day,
bringing dry and breezy conditions to the northern Plains and upper
Midwest. North winds of 10-20 mph and surface humidity of 20-30%
will support elevated fire weather conditions.

...Great Basin and Southwest...
Ahead of the shortwave trough and cold front across the western
Great Basin, gusty southerly winds are expected to increase early in
the day. Warm temperatures in the 70s to 80s F will support deep
mixing and low surface humidity of 10-15%. Locally elevated fire
weather conditions appear possible given the favorable
meteorological overlap. However, the lack of robust fuels cast doubt
on how widespread favorable fire weather conditions may become.

Mid-level moisture ahead of the cold front will also support
isolated showers/thunderstorms from the Great Basin southeastward
into the portions of the Southwest. Dry surface conditions will
limit any precipitation from storms that do develop during the day
supporting low-end dry thunderstorm potential.

...Heavy rain possible for parts of the Ohio Valley, Mid-South,
and Southeast next week...

...Chilly temperatures for the western High Plains with some snow
for the Rockies...

...Overview...

A split-flow and increasingly progressive/zonal upper level
pattern is expected across the lower 48 and southern Canada next
week, anchored by upper ridging over the northeastern Pacific and
across the northwestern Caribbean. Embedded shortwave impulses in
the southern stream will provide a focus for multiple rounds of
showers and storms over the southeastern 1/3rd of the CONUS.
Farther north, a broad trough over the Intermountain West and
northern Rockies coupled with a large Canadian surface high
sinking southward across the north-central states will result in
below normal temperatures from the Rockies to the East Coast.  A
moderation trend may commence by the middle of next week across
the West as an upper level ridge tries to build back in.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the models and ensembles remained in
good agreement overall through the early part of next week. The
largest difference remained how quickly (or not) to take the
trough over the Rockies Mon-Tue eastward. The GFS/GEFS were
generally slower than the ECMWF/ECMWF ensembles, but enough
overlap existed between the two ensemble systems that made a
blended solution preferable yet again. Overall pattern evolution
that will be trending towards more zonal flow suggests that the
quicker solutions may be more correct, but if anything the ECMWF
ensembles have been trending a bit slower the past couple days.
Over the East/Northeast, trend has been for a bit slower pace of
the low pressure along a frontal boundary, and a 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF
blend sufficed.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The highest rainfall prospects will likely be from the Ohio Valley
to the central Appalachians and over the Mid-South on Sunday,
associated with an area of low pressure and cold front tracking
eastward across the region.  The potential exists for 1 to 3
inches of rain from along the Ohio River southward, potentially
aided by convection. Another zone of heavy rain is also probable
across portions of the lower Mississippi Valley/Deep South next
Tuesday and Wednesday. With marginally cold temperatures over the
Rockies, accumulating snow is likely for the higher terrain of
Colorado and Wyoming while a cold rain may fall in lower
elevations. Dry conditions should persist across most of the
Intermountain West and the Desert Southwest.

Temperatures will likely be more reminiscent of March across the
central/western High Plains and adjacent portions of the northern
Rockies for the Sunday to Tuesday time period, with highs up to 20
degrees below early May averages. This equates to readings maxing
out in the mid 40s to mid 50s for many of those areas, and even
colder across the central and northern Rockies. Some of these
cooler temperatures should also be realized across Great Lakes and
Northeast U.S. courtesy of the upper trough and Canadian surface
high in place, though only about 5-15 degrees below normal. By the
middle of next week, above normal temperatures are likely to make
a return to the West Coast region where 90s to low 100s may again
be possible over the lower deserts of AZ/CA/NV.

300 PM EDT May 06 2021

SYNOPSIS: While no temperature related hazards are designated, above (below=
)
normal temperatures are anticipated over the western (southeastern) contigu=
ous
U.S early in week-2. By the middle of the period, there is good model
agreement
that the development of surface low pressure and return flow will increase =
the
potential for heavy precipitation and high winds across many parts of the
Great

ed
to bring above normal precipitation over portions of the southern Mainland
early in the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Central and South=
ern
Plains, and the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Sun-Wed, May 16-19.

Slight risk of high winds across portions of the Central and Southern High

dHebKSv4MOe$

FOR FRIDAY MAY 14 - THURSDAY MAY 20: A transient mid-level pattern appears =
to
be on tap across much of the CONUS during week-2.  By the start of the peri=
od,
both the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensemble mean 500-hPa height anomaly forecast=
s
favor the progression of a shortwave trough shifting east from the Ohio Val=
ley
to the Northeast, with upstream anomalous ridging centered over the western
U.S. Anomalously warm (cold) temperatures are forecast throughout much of t=
he
western (southeastern) CONUS early in the period, however, these temperatur=
es
are not anticipated to exceed hazard thresholds for mid-May. The mid-level
pattern is favored to deamplify, as both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles means
show anomalous troughing developing across the western U.S. by day 10 (May
16).
This mid-level transition is expected to result in surface low pressure
development predominately west of the Mississippi and promote a favorable
pattern for periods of above-normal, and possible heavy precipitation and h=
igh
winds across the Plains and Mississippi Valley by the middle of the period.
Compared to the GEFS, the ECMWF is slightly more robust with the developmen=
t
of
anomalous troughing centered over the northwestern CONUS which also looks t=
o
persist through the end of the outlook period.



A stationary front over the southcentral U.S., which has been the main culp=
rit
for hazard potential since earlier this week, is favored to dissipate by th=
e
outset of week-2, as surface high pressure shifts east allowing for a perio=
d
of
moist, low-level return flow across much of the central U.S. There is good
agreement in the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means depicting increased daily
precipitation amounts tied to deepening surface low pressure lee of the
Rockies
by day 10 (May 16), where reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance t=
hat
3-day rainfall accumulations exceed the 85th percentile and 1 inch over the
Central and Southern Plains and the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley.
Therefore, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is highlighted for the regi=
on
from May 16 to May 19. Given the strengthening pressure gradients favored b=
y
the GEFS and ECMWF to enhance the lower-level jet across the Plains, a slig=
ht
risk of high winds is also added over the region (May 15 to May 18), where
there is support in the ECMWF reforecast tool that sustained winds will exc=
eed
the 90th percentile. The continued wet outlook is likely to further reduce
drought coverage across the portions of Texas, however, any locally heavy
rainfall may trigger localized flooding in eastern Texas and into the Lower
Mississippi Valley, where there are saturated soils due to recent heavy
rainfall and above-normal precipitation is forecast during week-1. In
addition,
any gusty winds west of the dry line over the drought affected regions of t=
he
southern High Plains would likely enhance fire danger and blowing dust.



Over Alaska, anomalous mid-level troughing forecast over the Aleutians is
likely to bring enhanced onshore flow over parts of the southern Mainland.
Although reforecast guidance shows 3-day amounts over the southwestern
Mainland
exceeding the 85th percentile, these amounts are not likely to exceed hazar=
d
thresholds and no corresponding hazards are issued. Above-normal temperatur=
es
also remain favored over much of the State during week-2, and dynamical mod=
els
have not deviated much with this likelihood during the last few days. It is
anticipated that any sharp rise in the temperature outlook would adversely
affect the ongoing river ice break-up season, where many rivers are opening=
 up
and have been largely free of ice jams to induce flooding.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu May 06 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 12 - 16 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian dynamical models are in good agreement in
regards
to the 6-10 day 500-hPa geopotential height pattern over North America.
Troughing is predicted west of Alaska. Across the western CONUS, the mid-le=
vel
flow is forecast to become more zonal, with ridging predicted over the
Northeast Pacific, extending northward through much of Alaska. Todays manua=
l
500-hPa height blend depicts near to above normal heights across much of th=
e
western CONUS, with weak negative anomalies across extreme northern Montana=
.
Below normal heights are favored from the Great Plains eastward to the
Atlantic
Coast, with negative anomalies diminishing to near normal southward toward =
the
Gulf Coast. Above normal heights are depicted across much of Alaska, except
over parts of the western Aleutians, where below normal heights are favored
underneath troughing forecast over the Bering Sea.

Increased probabilities for below normal temperatures are highlighted acros=
s
much of the eastern CONUS, as a low pressure system is forecast to traverse
the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic with northerly surface flow ushering in cooler a=
ir
on its west side. Probabilities for above normal temperatures are increased
over the southern Florida Peninsula, ahead of the associated mean frontal
boundary. Above normal temperatures are favored mainly west of the Continen=
tal
Divide, underneath positive mid-level height anomalies extending southeastw=
ard
from the Northeast Pacific ridge. Near to above normal temperatures are
favored
across Alaska underneath increased ridging and enhanced southerly surface a=
nd
mid-level flow ahead of a mean trough over the Bering Sea.

Above normal precipitation is favored along the East Coast, associated with
the
low pressure system that is expected to move across the Southeast before
amplifying off the coast of the Carolinas and moving northeastward. Increas=
ed
odds of above normal precipitation in southern Texas are mainly associated
with
increased return flow from the Gulf of Mexico later in the 6-10 day period,=
 as
high pressure shifts farther eastward. Below normal precipitation
probabilities
are favored in the western CONUS, extending into the Central and Southern
Plains, underneath positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Over southern Alaska,=
 an
active storm track is favored on the northern periphery of the mean Pacific
ridging, indicating increased odds of above normal precipitation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement in the model mid-level height forecast, offset by differences amo=
ng
the forecast tools in the predicted temperature and precipitation fields,
particularly across the Northern Tier states and the Great Lakes.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 14 - 20 2021

The predicted 500-hPa height pattern during the Week-2 period depicts mean
mid-level troughing across the eastern and western CONUS, with relative
mid-level ridging over the central CONUS. This favors weakly below normal
mid-level heights over the West, extending to the Northern Plains, and over
the
Northeast. Height anomalies lean toward positive elsewhere over the CONUS.
Over
Alaska, 500-hPa heights are also favored to be near normal, with negative
height anomalies predicted for the Southwest Mainland, associated with mean
troughing over the Bering Sea, and weak positive anomalies elsewhere over t=
he
state.

Below normal temperature probabilities are increased across much of the
eastern
third of the CONUS, with mean northerly surface flow favored early and late=
 in
the Week-2 period, despite a brief warmup during the middle of the period. =
As
high pressure shifts eastward throughout the period, return flow from the G=
ulf
of Mexico on its western periphery favors increased probabilities of above
normal temperatures for the southwestern CONUS and portions of the Southern
and
Central Plains. Increased mean mid-level troughing and associated northerly
surface flow, relative to yesterday's Week-2 forecast, tilts odds toward be=
low
normal temperatures along the West Coast. Below normal temperature odds ext=
end
eastward along the Canadian border to Montana. Mean southerly to southweste=
rly
flow favors above normal temperatures across much of Alaska.

Odds tilt toward below normal precipitation in the Southeast, associated wi=
th
mean surface high pressure during the Week-2 period. In the Northeast, a
strong
coastal low early in the period, and the potential for additional frontal
rainfall later in the period increase the potential for above normal
precipitation. Above normal precipitation is weakly favored in the southern
Florida Peninsula, along a mean frontal boundary to the south of the mean
surface high pressure over the Southeast. Increased odds of above normal

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0209 PM CDT Thu May 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

An elevated area has been added to eastern Montana into western
North Dakota. Surface observations from Thursday afternoon indicate
dry air across much of North Dakota. This airmass is then expected
to return northwestward as a cyclone develops in the vicinity of the
Big Horns. All this suggests that the warmer/drier guidance should
receive more weight in the forecast. RAP/HRRR guidance may be too
warm tomorrow, but mid 60s F temperatures do seem reasonable. With
dewpoints near 20 F, RH of 20-25% is probable enough for highlights
given high confidence in 15-20 mph winds. Ongoing extreme drought
has kept fuels cured and green up minimal.

The forecast in the Southwest remains on track. See the previous
discussion for greater detail.

..Wendt.. 05/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Thu May 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, meridional flow will become more amplified
through the period as the shortwave ridging over the central US
shifts to the east. At the surface, high pressure will strengthen
over the Midwest and northern Plains while a cold front, associated
with a western US trough, moves eastward toward the Rockies.
Elevated fire weather conditions are likely ahead of this front
across the Southwest.

...Western New Mexico, eastern Arizona, and the Four Corners....
As stronger mid-level southwesterlies overspread the region ahead of
the shortwave trough, low-level flow is forecast to increase
markedly. Deep vertical mixing and momentum transport will bolster
low-level winds to 15-25 mph by the afternoon. Warm temperatures and
humidity as low as 8-10% overlapping with the strong winds will be
supportive of widespread elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions from New Mexico toward the Western Slope.

To the east of the elevated area across the higher terrain of
central New Mexico, isolated thunderstorms are forecast to
developing during the day. Model soundings indicate PWATS between
0.45 and 0.75 inches, as well as mostly dry low-level profiles. A
few cloud to ground lightning strikes appear possible with some
potential for starts and holdovers despite wetter than average fuel
conditions.

340 PM EDT Thu May 06 2021

Valid 00Z Fri May 07 2021 - 00Z Sun May 09 2021

...Unsettled weather will shift into the Northern High Plains by
Friday...

...Scattered showers and thunderstorms found across the Lower
Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic through the beginning
of the weekend...

...Warm temperatures in the West will spread into the Rockies and
High Plains on Friday as cooler temperatures remain throughout the
East...

A lingering cold across Florida will be the focus for scattered
shower and thunderstorm activity through late Thursday/early
Friday morning before pushing offshore. A separate low pressure
system tracking through the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys will
produce showers and thunderstorms and the Storm Prediction Center
has a Slight Risk area near the Missouri Boot Hill and western
Kentucky/Tennessee. This same system is expected to reach the
Mid-Atlantic region Friday, ushering in additional rain and
isolated thunderstorms. Cooler temperatures will arrive to much of
the eastern U.S. once the front passes through- daily maximums
will largely be in the 50s and 60s from the Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. This equates to
temperatures around 10 to 20 degrees below average.

Across the western U.S. a cold front will advance inland toward
the Great Basin tonight, spreading light rain and higher elevation
snow along its path. Precipitation is then forecast to reach the
Northern Rockies and Northern High Plains by Friday while an
upper-level low drops southeastward into the region. As colder air
aloft filters into the Northern Rockies, snow could potentially
mix into the lower elevations of western Montana on Friday night.
Much of the Desert Southwest and Central Great Basin will persist
in being warmer and drier through the weekend. Well-above seasonal
average temperatures are expected, with a few locations possibly
reaching triple digits. Above average temperatures will also be
felt throughout much of the central and southern Rockies/High
Plains as well.

...Heavy rain possible for parts of the Ohio Valley, Mid-South,
and Southeast next week...

...Chilly temperatures for the western High Plains with some snow
for the Rockies...

...Overview...

A split-flow and increasingly progressive/zonal upper level
pattern is expected across the lower 48 and southern Canada next
week, anchored by upper ridging over the northeastern Pacific and
across the northwestern Caribbean. Embedded shortwave impulses in
the southern stream will provide a focus for multiple rounds of
showers and storms over the southeastern 1/3rd of the CONUS.
Farther north, a broad trough over the Intermountain West and
northern Rockies coupled with a large Canadian surface high
sinking southward across the north-central states will result in
below normal temperatures from the Rockies to the East Coast.  A
moderation trend may commence by the middle of next week across
the West as an upper level ridge tries to build back in.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the models and ensembles remained in
good agreement overall through the early part of next week. The
largest difference remained how quickly (or not) to take the
trough over the Rockies Mon-Tue eastward. The GFS/GEFS were
generally slower than the ECMWF/ECMWF ensembles, but enough
overlap existed between the two ensemble systems that made a
blended solution preferable yet again. Overall pattern evolution
that will be trending towards more zonal flow suggests that the
quicker solutions may be more correct, but if anything the ECMWF
ensembles have been trending a bit slower the past couple days.
Over the East/Northeast, trend has been for a bit slower pace of
the low pressure along a frontal boundary, and a 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF
blend sufficed.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The highest rainfall prospects will likely be from the Ohio Valley
to the central Appalachians and over the Mid-South on Sunday,
associated with an area of low pressure and cold front tracking
eastward across the region.  The potential exists for 1 to 3
inches of rain from along the Ohio River southward, potentially
aided by convection. Another zone of heavy rain is also probable
across portions of the lower Mississippi Valley/Deep South next
Tuesday and Wednesday. With marginally cold temperatures over the
Rockies, accumulating snow is likely for the higher terrain of
Colorado and Wyoming while a cold rain may fall in lower
elevations. Dry conditions should persist across most of the
Intermountain West and the Desert Southwest.

Temperatures will likely be more reminiscent of March across the
central/western High Plains and adjacent portions of the northern
Rockies for the Sunday to Tuesday time period, with highs up to 20
degrees below early May averages. This equates to readings maxing
out in the mid 40s to mid 50s for many of those areas, and even
colder across the central and northern Rockies. Some of these
cooler temperatures should also be realized across Great Lakes and
Northeast U.S. courtesy of the upper trough and Canadian surface
high in place, though only about 5-15 degrees below normal. By the
middle of next week, above normal temperatures are likely to make
a return to the West Coast region where 90s to low 100s may again
be possible over the lower deserts of AZ/CA/NV.

...Heavy rain possible over parts of the South early-mid week...

...Well below normal temperatures over the central High Plains
with some snow in the central Rockies early next week...

...Overview...

Between mean ridging aloft expected to prevail over the
northeastern Pacific and northwestern Caribbean, a blocky pattern
that develops over the western U.S./Canada during the weekend
should become more progressive next week.  Early next week an
upper trough emerging from the West combined with low level
upslope flow will produce chilly temperatures and enhanced
rain/higher elevation snow over the central Rockies/High Plains.
Southern stream energy and then this upper trough will interact
with a front that settles along the Gulf Coast for a time,
bringing the potential for heavy rain/thunderstorms over areas
from the southern Plains into the Southeast.  Other parts of the
East may see meaningful precipitation as well.  The West should
see a warming trend as an upper ridge moves into/across the
region.  By Friday a modest upper trough nearing/reaching the West
Coast may reverse that trend over the Northwest.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Overall the 12Z ECMWF/GFS/UKMET provided the best guidance cluster
early in the period, followed by a transition toward emphasis on
the ECMWF and 12Z NAEFS/ECMWF means.  The forecast maintained a
small minority of 12Z GFS input late in the period for its
relative agreement over the East but not enough to influence the
forecast over the West where it compared more poorly to the
majority of guidance.

Guidance has been having some difficulty resolving the specifics
of waviness expected to affect the Northeast early next week, with
even a consensus blend waffling somewhat from cycle to cycle for
position and structure.  Behind this system, the upper trough
emerging from the West was slowest in the 18Z GFS/GEFS mean.  The
evolution toward a more progressive pattern may not favor the slow
side of the envelope, though the ECMWF mean has trended a bit
slower over the past couple days.  The new 00Z GFS has nudged a
little faster to provide a better comparison than the 18Z version.
 Majority cluster of recent ECMWF runs, ECMWF/CMC means, and some
GFS runs would have this trough supporting surface development
near the Mid-Atlantic coast by early day 7 Friday.  The 12Z CMC
was very out of phase with important features but the new 00Z run
also shows this wave.  Finally, multiple GFS runs become more
progressive than most other guidance with flow from the North
Pacific into North America.  As a result the 12Z/18Z GFS runs were
much less eager to develop an upper trough near the West Coast by
next Friday.  The new 00Z run shows a shortwave but still may be
underdone with the reflection of a compact upper low that travels
from near the eastern Aleutians eastward/southeastward.  The new
00Z ECMWF has added a new wrinkle in the forecast by trending
slower than model/ensemble consensus as the trough approaches the
Northwest.  By late in the period the Canadian ensemble
contribution to the NAEFS provided a more compatible companion to
the ECMWF/ECMWF mean for both the West Coast trough and the system
forecast near the East Coast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Early next week expect a period of enhanced precipitation over the
central Rockies/High Plains from the combination of the upper
trough over the West and strong Plains high pressure leading to
low level upslope flow.  Accumulating snow is likely in the higher
terrain of Colorado and Wyoming while cold rain should fall in
lower elevations.  Otherwise much of the West should be fairly dry
through the period.

Moisture and southern stream shortwave energy along a front
settling toward the Gulf Coast may already support some areas of
moderate to heavy rainfall across the South to start the week.
Then the progression of the western upper trough may produce some
waviness along the front and intensify rainfall from parts of the
southern Plains through the Southeast.  Some areas across the
southern tier may be sensitive to this additional rainfall in
light of significant totals received over the past week, though at
least late this week into the weekend should be fairly dry over
the South.  Some of the southern tier moisture may extend farther
northward over the eastern U.S. mid-late week as potential low
pressure develops.

During Monday-Tuesday the temperatures over the central portions
of the High Plains/eastern slopes of the Rockies should be more
reminiscent of March, with highs up to 20-25F below early May
averages.  This region will see a steady warming trend after
Tuesday, possibly to the point of seeing highs 5-10F above normal
by next Friday.  Much of the central and eastern U.S. should see
multiple days with highs 5-15F below normal due to the influence
of an upper trough over the northeastern quadrant of the lower 48
during the first half of the week and Canadian high pressure
reaching areas to the east of the Rockies.  Meanwhile above
average temperatures will expand across the West as an upper ridge
progresses into and across the region.  The best potential of plus
10-20F anomalies for highs will be from parts of California and
Oregon into the Great Basin.  The Pacific Northwest may see a
cooling trend late next week with the arrival of an upper trough.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 AM CDT Fri May 07 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
An amplified upper-air pattern will persist across the today. A deep
upper trough over the eastern CONUS will shift slowly eastward
today. Likewise, an upper trough will move eastward across the
Pacific Northwest, as an downstream ridge shifts eastward over the
Plains. A surface ridge will build into portions of the Northwest
and Great Basin, as a surface low moves into the northern High
Plains and a lee trough develops southward into the southern High
Plains.

...Eastern AZ/UT into Western NM/CO...
Increasing low-level flow amidst a very warm/dry airmass will result
in elevated to locally critical conditions from northern/eastern AZ
into eastern UT and western NM/CO. Surface winds are expected to
increase to 15-25 mph during the afternoon as RH drops into the
8-15% range. Some dry thunderstorm activity cannot be ruled out from
western into central NM, though uncertainty regarding coverage and
fuel receptivity precludes adding an isolated dry thunderstorm
delineation at this time.

...Eastern MT into Western ND...
Relatively dry and breezy conditions to the north/northeast of a
developing surface low across WY will result in a threat of elevated
to locally critical conditions from eastern MT into western ND.
Given the very dry airmass observed over the region on Thursday,
greater weight was given to the drier guidance, which suggests the
potential for surface winds of 15-20 mph concurrent with minimum RH
values of 15-25%. There remains some uncertainty as to how far east
the stronger winds will develop across ND, but have expanded the
Elevated area somewhat eastward given ongoing extreme drought across
the area.

...FL/GA into the Carolinas...
Dry northwesterly flow is forecast to develop in the wake of a cold
front from FL/GA into portions of the Carolinas today. Sustained
winds of 15-18 mph across the Carolinas and 12-15 mph southward into
FL, combined with anomalously dry conditions (RH potentially
dropping below 30% across much of the region), will result in
elevated to locally critical meteorological conditions this
afternoon. Fuel conditions likely vary quite a bit across the region
due to recent rainfall and differing levels of long-term
precipitation/drought, but due to the unseasonably dry airmass and
potential for winds to approach critical criteria, have opted to
include an Elevated delineation for this region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1034 AM CDT Sun May 01 2022

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN ARIZONA INTO NEW
MEXICO...

Critical fire weather conditions remain likely for much of northern
AZ and western to central NM. Mid-morning RH values are already
falling under 15% across most of the region, and will see further
reduction through mid afternoon. Uncertainty regarding the position
of the dryline (and the eastward extent of the fire weather threat)
has diminished somewhat with most guidance coming into better
agreement over the past 12 hours. The eastern extent of the Critical
risk area currently delineates where confidence is highest in the
afternoon dryline position, though deviations to the east/west are
possible.

The dryline position will also denote the western extent of
thunderstorm potential later this afternoon and evening. Forecast
soundings along and just east of the dryline show sufficient
low-level moisture to support convection, but reveal a deep,
well-mixed boundary layer that may support limited rainfall at the
surface with initial thunderstorms. Rainfall rates will increase as
storms intensify and move east towards the TX border, but a narrow
corridor of dry-thunderstorm potential may emerge across the eastern
Plains of NM. Critically dry fuels already in place will support the
potential for lightning starts, warranting the isolated
dry-thunderstorm risk area. Thunderstorms developing across this
region may also pose a hail/wind risk (see the latest Day 1
Convective Outlook for additional details).

..Moore.. 05/01/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0125 AM CDT Sun May 01 2022/

...Synopsis...
A potent shortwave trough will move through the Great Basin and into
the Southwest today. At the surface, a dryline will set up in
eastern New Mexico with a Pacific cold front moving through the
Great Basin. Fire weather concerns will be focused between these
boundaries.

...Southwest and southern/eastern Great Basin...
Regional soundings from Saturday evening show very dry air at low
levels. With poor overnight RH recovery expected, Elevated to
Critical conditions will likely being relatively early in the day.
Strong winds will develop in response to the deepening surface low
in the Colorado Plateau as well as increasing mid-level winds. RH by
afternoon will generally fall to 5-15%, with some locations seeing
closer to 20%. The strongest winds will occur north of the Mogollon
Rim into eastern Utah and western Colorado due to their position
beneath the mid-level jet. Here, 25-35 mph winds with higher gusts
are expected. Extremely Critical meteorological conditions are
possible north of the Rim, though low fuel loading should mitigate
large fire potential. Winds of 20-25 mph are probable into much of
New Mexico. Farther south and west, winds are generally expected to
be lighter at 15-20 mph, though briefly Critical conditions may
still occur.

The primary uncertainty in this forecast will be how far east fire
weather concerns will extend onto the plains of eastern New Mexico.
Dryline position varies within guidance. Given this uncertainty, no
adjustments will be made to highlights. However, these highlights
may need to be adjusted westward as the dryline position becomes
more observationally clear.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 PM CDT Sun May 01 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed
based on trends in latest hi-res guidance. Critical conditions
remain likely across the TX Panhandle, and possibly into far western
OK behind the dryline, but latest guidance continues to show high
probability for wetting rainfall along the I-40 corridor over the
next 12-24 hours. Critical highlights may need to be extended east
into TX/OK if rainfall is less than currently expected. See the
previous discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 05/01/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0127 AM CDT Sun May 01 2022/

...Synopsis...
On Monday, the Southwest and southern High Plains will be in between
shortwave troughs. Mid-level winds will be relaxed to some degree.
However, a strong surface low is expected to develop in eastern
Colorado and migrate southeastward during the day. This feature
should drive strong surface winds across New Mexico. Farther west,
the next shortwave trough will move into the Great Basin. A surface
trough in Utah will also aid in strong surface winds impacting
southern Nevada.

...New Mexico and adjacent southern High Plains...
Critical fire weather is most likely to occur across parts of New
Mexico. Winds of 20-25 mph will coincide with 5-15% RH during the
afternoon. Critical meteorological conditions will probably extend
into the Texas Panhandle/South Plains as well. However, these areas
are expected to receive precipitation on Sunday. Given this
uncertainty, Critical highlights will be withheld in these areas.
Another uncertainty is the southward progression of a cold front in
the High Plains. This may limit the duration of fire weather
concerns as well.

...Southern Nevada...
Area fuels have become critically dry recently. Strong
southerly/southwesterly winds are probable during the afternoon as
the surface trough deepens in Utah. Mid-level winds will also be
strengthened as the trough approaches from the west. Surface winds
of 15-20 mph will overlap 15-20% RH. Elevated fire weather
conditions are expected.

Extended Forecast Discussion

240 PM EDT Sun May 01 2022

Valid 12Z Wed May 04 2022 - 12Z Sun May 08 2022

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progression of a closed upper low
tracking out of the West into the Plains and eastward, with the
GFS/GEFS mean (including the new 12z runs today) still on the fast
side compared to the better clustered and slower 00/12 UTC
solutions of the ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF ensemble mean. The
WPC forecast continues to lean towards the slower side of the
forecast envelope, given continuity, but also the general nature
of a separated southern stream flow with these embedded closed
systems. By late period, some larger scale differences begin to
emerge between the CMC and ECMWF with the EC wanting to maintain a
stronger/closed low while the CMC opens up into general amplified
troughing along the East Coast. Felt leaning towards the ensemble
means by next weekend helped mitigate these variances. This
general combination also worked well for the rest of the country
and maintains good WPC continuity. Out West, there is a general
theme of a leading shortwave reaching the coast Thursday and then
another arriving around Saturday. Models/ensembles continue to
vary on amplitude and timing for the later troughing, though the
most notable outlier continues to be the CMC which features a
faster and much weaker/less amplified progression of the Saturday
wave into the West, with a faster system upstream dropping out of
the Gulf of Alaska by Sunday compared to the ECMWF and GFS and the
ensembles.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Threat Highlights...

An active spring pattern continues across much of the lower 48
states this week. A leading system into the Northeast should focus
some moderate rains on Wednesday, with cooling post-frontal
Canadian high pressure settling in the wake of the main low.
Meanwhile, a closed upper low forecast to track through the
central Rockies midweek and associated surface system development
will spread rain and higher elevation snow across the
northern-central Rockies and High Plains, with some locally
terrain enhanced totals. This system will then emerge over the
Plains and present a potentially heavy rainfall threat, with the
WPC experimental Excessive Rainfall Outlook still showing a Slight
Risk over/near parts of the south-central Plains Wednesday into
Thursday. The threat signal is stronger than average as the
southern stream closed upper system and upper
diffluence/instability combine with increasing inflow of Gulf
moisture into a wavy front. The Storm Prediction Center is also
monitoring severe threats for this area Wednesday-Thursday.
Organized rain should translate generally eastward through the
rest of the week with low/frontal system progression that will
focus some widespread moderate to heavy amounts. The most likely
axis of highest rainfall totals extends from the mid-lower MS and
OH Valleys through the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic given
expected upper low/trough and surface system track and trailing
cold front.

Upstream, a moderately amplified upper trough and surface frontal
system forecast to reach the West Coast and progress inland
Thursday into next weekend should bring a renewed precipitation
focus into the Pacific Northwest and then farther eastward. The
southern extent of precipitation will depend on the upper trough's
precise amplitude which has been quite uncertain recently in
guidance, but latest trends suggest that most moisture should be
confined to the northern half of the West. The upper
dynamics/surface front could reach far enough east to start
producing at least scattered rainfall over the northern High
Plains by next weekend. Expect renewed potential again by next
weekend to progress into and across the West with another frontal
surge as unsettling upper trough energies earnestly dig into the
region.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 01 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...A low pressure system is bringing areas of heavy rain and a
slight chance of severe thunderstorms across the Mid-Atlantic
through Monday morning...

...Another low pressure system is forecast to bring heavy rain, a
slight chance of flash flooding, and an enhanced risk of severe
thunderstorms across portions of the central Plains toward the
mid-Mississippi Valley on Monday...

...Still another low pressure system is forecast to bring
high-elevation snow into the northern Rockies on Tuesday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southwest and southern Rockies...

A parade of low pressure system is forecast to march across the
country from coast to coast through the next couple of days.  The
center of the eastern-most system is currently tracking across the
Great Lakes with mainly light amounts of rain.  In contrast, a
threat of heavy rain along with a slight risk of severe
thunderstorms is forecast for the Mid-Atlantic tonight through
Monday morning ahead of the trailing cold front as Atlantic
moisture is being directed into the region.  The rain is expected
to slowly move off the East Coast on Monday as the system and cold
front move farther east.

Meanwhile, another low pressure system is currently organizing
across the interior western U.S.  This system is forecast to
intensify over the central Plains on Monday, bringing an
increasing threat of heavy rain, a slight chance of flash
flooding, and an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms from the
central Plains eastward toward the mid-Mississippi Valley.  This
system will initially bring mixed rain and snow across the
northern and central Rockies into tonight before a swath of wet
snow develops over the central High Plains on Monday when the low
pressure system is forecast to intensify over the central Plains
and draw cold air down from the north behind the system.  On
Tuesday, the center of the low is forecast to move across the
Midwest with a swath of rain, locally heavy, moving from the
Midwest into the lower Great Lakes.

Still another cold front from the Pacific is forecast to reach the
West Coast on Monday with colder air surging into the region
behind it.  A low pressure system is forecast to develop across
the interior western U.S. Monday and into Tuesday, bringing
high-elevation snow and low-elevation rain across the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Rockies.  By later on Tuesday, the
center of the low is forecast to intensify over the central High
Plains with mixed rain and snow extending farther north into the
northern High Plains.

Over the Southwest and into the southern Rockies, persistent dry
air combined with bouts of gusty winds will promote conditions
favorable for wildfires for the next couple of days.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 AM CDT Mon May 02 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move into the southern Plains today. Farther
west, another shortwave trough will move into the Great Basin. At
the surface, a cyclone will deepen in the Texas Panhandle before
moving northeastward through the day. A cold front will eventually
move southward into the High Plains region.

...New Mexico...
Despite weaker mid-level winds, critical fire weather is possible
during the afternoon due to the strong surface pressure gradient.
Westerly winds will reach 20+ mph in some parts of central and
southern New Mexico. The airmass will remain quite dry and RH will
fall to 10-15%.

...Texas Panhandle into the Permian Basin...
Critical meteorological conditions are possible in the Panhandle and
South Plains. However, scattered thunderstorms on Sunday evening
have produced rainfall across the region, particularly in the
Panhandle. Highlights have been adjusted to account for
rain-impacted fuels. Localized fire weather concerns are still
possible in those areas, however.

...Southern Nevada...
With the approaching trough, southerly/southwesterly winds will
increase ahead of a Pacific boundary. Fuels that have become
critically dry will promote large fire potential. Winds of 15-20 mph
will be common, but isolated higher speeds are possible. RH should
generally range from 15-20% during the afternoon.

...Severe weather and enhanced rainfall threat with southern
stream closed low track Thursday into Saturday...
...Heavy snow threat from the Northwest to the North-Central Great
Basin/Rockies Friday-next Monday...
...Active pattern set to transition to Omega-style blocky pattern
by early next week...


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progression of a closed upper low
tracking out of the West into the Plains and eastward, with the
GFS/GEFS mean still on the fast side compared to the better
clustered and slower recent ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF
ensemble mean solutions. The WPC forecast continues to lean
towards the slower side of the forecast envelope, given
continuity, but also the general nature of a separated southern
stream flow with an embedded closed system. Latest 12 UTC models
and ensembles continue to trend in this direction. This
combination seems to work well for much of the rest of the country
and maintains good WPC product continuity, albeit with more
emphasis on the ECMWF ensemble mean into day 6/7 amid growing
forecast spread. Out West, there remains a general theme of
leading main upper troughing to reaching the coast Thursday, with
guidance converging on depiction of a more digging system over the
weekend into early next week as part of a developing Omega style
block over the lower 48 to also include downstream development of
an amplified and warming east-central U.S. upper ridge and stormy
western Atlantic closed low/trough.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system is expected to track from the south-central Plains to the
Mississppi Valley/Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic Thursday-Saturday.
The Storm Prediction Center shows a threat for severe weather
Thursday/Friday from the southern Plains to the Mid-South. Strong
storms are also possible into the weekend with slow/steady
downstream track of the system. Upper diffluence, moisture inflow
and instability will also offer a threat for enhanced comma head
and wavy lead/trailing frontal rainfall focus from the mid-lower
Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic
Thursday-Saturday.

The digging of a moderately amplified/dynamic upper trough and
frontal system energies across the West Coast and subsequent
inland progress Thursday through the weekend will bring a
widespread precipitation focus from the Northwest through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies and height falls/cooling will
favor a threat for heavy terrain focusing snows. Upper
dynamics/frontal translation should also support an emerging
convection/rainfall pattern with local runoff concerns across the
north-central U.S. by later weekend/early next week.

Upstream, the guidance signal is growing for yet another frontal
surge into the West for ther weekend into early next week as
unsettling upper trough energies seem set to dig more earnestly
into the region that may lead to closed low/trough development
over the south-central Great Basin/Southwest as part of a large
scale Omega style block to also include downstream development of
an amplified and warming east-central U.S. upper ridge and stormy
western Atlantic closed low/trough.

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms for portions of the
Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley on
Monday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms for portions of
the Ohio Valley through Tuesday into Wednesday morning...

On Monday morning, low pressure roughly over the Northeast will
slowly move eastward off the northern Mid-Atlantic Coast by Monday
evening. The system will produce light rain from parts of the
Great Lakes to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic and then linger over
New England through Tuesday morning.

Meanwhile, a wave of low pressure over the Central/Southern High
Plains on Monday will move eastward to the northern Mid-Atlantic
by Wednesday. In addition, moisture from the Western Gulf of
Mexico will move northward over the Southern/Central Plains. The
associated boundary and moisture will aid in destabilizing the
atmosphere producing showers and thunderstorms from the Central
High Plains to the Southern Plains. Therefore, the SPC has issued
an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Central/Southern Plains through Tuesday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. In addition,
there is an increased risk for EF2 to EF5 tornadoes and large
hail, two inches or greater over the area.

In addition, the threat of excessive rainfall increases over parts
of the Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley
through Tuesday morning. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of Central/Southern Plains
and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley through Tuesday morning. The
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams being the
most vulnerable.

Furthermore, the upper-level energy associated with the system
will aid in producing light snow over parts of the Central Rockies
and snow/rain over the Central Plains. Additionally, cold high
pressure will build in the system s wake, allowing temperatures to
become 10 to 25 degrees below average over Northern/Central Plains
and the Upper Mississippi Valley.

On Tuesday, as the front moves eastward, the threat of severe
thunderstorms moves eastward to the Ohio Valley. Ahead of the
front, moisture will stream into the Ohio Valley, aiding in
destabilizing the atmosphere. Therefore, the SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Ohio Valley
on Tuesday into Wednesday morning. The hazards associated with
these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. In addition, moderate to
heavy rain will be associated with these thunderstorms, and the
storms will be going over areas sensitive to excessive rainfall.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall over the Lower Great Lakes parts into the Central
Appalachians on Tuesday into Wednesday morning. The associated
heavy rain will create localized areas of flash flooding,
affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.

Moreover, on Monday, a front will move from the Pacific Northwest
to the Southern Plains by Wednesday. The system will produce rain
and highest elevation snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest and
Northern California, expanding into parts of the Northern
Intermountain Region by Monday afternoon. Overnight Monday, more
snow than rain will move into the Northern Rockies, with snow
moving into the Central Rockies and rain over parts of the Central
High Plains by Wednesday morning.

As the associated energy moves out of the Rockies into the Plains,
moisture will once again be drawn over the Southern/Central Plains
late Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday. As a result, showers and
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Southern Plains
overnight Tuesday.

Furthermore, the SPC issued a Critical Risk of fire weather over
the Southern Rockies on Monday. The fire weather threat is due to
gusty winds, dry fuels, and low relative humidity. On Tuesday, the
threat of fire weather expands over parts of the Southwest while
continuing over the Southern Rockies.

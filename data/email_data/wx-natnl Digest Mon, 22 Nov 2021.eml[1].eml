Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1042 AM CST Sun Nov 21 2021

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

Elevated to Critical surface offshore winds and RH are currently
being observed across portions of coastal southern California per
latest METAR observations. METARS also suggest that the LAX to
TPH/DAG/WJF/PMD/BFL pressure gradient(s) have dropped to Critical
thresholds. Given clear skies across the region, boundary-layer
mixing should only exacerbate critically dry and breezy conditions
across terrain-favoring areas through the rest of the day. Latest
guidance consensus also hints at an uptick in surface winds
coinciding with poor RH recovery between 06-12Z as a 1036 mb surface
high drifts across the southwestern Great Basin and enhances the
surface pressure gradient. As such, widespread 25 mph offshore flow
(locally higher in terrain-favoring areas) and around 15% RH are
likely through 12Z Monday, especially in the Ventura Valley area.

Given the likelihood for Critical conditions to persist past 12Z
Monday, a Critical delineation will be added over portions of the
Ventura Valley in the Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook Update.

..Squitieri.. 11/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0132 AM CST Sun Nov 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will extend from the eastern Pacific into
portions of the Great Basin for most of today, as an upper-level
trough amplifies over the central and eastern CONUS. The surface
ridge over the Great Basin is expected to peak in intensity during
the day today, before gradually weakening later tonight into Monday
morning.

...Southern CA...
Critical fire-weather conditions are expected to develop across
parts of southern CA today, as offshore flow intensifies through the
first half of the day. Diurnal heating and downslope flow will
result in rapid drying, with RH values dropping below 15% across
much of the region by late morning/early afternoon. Meanwhile,
sustained winds of 20-30 mph (with higher gusts) will develop across
terrain-favored areas, and also potentially toward coastal regions
of Ventura County. While offshore flow is expected to peak this
afternoon, gusty winds are expected to continue into tonight, and
overnight RH recovery is expected to be very poor. As a result,
elevated to locally critical conditions will likely persist
overnight into Monday morning.

Valid 12Z Wed Nov 24 2021 - 12Z Sun Nov 28 2021

...Potential heavy rainfall for portions of the Southern Plains,
Lower Mississippi Valley, and Pacific Northwest may impact travel
for the Thanksgiving holiday...

...Overview...

An amplified pattern should prevail through much of the medium
range period (Wed-Sun) beginning with a trough axis moving through
the interior West, a closed low off the Northeast Coast, and
ridging in between. The developing closed low off the Northeast
coast may linger for a few days but likely remaining far enough
east not to impact the Northeast U.S. significantly. Out west,
guidance continues to advertise the trough will likely split into
two separate streams, with southern energy digging into Mexico and
northern stream energy sliding across the Northern Plains and
Great Lakes. The latter may eventually combine with a shortwave in
central Canada to form a closed low over eastern Canada next
weekend. The southern stream energy and moisture flowing into a
frontal system could produce locally heavy rain across the
south-central U.S. during the late week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z/06Z guidance continues to show the leading trough/closed
low linger near the Northeast before pulling away from the coast
further out into the Atlantic Ocean. This feature will mostly
impact the Canadian maritime region. Meanwhile another longwave
trough moves into the central CONUS and transitions to a split
flow pattern. The northern stream is expected to continue to track
across the Mississippi Valley to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
regions while the southern stream gets hung up near the Baja
Peninsula for a few days. The southern stream energy continues to
trend weaker in the models however this leads to uncertainty on
when energy slides southeast into the Southern Plains. The CMC is
the quickest to bring the energy into the Southern Plains next
weekend and is quite generous with the associated QPF. The
GFS/ECMWF have slower timing, but also differing placements of the
maximum QPF. As noted on the last cycle, the ensemble means
continue to support the parent ECMWF/GFS solutions. The northern
stream has had persistent, run-to-run consistency and clustering
with the evolution as the low closes off near eastern Canada,
likely a result of stronger shortwave energy dropping in behind it
from western Canada. The next shortwave should begin impacting the
West by Saturday-Sunday. The CMC is much slower with the shortwave
as it drops southward from Alaska late this week and quickly
becomes out of phase with the GFS, ECMWF, and the ensemble means
showing strong ridging over the West Coast on day 7 rather than
troughing like the better consensus would suggest.

The WPC model blend consisted of 00Z CMC/ECWMF/00Z and 06Z GFS and
the their ensemble means through the extended period - weighting
of the means increased through the middle and later periods. This
combination helps maintains continuity with the previous WPC
forecast.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moderate rainfall, possibly heavy at times, is expected over parts
eastern Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday and
into Thanksgiving Day as a cold front passing through the Southern
Plains. The best chance for heavy rainfall may be Thursday along
the western Gulf Coast where instability should be greatest and at
least a localized flood threat may develop. Less intense and more
scattered rain may extend northward along the cold front into
parts of the Ohio Valley Wednesday-Thursday and eventually the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Friday. The degree of risk for excessive
rainfall will be dependent on the how quickly the cold front
progresses; if it slows or stalls the risk for local flooding
concerns will elevate.

Shortwave energy may help direct an elongated plume of moisture
into the Pacific Northwest to produce terrain-enhanced, moderate
to heavy rain and mountain snows across eastern portions of
Washington and Oregon on Thanksgiving Day. Unsettled conditions
will persist across the West through the weekend, with the
precipitation weakening in intensity for a few days. The system to
follow has the possibility of ushering in another round of locally
heavy rains to the Pacific Northwest.

For temperatures across the CONUS, sprawling high pressure in the
East on Wednesday should continue well below normal daytime highs
and morning lows, particularly for locations in the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic states. Daily low reading are expected to be near or
below freezing. Temperatures may briefly warm back towards normal
on Thursday and Friday but could trend chillier again next weekend
as the next cold front moves through. Through the extended
forecast, locations across the West are expected to trend warmer,
which will spill over into the Plains next weekend. Daytime highs
for the northern and central High Plains could be 10 to 20 degrees
above normal by next Sunday.

...Potential heavy rainfall for portions of the Southern Plains,
Lower Mississippi Valley, and Pacific Northwest may impact travel
for the Thanksgiving holiday...

...Overview...

An amplified pattern should prevail through much of the medium
range period (Wed-Sun) beginning with a trough axis moving through
the interior West, a closed low off the Northeast Coast, and
ridging in between. The developing closed low off the Northeast
coast may linger for a few days but likely remaining far enough
east not to impact the Northeast U.S. significantly. Out west,
guidance continues to advertise the trough will likely split into
two separate streams, with southern energy digging into Mexico and
northern stream energy sliding across the Northern Plains and
Great Lakes. The latter may eventually combine with a shortwave in
central Canada to form a closed low over eastern Canada next
weekend. The southern stream energy and moisture flowing into a
frontal system could produce locally heavy rain across the
south-central U.S. during the late week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z/06Z guidance continues to show the leading trough/closed
low linger near the Northeast before pulling away from the coast
further out into the Atlantic Ocean. This feature will mostly
impact the Canadian maritime region. Meanwhile another longwave
trough moves into the central CONUS and transitions to a split
flow pattern. The northern stream is expected to continue to track
across the Mississippi Valley to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
regions while the southern stream gets hung up near the Baja
Peninsula for a few days. The southern stream energy continues to
trend weaker in the models however this leads to uncertainty on
when energy slides southeast into the Southern Plains. The CMC is
the quickest to bring the energy into the Southern Plains next
weekend and is quite generous with the associated QPF. The
GFS/ECMWF have slower timing, but also differing placements of the
maximum QPF. As noted on the last cycle, the ensemble means
continue to support the parent ECMWF/GFS solutions. The northern
stream has had persistent, run-to-run consistency and clustering
with the evolution as the low closes off near eastern Canada,
likely a result of stronger shortwave energy dropping in behind it
from western Canada. The next shortwave should begin impacting the
West by Saturday-Sunday. The CMC is much slower with the shortwave
as it drops southward from Alaska late this week and quickly
becomes out of phase with the GFS, ECMWF, and the ensemble means
showing strong ridging over the West Coast on day 7 rather than
troughing like the better consensus would suggest.

The WPC model blend consisted of 00Z CMC/ECWMF/00Z and 06Z GFS and
the their ensemble means through the extended period - weighting
of the means increased through the middle and later periods. This
combination helps maintains continuity with the previous WPC
forecast.

...Heavy rain and isolated instances of flash flooding possible
across portions of eastern Florida and South Texas tonight...

...Widespread showers to stretch along the East Coast on Monday
due to a sweeping cold front, colder temperatures return with lake
effect snow possible in its wake...

...Elevated to Critical fire weather conditions in Southern
California, with wet weather returning to the Pacific Northwest
late Monday...

Wet and stormy weather will remain possible across southern
portions of the Nation to end the weekend. Steady onshore flow
will create the potential for additional rounds of heavy rain
across eastern Florida. As a result, the main weather hazards
associated with these downpours will be the possibility of
isolated flash flooding. Meanwhile, a cold front sweeping through
South Texas is expected to spark showers and thunderstorms across
this region as well, with isolated flooding possible.

The aforementioned cold front is also forecast to produce numerous
showers along the East Coast on Monday as it finishes its trek
across the country. Moderate to locally heavy rain is possible
throughout eastern Maine before the cold front fully clears the
region on Monday night. Behind the front, much colder temperatures
and lake effect snow will make for a chilly and blustery start to
the week. Total snowfall accumulations downwind of the Great Lakes
could approach 3-6 inches across localized parts of western New
York and the eastern U.P. of Michigan.

For the western U.S., elevated to critical fire weather remains a
concern across Southern California through Monday. Gusty offshore
winds and low relative humidity will create conditions ripe for
any wildfires that develop to potentially spread uncontrollably.
Red Flag Warnings are in effect. Farther north, wet weather
associated with an approaching Pacific cold front is expected to
enter the Northwest by Monday afternoon. This system is forecast
to push into the Northern Rockies on Tuesday and spread light snow
across the mountainous region. While the aforementioned cold front
traverses the Intermountain West, warm and well above average
temperatures are expected to build across the Plains. Highs are
forecast to reach into the 60s and 70s as far north as South
Dakota on Tuesday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE VENTURA VALLEY IN
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST WYOMING...

The Ventura Valley area in southern California has been upgraded to
a Critical risk for tomorrow/Monday. Early Monday morning, a lobe of
high pressure will brush by southern California and enhance the
surface pressure gradient and associated offshore flow. At least
locally Critical conditions will be possible across much of the
south Coast and Transverse Ranges Monday morning/early afternoon.
However, latest high-resolution guidance consensus depicts a
relatively more concentrated swath of Critical conditions 12-18Z
Monday across parts of the Ventura Valley, where 20+ mph sustained
northeasterly winds and 15% RH will be common.

Across the central High Plains, portions of far southeast Wyoming
were also upgraded to a Critical risk, with Elevated highlights
expanded into the Nebraska Panhandle to account for a more favorable
surface westerly wind/low RH overlap. While cooler temperatures are
expected, especially during the morning hours, temperatures will
exceed 60F by 18Z, with up to 25 mph sustained westerly surface
winds and 15% RH overlapping for a couple of hours over the Laramie
Range towards the Cheyenne, Wyoming vicinity.

Elsewhere, across north-central Montana, Elevated to locally
Critical surface winds/RH are still likely by afternoon peak
heating. However, Critical overlapping winds/RH are expected to be
too localized or brief for a Critical upgrade this outlook.

..Squitieri.. 11/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CST Sun Nov 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper ridge over the Great Basin is forecast to weaken and shift
eastward on Monday, as an upper trough moves into parts of the
Pacific Northwest. As a result, offshore flow will weaken across
parts of southern California. A surface low is forecast to deepen
across parts of Alberta, with a lee trough developing into portions
of the northern and central High Plains.

...Southern CA...
Despite weakening offshore flow, elevated to locally critical
conditions will likely be ongoing at the start of the period Monday
morning across terrain-favored areas of southern CA, due to poor
overnight RH recovery and lingering gusty winds. Winds are generally
expected to weaken through the day, though RH will remain critically
low (generally in the 7-15% range at peak heating). At this time,
confidence in a sufficient duration of critical conditions is too
low to include more than an Elevated delineation. Observations and
short-term guidance will continue to be evaluated, and an upgrade
for the first part of the period remains possible in the Day 2
update.

...Parts of MT/WY...
In response to the developing surface low across AB and lee trough
extending into the northern/central High Plains, relatively dry and
breezy conditions appear possible across two separate areas; one
across the plains of northern MT, and the other across southeast WY
and vicinity. In both areas, sustained winds of 20 mph or greater
(with higher gusts) appear possible in combination with minimum RH
values of 15-25%. These conditions will support an elevated to
locally critical fire-weather threat where receptive fuels are
available.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun November 21 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Potential heavy rainfall for portions of eastern Texas and the
Pacific Northwest may impact travel for the Thanksgiving holiday...

...Overview...

Amplified and elongated troughing across the Central U.S. should
be splitting into two seperate streams as the medium range period
begins. The southern energy should drop southward and linger
off/over Baja California through next weekend while the northern
energy closes off a low over the Great Lakes and shifts into
eastern Canada. Additional energy from Canada should act to reload
and amplify the trough over the eastern U.S. by early next week as
upper level ridging builds across the Northwest/Rockies the second
half of the period.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A closed low off the Northeast coast may hang around for a day or
two before it weakens and the energy becomes absorbed by northern
stream energy from the West. With this, the latest suite of
guidance shows reasonable agreement in the large scale as a low
closes off over the Great Lakes, with only some minor
timing/placement differences. There's more uncertainty with
secondary energy diving into the western fringe of the trough (CMC
much stronger than the GFS/ECMWF) and then evolution and detail
differences as the trough reamplifies over the East day 6-7. The
models actually show really good agreement with the southern
stream closed low over Baja California which may try to inch into
the Southwest by next Monday. Elsewhere, there are some
differences in the East Pacific with the next trough towards the
West Coast with the CMC beginning to get out of phase with the
GFS/ECMWF and ensemble means.

WPC used a blend of the deterministic guidance (more weighting
towards the GFS and ECMWF) for days 3-5, with increasing
contributions from the agreeable ensemble means by late period
which should help mitigate the differences discussed above. This
combination helps maintain good continuity with the previous WPC
forecast for days 3-6.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moderate rainfall, possibly heavy at times, is expected over parts
eastern Texas into Thanksgiving Day. The guidance still shows the
best chance for heavy rainfall may be along the western Gulf
Coast/far south Texas where instability should be greatest and at
least a localized flood threat may develop. The degree of risk for
excessive rainfall will be dependent on the how quickly the cold
front progresses; if it slows or stalls the risk for local
flooding concerns will elevate. Less intense and more scattered
rain may extend northward along the cold front into parts of the
Lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys Thursday and
eventually the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Friday.

Shortwave energy should help direct an elongated plume of moisture
into the Pacific Northwest to produce terrain-enhanced, moderate
to heavy rain and mountain snows across eastern portions of
Washington and Oregon on Thanksgiving Day. Unsettled conditions
will persist across the West through the weekend, with the
precipitation weakening in intensity for a few days. The system to
follow has the possibility of ushering in another round of locally
heavy rains to the Pacific Northwest next weekend.

One day of near normal temperatures are expected over the East,
but after Thanksgiving temperatures should once again trend much
cooler from the Midwest into the East underneath of amplified
upper troughing. Periods of 10-15 belor normal are possible from
the Gulf Coast to the Midwest/Ohio Valley on Friday, with
generally minus 5-10 degrees into the East next weekend.
Meanwhile, amplified troughing into the West will promote a
warming trend across the West and into the Plains through the
period. By next Sunday and Monday, daytime highs and morning lows
across the northern/central High Plains could be 10 to 20 degrees
above normal.

...Holiday travelers thankful as Thanksgiving week kicks off on a
tranquil note across much of the Lower 48...

...Wet Monday morning along the East Coast; Wettest and snowiest
conditions in the Northwest; Lake effect snow showers in the Upper
Great Lakes...

...Chilly temperatures in the East, warmer trend in the Heartland;
Critical fire weather areas in the central High Plains and
Southern California...

As the holiday week gets off and running, much of the continental
U.S. will be devoid of hazards the first half of the week. This is
due to an expansive dome of high pressure in the Nation's
Heartland making its way east towards the East Coast by Tuesday.
Before high pressure builds in, however, an advancing cold front
is responsible for passing up and down the Eastern Seaboard this
morning. A few thunderstorms are also possible as the front
traverses the Southeast today. Passing shower and thunderstorm
activity will race into the northwest Atlantic by Monday evening.
The region forecast to witness the most unsettled weather through
Tuesday night is the Pacific Northwest thanks to a frontal system
ushering in Pacific moisture as far inland as the Northern Rockies
Monday night into Tuesday. Coastal and valley locations will see
occasional rounds with showers while mountain ranges pick up
measurable snowfall. By Wednesday morning, the heaviest snowfall
totals likely occur in the Cascades where over a foot of snow in
the highest of elevations is expected. Parts of the Bitterroots
and Lewis Range can also expect 6 to 12 inches of snowfall. The
interior Northwest will not be the only region observing
accumulating snow. The Upper Great Lakes will receive several
inches of snow today as cold air rushing over the warm Great Lakes
activates the lake effect snow machine downwind of Lakes Superior,
Michigan, Erie, and Ontario. Additional snowfall accumulations up
to 6 inches is likely in Michigan's Upper Peninsula with several
inches possible just east of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Lastly,
scattered showers and minor mountain snowfall accumulations are
possible in the Four Corners region as a frontal boundary
approaches from the north and west Tuesday night.

It certainly feels like the Holiday Season is upon us in the East
where below normal temperatures look to set up shop through
Wednesday morning. The cold front responsible for this morning's
scattered shower activity is also injecting cold Canadian air into
the eastern third of the country. High temps today will struggle
to get out of the 30s in parts of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley
(high temp anomalies of 10 to 20 degrees below normal) with the
same scenario playing out in the Northeast on Tuesday. Even in the
Southeast, daily temperature anomalies of 10 to 15 degrees below
normal are anticipated into Wednesday. Farther west, a warm front
lifting across the Plains and Midwest results in considerably
warmer temps. Highs will soar into the 60s throughout the Great
Plains today with some areas getting into the 70s by Tuesday.
Regarding other potential hazards, the combination of dry
conditions and gusty winds is a favorable recipe for fire weather
conditions in the central and northern High Plains. In fact, a
Critical Risk for fire weather is in place over southeast Wyoming.
Meanwhile, Southern California can expect one more day of Santa
Ana winds where Red Flag Warnings remain in effect through the
first half of Monday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF VENTURA AND LOS
ANGELES COUNTIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEASTERN
WYOMING...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge over the West is forecast to shift eastward
today as a shortwave trough approaches the Pacific Northwest coast.
At the surface, high pressure over the Great Basin will gradually
weaken throughout the day, resulting in an eventual relaxation of
the pressure gradient across Southern California.

...Portions of Southern California...
With ongoing downslope, offshore flow through the morning, RH
recovery will be poor, resulting in continuous critical fire weather
conditions across portions of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties in
Southern California.  While the offshore flow will eventually weaken
through the afternoon, a multi-hour period of sustained
northeasterly winds over 20 mph concurrent with RH values less than
15% is likely, especially across southern portions of Ventura
County.

...Southeastern Wyoming into the Southern Nebraska Panhandle...
Westerly winds are expected to peak early and largely decrease into
the afternoon hours while the RH is forecast to continue falling
through the afternoon with diurnal heating.  Nevertheless, there
should be sufficient spatiotemporal overlap of strong winds (~20
mph) and low RH (~15%) to warrant a critical delineation for
portions of southeastern Wyoming, especially considering atypical
fuel conditions for this time of year (i.e., ERC and 100-h fuel
moisture values around the 90th percentile).

...Portions of North-Central Montana...
Despite relatively cool conditions (highs largely in the 50s F),
strong winds just above the surface coupled with diurnal
heating/mixing is likely to result in strong/gusty winds.  As the
morning inversion erodes, RH values are expected to fall to
near-critical values, leading to elevated fire weather conditions
across the region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEASTERN WYOMING
AND THE NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough with a slightly positive tilt is forecast to
move eastward across the Great Basin on Tuesday.  In response at the
surface, a trough of low pressure is expected to develop from
eastern North Dakota southwestward into northeastern New Mexico by
Tuesday afternoon.

...Southeastern Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle...
As the trough approaches, enhanced westerly low-level flow is
forecast to develop across the region.  While there is some
uncertainty among model solutions with regard to the amount of
vertical mixing and the exact placement of the surface pressure
trough, there is confidence in the dry, downslope flow regime for
critical fire weather conditions to develop across portions of
southeastern Wyoming and the western Nebraska Panhandle. Afternoon
RH values are likely to fall below critical thresholds with
sustained winds of 20 mph (gusting to over 30 mph).

...Portions of Southeastern Colorado, Southwestern Kansas,
Northeastern New Mexico, and TX/OK Panhandles...
Low-level flow will also be enhanced farther south across the
southern High Plains in advance of the approaching trough.  Diurnal
heating in the presence of a dry airmass will result in rapid drying
and vertical mixing.  Afternoon RH values are expected to fall below
20% with surface winds approaching 20 mph.  Fuels are unusually dry
for this time of year, elevating the fire weather concerns.

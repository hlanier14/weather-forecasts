Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1133 AM CDT Thu Nov 04 2021

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. See the discussion below for
more details.

..Karstens.. 11/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Thu Nov 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough, moving inland on the Oregon coast this morning,
will shift south and east through the day. As it does, a cold front
will move southeastward across portions of the Great Basin. Some dry
and breezy conditions are possible in portions of central Nevada.
However, fuels in this area are quite moist and therefore, fire
weather concerns should remain low.

Elsewhere in the CONUS, fire weather concerns remain minimal due to
a cool/moist low-level airmass and moist fuels.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CDT Thu Nov 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
Strong westerly winds are expected to develop across eastern Montana
and western North Dakota Friday afternoon. Relative humidity is
expected to remain above 30 percent and fuels in this area are quite
moist. Therefore, no elevated delineation is warranted in this
region.

Isolated dry and breezy conditions may occur in portions of
downslope flow in eastern Wyoming. However, fuels in this area
should not be receptive to fire spread and therefore, fire weather
concerns remain low.

ZG5_79dln6H$

FOR FRIDAY NOVEMBER 12 - THURSDAY NOVEMBER 18: There is good multi-model
agreement indicating amplified mid-level troughing forecast across the east=
ern
half of the CONUS at the beginning of the period, gradually weakening
throughout week-2. This pattern may support anomalously cool temperatures t=
o
sink southward from Canada at the beginning of the period. A slight risk of
much below normal temperatures is posted across parts of the eastern half o=
f
the CONUS, Nov 13 to 15, where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowes=
t
15h percentile and below freezing. Today's 6Z and 12Z deterministic GFS sho=
ws
some areas experiencing negative temperature anomalies reaching 10 Deg F or
greater. For some of the areas across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southeast, this would be the first freeze of the season.



Today's 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian daily ensemble means indicate surface =
low
formation over the Great Lakes with a trailing front at the beginning of th=
e
period, bringing wet weather to parts of the eastern third of the CONUS. Th=
e
greatest likelihood for heavy precipitation is across parts of the Eastern
Seaboard. There are, however, significant differences between recent
deterministic GFS runs regarding this storm. The 12Z deterministic GFS
indicates this storm forming a day later (Nov 12) than the 6Z over the
Mississippi Valley (Nov 11), with the 12Z having the surface low tracking
further south than the 6Z and being more progressive. If the 12Z GFS soluti=
on
pans out, there would be potential for heavy precipitation across a greater
area of the eastern CONUS compared to the 6Z. Additionally, some models hav=
e
been hinting at some possibility of surface low formation off the coast of =
the
Carolinas, which could also bring heavy precipitation to the central and
southern Eastern Seaboard. Given significant model uncertainty regarding th=
e
details of surface low formation and associated frontal activity, a broad a=
rea
is highlighted for heavy precipitation across parts of the Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic, eastern Great Lakes area, and Central Appalachians, Nov 12 to
14,
incorporating the reforecast tools, deterministic model solutions, and
ensemble
means. Both the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day
liquid
equivalent precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch
across the New England area. Localized areas further inland may receive hea=
vy
precipitation in the form of snow, although too much uncertainty regarding =
the
details of the storm precludes designating heavy snow risk at this time.



The deterministic 6Z and 12Z GFS indicates a possible secondary surface low
forming over Canada and tracking towards the Great Lakes by the middle of t=
he
period. Some areas may receive lake effect snow, with the 6Z deterministic =
GFS
favoring the greatest chances across northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania
and
Western New York, associated with warm surface temperatures across Lake Eri=
e
and anticipated cold air temperatures. The orientation of the storm in the =
12Z
deterministic GFS, however, suggests that Michigan and Indiana have greater
chances for lake effect snow. Due to significant model differences and high
uncertainty regarding the orientation of this surface low, a related heavy
snow
risk is not posted at this time.



Surface low pressure is anticipated to form across the Northeast Pacific at
the
beginning of week-2, which could support strong onshore flow into the Pacif=
ic
Northwest. The GFS and ECMWF indicate enhanced integrated water vapor
transport
(IVT) values (greater than 250 kg/m/s) that would be conducive for heavy
precipitation across the region at the beginning of the period. Therefore, =
a
slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for parts of western Washingto=
n,
Nov 12 to 14. Lower elevations are most likely to receive heavy precipitati=
on
in the form of rainfall, with possible heavy snow in higher elevation areas=
.



Mid-level troughing is forecast across much of Mainland Alaska, supporting
surface high pressure building across interior portions of the state. This
pattern may usher in cold arctic air into parts of Alaska. A slight risk of
much below normal temperatures is posted for parts of southwestern Mainland
Alaska, Nov 12 to 14, where the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20%
chance
of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile. The GEFS and
ECMWF ensemble means indicate the possibility of negative temperature
anomalies
falling to at least 10 Deg F below normal and -10 Deg F.



Multiple models continue to indicate the potential for surface high pressur=
e
centered over the interior West at the beginning of the period, implying a
potential for strong downsloping Santa Ana winds in southern California to =
the
west of the coastal mountain ranges. The threat decreases later in week-2, =
as
the surface high pressure starts to weaken and the pressure gradient in
southern California begins to relax. These enhanced winds could enhance the
risk for wildfire potential across portions of Southern California, where t=
he
National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) shows some areas forecast to have
enhanced risk of wildfires leading up to week-2.

251 PM EDT Thu Nov 4 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Nov 7 2021 - 12Z Thu Nov 11 2021

19Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in very good
agreement for the beginning of the forecast period on Sunday, with
differences becoming more apparent by Monday across south-central
Canada and the West Coast.  The GFS is stronger with the shortwave
crossing eastern Canada and faster with the arrival of the next
shortwave reaching the Pacific Northwest by Tuesday, and this
quick progression continues across the Plains by the middle of the
week, and ahead of its own ensemble mean.  The UKMET is on the
slower side of the guidance with the ECMWF/ECENS/GEFS in
relatively good agreement on timing.  This will have implications
on the next storm system across the central U.S. and the
extent/timing of heavier shower and storms.  Otherwise, the
forecast remains largely on track from the previous version, and
the overnight discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with an upper ridge
across the central U.S., separating troughing in the East and
along the West Coast. This pattern shifts eastward as the week
progresses, as multiple shortwaves from the Pacific deepen
troughing across the central U.S. by midweek. A series of fronts
coming into the West Coast will keep precipitation chances high
there, and precipitation is currently expected to increase over
the central U.S. by Wednesday as a low pressure system
consolidates in the Midwest.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 12/18Z model guidance continues to show reasonably good
agreement at the beginning of the medium range period with the
large-scale pattern, though some differences still remain with the
position and track of the surface low moving northeastward through
the western Atlantic Sunday into Monday with the eastern upper
trough. The 18Z GFS appeared to be on the faster/more northeast
side of the guidance envelope and was not particularly favored,
while the 12Z ECMWF was on the slower side by Monday. Favored a
position in between, which was closer to the ensemble means'
position and other 12Z guidance including the GFS, and which fits
in line with WPC continuity.

Shortwave differences remain within the jet stream across the West
into the north-central U.S. and south-central Canada. Initially
these differences are nothing too egregious considering the time
range, but start to affect the overall flow across the western and
central U.S. by around Tuesday. The evolution of these shortwaves
and differences in strength of an upper low rotating in the
eastern Pacific and approaching the Pacific Northwest Tuesday
cause downstream differences across the central U.S., in terms of
amplification of troughing moving through and with whether
shortwave energy combines or remains separate. A significant
amount of run to run variability (including with the newer 00Z
cycle coming in) and between models lead to low confidence. A
forecast mainly based on the ensemble means, which show troughing
across the central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday but not as amplified as
the 12Z ECMWF, seemed like the best starting point at this time.

Overall the WPC forecast utilized a multi-model blend of 12Z
deterministic guidance early in the period, favoring the 12Z GFS
more than the 18Z, and increasing usage of the 12Z EC and GEFS
ensemble means as the period progressed while lessening weighting
of the less agreeable deterministic models.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Some light rain may linger across eastern North Carolina into
Sunday and possibly over coastal areas of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast given the Atlantic surface low, but most precipitation
should stay offshore with this low track. Abundant moisture ahead
of frontal systems and upper-level shortwaves edging in from the
Pacific will result in periods of enhanced precipitation for much
of next week near the West Coast and inland. Through the period,
the Pacific Northwest and northern California can expect the
heaviest precipitation, with typical terrain enhancements and
higher elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with rain and mountain
snow threats increasing by Monday and especially Tuesday into
Wednesday. Then as a low pressure system is forecast to
consolidate in the Midwest by midweek, rain is expected to spread
to that area and south along its trailing cold front in the
Plains/Mississippi Valley. Chances for snow on the backside of
this low in the north-central U.S. will continue to be monitored.

Temperatures could remain slightly below normal on Sunday for the
Southeast due to a cold surface high to the west and the low
offshore bringing northerly winds. Meanwhile, a persistent
upper-level ridge over the west-central U.S. should lead to
temperatures that are above average by 10-20 degrees over the
Plains into the Midwest through early next week, with highs 5-10F
above normal stretching toward the East Coast by Tuesday-Thursday.
Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs modestly below normal
over the West Coast on most days, eventually entering into the
Great Basin and Rockies by midweek.

Valid 12Z Sun Nov 7 2021 - 12Z Thu Nov 11 2021

19Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in very good
agreement for the beginning of the forecast period on Sunday, with
differences becoming more apparent by Monday across south-central
Canada and the West Coast.  The GFS is stronger with the shortwave
crossing eastern Canada and faster with the arrival of the next
shortwave reaching the Pacific Northwest by Tuesday, and this
quick progression continues across the Plains by the middle of the
week, and ahead of its own ensemble mean.  The UKMET is on the
slower side of the guidance with the ECMWF/ECENS/GEFS in

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu November 04 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 10 - 14 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical models forecast a ridge with above-normal mid-le=
vel
heights over the Bering Sea and western Alaska, while a trough is forecast
over
the Gulf of Alaska extending southwestward over the North Pacific. A ridge =
is
predicted over the western CONUS, while a trough is predicted over the east=
ern
central CONUS with below normal mid-level heights. A ridge is predicted ove=
r
the northeastern CONUS by most model solutions, with associated above-norma=
l
500-hPa heights.

Below-normal temperatures are favored across most of Alaska, except for par=
ts
of the North Slope, under anomalous easterly and northerly flow. Above-norm=
al
temperatures are favored for the western CONUS, under a predicted ridge and
positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Above-normal temperatures are favored fo=
r
the north-central and northeastern CONUS, under above-normal mid-level heig=
hts
early in the period, although probabilities are weak or moderate, as a trou=
gh
digs into the central CONUS during the period. Near-normal temperatures are
favored for parts of the southeastern CONUS, centered around the Lower
Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Coast, under the predicted mid-level trough=
.

Below-normal precipitation is favored over the Aleutians and much of Mainla=
nd
Alaska, except the North Slope, under anomalous easterly and northerly flow=
.
With increased onshore flow ahead of predicted troughing over the North
Pacific, above-normal precipitation is likely for across the northern tier =
of
the CONUS from the Pacific Northwest extending eastward to the Northern
Plains.
Probabilities for above-normal precipitation are enhanced across much of th=
e
eastern CONUS, near and ahead of a predicted trough. Below-normal
precipitation
probabilities are enhanced over much of the Southwest and Southern Plains,
under predicted ridging with above-normal mid-level heights. Near-normal
precipitation is favored in climatologically arid regions of the Southwest.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the average large-scale circulation
pattern,
offset by differences among the temperature and precipitation tools, as wel=
l
as
a changing circulation pattern during the period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 12 - 18 2021

During the week-2 period, the predicted 500-hPa circulation is similar to t=
he
forecast for the 6-10 day period, with some eastward progression of the rid=
ge
and trough over the CONUS and decrease in amplitude with increased
uncertainty.
A trough over the Northern Pacific is forecast to shift westward as a
predicted
ridge over the western CONUS with above-normal mid-level heights expands
northward and eastward. A trough and associated below-normal heights are
forecast over most of the eastern CONUS. Downstream of this trough, a
weakening
ridge is forecast to progress eastward over the Northeast,  leading to
near-normal average mid-level heights.

Troughing and anomalous easterly and northerly flow lead to likely below-
normal
temperatures for southwestern areas of Alaska, while near-normal temperatur=
es
are favored for northeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, unde=
r
rising mid-level heights. Above-normal mid-level heights lead to increased
probabilities of above-normal temperatures for the western half of the CONU=
S.
Below-normal temperatures are favored over most of the east-central CONUS a=
nd
Southeast, under a predicted trough and northerly flow. Near-normal 500-hPa
heights are forecast over the northeastern CONUS along with anomalous
southerly
flow, favoring above-normal temperatures across the region.

Enhanced easterly and northeasterly flow favors below-normal precipitation =
for
the Aleutians and most of Mainland Alaska, except for the North Slope and
extreme southeastern areas. The trough over the Northern Pacific favors
enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitation for extreme southeaste=
rn
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, as well as northern areas of the
Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies, due to increased onshore flow.=
 A
predicted trough over the east-central CONUS and potential storm system
development leads to enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitation f=
or
the northeastern CONUS, consistent with the precipitation consolidation too=
l.
Below-normal precipitation is favored over a large area of the western and
central CONUS, extending from the California coast across the Central and
Southern Rockies into the Central and Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley, under and ahead of a mid-level ridge.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=

good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=

by increasing uncertainty and differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools, with a changing circulation pattern during th=

period.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

...More rain, high elevation snow, and blustery winds moving into
the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies...

...A developing low pressure system expected to bring and
increasing threat of thunderstorms and gusty winds across Florida
and along the southeastern U.S. coast through Saturday...

...First freeze of the season arriving across the interior Deep
South, Tennessee Valley and interior Mid-Atlantic...

More unsettled weather is in store for the northwestern quadrant
of the mainland U.S. as a parade of Pacific storm systems is
forecast to move onshore, delivering rain and high elevation snow
from the coast to the Rockies.  The relatively moisture-rich cold
front associated with these systems could deliver as much as 1-2+"
of rain to low lying coastal areas from northern California to the
Olympic Peninsula as well as some heavy snow to the Washington
Cascades.  As the front moves further inland throughout the day
light to moderate rain showers and the coincident high elevation
snow will also spread east into the Northern Great Basin and
Northern Rockies. Without skipping a beat the second system will
reach the coastline Friday morning, bringing with it another
helping of rain and snow. Though precipitation totals are not
expected to be as high as those with the previous system, a drop
in snow levels to around 3000-4000 ft will allow snow to
accumulate at lower elevations throughout the Cascades and the
Olympic Mountains.

In the mean time, a cool high pressure system is forecast to
dominate the weather pattern for much of the eastern two-thirds of
the country into the weekend.  In fact, the first freeze of the
season is forecast to continue for the next couple of mornings
across the interior Deep South, Tennessee Valley and interior
Mid-Atlantic.  As the high pressure system remains nearly
stationary across the central and eastern U.S., a low pressure
system is forecast to gradually develop in the Gulf of Mexico near
a stationary front during the next couple of days.  This system
will track east-northeast across the Gulf of Mexico into Friday
and then across the Florida Peninsula Friday night as the storm
gradually intensifies.  Much of Florida will see an increasing
threat of showers and thunderstorms through Friday, with the
southern half of the Peninsula possibly seeing the thunderstorms
becoming severe Friday night with heavy downpours and damaging
wind gusts as a dynamic cold front approaches.  The intensifying
low pressure system will likely head northeastward just off the
southeastern U.S. coast later on Saturday with gusty winds and
some heavy rain possible near/along the coast.

In stark contrast to the cold spell in the central and eastern
U.S., upper-level ridging out West has allowed above normal
temperatures to overspread much of the the western U.S. to the
northern Plains with temperatures topping 10 to 20 degrees above
normal. As the ridge progresses eastward on Friday it will spread
the warm weather into the upper Midwest and central Plains while
also providing some relief to the eastern U.S. by moderating
temperatures back closer to average.

Valid 12Z Sun Nov 07 2021 - 12Z Thu Nov 11 2021

19Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in very good
agreement for the beginning of the forecast period on Sunday, with
differences becoming more apparent by Monday across south-central
Canada and the West Coast.  The GFS is stronger with the shortwave
crossing eastern Canada and faster with the arrival of the next
shortwave reaching the Pacific Northwest by Tuesday, and this
quick progression continues across the Plains by the middle of the
week, and ahead of its own ensemble mean.  The UKMET is on the
slower side of the guidance with the ECMWF/ECENS/GEFS in
relatively good agreement on timing.  This will have implications
on the next storm system across the central U.S. and the
extent/timing of heavier shower and storms.  Otherwise, the
forecast remains largely on track from the previous version, and
the overnight discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with an upper ridge
across the central U.S., separating troughing in the East and
along the West Coast. This pattern shifts eastward as the week
progresses, as multiple shortwaves from the Pacific deepen
troughing across the central U.S. by midweek. A series of fronts
coming into the West Coast will keep precipitation chances high
there, and precipitation is currently expected to increase over
the central U.S. by Wednesday as a low pressure system
consolidates in the Midwest.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 12/18Z model guidance continues to show reasonably good
agreement at the beginning of the medium range period with the
large-scale pattern, though some differences still remain with the
position and track of the surface low moving northeastward through
the western Atlantic Sunday into Monday with the eastern upper
trough. The 18Z GFS appeared to be on the faster/more northeast
side of the guidance envelope and was not particularly favored,
while the 12Z ECMWF was on the slower side by Monday. Favored a
position in between, which was closer to the ensemble means'
position and other 12Z guidance including the GFS, and which fits
in line with WPC continuity.

Shortwave differences remain within the jet stream across the West
into the north-central U.S. and south-central Canada. Initially
these differences are nothing too egregious considering the time
range, but start to affect the overall flow across the western and
central U.S. by around Tuesday. The evolution of these shortwaves
and differences in strength of an upper low rotating in the
eastern Pacific and approaching the Pacific Northwest Tuesday
cause downstream differences across the central U.S., in terms of
amplification of troughing moving through and with whether
shortwave energy combines or remains separate. A significant
amount of run to run variability (including with the newer 00Z
cycle coming in) and between models lead to low confidence. A
forecast mainly based on the ensemble means, which show troughing
across the central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday but not as amplified as
the 12Z ECMWF, seemed like the best starting point at this time.

Overall the WPC forecast utilized a multi-model blend of 12Z
deterministic guidance early in the period, favoring the 12Z GFS
more than the 18Z, and increasing usage of the 12Z EC and GEFS
ensemble means as the period progressed while lessening weighting
of the less agreeable deterministic models.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Some light rain may linger across eastern North Carolina into
Sunday and possibly over coastal areas of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast given the Atlantic surface low, but most precipitation
should stay offshore with this low track. Abundant moisture ahead
of frontal systems and upper-level shortwaves edging in from the
Pacific will result in periods of enhanced precipitation for much
of next week near the West Coast and inland. Through the period,
the Pacific Northwest and northern California can expect the
heaviest precipitation, with typical terrain enhancements and
higher elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with rain and mountain
snow threats increasing by Monday and especially Tuesday into
Wednesday. Then as a low pressure system is forecast to
consolidate in the Midwest by midweek, rain is expected to spread
to that area and south along its trailing cold front in the
Plains/Mississippi Valley. Chances for snow on the backside of
this low in the north-central U.S. will continue to be monitored.

Temperatures could remain slightly below normal on Sunday for the
Southeast due to a cold surface high to the west and the low
offshore bringing northerly winds. Meanwhile, a persistent
upper-level ridge over the west-central U.S. should lead to
temperatures that are above average by 10-20 degrees over the
Plains into the Midwest through early next week, with highs 5-10F
above normal stretching toward the East Coast by Tuesday-Thursday.
Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs modestly below normal
over the West Coast on most days, eventually entering into the
Great Basin and Rockies by midweek.

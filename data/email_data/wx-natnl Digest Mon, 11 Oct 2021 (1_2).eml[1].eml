No changes. Previous discussion follows.

..Bentley.. 10/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0211 AM CDT Sun Oct 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-/upper-level trough over the Four Corners region early this
morning will move into the Plains this afternoon and deepen.
Coincident with this, a strengthening mid-/upper-level jet will
carve out a new trough along the Pacific coast late tonight into
early Monday morning.

At the surface, an advancing cold front, stretched from central
Minnesota south-southwestward into northwest Oklahoma and the Texas
Panhandle at the start of the forecast period, will stall across
portions of Oklahoma late morning into early afternoon, roughly
along the I-44 corridor. At the same time, robust westerly downslope
flow to the south of this cold front will contribute to a strong
dryline push into the southern Texas Panhandle by mid-afternoon. The
surface low at the intersection of the dryline-cold front
intersection will deepen during the afternoon as it moves out of the
Texas Panhandle and into southwest Oklahoma. The circulation around
the deepening low will aid the dryline push into Texas.

... Southern New Mexico into the southern Plains ...

Several hours of sustained surface winds nearing 30 mph, with
stronger gusts, will occur across the region. Coincident with this,
relative humidity will fall below 15-20% in the presence of strong
diurnal heating and a deeply mixed boundary layer. Despite critical,
or even high-end critical, meteorological conditions, fuels appear
unfavorable for large-scale fire spread. The result will be several
hours of at least elevated to locally critical fire conditions. The
eastward extent of the dryline push into Texas will determine the
eastward extent of the fire weather potential. Thus, additional
refinements to the eastward delineation of the elevated area may
need to be refined with the next forecast update.

... Northern California ...

Surface winds will increase and become gusty across northern
California overnight Sunday into Monday due to the strengthening jet
digging into the area. Although winds will increase overnight,
relative humidity should remain high enough to warrant widespread
elevated or critical fire concerns under normal conditions until
later Monday morning. However, given extremely receptive fuels and
the potential for the relative humidity to fall earlier than
expected, an elevated area has been introduced.

...Strong northern Plains storm to bring heavy rainfall to the
region on Wednesday along with some High Plains snow...

...Heavy rain threat over parts of the southern Plains
Wednesday-Thursday...

18Z Update:  Model guidance continues to be in above average
agreement overall through Friday on the large scale pattern across
the continental U.S., and a UKMET/ECMWF/GFS blend was used as a
starting point for fronts, temperatures, and QPF for this time
period.  The biggest differences remain with the eventual track of
what is expected to become Hurricane Pamela over the next few days
south of Mexico, with the GFS remaining on the stronger side of
the guidance and slightly slower to make landfall, and the
ECMWF/UKMET/CMC indicating a weaker system by 12Z Wednesday.  The
eventual remnants of this tropical cyclone will have an impact
across portions of the western Gulf Coast by the end of the week,
and this is among the most uncertain aspects of the QPF forecast
going forward.  By next weekend, differences in the model guidance
over the Gulf of Alaska related to the next storm system
approaching the Pacific Northwest become more evident, with the
GFS quicker with the lead shortwave and the CMC/ECMWF slower.
Models remain in decent agreement across the East Coast with the
cold front exiting the region.  The previous forecast discussion
is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Guidance continues to show a very active pattern over the central
U.S. mid-late week.  A strong storm system tracking northeastward
from Nebraska/South Dakota into Canada will bring significant
precipitation to the northern Plains and vicinity, while incoming
Pacific shortwave energy and a flow of eastern Pacific tropical
moisture/energy are likely to interact with the trailing front to
produce areas of heavy rainfall over the southern Plains.  The
amplified pattern consisting of mean troughing aloft over the
west-central U.S. and a ridge from the Gulf of Mexico into the
eastern U.S. will lead to a pronounced temperature contrast with
much below normal readings over the West and unseasonable warmth
over the East.  By the weekend precipitation coverage/intensity
over the lower 48 will steadily decrease and temperatures will
moderate as an eastern Pacific upper trough encourages a ridge to
build into the West, pushing the western/central U.S. trough into
the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Latest models and ensemble means are fairly well clustered for the
strong storm tracking northeastward from Nebraska/South Dakota
early Wednesday onward, at least with respect to typical errors
for three or four days out in time.  Some GFS runs over recent
days may have been a bit fast/east but overall trends from other
guidance have been gradually deeper, toward a depth that the GFS
advertised with earlier lead time.  00Z models maintain good
continuity and agreement for depth and track.

Meanwhile agreement is improving for the Pacific shortwave energy
entering the West by early Wednesday and emerging into the Plains
by Friday, though some modest spread is still noted late in the
week.  On the other hand models continue to show more spread and
variability than desired for the specifics of an eastern Pacific
tropical system currently expected to form later today per the
latest Tropical Weather Outlook from the National Hurricane
Center.  There has been some narrowing of the envelope for the
track of this system (northeastward progression as it passes
southeast of the southern tip of Baja California) but the CMC is
the persistent fast extreme and the 00Z UKMET is fairly fast as
well.  The 12Z ECMWF was not far from recent GFS runs but now the
new 00Z ECMWF has trended faster.  The precise timing of this
system will be important for resolving the effects over the
southern Plains.  The depiction on the manual forecast maintains a
solution reflecting yesterday's WPC-NHC coordination.

Beyond early Friday the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their ensemble means
(plus the 12Z CMC aside from its slower eastern U.S. wave that
went away in the new 00Z run) provide reasonable agreement in
principle as the pattern adjusts to a trough-ridge-trough
configuration, favoring a model/mean blend to tone down smaller
scale shortwave uncertainties by days 6-7.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The strong storm tracking northeastward across the northern Plains
Wednesday into early Thursday will bring an area of rainfall that
should be heaviest over the Dakotas, along with possibly some
meaningful snow over parts of the northern High Plains, and
strong/gusty winds.  Parts of the southern Plains will see the
potential for heavy rainfall around Wednesday-Thursday due to
approaching western U.S. shortwave energy and eastern Pacific
tropical moisture/shortwave energy interacting with the trailing
front over the region.  The general signal for this event has
persisted over the past couple days but the uncertainty regarding
the timing of the Pacific tropical system keeps confidence lower
than desired for resolving the finer details at this time.  Some
of this moisture may continue into the eastern U.S. late week into
the weekend as the front becomes more progressive but rainfall
totals should be less extreme.

Flow on the eastern fringe of Pacific mean troughing aloft will
bring periods of light to perhaps moderate precipitation to the
northern Pacific Northwest through the period.  Light rain and
high elevation snow may extend from the Northwest down into the
central Rockies with the upper shortwave crossing the West during
Wednesday-Thursday.

The West will see a broad area of highs 15-30F below normal
through at least Thursday followed by steady moderation toward
mostly single-digit anomalies with only pockets of colder readings
during the weekend.  Morning lows will be less extreme but there
will still be multiple days with lows of 10-20F below normal.  A
few daily records for lows/cold highs will be possible.  Meanwhile
at least the northern two-thirds of the East will see highs of
10-20F above normal mid-late week with some cooling that starts
over the Mississippi Valley.  A much broader area will see plus
10-20F or so anomalies for lows.  Numerous record warm lows will
be possible from the western Gulf Coast or Lower Mississippi
Valley northward/northeastward.  Progression of the Plains cold
front into the East should bring a cooling trend during the
weekend with highs dropping to near or slightly below normal.

...Strong northern Plains storm to bring heavy rainfall to the
region on Wednesday along with some High Plains snow...

...Heavy rain threat over parts of the southern Plains
Wednesday-Thursday...

18Z Update:  Model guidance continues to be in above average
agreement overall through Friday on the large scale pattern across
the continental U.S., and a UKMET/ECMWF/GFS blend was used as a
starting point for fronts, temperatures, and QPF for this time
period.  The biggest differences remain with the eventual track of
what is expected to become Hurricane Pamela over the next few days
south of Mexico, with the GFS remaining on the stronger side of
the guidance and slightly slower to make landfall, and the
ECMWF/UKMET/CMC indicating a weaker system by 12Z Wednesday.  The
eventual remnants of this tropical cyclone will have an impact
across portions of the western Gulf Coast by the end of the week,
and this is among the most uncertain aspects of the QPF forecast
going forward.  By next weekend, differences in the model guidance
over the Gulf of Alaska related to the next storm system
approaching the Pacific Northwest become more evident, with the
GFS quicker with the lead shortwave and the CMC/ECMWF slower.
Models remain in decent agreement across the East Coast with the
cold front exiting the region.  The previous forecast discussion
is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Guidance continues to show a very active pattern over the central
U.S. mid-late week.  A strong storm system tracking northeastward
from Nebraska/South Dakota into Canada will bring significant
precipitation to the northern Plains and vicinity, while incoming
Pacific shortwave energy and a flow of eastern Pacific tropical
moisture/energy are likely to interact with the trailing front to
produce areas of heavy rainfall over the southern Plains.  The
amplified pattern consisting of mean troughing aloft over the
west-central U.S. and a ridge from the Gulf of Mexico into the
eastern U.S. will lead to a pronounced temperature contrast with
much below normal readings over the West and unseasonable warmth
over the East.  By the weekend precipitation coverage/intensity
over the lower 48 will steadily decrease and temperatures will
moderate as an eastern Pacific upper trough encourages a ridge to
build into the West, pushing the western/central U.S. trough into
the East.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 PM CDT Sun Oct 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF
CALIFORNIA....

Expanded the elevated delineation westward to the California
coastline as latest guidance suggests 15 to 20 mph winds will
persist to somewhere near the coast. In addition, expanded the
elevated area a bit farther south into Los Angeles and Ventura
counties where winds of 15 to 20 mph are forecast late in the day.
Otherwise, no changes were made. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 10/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0213 AM CDT Sun Oct 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Monday, a strong mid-/upper-level Pacific jet will dig south
across California, increasing to over 100 knots at 500-millibars.
This jet will carve out a deep trough across the western United
States, with an eventual closed 500-millibar low developing across
northern Arizona by early Tuesday morning.

As this jet digs and strengthens, a surface low will deepen across
southern Nevada late Monday evening before lifting northeast into
Utah by Tuesday morning. A strong surface high across the northeast
Pacific will contribute to an increased surface pressure gradient
across California to the west of the deepening low. The resultant
dry, northerly flow will combine with intense heating supporting a
deeply mixed boundary layer and downward momentum transfer of the
mid-level jet. The result will be surface winds approaching 30 mph,
with local gusts over 40 mph possible -- stronger and gustier than
would otherwise be expected, given the surface pressure gradient.

Relative humidity on Monday will fall into the teens across the
region, with a delayed (if any) overnight recovery occurring Monday
night. Therefore, with extremely receptive fuels in place owing to
the long-term drought, the addition of the strong, gusty winds
described above will result in elevated and critical fire weather
conditions throughout the Central Valley on Monday into Tuesday
morning.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun October 10 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Severe weather outbreak and Excessive Rainfall in the Southern
Plains this evening, severe weather in the Great Lakes and
Mississippi Valley on Tuesday...

...Amplifying upper trough to inject some of the coldest air of
the season into the West with heavy mountain snow and much below
normal temperatures; High Winds and freezes in parts of the West...

...Another severe weather outbreak anticipated in the Great Plains
on Tuesday; seasonally warm in the East...

A trio of storm systems are set to unleash a myriad of weather
hazards across the western two-thirds of the Lower 48 the first
half of the week. The first is unfolding in the the northern Great
Lakes and northern Minnesota as an occluded storm system is set to
generate strong-to-severe storms this afternoon and evening. A
second storm system is unfolding in the Southern Plains where a
potent cold front and late season dryline are set to ignite severe
storms this afternoon and evening. A Moderate Risk for severe
weather has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center for central
and eastern Oklahoma while the severe threat extends from
southwest Missouri on south into central Texas. There is also a
Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall in northeast Oklahoma this
evening, meaning there is also a threat for flash flooding. All
modes of severe weather; tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large
hail are possible within severe storms. By Monday, the upper
trough responsible for the severe weather in the Southern Plains
takes aim at the Midwest causing severe storms to develop from the
mid-Mississippi River Valley to the Great Lakes with localized
flash flooding also possible. The storm system weakens as it
tracks into the northern Great Lakes on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, an impressive upper trough diving south into the
Pacific Northwest is forecast to produce the first significant
winter storm of the season for the northern and central Rockies.
The storm's associated cold front is set to usher in the coldest
air of the season to date in the western third of the country by
Monday and persisting into Tuesday. In wake for the cold frontal
passage, high winds will ensue from the Great Valley of California
to the Desert Southwest. High Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories
have been issued in advance for a heightened risk for hazardous
wind gusts. Freeze Watches and Warnings have also been posted for
the western Nevada Basin, and portions of Colorado and New Mexico.
As the front crosses the northern Rockies, plummeting snow levels
give way to periods of snow breaking out Monday morning. As the
trough continues to strengthen, so will the evolving frontal
system in the West, causing heavy snow to envelope many mountain
ranges in the Intermountain West. A developing area of low
pressure in the central High Plains keeps heavy snow and gusty
winds in the forecast across the northern and central Rockies.
Latest snowfall forecast indicate anywhere from 12 to 24 inches
(locally higher amounts possible) in the northern Rockies,
including ranges such as the Wasatch, Uinta, Absaroka, Teton, Wind
River, and Big Horns.

This upper trough becomes a vigorous upper low over the Four
Corners region Tuesday morning, setting the stage for yet another
severe weather outbreak in the southern and central Great Plains.
The Storm Prediction Center has an Enhanced Risk for severe
weather from southern Nebraska and central Kansas to parts of the
Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle. While severe weather erupts in the
Plains and cold/snowy conditions take hold of the West, the East
remains under the influence of large scale upper level ridging,
forcing seasonally warm temperatures to stick around from the
Plains to the East Coast.

...Severe weather outbreak and Excessive Rainfall in the Southern
Plains this evening, severe weather in the Great Lakes and
Mississippi Valley on Tuesday...

...Amplifying upper trough to inject some of the coldest air of
the season into the West with heavy mountain snow and much below
normal temperatures; High Winds and freezes in parts of the West...

...Another severe weather outbreak anticipated in the Great Plains
on Tuesday; seasonally warm in the East...

A trio of storm systems are set to unleash a myriad of weather
hazards across the western two-thirds of the Lower 48 the first
half of the week. The first is unfolding in the the northern Great
Lakes and northern Minnesota as an occluded storm system is set to
generate strong-to-severe storms this afternoon and evening. A
second storm system is unfolding in the Southern Plains where a
potent cold front and late season dryline are set to ignite severe
storms this afternoon and evening. A Moderate Risk for severe
weather has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center for central
and eastern Oklahoma while the severe threat extends from
southwest Missouri on south into central Texas. There is also a
Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall in northeast Oklahoma this
evening, meaning there is also a threat for flash flooding. All
modes of severe weather; tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large
hail are possible within severe storms. By Monday, the upper
trough responsible for the severe weather in the Southern Plains
takes aim at the Midwest causing severe storms to develop from the
mid-Mississippi River Valley to the Great Lakes with localized
flash flooding also possible. The storm system weakens as it
tracks into the northern Great Lakes on Tuesday.

...Heavy rain threat over parts of the southern Plains may extend
into Thursday...

...Overview...

Expect an amplified western trough/eastern ridge upper pattern at
the start of the period on Thursday, supporting unseasonably
chilly temperatures over the West and very warm conditions over
the East.  A front extending from low pressure tracking into
Canada will separate the two air masses, with moisture from
eastern Pacific Tropical Storm Pamela (forecast to pass just to
the southeast of the southern tip of Baja California as a major
hurricane around Tuesday night/early Wednesday) likely enhancing
rainfall along the front.  Highest totals are likely over the
southern Plains but some heavy rain is possible farther northeast.
 Then during the weekend into early next week the mean flow will
become less amplified and more progressive.  This will support a
drying trend over the central/eastern U.S. and a moderation of
temperatures closer to normal over much of the lower 48.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The combination of exact timing of the western upper trough as it
emerges into the central U.S. along with timing of Pamela continue
to present forecast challenges for resolving the details of one or
more frontal waves that should track northeastward from the
southern Plains.  Recent GFS runs have tended to be faster than
the ECMWF with the western trough and slower with Pamela.  CMC
runs have been slowest with the western trough and fastest with
Pamela.  A steady faster trend for Pamela in the GFS over the past
12 hours is narrowing that spread though.  After early Friday
UKMET runs have been straying a lot flatter than consensus over
western North America where consensus has been building a
ridge--leading to questionably fast progression of the trough
heading into the East.

By the latter half of the period some Pacific/western North
America details have changed over the past day or so.  Latest
trends are for a more pronounced upper trough to develop south of
Alaska around early next week, ultimately leading to greater
inland progression of the shortwave currently forecast to be
nearing the Pacific Northwest/British Columbia by very early
Sunday.  On the positive side, by day 7 Monday the 12Z/18Z models
and their ensemble means were quite agreeable for the system
tracking across southern Canada and bringing a frontal system into
the northern Plains.  After early Sunday the new 00Z CMC goes
wildly astray from its continuity or other guidance, digging a
deep trough into the West by Monday.  Teleconnections relative to
the upstream Pacific trough greatly favor the other models and
ensemble means.

The updated forecast started with a blend of 12Z/18Z operational
models from Thursday into early Friday but then removed the UKMET
and minimized CMC influence since those models were on opposite
extremes of the envelope over the central/eastern U.S. and the
UKMET compared increasingly poorly to consensus over the West.
The blend eventually went to a model/mean mix consisting mostly of
the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their means.  While the forecast
employed a general blend, some surface details from the southern
Plains northeastward still ended up having somewhat more of an
ECMWF flavor--and are generally maintained in the new 00Z run.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Southern Plains heavy rainfall that should already be in progress
may continue into Thursday, followed by some of the enhanced
rainfall continuing northeastward into portions of the Ohio
Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast during Friday-Saturday.
Guidance has been providing a consistent signal for an upper
trough emerging from the West and moisture from Pamela interacting
with a wavy front to produce the heavy rainfall over the southern
Plains.  However frontal wave details continue to vary
significantly enough in the guidance to keep confidence low for
resolving the most likely axis of potentially heavy rain farther
northeast.  Continue to monitor forecasts as details hopefully
gain more clarity soon.  By Sunday much of the eastern U.S. should
be dry aside from lingering moisture over the eastern Great
Lakes/New England and parts of Florida.

The upper trough initially over the West will produce a brief
period of rain and higher elevation snow over the central Rockies
on Thursday.  Models have been trending steadily higher with
precipitation totals over the past couple days.  Light to moderate
precipitation over the northern Pacific Northwest late this week
may become heavier over the Olympics and northern Cascades around
Saturday with the approach of a Pacific shortwave.  Expect a
lighter trend heading into early next week.

On Thursday the West will see significant coverage of highs 15-30F
below normal with a few record cold highs possible.  Such
anomalies will shrink a little on Friday and more so by Saturday,
with more scattered areas still seeing highs 10F or more below
normal.  Highs should be within a few degrees of normal over the
West by the start of next week while system progression may bring
moderately above normal readings into parts of the Plains by
Sunday-Monday.  In the East, highs will be 10-15F above normal
over at least the northern two-thirds of the region Thursday into
Saturday while anomalies for morning lows will be even higher,
possibly exceeding plus 20F from the Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes
into the central Appalachians.  A broad area of record warm lows
will be possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley northeastward.
Progression of the Plains cold front into the East will erode the
warmth from the west late week into the weekend, ultimately
bringing near to slightly below normal highs to the East by
Sunday-Monday.

UKMET runs have been straying a lot flatter than consensus over
western North America where consensus has been building a
ridge--leading to questionably fast progression of the trough
heading into the East.

By the latter half of the period some Pacific/western North
America details have changed over the past day or so.  Latest
trends are for a more pronounced upper trough to develop south of
Alaska around early next week, ultimately leading to greater
inland progression of the shortwave currently forecast to be
nearing the Pacific Northwest/British Columbia by very early
Sunday.  On the positive side, by day 7 Monday the 12Z/18Z models
and their ensemble means were quite agreeable for the system
tracking across southern Canada and bringing a frontal system into
the northern Plains.  After early Sunday the new 00Z CMC goes
wildly astray from its continuity or other guidance, digging a
deep trough into the West by Monday.  Teleconnections relative to
the upstream Pacific trough greatly favor the other models and
ensemble means.

The updated forecast started with a blend of 12Z/18Z operational
models from Thursday into early Friday but then removed the UKMET
and minimized CMC influence since those models were on opposite
extremes of the envelope over the central/eastern U.S. and the
UKMET compared increasingly poorly to consensus over the West.
The blend eventually went to a model/mean mix consisting mostly of
the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their means.  While the forecast
employed a general blend, some surface details from the southern
Plains northeastward still ended up having somewhat more of an
ECMWF flavor--and are generally maintained in the new 00Z run.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Southern Plains heavy rainfall that should already be in progress
may continue into Thursday, followed by some of the enhanced
rainfall continuing northeastward into portions of the Ohio
Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast during Friday-Saturday.
Guidance has been providing a consistent signal for an upper
trough emerging from the West and moisture from Pamela interacting
with a wavy front to produce the heavy rainfall over the southern
Plains.  However frontal wave details continue to vary
significantly enough in the guidance to keep confidence low for
resolving the most likely axis of potentially heavy rain farther
northeast.  Continue to monitor forecasts as details hopefully
gain more clarity soon.  By Sunday much of the eastern U.S. should
be dry aside from lingering moisture over the eastern Great
Lakes/New England and parts of Florida.

The upper trough initially over the West will produce a brief
period of rain and higher elevation snow over the central Rockies
on Thursday.  Models have been trending steadily higher with
precipitation totals over the past couple days.  Light to moderate
precipitation over the northern Pacific Northwest late this week
may become heavier over the Olympics and northern Cascades around
Saturday with the approach of a Pacific shortwave.  Expect a
lighter trend heading into early next week.

On Thursday the West will see significant coverage of highs 15-30F
below normal with a few record cold highs possible.  Such
anomalies will shrink a little on Friday and more so by Saturday,
with more scattered areas still seeing highs 10F or more below
normal.  Highs should be within a few degrees of normal over the
West by the start of next week while system progression may bring
moderately above normal readings into parts of the Plains by
Sunday-Monday.  In the East, highs will be 10-15F above normal
over at least the northern two-thirds of the region Thursday into
Saturday while anomalies for morning lows will be even higher,
possibly exceeding plus 20F from the Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes
into the central Appalachians.  A broad area of record warm lows
will be possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley northeastward.
Progression of the Plains cold front into the East will erode the
warmth from the west late week into the weekend, ultimately
bringing near to slightly below normal highs to the East by
Sunday-Monday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF
CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-/upper-level low will lift northeast from the southern
Plains toward the Great Lakes today, while at the same time, a
powerful mid-/upper-level jet dives south over California. The
western jet will strengthen to over 100 knots on Monday as it carves
out a 500-millibar trough across the western United States.

At the surface, a low will slowly fill between Monday and Tuesday
mornings as it moves from southwest Missouri into northern
Wisconsin. A second low will deepen across southern Nevada on Monday
due to the strengthening mid-/upper-level jet across California.
This low will move through northern Arizona overnight Monday on its
way to southern Utah by Tuesday morning.

... Central Valley of California ...

As the Nevada surface low deepens, the surface-pressure gradient
across California will correspondingly increase, yielding strong,
northerly surface winds across much of California. At the same time,
strong diurnal heating will allow for downward momentum transport of
the increasing mid-level jet, supporting stronger, gustier winds
than the surface-pressure gradient alone supports.

Winds will range from 15-25 mph near coastal areas of northern
California to in excess of 60 mph atop favored peaks, with
widespread winds around 30 mph across much of the critical area.
Relative humidity should fall into the teens across most areas on
Monday, with overnight recoveries ranging from 25% in some areas to
more than 50%, especially in favored/sheltered valleys. With fuels
across the area receptive to rapid fire spread owing to the
long-term drought, widespread elevated and critical fire conditions
are likely on Monday into Monday night.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0216 AM CDT Mon Oct 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level low, found in the basal region of the western
United States large-scale trough, will move from northern Arizona
into western Nebraska during the forecast period. As this occurs,
the strong mid-/upper-level jet will weaken across California as it
strengthens across New Mexico and Colorado.

At the surface, the low across Utah early Tuesday morning will
redevelop farther east, across the plains of Colorado by midday
Tuesday. This low will deepen throughout the afternoon as it lifts
north toward the Nebraska Panhandle due to the strengthening
mid-level jet overhead. Farther west, the strong surface-pressure
gradient across California from Monday will relax as the
aforementioned Utah low redevelops farther east.

... Southern and Central High Plains ...

As the surface low deepens and lifts north from Colorado into
Nebraska, southwest winds locally more than 25 mph will develop
across the Colorado plains. The westerly component of the low-level
wind field will result in downsloping and increased adiabatic
warming/drying. Adiabatic warming/drying, in turn, results in
increased vertical mixing, which typically further reduces the
relative humidity. However, in this case, an elevated moist plume
drawn north from the Pacific by the strong mid-level trough is
present. Thus, increased vertical mixing will limit the overall
reduction in relative humidity and therefore mitigate the overall
fire risk. However, given the strength of the low-level wind field
and fuel ERC values expected to be greater than the 90th percentile,
at least elevated fire conditions are expected. If the elevated
moist plume is weaker/drier than currently anticipated, critical
fire weather conditions will be likely. The evolution of this
elevated moist plume will be monitored for future forecasts.

Farther south, across the Texas Panhandle, meteorological conditions
will be similar to the Colorado plains. However, widespread wetting
rains occurred on Sunday, tempering the fire threat for Tuesday.
Future forecasts will reassess fuel trends for potential expansion
of the elevated fire area into the Texas Panhandle.

Even farther south, across West Texas and southeast New Mexico,
surface winds will not be as strong as on Sunday, given the farther
north position of the main mid-level low. However, even a modest
response in the surface winds will result in winds near 20 mph, with
stronger gusts likely. With afternoon relative humidity in the
teens, elevated fire weather conditions will result.

... Central Valley of California and Coastal Areas of Southern
California ...

Strong northerly surface winds will be ongoing at the start of the
forecast period Tuesday in response to a strong surface-pressure
gradient across the region. Please see the current Day 1 Fire
Outlook for more details about the evolution of this surface
pattern. For many areas, the peak surface-pressure gradient winds
will occur during the peak in overnight relative-humidity recovery.
As diurnal heating results in decreasing relative humidity, the
surface-pressure gradient will already be weakening in response to
the filling Utah surface low. As such, the strongest winds and
minimum relative humidity should be offset just enough to preclude
critical fire weather conditions, however, another day of widespread
elevated fire concerns is in store.

...Severe weather and heavy rain over the southern Plains this
morning will spread towards the Great Lakes tonight...

...A powerful low pressure system is forecast to bring heavy
mountain snow, high winds and freezes to various parts of the
West...

...Another severe weather outbreak anticipated for the central to
southern Plains on Tuesday...

The stage is set for a large and powerful low pressure system to
form over the mid-section of the country as an outbreak of cold
air is surging into the Pacific Northwest behind a sharp cold
front.  The coldest air of the season to date will be ushered into
the western states today and into Tuesday behind the sharp front,
bringing high winds from the Great Valley of California to the
Desert Southwest, where High Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories
have been issued in advance for a heightened risk for hazardous
wind gusts.  An impressive upper-level trough will then interact
with the front to produce the first significant winter storm of
the season for the northern and central Rockies on Tuesday into
early Wednesday.  Latest snowfall forecast indicate anywhere from
12 to 24 inches (locally higher amounts possible) in the northern
Rockies, including ranges such as the Wasatch, Uinta, Absaroka,
Teton, Wind River, and Big Horns.  In addition, high winds will
likely result in blowing and drifting of the snow during the
height of the storm over parts of the northern and central Rockies
Tuesday night into early Wednesday.

In the meantime, a low pressure system currently bringing severe
weather and heavy rainfall across the central and southern Plains
this morning will head northeastward and reach the Great Lakes by
Tuesday morning.  The severe storms should be most intense this
morning over the Plains but they should gradually weaken with time
as they move into the Mississippi Valley, the Midwest, and
eventually the Great Lakes later today and tonight.
This upper trough becomes a vigorous upper low over the Four
Corners region Tuesday morning, setting the stage for yet another
severe weather outbreak in the southern and central Great Plains.
The Storm Prediction Center has an Enhanced Risk for severe
weather from southern Nebraska and central Kansas to parts of the
Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle. Excessive Rainfall is also possible
in parts of the Great Plains on Tuesday. While severe weather
erupts in the Plains and cold/snowy conditions take hold of the
West, the East remains under the influence of large scale upper
level ridging, forcing seasonally warm temperatures to stick
around from the Plains to the East Coast.

front with pesky low pressure systems are forecast to linger just
off the East Coast, with the associated rainfall expected to stay
largely offshore.  On the West Coast, some record low temperatures
are possible especially on Tuesday morning.  By later on Tuesday,
the next wave of Pacific moisture is forecast to reach the Pacific
Northwest.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1055 AM CDT Mon Apr 18 2022

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

The main change made to this forecast was to trim the eastward
extent of the Elevated across western Iowa to account for recent
snowfall. Otherwise, the widespread 20+ mph sustained northwesterly
surface winds depicted by observations should continue into the
afternoon, when RH is expected to dip into the 20-35 percent range.
The previous forecast remains on track across the Desert Southwest,
which is under sunny skies and should remain so through the day,
promoting ample boundary-layer mixing to support widespread,
high-end Elevated to locally Critical fire weather conditions. 15-20
mph sustained southerly winds (locally higher in terrain-favoring
locations) will coincide with 10-20 percent RH for at least a few
hours around afternoon peak heating.

..Squitieri.. 04/18/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Mon Apr 18 2022/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale ridge will be situated over the western CONUS, while a
midlevel trough moves eastward across the Upper MS Valley and Great
Lakes region. At the surface, high pressure will encompass most of
the Great Plains, with a tight surface pressure gradient along its
eastern and western peripheries.

...Southwest into the south-central Rockies and High Plains...
Over the Southwest, diurnal heating/mixing will yield 5-15 percent
RH by the afternoon. At the same time, enhanced midlevel flow will
mix down to the surface, resulting in 15-20 mph sustained westerly
surface winds. For the south-central Rockies and adjacent High
Plains, downslope warming/drying and diurnal heating will allow for
15-20 percent RH by peak heating. Here, sustained southerly surface
winds of 15-20 mph will develop in response to the tightening
surface pressure gradient. These meteorological conditions combined
with modestly receptive fuels will support elevated to spotty
critical conditions.

...Middle MO Valley...
Deep/strong northwesterly flow on the backside of the
eastward-advancing midlevel trough will overspread the MO Valley --
where a tight surface pressure gradient will be in place. This will
result in 15-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds amid 25-30
percent RH. While the marginal RH reductions cast uncertainty on the
overall fire-weather risk, the strong/gusty winds atop very dry
fuels (ERCs exceeding the 90th percentile) should generally
compensate for this.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 18 2022

SYNOPSIS: A substantial warm-up is forecast across much of the east-central
contiguous U.S. during the week-1 period as mid-level high pressure progres=
ses
through the region. This is forecast to accelerate spring bloom across
northern
areas that have seen limited growth thus far. However, by the start of week=
-2,
the mid-level pattern is forecast to flip to a much colder pattern across t=
he
East, leading to a potential agricultural hazard across portions of the Cor=
n
Belt, Midwest, and Ohio Valley, where following a short period of anomalous=
ly
warm temperatures, minimum temperatures cold enough to support frost are
forecast to become more likely over newly susceptible vegetation. Elsewhere
across the forecast domain, a more tranquil pattern is forecast with the
mid-level flow favored to become more zonal later in week-2, precluding
inclusions of any additional areas of hazardous weather in the forecast.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Norther=
n
and Central Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and O=
hio
Valley, Tue-Wed, Apr 26-27.

Slight risk for much below normal temperatures for portions of the Great
Plains, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, Appalachians, Great Lakes=
,
Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, Tue-Mon, Apr 26-May 2.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 21 - MONDAY APRIL 25:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!qCvuAWyhve2Gl0QchsJ3QQbiUKkXotF9QgBJ1BpEFEUBKMoLMZ5qF6H6nhpyJ=
w9lVZIMnYT6$

FOR TUESDAY APRIL 26 - MONDAY MAY 02: Later in week-1, anomalous ridging is
forecast to amplify across the east-central CONUS, resulting in elevated
chances for above normal temperatures. However, this warm-up is forecast to=
 be
short-lived as the predicted negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillati=
on
(NAO), combined with the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) reemerging in phas=
es
8
and 1, both support a return to a colder pattern across the eastern half of
the
CONUS. Following a period of maximum temperatures in the 60s and 70s deg F
over
much of the east-central CONUS (possibly reaching 80 deg F in the Middle
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys), minimum temperatures may again fall below 40
deg
F at the outset of week-2 as troughing expands over the northeastern CONUS.
This presents a major concern for agriculture as the sudden warm up will
likely
accelerate vegetation growth across portions of the Midwest and Ohio Valley=
,
and be immediately followed by temperatures cold enough to support a crop
damaging frost. Due to the increased risk for agricultural impacts, a moder=
ate
risk for much below normal temperatures is highlighted across portions of t=
he
Northern and Central Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lak=
es,
and the Ohio Valley on Apr 26-27, where there is at least a 40 percent chan=
ce
minimum temperatures fall below 40 deg F (supporting potential frost) based=
 on
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast guidance. Vegetation is less of a concern farther=
 to
the north across the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley. However,
the
strongest signals for anomalous cold are over these areas, with both
reforecast
tools depicting a 40-60 percent chance for minimum temperatures falling bel=
ow
the 15th climatological percentile, with uncalibrated ECMWF and GEFS ensemb=
le
mean minimum temperatures in the teens and 20s deg F.



A broader slight risk for much below normal temperatures is posted for much=
 of
the east-central CONUS for all of week-2, where the ECMWF and GEFS reforeca=
st
tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance minimum temperatures fall below
the
15th climatological percentile and 40 deg F. Due to the upstream blocking
forecast to be in place, the ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensembles all show t=
he
troughing amplifying across the Northeast toward the end of the period, whi=
ch
would result in a cool start to May across much of the East. The troughing
also
supports the development of surface low pressure along the Northeast coast,
and
increased potential for enhanced rainfall, but the reforecast tools do not
highlight any widespread areas where precipitation totals reach hazardous
thresholds, precluding a related precipitation hazard.



Elsewhere across the CONUS and Alaska, a quieter pattern is forecast
underneath
a more zonal mid-level flow pattern. There is potential for above normal
temperatures across the Southwest early in the period, with some of the
hottest
locations in the deserts possibly topping 100 deg F. However, this level of
heat is becoming more typical for the region, and no related hazard is
included. No hazards are indicated across Alaska, with near to above normal
temperatures and near to below normal precipitation favored for much of the
state.

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 21 2022 - 12Z Mon Apr 25 2022

...Additional snow and cold weather anticipated for portions of
the Northern Plains Friday night into Saturday night...

...Weather Pattern Overview...
A quasi-zonal flow pattern aloft becomes more amplified Thursday
night as a large low off the Pacific Northwest opens and digs
southeast over California before crossing the Intermountain West
Friday and slowing as it closes again as it drifts over the
northern Plains late Friday night through Saturday night. Surface
cyclogenesis over the central High Plains is expected by Friday
evening before tracking up through the north-central Plains into
Sunday. Showers and thunderstorms will develop ahead of the low on
both on the warm and cold fronts with substantial rain for the
Mid-South likely in the Sunday timeframe. Meanwhile, a downstream
ridge axis builds across the eastern U.S. and results in a
considerable warming trend for the weekend continuing into next
week.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...
Above average agreement on the main synoptic scale features are
apparent among the latest global guidance into this weekend.
Similar to recent days, the 06Z GFS was more progressive with the
axis of the main trough across the central/northern Plains, and
definitely stronger by 12Z Saturday compared to the 00Z
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET which were in close agreement with their depiction
of the closed low evolving over the Dakotas by early Sunday. So
far among 12Z guidance, the 12Z GFS/CMC/UKMET have slowed, likely
leaving the 12Z GFS still the most progressive deterministic
solution with the deepest northern Plains low. By Sunday,
deterministic guidance are in decent agreement on the depiction of
the next storm system near the Gulf of Alaska, but considerable
model spread is apparent with the timing of the surface low over
the north-central U.S. with the 12Z CMC the slowest. A
multi-deterministic model blend was used for Days 3-5 with minor
inclusions of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECENS beyond the 144hr forecast
period of the UKMET (Days 6/7).

...Sensible Weather/Threats...
Moderate to heavy precipitation with snow levels generally 5500ft
to 6500ft will continue to spread down the Sierra Nevada Thursday
before easing Thursday night as the digging upper trough moves
inland. This spring event will deliver some highly beneficial
precipitation to drought-stricken areas of California, with the
potential for 1-2+ inches of rain in some areas of central and
northern California, and 1-3 feet of snow for the High Sierra.
Moderate to locally heavy rain/mountain snow (snow levels
generally about 7000ft) then progresses ahead of the upper trough
across the Intermountain West Thursday night through Friday.

Organized showers and thunderstorm are expected to develop across
the central Plains/Midwest and north Thursday night through this
weekend as Gulf moisture is advected northward ahead of the
western trough. Additional moderate to heavy snow is expected for
portions of the northern Rockies Friday, spilling onto the
northern High Plains Friday night into Saturday night. The threat
for heavy snow remains across the western Dakotas and eastern
Montana/Wyoming, likely affecting the similar areas to the recent
blizzard and subsequent storms.

In terms of temperatures, a major warming trend is forecast for
much of the eastern half of the nation going into the weekend,
along with increasing humidity levels, in response to deep
southerly flow ahead of the central U.S. storm system. One of the
caveats in the temperature forecast will be the presence of a back
door cold front/cold air damming for the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast U.S. this weekend, with potentially a big contrast over
a relatively short distance near the wedge front. It will likely
remain uncomfortably cold from Montana to North Dakota and
northern Minnesota with near-freezing highs running 20 to 25
degrees below normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0245 PM CDT Mon Apr 18 2022

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN WYOMING INTO FAR WESTERN
NEBRASKA...

Fire weather highlights have been expanded across the Southwest into
the High Plains for this outlook. Specifically, Critical highlights
have been added to portions of eastern Wyoming into far western
Nebraska and extreme southwestern South Dakota. Guidance consensus
has trended drier and winder in the central High Plains, where
meaningful precipitation accumulations have been largely absent in
the past week. As such, grass-based fuels should be at least
modestly receptive to wildfire-spread given the forecast 20+ mph
sustained westerly surface winds overlapping 15 percent RH
tomorrow/Tuesday afternoon.

Guidance has also trended drier and winder across portions of
southern New Mexico into northern Arizona and far southern Nevada,
where Critical highlights have been expanded. Overall, 20-30 mph
sustained westerly winds coinciding with 15 percent RH are still
forecast to overspread modestly to highly receptive fuel beds
(especially in low-terrain areas) across the Southwest. Finally, dry
and occasionally breezy conditions are still anticipated tomorrow
afternoon across the west-central Florida Peninsula. However, the
lack of a stronger surface wind field on a widespread basis
precludes fire weather highlights this outlook.

..Squitieri.. 04/18/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Mon Apr 18 2022/

...Synopsis...
Enhanced midlevel westerly flow will impinge on the central and
southern Rockies on Tuesday, resulting in a deepening lee trough
over the High Plains.

...Southwest into the south-central Rockies and High Plains...
Downslope warming/drying combined with diurnal heating will result
in widespread 10-15 percent RH across the Southwest into the
south-central Rockies and High Plains. Here, a tight surface
pressure gradient along the southern periphery of the lee troughing
will favor widespread 20-30 mph sustained westerly surface winds.
These conditions, combined with increasingly dry fuels, will support
enhanced fire-weather conditions. While critical meteorological
conditions will be possible into Arizona, fuels are generally not as
receptive to wildfire spread.

...Southern Florida...
Diurnal heating of a dry post-frontal airmass could result in
minimum RH of 20-30 percent over inland areas. However, recent
rainfall and generally light surface winds should mitigate the
fire-weather threat.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon April 18 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 24 - 28 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting above normal 500-
hPa
heights across most of the higher latitudes of North America, consistent wi=
th
a
transition to the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO).. In the me=
an
mid-level height fields, a ridge over the Bering Sea is forecast, leading t=
o a
troughing downstream across the Gulf of Alaska. Slightly anomalous ridging =
is
likely farther downstream, across parts of the western CONUS. Another troug=
h
is
predicted over the north central CONUS, with below normal 500-hPa heights,
while above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast to remain over the eastern
CONUS.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored over much of Alaska associate=
d
with predicted near to above normal heights. Probabilities for near to abov=
e
normal temperatures are increased across much of the southwestern CONUS due=
 to
relatively higher mid-level heights. Increased probabilities of below norma=
l
temperatures are favored for parts of the Northwest, the Central and Northe=
rn
Plains and the western Great Lakes region in association with forecast
troughing and consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Probabilitie=
s
for near to above normal temperatures are increased across the eastern CONU=
S
and the Lower Mississippi Valley ahead of the troughing.

There is good agreement among the ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian models regardin=
g
cyclogenesis across the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, potentially
increasing precipitation chances across much of the east-central CONUS duri=
ng
the period. Above normal precipitation probabilities remain increased acros=
s
most of Texas, consistent with the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools. Above
normal precipitation is also favored for the northwestern CONUS, as troughi=
ng
is forecast to approach the Pacific Northwest. Enhanced probabilities for n=
ear
to below normal precipitation are indicated for much of the southwestern CO=
NUS
during the period related to predicted ridging. Below normal precipitation
probabilities are also increased across parts of the Northern and Central
Plains, supported by the consolidated forecast tool. Ahead of ridging over =
the

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 26 - MAY 02, 2022

During week-2, 500-hPa troughing is favored to propagate across the eastern
CONUS resulting in below normal heights in the manual blend over much of th=
e
eastern CONUS. An enhanced 500-hPa ridge is forecast to cross the western
CONUS. Ridging is forecast over the Bering Sea and parts of Alaska, while a
trough is predicted downstream over the Northeast Pacific and the Northwest=
ern
CONUS.
Given the predicted propagation of anomalous troughing across the eastern
CONUS, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate elevated
probabilities
for below normal temperatures across most of the eastern half CONUS, except
above normal temperature probabilities are increased over southern Florida
Peninsula. Below normal temperature probabilities are increased over the
Northwest related to the troughing over the northeast Pacific. Both reforec=
ast
tools continue to depict increased probabilities for above normal temperatu=
res
across the Southwest due to the ridging. Elevated probabilities for near to
above normal temperatures remain favored for western Mainland Alaska due to
forecast ridging.

Increased chances for near to above normal precipitation are favored for th=
e
eastern CONUS due to troughing forecast to propagate across the CONUS.
Elevated
probabilities for above normal pricipitation are indicated over parts of th=
e
Northwest and the Northern High Plains along with increased potential for
surface low development and frontal activity. Both reforecast tools support
enhanced below normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, and the Central and Southern Plains.
Increased chances for below normal precipitation are indicated for the
southwestern CONUS due to persistent ridging. Riding with above normal 500-=
hPa
heights over Alaska favors slightly increased chances for below normal
precipitation across parts of southern Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 10% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
the potential for a significant pattern change during the period and
associated
substantial model disagreements.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Late season snow for the interior Northeast on Monday night
through Tuesday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average east of the
Plains...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern Rockies...

On Monday evening, an upper-level low over the Great Lakes will
move slowly off the Northeast Coast by Wednesday evening. The
system will produce snow from parts of the Great Lakes to the
Northeast and Central Appalachians. The snow will end from west to
east by late Tuesday night. Heavy snow will fall over interior
portions of New York State and northeastern Pennsylvania through
Tuesday late afternoon. Rain will develop over parts of the Ohio
Valley and move into parts of the Mid-Atlantic and coastal New
England through Tuesday morning. In addition, showers and
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic Coast through Monday evening. Furthermore,
temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average east of the
Plains under the upper-level low. The temperatures will start to
moderate on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, a front over the Pacific Northwest will move to the
Upper Midwest to Southern Plains by Wednesday evening. The system
will produce coastal rain and higher elevation snow over the
Pacific Northwest and Northern California into late Tuesday night.
The light snow expands into the Northern Intermountain Region by
Tuesday morning and parts of the Northern Rockies by Tuesday
evening. Overnight Tuesday, snow will develop over parts of the
Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley as the system moves
onto the Plains. The snow ends over the Northern Plains by
Wednesday afternoon and continues over the Upper Mississippi
Valley. The northwest coast of Lake Superior will get
lake-enhanced snow on Wednesday. Additionally, upper-level energy
over the Southern Rockies/Southern Plains and moist flow off the
Western Gulf of Mexico will produce showers and thunderstorms over
parts of Southern Plains on Tuesday into Tuesday evening.

On Wednesday, moisture will continue to stream northward over the
Plains, aiding in the development of showers and thunderstorms
over the Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley. Rain will also develop over parts of the Northern Central
Plains and move into the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley by
Wednesday evening.

Moreover, the SPC has issued an Elevated Risk of fire weather over
the Southwest to Southern Rockies and far eastern Nebraska and
western Iowa through Tuesday morning. The fire weather hazard is
due to gusty winds, dry fuels, and low humidity. However, the fire
weather risk increases to a Critical Risk over parts of the
Southern Rockies on Tuesday.

...Additional snow and cold weather anticipated for portions of
the Northern Plains Friday night into Saturday night...

...Weather Pattern Overview...
A quasi-zonal flow pattern aloft becomes more amplified Thursday
night as a large low off the Pacific Northwest opens and digs
southeast over California before crossing the Intermountain West
Friday and slowing as it closes again as it drifts over the
northern Plains late Friday night through Saturday night. Surface
cyclogenesis over the central High Plains is expected by Friday
evening before tracking up through the north-central Plains into
Sunday. Showers and thunderstorms will develop ahead of the low on
both on the warm and cold fronts with substantial rain for the
Mid-South likely in the Sunday timeframe. Meanwhile, a downstream
ridge axis builds across the eastern U.S. and results in a
considerable warming trend for the weekend continuing into next
week.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...
Above average agreement on the main synoptic scale features are
apparent among the latest global guidance into this weekend.
Similar to recent days, the 06Z GFS was more progressive with the
axis of the main trough across the central/northern Plains, and
definitely stronger by 12Z Saturday compared to the 00Z
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET which were in close agreement with their depiction
of the closed low evolving over the Dakotas by early Sunday. So
far among 12Z guidance, the 12Z GFS/CMC/UKMET have slowed, likely
leaving the 12Z GFS still the most progressive deterministic
solution with the deepest northern Plains low. By Sunday,
deterministic guidance are in decent agreement on the depiction of
the next storm system near the Gulf of Alaska, but considerable
model spread is apparent with the timing of the surface low over
the north-central U.S. with the 12Z CMC the slowest. A
multi-deterministic model blend was used for Days 3-5 with minor
inclusions of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECENS beyond the 144hr forecast
period of the UKMET (Days 6/7).

...Sensible Weather/Threats...
Moderate to heavy precipitation with snow levels generally 5500ft
to 6500ft will continue to spread down the Sierra Nevada Thursday
before easing Thursday night as the digging upper trough moves
inland. This spring event will deliver some highly beneficial
precipitation to drought-stricken areas of California, with the
potential for 1-2+ inches of rain in some areas of central and
northern California, and 1-3 feet of snow for the High Sierra.
Moderate to locally heavy rain/mountain snow (snow levels
generally about 7000ft) then progresses ahead of the upper trough
across the Intermountain West Thursday night through Friday.

Organized showers and thunderstorm are expected to develop across
the central Plains/Midwest and north Thursday night through this
weekend as Gulf moisture is advected northward ahead of the
western trough. Additional moderate to heavy snow is expected for
portions of the northern Rockies Friday, spilling onto the
northern High Plains Friday night into Saturday night. The threat
for heavy snow remains across the western Dakotas and eastern
Montana/Wyoming, likely affecting the similar areas to the recent
blizzard and subsequent storms.

In terms of temperatures, a major warming trend is forecast for
much of the eastern half of the nation going into the weekend,
along with increasing humidity levels, in response to deep
southerly flow ahead of the central U.S. storm system. One of the
caveats in the temperature forecast will be the presence of a back
door cold front/cold air damming for the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast U.S. this weekend, with potentially a big contrast over
a relatively short distance near the wedge front. It will likely
remain uncomfortably cold from Montana to North Dakota and
northern Minnesota with near-freezing highs running 20 to 25
degrees below normal.

caveats in the temperature forecast will be the presence of a back
door cold front/cold air damming for the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast U.S. this weekend, with potentially a big contrast over
a relatively short distance near the wedge front. It will likely
remain uncomfortably cold from Montana to North Dakota and
northern Minnesota with near-freezing highs running 20 to 25
degrees below normal.

***Threat of winter storm increasing for portions of the Northern
Plains this weekend***

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The upper level pattern over the continental U.S. becomes more
amplified by the end of the week and into the weekend as a large
synoptic scale trough from the Pacific moves inland across the
Intermountain West, and this will spur surface cyclogenesis across
the High Plains by Friday night.  This low will then track across
the Upper Midwest through early Sunday, with a trailing front
across the Mississippi River Valley that will fuel showers and
storms.  Meanwhile, a downstream ridge axis builds across the
eastern U.S. and results in a considerable warming trend for the
weekend.  Another Pacific trough approaches the northwestern U.S.
by the beginning of next week.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The 00Z model guidance suite appears to have above average
agreement on the main synoptic scale features through early
Saturday, with just some minor differences in the timing of the
upper trough evolution over the western states.  The GFS is not as
progressive as earlier runs with the axis of the main trough axis
across the central/northern Plains, although the CMC is slower in
lifting the trough/closed low out of the region.  By early next
week, the models are in good agreement on the depiction of another
storm system over the northeast Pacific Ocean, but model
differences still exist with the degree of upper level ridging
ahead of that feature across the Intermountain West.  A nearly
multi-deterministic model blend was incorporated as a starting
point for Friday and Saturday, and then more of the ECMWF/ECENS
was used going forward into early next week along with some of the
GFS and GEFS mean.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The threat of a noteworthy winter storm is increasing with time
for western North Dakota and portions of eastern Montana for the
upcoming weekend on the backside of the intensifying surface low,
where a well-defined deformation zone will likely exist.  This
will likely be coupled with strong northerly winds owing to the
tight pressure gradient that will be in place, and this could
result in blizzard conditions for some areas if these model trends
continue.  Moderate to heavy snow is also likely for the northern
Rockies through early Saturday, and this will also include the
higher terrain of northern Utah and central Colorado.

Heavy showers and thunderstorms could also make weather headlines
on Sunday and going into early Monday across the central U.S. as a
deep surge of Gulf moisture advects northward and interacts with a
slow moving surface cold front with multiple shortwave
perturbations moving overhead.  This will likely be in the form of
multiple mesoscale convective complexes with repeating rounds of
convection, and some strong to severe storms are also possible.

In terms of temperatures, a major warming trend is forecast for
much of the eastern half of the nation going into the weekend,
along with increasing humidity levels, in response to deep
southerly flow ahead of the central U.S. storm system.  One of the
caveats in the temperature forecast will be the presence of a back
door cold front/cold air damming for the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast U.S. this weekend, with potentially a big contrast over
a relatively short distance near the front.  It will likely remain
uncomfortably cold from Montana to North Dakota and northern
Minnesota with near-freezing highs running 15 to 25 degrees below
normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN WYOMING INTO WESTERN
NEBRASKA...

...Synopsis...
A belt of strong westerly midlevel flow will cross the northern and
central Rockies, maintaining broad surface lee troughing over the
High Plains. Farther east, a dry continental airmass will remain in
place over the southeastern CONUS.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Diurnal heating/mixing of a dry airmass will result in widespread
10-15 percent minimum RH, where 20-25 mph sustained westerly surface
winds are expected. These meteorological conditions, combined with
increasingly dry fuels, will yield critical fire-weather conditions
primarily over New Mexico.

...Eastern Wyoming into western Nebraska...
Strong downslope flow combined with diurnal heating will favor 15-20
percent RH in the lee of the Rockies over eastern Wyoming into
western Nebraska. At the same time, sustained westerly surface winds
of 25+ mph will overspread highly receptive fuels. Therefore,
Critical highlights are in place where the best overlap of the
strong surface winds and dry boundary-layer conditions are expected.

...Eastern Montana...
Strong west-northwesterly surface winds of 25-35 mph (with higher
gusts) will develop across parts of eastern Montana, where
downsloping could yield 25-35 percent minimum RH. While the latest
guidance suggests that fuels are not receptive to wildfire spread,
trends will need to be monitored.

...Florida Peninsula...
Breezy easterly surface winds near 15 mph are expected across the
Florida Peninsula. While uncertain, diurnal heating/mixing over the
western portions of the peninsula could result in a small corridor
of 35 percent minimum RH. Confidence in the overlap of the breezy
surface winds and low RH is too low to introduce highlights at this
time, though trends will be monitored.

830 AM EST Thu Nov 18 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

The December-January-February 2021-2022 temperature outlook depicts elevate=
d
odds of above-normal seasonal mean temperatures for most of the southern ha=
lf
of the U.S. and for the eastern third of the nation. The greatest likelihoo=
d
for above normal temperatures are located in the Northeast and Southeast.
Below
normal temperatures are most likely for most of Alaska, the Pacific Northwe=
st,
and northern Idaho, Montana, and parts of western North and South Dakota.



For precipitation, above-normal seasonal precipitation amounts are favored =
for
the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley. Drie=
r
than normal conditions are most likely for the southern tier of the U.S. fr=
om
California eastward to the Southeast. The greatest likelihood of below-norm=
al
precipitation is in southern New Mexico, parts of western Texas, and south
Florida.



La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions persist in the Pacific Ocean and are fo=
recasted to remain
through spring 2022. The influence of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa contributed =
substantially to
the
temperature and precipitation outlooks through the winter months into Sprin=
g
2022.

BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS
Note:  For Graphical Displays of the Forecast Tools Discussed Below See:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictio=
ns/90day/tools/briefing__;!!DZ3fjg!rctZw7PEgVSQd4T4LR2X890wYQwxWUCSUUDdKtZD=
OKjf7YBm03y4I05paxF7D7mBleNZs595$

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions have strengthened in the Pacific Ocean =
as indicated by
both
ocean and atmospheric indicators. The La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa advisory iss=
ued in early
October
remains in effect for the November forecast, and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa c=
onditions are
expected to persist through the Northern Hemisphere winter and into spring
2022, followed by enhanced probability of ENSO neutral conditions in late
spring through summer. Equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies
are
negative from west of the date line to the South American coast with anomal=
ies
ranging from -0.7 to -1.0 degrees C. The latest weekly Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
o 3.4 region sea
surface temperature anomaly was -0.8 degrees C. Negative subsurface
temperature
anomalies have persisted across the eastern Pacific Ocean for the past two
months, though have weakened since mid-October. A reservoir of colder than
normal water is observed along the equator from 160W to 90W ranging from 0 =
to
200 meters in depth, surpassing -0.6 degrees C at the peak from 130W to 120=
W.
Positive subsurface temperature anomalies have expanded from the western
Pacific to the central Pacific in recent observations. Current upper ocean
heat
content remains negative, reflecting La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions.



The expansion of positive subsurface temperature anomalies and slight
weakening
of the cold reservoir support current La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions t=
hat are forecasted
to
persist through the winter and weaken into the spring and summer 2022.



The atmospheric state remains consistent with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa with=
 suppressed
convection over the western and central Pacific ocean and enhanced convecti=
on
observed around Indonesia. Low-level easterly wind anomalies were present o=
ver
the western and east-central equatorial Pacific Ocean, with upper level
westerly wind anomalies observed over the western equatorial Pacific,
consistent with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions.



Below-normal sea surface temperatures are present off the southern and west=
ern
coasts of Alaska, consistent with the La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa atmospheric =
response. Western
U.S. sea surface temperatures have shifted to neutral from anomalously cold=
 in
mid- to late- October. Neutral to below-normal sea surface temperatures are
present in the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard, with anomalously warm sea
surface temperatures off the northeastern coast in the Gulf Stream.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

The CPC Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo 3.4 SST consolidation forecast predicts anoma=
lously cold SSTs in
DJF 2021-2022 between -1.5 and -2.0 degrees C. The CPC Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
o 3.4 SST
consolidation forecast predicts that SSTs indicating La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDa conditions
continue but weaken though at least MAM, as negative SST anomalies weaken f=
rom
between -1.5 and -2 degrees C in DJF to above -0.5 degrees C in MAM. The
dynamical model sources such as those from the North American Multi-Model
Ensemble (NMME) favor a moderate La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa in DJF with the e=
nsemble mean
reaching
about -1.5 degrees C. Ensemble spread is large in DJF, with some members
predicting a stronger La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa with SST anomalies nearing -=
3 degrees C, and
others a weaker La Nina with SST anomalies near -0.5 degrees C. The NMME
predicts still negative but weakening SST anomalies from DJF, with SST
anomalies forecast by the ensemble mean weakening to -0.5 degrees C in MAM.
The
CPC / IRI official ENSO outlook depicts high probabilities for La Ni=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDa (90%)
in
DJF, decreasing to a 50% probability of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa or ENSO Ne=
utral conditions in
MAM. AMJ through JJA depict enhanced odds (over 50%) for ENSO neutral
conditions.

PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Potential typical impacts known to be associated with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDa winters are
utilized in preparation of the outlook via common techniques that include
composite analysis (including consecutive La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa events) =
and regressions
anchored to Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo 3.4 SST in both diagnostic and prognostic=
 terms. La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
impacts were considered through the MAM 2022 forecast lead consistent with =
the
expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa evolution. Dynamical model guidance from =
the NMME and
Copernicus (C3S) multi-model ensemble systems are used through AMJ 2022. In
addition, objective, skill-based consolidation tools contribute to the outl=
ook
and include the ENSO/OCN and a complete suite of statistical/dynamical tool
combinations. Statistical guidance such as the global SST based Constructed
Analog (CA), CBaM guidance, and long term temperature and precipitation tre=
nds
played a role in many of the outlook seasons. Coastal SSTs also are
considered,
especially at the early leads.



PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - DJF 2021 TO DJF 2022

TEMPERATURE

The DJF 2021-2022 temperature outlook favors above-normal temperatures for
most
of the southern half and the eastern third of the CONUS. The greatest odds =
for
above-normal temperatures are in the northeast and southeast regions.
Below-normal temperatures are most likely for the Pacific Northwest, northe=
rn
Idaho, Montana, and western North and South Dakota, as well as much of Alas=
ka.
These temperatures are reflective of the La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa base stat=
e, trend, and
anomalous sea surface temperatures. The expectation of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDa conditions and
associated typical impacts - on average over many events - is the primary
driver of the DJF 2021-2022 temperature outlook, and is indicated by multip=
le
methods that includes empirical, statistical and dynamical forecast guidanc=
e.
Dynamical model guidance (NMME and C3S) favor a response generally consiste=
nt
with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa, though the C3S favors near- to above-normal =
temperatures in the
region of expected below-normal temperatures in the northern CONUS. A wave
train typical of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa winters is present and amplified =
in DJF in the NMME,
which is consistent with predicted NMME DJF temperatures.



Temperature guidance from dynamical and statistical models is strongly cold=
 in
Alaska and parts of western Canada, and remains anomalously cold through
spring
2022. Dynamical and statistical model guidance reflect the expected DJF
pattern
of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa and trend, and anomalously cold coastal SSTs fa=
vor below-normal
temperatures in Alaska. The area of enhanced below-normal temperature
probabilities in the northern parts of the CONUS decreases in coverage thro=
ugh
MAM2022, shifting westward toward the west coast of the U.S. This relaxatio=
n
of
the coverage of favored below-normal temperatures to the west coast through
MAM2022 is at odds with the forecast issued in October. Dynamical and
statistical model guidance updated in November are slightly warmer further
west
into the northern Great Plains than previous guidance, and probabilities fo=
r
below-normal temperatures have been reduced reflective of this shift.
Beginning
in AMJ2022, equal chances (EC) are indicated in the northwest, shifting to
warmer temperatures as the forecast moves into spring and summer. This
relaxation of the favored below-normal temperatures is consistent with the
waning La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa signal moving into the spring, and change t=
o ENSO neutral
conditions in the summer, where temperature trends will be more dominant.



The greatest odds for above-normal temperatures shift from the northeast in
MAM2022, as temperature trends become less dominant in the region and
dynamical
models decrease probabilities for above-normal temperatures. The greatest o=
dds
for above-normal temperatures in the southeast shifts towards TX, NM, and A=
Z
in
MAM2022, following a typical trend and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa pattern tha=
t is favored by
dynamical model suites. The spatial extent decreases in AMJ2022 as the
tropical
forcing begins to shift to ENSO neutral conditions. The north-central U.S.
favors EC for above and below-normal temperatures, with increasing coverage
through AMJ2022, due to uncertainty in tools and the tendency for increased
variability or weak signals from tropical forcing.



The remaining set of temperature outlooks remain generally the same from th=
e
October release and are based on the ENSO/OCN and other consolidation forec=
ast
tools for which long term temperature trends contribute significantly at ti=
mes
in various regions



PRECIPITATION

For the DJF 2021-2022 precipitation outlook, above-normal seasonal
precipitation amounts are most likely for the west coast of Alaska, the
Pacific
northwest, northern Rockies, and portions of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, =
and
Northeast. Above-normal Great Lakes water temperatures lead to enhanced
possibility of lake effect precipitation and contributed to the higher
probability of above-normal precipitation over the Great Lakes region (40%)=
 in
DJF 2021-2022 through FMA2022. Enhanced probabilities of above-normal
precipitation in the Pacific NW is largely based on composite analysis of L=
a
Nina winters. Drier than normal conditions are most likely for south-centra=
l
Alaska and along the southern tier of the CONUS. The highest probability of
below-normal precipitation (50%) in DJF 2021-2022 is found in southern Ariz=
ona
and New Mexico, parts of western Texas, and south Florida, consistent with
dynamical model guidance favoring enhanced probability of below-normal
precipitation in these regions. The evolution of precipitation outlooks
through
MAM 2022 are derived from the typical observed impacts during La Ni=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDa
winters,
and statistical and dynamical model guidance. Given the predicted weakening=
 of
La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions to ENSO neutral conditions in AMJ 2022,=
 the AMJ 2022

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook

30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR DECEMBER 2021

The December 2021 temperature and precipitation outlooks are based on the
predicted evolving pattern from Week-2, Weeks 3-4 model consensus, dynamica=
l
model output for December, La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites, and decadal=
 trends.
Below-average sea surface temperatures continue across the central and east=
ern
equatorial Pacific, while suppressed convection was observed near and west =
of
the Date Line this past month. The oceanic and atmospheric observations
reflect
La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions which are likely to persist through the=
 winter. The
Madden-Julian Oscillation is forecast to remain weak during the next two we=
eks
and is unlikely to influence the mid-latitude circulation at this time.



The highest forecast confidence in the December temperature outlook exists
across the Southwest and southern Great Plains where above temperatures are
most likely, based on good agreement among inputs to the North American
Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) along with support from La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
a composites and
decadal trends. Probabilities for above normal temperatures decrease farthe=
r
to
the north across the Great Basin and to the east along the Gulf Coast due t=
o
weaker signals among dynamical models. During late November, a large positi=
ve
500-hPa height anomaly center is likely to become centered over Greenland a=
nd
the northern Atlantic as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) becomes
negative.
The ECMWF ensemble mean depicts this anomalous ridging persisting into the
beginning of December and a majority of GFS ensemble members feature a
continuation of a negative NAO heading into December.  The week 3-4 model
consensus for the 500-hPa height pattern, using the GEFS, CFS, ECMWF,
Canadian,
and JMA models initialized on Nov 15, depicts this negative phase of the NA=
O
ending sometime during early December. Due to uncertainty on when the
anomalous
ridging downstream over the north Atlantic weakens and the associated negat=
ive
NAO ends, a large area of equal chances (EC) of below, near, or above norma=
l
temperatures is necessary for the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, Northeast, and
Mid-Atlantic. Also, inputs to the NMME vary largely for these areas. The EC
forecast for the northern Great Plains, northern Rockies, and Pacific
Northwest
is related to the lack of a signal in the calibrated NMME and conflicting
signals between model output and wintertime La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa compos=
ites.



Dynamical models and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites favor below (above=
) normal
precipitation across the southern tier of the CONUS (Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies). The slightly elevated probabilities for above normal
precipitation forecast for the Great Lakes is consistent with La Ni=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDa
composites but also given the above normal Great Lakes temperatures, any co=
ld
air advection would likely lead to enhanced lake-effect precipitation.
Although
there is some support among dynamical models for a larger area of elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation across the north-central CONUS,
large uncertainty at this time lead results in an EC forecast. The northern
Great Plains and upper Mississippi Valley will be reevaluated for the updat=
ed
monthly outlook (to be issued on Nov 30) when storm track predictability
improves. Due to anomalous ridging predicted by the ECMWF and Canadian
ensemble
means heading into the beginning of December, the favored area of wetness f=
or
the Pacific Northwest is slightly reduced in coverage compared to what La
Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
composites would typically support. This region, along with northern
California, will be reassessed on Nov 30 when the longwave pattern over the
northeast Pacific and western North America is better known.



Negative sea surface temperature anomalies and the calibrated NMME support
increased probabilities of below normal temperatures across southern Mainla=
nd
Alaska and the Aleutians. The favored area of dryness forecast for
south-central Alaska is consistent with the predicted colder-than-normal
temperatures. Elsewhere, across Alaska, precipitation tools feature little =
to
no signal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1035 AM CST Thu Nov 18 2021

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 11/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0112 AM CST Thu Nov 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper low/trough across southern Canada will shift east today as
a shortwave ridge over the western US weakens and the upper-level
flow pattern trends more zonal. Cooler and drier conditions behind
the recent cold front will continue, supporting brief localized fire
weather potential across much of the central/southern Rockies and
Plains.

...Central/Southern Rockies and High Plains...
Very dry surface conditions are forecast to develop across portions
of the central Rockies and High Plains within the post-frontal
airmass. While temperatures in many spots will remain below 50
degrees F, observed surface dewpoints already in the single digits
and below zero will support humidity values as low as 7-15% this
afternoon. Lingering flow aloft may also support some strong wind
gusts of 15-25 mph, especially closer to the higher terrain of
eastern WY and northern CO. While widespread fire weather conditions
are not anticipated due to cool temperatures and a lack of greater
background flow, locally elevated to near critical conditions may
develop near higher terrain where strong wind gusts and very low
humidity overlap with dry fuels.

Brief elevated fire weather conditions may also develop across
portions of the southern Plains and into central Texas, as gusty
winds develop through the day. Here, low humidity of 15-25% may
briefly overlap with surface winds of 10-20 mph. However, the short
duration and limited spatial extent suggests the overall fire
weather threat will remain low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 PM CST Thu Nov 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

Small adjustments to the ongoing forecast to add more of western
Oklahoma. Confidence in prolonged low RH into central/eastern Kansas
remains low, primarily due to mid/high-level clouds. Localized
elevated conditions may occur for brief periods, however.

..Wendt.. 11/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0116 AM CST Thu Nov 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow over the western US will continue through Day2/Fri as a
weak shortwave trough approaches the central Rockies. Lift from the
approaching trough will aid in the development of a lee low across
eastern CO, enhancing southerly low-level winds across portions of
the southern High Plains. Surface high pressure over the Plains will
move east as cool and dry surface conditions linger across much of
the central US.

...Southern High Plains...
As the area of high pressure over the southern Plains shifts east
through the day, low-level pressure gradients will strengthen in
response to a lee low developing across eastern CO. Southerly
surface winds of 15-25 mph appear likely by mid afternoon from the
panhandles into southern CO and western KS. The gusty winds will
overlap with a warming and drying air mass with forecast relative
humidity values of 15-25%. While confidence in the surface humidity
values is low, regional fuels have continued to dry over the last
several days, suggesting elevated fire weather conditions may
develop across portions of the southern High Plains through the
afternoon.

Valid 12Z Sun Nov 21 2021 - 12Z Thu Nov 25 2021

...Potential continues for a strong cold front and significant
storm to affect the East next week...

...Overview...

For the early part of next week, a complex low pressure system is
forecast to develop near the Great Lakes region and track eastward
toward the Northeast U.S./Southeast Canada while the upper-level
pattern amplifies aloft. The cold fronts associated with this
storm system will bring colder temperatures and possibly gusty
winds to the East, while heavy rain is a possibility in the warm
sector in northern New England, with snow possible on the backside
of the low in the interior Northeast, especially in lake
effect/terrain enhanced areas. Continue to monitor forecasts as
details may change. Farther west, a southern stream upper low
initially southwest of California should combine with a Pacific
shortwave and yield an upper trough aligned from the Northern
Plains into northwestern Mexico by Thanksgiving, bringing some
light to moderate precipitation to the Pacific Northwest and some
higher elevation snow in the Rockies around Monday-Wednesday, and
developing into a possible heavy rain threat on Thanksgiving
across parts of Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley as Gulf
moisture interacts with a Plains front.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The first notable feature to watch is an upper trough with its
axis initially over central North America on Sunday that pushes
eastward and deepens considerably as additional energy streams in
and a ridge initially over the the West Coast tracks east as well.
The vorticity/energy coming in that causes the trough to dig is
still aloft over or near Alaska at this time, so the details of
the trough/eventually developing closed low as well as the
associated surface low still have lower predictability several
days out in time. Models have been waffling on if/where an
embedded upper low may form between Sunday and early Tuesday, but
there is a decent consensus that an upper low should reach along
or just offshore the Mid-Atlantic or New England coast by later
Tuesday or Wednesday. At the surface, there is reasonable
continuity with low pressure consolidating over the Upper Great
Lakes/southeastern Canada Sunday-Monday. After that the forecast
gets more complicated, as multiple surface low centers may wrap
underneath the spinning upper low that may get blocked from moving
away from the Northeast due to a North Atlantic ridge. For the
00/06Z model cycle, GFS runs and the ECMWF are quite similar to
each other in terms of upper and surface low placement through at
least Tuesday. However, cluster analysis and spaghetti plots of
ensemble members from the ECMWF, GEFS, and CMC ensembles show that
these deterministic models are on the slower/deeper end of the
model spread despite their good agreement with each other. The
GEFS and EC ensemble means are fairly well aligned through the
period, and appear the best proxy for a middle ground solution in
terms of timing and position, since the GFS and EC are slower and
the 00Z CMC takes a bit faster track. The 12Z GFS and ECMWF appear
a bit faster and thus closer to consensus.

For the West, model guidance is reasonably agreeable with both the
southern stream low in the Pacific west of California and it
opening up and possibly combining with the northern stream around
Tuesday as a shortwave comes into the Pacific Northwest, though
with the 00Z UKMET remains on the slightly slower side. After
that, models are still varying from run to run with timing of the
trough's movement, and newer 12Z guidance coming in seems to
maintain or reproduce more flow separation with a slower track of
the trough/possible closed low in the Southeast, which was first
seem in the 00Z CMC.

For the updated medium range forecast, a deterministic model blend
was used initially, favoring the GFS runs and the 00Z ECMWF. As
the period progressed, phased in more ensemble mean guidance and
ended up with a fairly even blend of the 00Z ECMWF and its
ensemble mean and GFS runs and the 06Z ensemble mean. This
maintained good continuity with the previous forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The consolidating northern tier U.S./southern Canada low pressure
will bring a leading front and stronger trailing front into and
through the East early in the calendar week. Precipitation (mostly
rain) will develop along and east of the Mississippi Valley on
Sunday. Most rain should be light to moderate but locally more
intense activity may be possible over parts of the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys. As the front and possible waves of low pressure head into
New England, the trend continues to be for somewhat lower
precipitation totals over western/southern areas but maintain the
potential for some heavy rainfall over Maine, aided by strong
Atlantic inflow. Snow is still most likely in the cold air behind
the system, to the lee of the Great Lakes and along
westward-facing terrain from the central Appalachians
northeastward. There is still enough uncertainty in system
evolution to allow for other possibilities regarding precipitation
types and amounts. Meanwhile confidence is higher in a period of
breezy/gusty winds from the Upper Midwest through the East Sunday
into Tuesday and then possibly lingering over the Northeast
thereafter. Across the northern tier the combination of low
temperatures and wind would produce cold wind chills.

The Pacific Northwest into northern Rockies should see mostly
light to perhaps locally moderate precipitation during the first
half of next week with a shortwave/cold front arriving from the
Pacific. The combination of this energy aloft and the
opening/progression of the upper low southwest of California may
spread some moisture into other parts of the West by
Tuesday/Wednesday, but still with modest confidence for
precipitation coverage/amounts. Around Thanksgiving the western
front is currently expected to reach far enough into the Plains to
begin interacting with Gulf moisture to produce an expanding area
of rain along and north of the western Gulf Coast. Some of this
rain may become heavy.

The strong cold front crossing the East early in the week will
bring well below normal temperatures that should be most
pronounced between Monday and early Wednesday when there should be
decent coverage of highs/morning lows 10-15F below normal, with
some pockets of highs possibly 15-20F below normal over southern
areas. Temperatures may fall below freezing rather far into the
South. Readings should rebound toward normal by Thanksgiving.
Portions of the Rockies/Plains will see a brief warm period early
in the week with some plus 10-15F or so anomalies. A cold front
moving from the West into the Plains during Tuesday through
Thanksgiving will bring moderately below normal highs in its wake.

still aloft over or near Alaska at this time, so the details of
the trough/eventually developing closed low as well as the
associated surface low still have lower predictability several
days out in time. Models have been waffling on if/where an
embedded upper low may form between Sunday and early Tuesday, but
there is a decent consensus that an upper low should reach along
or just offshore the Mid-Atlantic or New England coast by later
Tuesday or Wednesday. At the surface, there is reasonable
continuity with low pressure consolidating over the Upper Great
Lakes/southeastern Canada Sunday-Monday. After that the forecast
gets more complicated, as multiple surface low centers may wrap
underneath the spinning upper low that may get blocked from moving
away from the Northeast due to a North Atlantic ridge. For the
00/06Z model cycle, GFS runs and the ECMWF are quite similar to
each other in terms of upper and surface low placement through at
least Tuesday. However, cluster analysis and spaghetti plots of
ensemble members from the ECMWF, GEFS, and CMC ensembles show that
these deterministic models are on the slower/deeper end of the
model spread despite their good agreement with each other. The
GEFS and EC ensemble means are fairly well aligned through the
period, and appear the best proxy for a middle ground solution in
terms of timing and position, since the GFS and EC are slower and
the 00Z CMC takes a bit faster track. The 12Z GFS and ECMWF appear
a bit faster and thus closer to consensus.

For the West, model guidance is reasonably agreeable with both the
southern stream low in the Pacific west of California and it
opening up and possibly combining with the northern stream around
Tuesday as a shortwave comes into the Pacific Northwest, though
with the 00Z UKMET remains on the slightly slower side. After
that, models are still varying from run to run with timing of the
trough's movement, and newer 12Z guidance coming in seems to
maintain or reproduce more flow separation with a slower track of
the trough/possible closed low in the Southeast, which was first
seem in the 00Z CMC.

For the updated medium range forecast, a deterministic model blend
was used initially, favoring the GFS runs and the 00Z ECMWF. As
the period progressed, phased in more ensemble mean guidance and
ended up with a fairly even blend of the 00Z ECMWF and its
ensemble mean and GFS runs and the 06Z ensemble mean. This
maintained good continuity with the previous forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The consolidating northern tier U.S./southern Canada low pressure
will bring a leading front and stronger trailing front into and
through the East early in the calendar week. Precipitation (mostly
rain) will develop along and east of the Mississippi Valley on
Sunday. Most rain should be light to moderate but locally more
intense activity may be possible over parts of the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys. As the front and possible waves of low pressure head into
New England, the trend continues to be for somewhat lower
precipitation totals over western/southern areas but maintain the
potential for some heavy rainfall over Maine, aided by strong
Atlantic inflow. Snow is still most likely in the cold air behind
the system, to the lee of the Great Lakes and along
westward-facing terrain from the central Appalachians
northeastward. There is still enough uncertainty in system
evolution to allow for other possibilities regarding precipitation
types and amounts. Meanwhile confidence is higher in a period of
breezy/gusty winds from the Upper Midwest through the East Sunday
into Tuesday and then possibly lingering over the Northeast
thereafter. Across the northern tier the combination of low
temperatures and wind would produce cold wind chills.

The Pacific Northwest into northern Rockies should see mostly
light to perhaps locally moderate precipitation during the first
half of next week with a shortwave/cold front arriving from the
Pacific. The combination of this energy aloft and the
opening/progression of the upper low southwest of California may
spread some moisture into other parts of the West by
Tuesday/Wednesday, but still with modest confidence for
precipitation coverage/amounts. Around Thanksgiving the western
front is currently expected to reach far enough into the Plains to
begin interacting with Gulf moisture to produce an expanding area
of rain along and north of the western Gulf Coast. Some of this
rain may become heavy.

The strong cold front crossing the East early in the week will
bring well below normal temperatures that should be most
pronounced between Monday and early Wednesday when there should be
decent coverage of highs/morning lows 10-15F below normal, with
some pockets of highs possibly 15-20F below normal over southern
areas. Temperatures may fall below freezing rather far into the
South. Readings should rebound toward normal by Thanksgiving.
Portions of the Rockies/Plains will see a brief warm period early
in the week with some plus 10-15F or so anomalies. A cold front
moving from the West into the Plains during Tuesday through
Thanksgiving will bring moderately below normal highs in its wake.

SYNOPSIS: There is decent multi-model agreement of the ensemble means,
indicating an amplified mid-level ridge-trough pattern across the lower 48
states during week-2. However, the 0Z GEFS indicates a greater potential fo=

the ridging over the western lower 48 to break down during the period. A
surface low is forecast to develop along the western Gulf Coast before movi=
ng
northeastward early in the period, which may bring heavy precipitation to
parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. Amplified mid-level low
pressure is predicted to prevail over Alaska throughout week-2, bringing
anomalously cool temperatures to the Mainland. A strong surface low over th=
e
Gulf of Alaska may bring heavy precipitation and high winds to the Alaska
Panhandle during the first couple days of the period.

2303BUTbDXC$

FOR FRIDAY NOVEMBER 26 - THURSDAY DECEMBER 02: There continues to be great
uncertainty in the evolution of the jet stream pattern across western North
America during week-2. The GEFS indicates a complete breakdown of mid-level
high pressure over the western U.S., which would result in a southward shif=
t
of
the storm track during the period. Conversely, the ECMWF and Canadian
ensembles
indicate only a suppression of the ridge over the West, which would prevent
the
storm track from shifting farther southward. However, the ECMWF ensemble ha=
s
indicated enough suppression of this ridge to enhance onshore flow in the
Pacific Northwest during, which better agrees with the GEFS solutions. The
GEFS
and ECMWF ensemble reforecast tools also indicate at least a 20% chance for
precipitation to exceed the 85th percentile and one inch for the 8-10, 10-1=
2,
and 12-14 day periods during week-2, with the GEFS solutions also indicatin=
g
an
increased potential to exceed two inches during those same periods. Therefo=
re,
a slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for the Pacific Northwest fr=
om
the coastal ranges to the Cascades for the entirety of week-2. In addition,
the
Pacific Northwest has seen marked improvements to soil moisture from a
persistent Fall storm track, so increased runoff is a major concern.



Leading up to the start of week-2, surface high pressure near southeastern
Atlantic Coast is expected to enhance return flow on its western periphery,
aiding in the development of surface low pressure along the western Gulf
Coast.
There is some uncertainty in the timing and track of this system among the
model guidance, but the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble reforecast tools are in
agreement depicting at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceedin=
g
the 85th percentile and one inch of rainfall accumulation across parts of t=
he
southeastern U.S. from the Lower Mississippi Valley eastward to the Southea=
st.
Therefore, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for the
region,Fri-Sat, Nov 26-27.



Amplified mid-level troughing across Mainland Alaska from the beginning to
middle of the period supports a slight risk of much below normal temperatur=
es
across parts of the western Mainland. The slight risk of much below normal
temperatures posted for the southeastern Mainland covers the first two days=
 of
the week-2 period (Fri-Sat, Nov 26-27), as temperatures are expected to
moderate enough to remain below hazardous thresholds beyond day 9. Much bel=
ow
normal temperatures are expected to linger slightly longer from the Seward
Peninsula northward, warranting a slight risk of much below normal
temperatures
through day 10 (Fri-Sun, Nov 26-28). Reforecast tools support both slight r=
isk
areas, as both the GEFS and ECMWF tools indicate at least a 40% chance of
minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and below zero D=
eg
F.



There is good multi-model agreement in the formation of a couple of strong
surface lows over the Gulf of Alaska at the beginning of the period (Fri-Sa=
t,
Nov 26-27), which could bring heavy precipitation to parts of the Alaska
Panhandle. A slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for the Alaska
Panhandle, Nov 26 to 27, where the reforecast tools show at least a 20% cha=
nce
of exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches. The location of these storm
systems may also support tight pressure gradients along coastal portions of
the
Alaska Panhandle and southeastern Mainland, resulting in high winds, which
could be locally enhanced near channels. Therefore, a slight risk of high
winds
is posted in these areas, Nov 26 to 27.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu November 18 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 24 - 28 2021

The GFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means are in excellent agreement and
remain consistent that a large positive 500-hPa height anomaly center of mo=
re
than +300 meters develops over southern Greenland and the northern Atlantic=
 by
the 6-10 day period. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is forecast to
become
sharply negative during late November.  This evolving longwave pattern,
including an amplified trough over eastern North America, favors below norm=
al
temperatures across the eastern third of the CONUS. The largest probabiliti=
es
(greater than 50 percent) for below normal temperatures are centered over t=
he
Southeast due to the negative NAO. The spatial extent of the favored area o=
f
below normal temperatures is consistent with teleconnections upon the large
positive 500-hPa height anomaly center at the southern tip of Greenland. A
500-hPa ridge near the West Coast and associated above normal heights suppo=
rt
increased probabilities for above normal temperatures from the western CONU=
S
east to the High Plains.

A transient shortwave trough in the southern stream favors above normal
precipitation from the Rio Grande Valley east to the Gulf Coast States and
Mid-Atlantic. The slightly elevated probabilities for above normal
precipitation across Maine are related to a departing low pressure system a=
nd
cyclonic flow. Prevailing surface high pressure favors below normal
precipitation across much of the north-central CONUS, but there could be br=
ief
periods of lake-effect snow downwind of the Great Lakes with any cold air
advection. Ridging aloft supports increased probabilities of below normal
precipitation from California east to the Great Basin. Onshore flow is much
more likely north of 45 degrees N, with above normal precipitation favored =
for
Washington and northern Idaho.

A highly amplified trough centered over Alaska favors below normal
temperatures
for the western two-thirds of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. The elevat=
ed
probabilities for below normal precipitation across western Alaska are
consistent with this anomalously cold pattern. Onshore flow favors above
normal
precipitation across the Alaska Panhandle.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
excellent model agreement on the developing large positive 500-hPa anomaly
center over Greenland and the northern Atlantic. Also, precipitation tools =
are
in good agreement.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 26 - DEC 02, 2021

Ensemble means maintain the anomalous ridging over Greenland and the northe=
rn
Atlantic, consistent with a negative NAO, through at least the early part o=
f
week-2. This persistent negative NAO and below normal 500-hPa heights favor
below normal temperatures along most of the East Coast. The uncalibrated
dynamical model output and statistical tools are most bullish with the
anomalous cold for this region. Enhanced Pacific flow at the higher latitud=
es
of North America is expected to rapidly diminish the reservoir of anomalous
cold that could potentially overspread areas west of the Appalachians.
Therefore, a warming trend in temperatures is anticipated for the Great Pla=
ins
and the Mississippi Valley during week-2. Above normal 500-hPa heights and =
the
potential return of onshore, Pacific flow support increased probabilities f=
or
above normal temperatures throughout the West.

Ensemble means continue to diverge during week-2 on how fast the anomalous
ridging along the West Coast weakens, as anomalous troughing shifts east to
the
northeast Pacific. The GFS ensemble mean is the most rapid with this
transition
by day 10 or 11, while the Canadian ensemble mean maintains a high amplitud=
e
ridge along the West Coast through late into week-2. The ECMWF ensemble mea=
n
is
a compromise between these two model solutions and is preferred today.
Enhanced
onshore flow is most likely across the Pacific Northwest but may begin to
shift
south later in week-2. Above normal precipitation is favored from the Pacif=
ic
Northwest east to the northern Rockies and Northern High Plains, while belo=
w
normal precipitation remains more likely across California, the southern Gr=
eat
Basin, and Southwest. As a shortwave trough ejects eastward, precipitation =
is
expected to time off around day 8 across the Rio Grande Valley, western Gul=
f
Coast, and Lower Mississippi Valley, where near to below normal precipitati=
on
is favored. Early in week-2, model solutions depict a low pressure system a=
nd
trailing front crossing the eastern CONUS which slightly increases
probabilities for above normal precipitation along the East Coast. Given th=
e
blocking downstream over the northern Atlantic, the low pressure system cou=
ld
intensify near or over the Northeast but ensemble spread is large.

An amplified ridge is forecast to remain centered over the Kamchatka Penins=
ula
with anomalous troughing downstream across Alaska. This longwave pattern
continues to support anomalously cold temperatures throughout a majority of
Alaska. Also, negative sea surface temperatures surrounding the state suppo=
rt
below normal temperatures along coastal areas. Based on the surface pattern
and
precipitation tools, above normal precipitation is most likely across the
Alaska Panhandle and coastal southeastern Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
increasing uncertainty on the duration of anomalous cold across the eastern
CONUS and large model differences on the amplitude of ridging along the Wes=
t
Coast.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=

for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or

 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=

(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no

Coast by Friday morning.  Mainly rain will develop along the front
from the Northeast to the Central Gulf Coast tonight into Thursday
morning.  The rain will move eastward off the East Coast by
Friday.  Behind the boundary, lake effect snow will develop over
parts of the Great Lakes.  Furthermore, lake effect snow will
develop downwind from Lakes Erie and Ontario tonight.  Snow will
also develop over parts of interior New England, while coastal
areas will remain rain.  On Friday, the lake effect snow ends over
the Upper Great Lakes, while lake effect snow continues downwind
from Lakes Erie and Ontario through Friday evening.  Likewise, the
light snow will also continue over parts of Northern New England
through Friday evening.

Meanwhile, another front moves onshore over the Pacific Northwest,
moving to the Northern High Plains/Great Basin by Friday evening.
The system will produce rain and higher elevation snow will
develop over parts of the Northwest and expand into Northern
California overnight Thursday.  Snow will develop over parts of
the Northern Intermountain Region and into parts of the Northern
Rockies through Friday evening.  Scattered light rain and higher
elevation snow will linger over parts of the Northwest through
Saturday. The front moves southeastward to the Southern Rockies
and Southern Plains by Saturday evening.

Elsewhere, easterly flow off the Atlantic will aid in producing
showers and thunderstorms over Florida overnight. Then, the
aforementioned East Coast front moves southward over Florida,
confining the showers and thunderstorms to the southern third of
Florida.  However, after the front moves offshore, the easterly
flow will again move over Florida producing scattered showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the peninsula on Saturday.

...Potential continues for a significant storm to affect the East
next week with possible moderate to heavy rainfall across portions
of the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley around or on
Thanksgiving Day...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Amplification of an Eastern U.S. upper trough will be underway as
the medium range period starts Monday, pushing a cold front off
the East Coast by Tuesday as low pressure then lingers near/off
the Canadian Maritimes the remainder of the week. Out West, a
southern stream upper low initially southwest of California should
combine with a Pacific shortwave to yield amplified troughing, and
potentially embedded compact closed low, to drop southward along
the California coast and into northern Mexico by the end of the
week. Northern stream energy may deepen as it tracks near the
U.S./Canadian border and into the Great Lakes by Friday.

Models and ensembles show reasonable agreement on the evolution of
the East Coast trough/closed low but continue to exhibit some
smaller scale differences in intensity and location of surface low
pressure lingering near the Canadian Maritimes later in the week.
12z (yesterday) CMC is displaced a bit west of the latest ECMWF
and GFS runs, which also have support from the ensemble means.

Out West, the latest guidance has trended deeper/stronger with
Pacific Northwest energy which may form a closed low dropping
southward along the California coast and into the Northern Mexico
during the early to middle part of next week. By Thursday though,
run to run variability increases significantly regarding the
evolution and of this southern stream energy across northern
Mexico and potentially into parts of the High Plains. The latest
run of the ECMWF is the deepest/slowest piece of guidance, while
the GFS is weaker and a little more progressive. Ensemble
solutions vary widely but suggest that both the ECMWF and GFS are
within the realm of possibilities. The ensemble means right now
seem to be the best starting point, with a more middle ground
solution.

The overnight medium range progs used a deterministic model blend
for days 3-5 (with slightly more weighting towards the ECMWF and
GFS). After this, the forecast trended quickly towards the
ensemble means, with some modest contributions still from the
deterministic solutions for added system definition. Overall, this
left a reasonably consistent starting point with the previous WPC
forecast.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The Northeast low pressure will bring a cold front into and
through the East on Monday with much of the heaviest precipitation
heading off the East Coast. Moderate to heavy rainfall should
continue into parts of New England though with the heaviest totals
(in excess of an inch) across far northeast Maine on Monday aided
by strong Atlantic inflow. Cold air filtering in behind the system
should support at least light accumulating snow downwind of the
lower Great Lakes as well as along westward-facing terrain from
the central Appalachians and northeastward. There is still enough
uncertainty in system evolution to allow for other possibilities
regarding precipitation type and amounts, even into parts of far
northern New England. Deepening low pressure should allow for a
period of breezy/gusty winds across much of the East Monday and
Tuesday and possibly into the middle and latter parts of the week
across the Northeast as low pressure lingers offshore. Daytime
highs and morning lows Monday and Tuesday could be 1o-20 degrees
below normal from portions of the Ohio Valley/Midwest into the
Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast. Near to below freezing morning
lows could extend rather far into parts of the South. Especially
for northern locations, this combination of cold temperatures and
gusty winds could make for some unpleasant wind chills during the
upcoming Holiday week.

The Pacific Northwest into northern Rockies should see mostly
light to perhaps locally moderate precipitation during the first
half of next week with a shortwave/cold front arriving from the
Pacific. The combination of this energy aloft and the
opening/progression of the upper low southwest of California may
spread some moisture into other parts of the West by
Tuesday/Wednesday, but still with modest confidence for
precipitation coverage/amounts. By mid week, the western front
should reach far enough into the Plains to begin interacting with
Gulf moisture to produce an expanding area of moderate to possibly
heavy rainfall from eastern Texas into parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley for Wednesday and especially into Thanksgiving
day.

Above normal temperatures ahead of the western front will march
from the Rockies to the Plains Monday-Wednesday with anomalies +10
to +15F possible. Modestly above normal temperatures are possible
into the Southern Plains and Midwest late week, with temperatures
generally near or slightly above average across the West upper
level ridging attemps to build over the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 AM CST Fri Nov 19 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
Zonal midlevel flow is expected over the southern Rockies and High
Plains today. A surface low is forecast to develop over parts of the
central High Plains, with a lee trough extending southward into
eastern CO and the TX/OK Panhandles.

...Southern High Plains...
Southerly flow will increase this afternoon across the southern High
Plains in response to the developing lee trough, but low-level
moisture will remain limited. Diurnal heating and mixing will
support minimum RH values of 15-20% across parts of the TX Panhandle
into western OK, as surface winds increase to 20-25 mph. Farther
west across parts of eastern NM, diurnal warming and drying
resulting from westerly downslope flow will support minimum RH
values of around 15%, as surface winds increase to 15-20 mph. These
conditions will support an elevated fire-weather threat.

Farther north into parts of southern/eastern Colorado, locally
elevated conditions will be possible across terrain-favored areas
where somewhat stronger downslope winds may develop. However,
confidence in a sufficient coverage and duration of elevated
conditions remains low at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 AM CST Fri Nov 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
A continuation of zonal midlevel flow is expected across the
southern Plains on Saturday. Meanwhile, an upper-level ridge will
gradually build into the Great Basin, as a trough develops south of
the ridge off the coast of southern California toward the end of the
period.

...Portions of eastern New Mexico into adjacent parts of West
Texas...

Persistent downslope flow across eastern New Mexico will continue to
support elevated fire weather conditions, with minimum RH values
around 15% and sustained surface winds of 15 to 20 mph expected.
There is some uncertainty regarding how far east elevated conditions
will spread into the Texas South Plains, and some adjustments may be
possible in future outlooks.

...Southern California...

Late in the period, offshore flow is expected to develop over
portions of southern California. Locally elevated conditions are
possible, but the greatest threat is not expected until later in the
day on Sunday, when more substantial RH reductions are expected.

...Cold Canadian Air-mass Arrives in the East Today, Warming Trend
in the Heartland on Saturday...

...Rain and Mountain Snow for the Northwest & Northern Rockies
Through Friday Night, Showers in the Ohio Valley Sunday Morning...

...Favorable Fire Weather Conditions in the Southern High Plains &
Southern California This Weekend...

An expansive area of Canadian high pressure in the Heartland is
advancing east this morning, ushering in some of the coldest
temperatures of the season to date east of the mighty Mississippi
River. Even in the Southern Plains it is quite cold with Freeze
Warnings in place from the ArkLaTex to the Upper Rio Grande
regions. Friday's high temps from the Ohio Valley to the Northeast
will struggle to get out of the 40s today with blustery conditions
causing wind chills to be near or below freezing this morning. The
combination of windy conditions and very cold low level
temperatures funneling over the Great Lakes will lead to more lake
effect snow showers this morning. Winter Weather Advisories remain
in place downwind of Lakes Superior, northern Michigan, Erie, and
Ontario with a couple more inches of snowfall expected. Chilly
temperatures stick around over the eastern third of the U.S. on
Saturday with the lone exception being South Florida where warm
and muggy conditions are firmly entrenched. After a couple days of
considerably cooler temperatures, warmer conditions arriving in
the Plains eventually reaches the East Coast by the end of the
weekend thanks to progressive zonal flow atop the Lower 48. The
next injection of abnormally cold temperatures arrives in the
Midwest on Sunday as a potent upper trough and an amplifying ridge
over the West Coast direct yet another Canadian air-mass into the
North Central U.S. to close out the weekend.

Precipitation-wise, a Pacific storm system is delivering valley
rain showers and mountain snow to the Northwest and northern
Rockies today. Winter Weather Advisories have been posted for
parts of the interior Northwest due to light, yet potentially
disruptive snowfall accumulations this morning. The heaviest
snowfall accumulations are likely to occur in the Tetons where
over a foot of snow is possible. Farther east, an approaching cold
front and a weak upper level disturbance aloft will help to ignite
showers and thunderstorms over South Florida today and Saturday.
Some thunderstorms could be severe and/or produce excessive
rainfall rates. By Sunday morning, a frontal boundary sweeping
across the Midwest and entering the Great Lakes may generate
scattered showers over the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes. A little
farther east, a wintry mix could develop over the northern
Mid-Atlantic Sunday morning as approaching light precipitation
overruns sub-freezing temperatures near the surface.

In addition, a warm up coinciding with dry conditions and gusty
winds is a recipe for favorable fire weather conditions in parts
of the southern High Plains today and Saturday. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued an Elevated Risk in their Fire
Weather Outlook for portions of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles,
far southwest Kansas, and eastern New Mexico. Elsewhere,
strengthening high pressure over the Intermountain West Saturday
night will lay the groundwork for Santa Ana winds to ensue over
Southern California into Sunday morning. Residents in Southern
California can expect strong wind gusts and favorable fire weather
conditions Saturday night into Sunday morning.

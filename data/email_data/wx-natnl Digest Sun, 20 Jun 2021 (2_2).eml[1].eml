...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Middle Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes, and
a Slight Risk over parts of the Southeast Coast with Tropical
Depression Claudette through Monday morning...

 ...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Great Lakes/Western Ohio Valley and the Southeast with Tropical
Depression Claudette through Monday morning...

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat wanes across California and
the Southwest, while expanding into the Pacific Northwest on
Monday...

Tropical Depression Claudette is forecast to move roughly
northeastward to the North Carolina Coast by Monday morning,
redevelops into a Tropical Storm.  Claudette will continue to move
northeastward out over the Western Atlantic by Monday evening.
Check the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center for
the most up-to-date track and intensity of Claudette.  Claudette
will produce heavy rain over parts of the Southeast through
Monday. As a result, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall with Tropical Depression Claudette over parts of the
southern Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast on Sunday into Monday
morning.  The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized
areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small
streams the most vulnerable. Additionally, the SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe weather associated with Claudette over the
Southeast Coast through Monday morning.  The hazards associated
with the severe weather are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Meanwhile, a front extending from parts of the Northeast westward
to the Central Plains will produce showers and thunderstorms along
and ahead of a boundary from the Middle Mississippi Valley
eastward to the Lower Great Lakes on Sunday. As a result, the SPC
has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Middle Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes
through Monday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  There is a 10% or greater
probability of two-inch or great hail over parts of the Middle
Mississippi Valley through Monday morning.  Furthermore, the WPC
has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Great Lakes/Western Ohio Valley, also through Monday morning.  The
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable. The front moves eastward on Tuesday to the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Coast, then heads southwestward to the
Southern Plains.  The boundary will continue to produce showers
and thunderstorms and the severe thunderstorm threat moves east
with the boundary.  The excessive rainfall threat decreases
slightly on Tuesday with the front over the Northeast.

Elsewhere, the western U.S. is also dealing with potentially
dangerous weather, heat and fire weather. A long-duration heat
wave has gripped the southwest corner of the U.S. and is expected
to wane slightly on Sunday as the potential for record-breaking
high temperatures decreases. However, there is a potential for
record-breaking high minimum temperatures across the Southwest on
Sunday and expanding into parts of the Northwest on Monday.
Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories remain in effect
throughout much of the Southwest, California, and the Great Basin.
The combination of record heat and exceptional drought is also
leading fire weather concerns throughout the Central/Southern
Rockies into the Southwest. Red Flag Warnings are in effect across
parts of Utah and western Colorado.

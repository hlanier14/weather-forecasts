Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1129 AM CDT Fri Sep 10 2021

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Primary change with this forecast update was to remove the Elevated
fire weather area over portions of northwest Nevada and far
northeast California. While spotty/locally elevated conditions are
probable (especially across the Sierras) due to sustained surface
winds of 20-30 mph, critically dry fuels, and possible lightning
holdovers, large-scale RH reductions below 30% appear unlikely based
on the latest observations and ensemble guidance.

Minor adjustments were also made to the Elevated fire weather area
over Wyoming based on the latest ensemble guidance. Several hours of
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected this afternoon, with
sustained surface winds peaking near 15-20 mph, minimum RH values
near 15-20%, and receptive fuels (ERCs exceeding the 90th
percentile).

Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop this
afternoon/evening across portions of the Great Basin and Northwest.
While precipitable water values are expected to be rather high (with
wetting rainfall possible), at least isolated lightning ignitions
may occur due to the exceptional dry fuels over the area and fast
storm motions. The greatest likelihood for ignitions will be along
the periphery of any heavier thunderstorm rain cores. Gusty/erratic
surface winds are also possible nearby any thunderstorms --
especially across portions of eastern Oregon, southern Idaho, and
central/northern Nevada where a Marginal severe weather risk is in
place in the Day 1 SPC Convective Outlook.

Please see previous discussion below for more information on today's
fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 09/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0110 AM CDT Fri Sep 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large upper-level ridge will persist across the Southwest on
Friday with a large amplitude upper-level trough in the eastern
CONUS and a compact shortwave trough across the Northwest.
Increasing mid-level flow is expected across the northern Great
Basin and portions of the Northwest ahead of the aforementioned
shortwave trough. This will lead to some strengthening downslope
flow in the lee of the Sierra in northwest Nevada.

Farther east, weak lee cyclogenesis is forecast in western South
Dakota during the afternoon with a strengthening pressure gradient
across Wyoming. Westerly winds are forecast to increase to around 15
to 20 mph across central and eastern Wyoming into far southwest
South Dakota where relative humidity is forecast to be around 15 to
20 percent.

Scattered thunderstorms are expected across much of the Great Basin
and Northwest. PWAT values are quite high, especially across
Northeast Oregon, northern Idaho, and eastern Washington, but
farther south, PWAT values are forecast between 0.75 and 1 inch.
This would generally promote more wet than dry storms. However, the
stronger tropospheric flow will lead to storm motions in excess of
30 mph which should increase the chance for dry thunderstorms in a
region with critically dry fuels.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 10 2021

SYNOPSIS: Dynamical models favor an amplified mid-level height pattern over
North America, with mid-level low pressure forecast over the West. This
pattern
supports increasing chances for below normal temperatures, elevated winds, =
and
enhanced precipitation across the northwestern contiguous U.S. early in the
period. Heavy rainfall tied to potential tropical activity is possible acro=
ss
the southeastern contiguous U.S. during week-2. The development of mid-leve=
l
high pressure over the northeastern lower 48 is anticipated to promote
above-normal temperatures for many areas east of the Rockies during the
period,
although these temperatures are not expected to reach hazardous thresholds.

HAZARDS

Slight risk for much below normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Northern California, Great Basin, Northern Intermountain Region,
Rockies, and Northern Plains, Sat-Mon, Sep 18-20.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Southern Plains, Low=
er
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, Southern Appalachians, Southeast, and
Mid-Atlantic, Sat-Wed, Sep 18-22.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Alaska Panhandle, Mon-W=
ed,
Sep 20-22.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Alaska Panhandle, Sat-Mon, Sep
18-20.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Northern Intermountain Region=
,
Rockies, Great Basin, and the Northern and Central High Plains, Sat-Mon, Se=

FOR SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 18 - FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 24: Dynamical models continue =
to
feature the development of an amplified 500-hPa trough-ridge pattern over t=
he
CONUS by next weekend. Anomalous mid-level troughing is favored to shift so=
uth
from the Gulf of Alaska, with negative height departures overspreading the
northwestern CONUS early in the period. Relative to yesterday's guidance, b=
oth
the ECMWF and GEFS ensembles favor a slightly less amplified trough. Howeve=
r,
this pattern transition is still expected to promote cooler temperatures,
elevate the potential for high winds, and enhance onshore flow to increase
precipitation chances over western North America.  By the middle portion of
the
outlook period, ensembles favor a deamplification of the mid-level pattern
over
the CONUS with much of the anomalous troughing retreating northward over
western Canada and Alaska.



Surface low pressure is favored over the Canadian Prairies early in the
period,
advecting anomalously cold air into many portions of the northwestern CONUS=
. A
slight risk of much below-normal temperatures remains posted for the region
where reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatur=
es
falling below the 15th percentile and 40 degrees F. The anomalously cold
temperatures may lead to early season frost and freezes to impact vegetatio=
n
in
the region. Ensemble guidance also favors the potential for strong surface
pressure gradients and elevated wind speeds across the Northern Intermounta=
in
Region, portions of the Rockies, Great Basin and the High Plains. Given
continued support in the reforecast tools, which show at least a 20% chance
for
sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile, a slight risk of high winds =
is
maintained over these regions from Sep 18 to 20. Combined with ongoing drou=
ght
conditions, any increase in sustained winds may exacerbate multiple ongoing
wildfires that continue to reduce air quality and threaten life and propert=
y
across the West. With enhanced onshore flow and increased precipitation lik=
ely
across the Pacific Northwest, there continues to be good agreement between =
the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depicting at least a 20% chance of 3-day
precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile. However, these
tools
maintain low chances for these accumulations exceeding hazard criteria for =
the
region, therefore no precipitation related hazards are issued. The above-
normal
precipitation is anticipated to help alleviate D0 to D4 drought conditions
being felt in the region. High elevation snowfall over parts of Idaho, Mont=
ana
and Wyoming also cannot be ruled out given the increase in moisture and col=
der
temperatures favored during week-2.



Amplified 500-hPa ridging remains favored downstream to promote unseasonabl=
y
warm temperatures for much of the remainder of the country during week-2. B=
oth
reforecast tools depict a broad area with at least a 20% chance of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile, with higher probabilities (>40%=
)
indicated over the northeastern CONUS in proximity to the predicted anomalo=
us
ridge center. However, actual temperatures are not anticipated to exceed
hazardous thresholds, and in consideration of decreasing sun angles resulti=
ng
in a cooler climatology heading into late September (particularly for the
higher latitudes of the CONUS), no heat related hazards are issued. The
highest
maximum temperatures (> 90 degrees F) are favored over the lower latitudes =
of
the CONUS. Elevated heat index values are possible in the Southern Plains a=
nd
Lower Mississippi Valley where many populations are still experiencing powe=
r
outages and a lack of cooling resources due to Hurricane Ida.



In the tropics, there are several ensemble members from the 0z GEFS depicti=
ng
deeping low centers tracking northward from the Bay of Campeche suggestive =
of
tropical cyclone development in the Gulf of Mexico early in the period.
Regardless of formation, uncalibrated precipitation guidance from both the
GEFS
and ECMWF indicate an increased potential for heavy precipitation tied to a=
n
area of low pressure, and both reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance =
of
3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch across the
Gulf Coast states through the middle of week-2. Farther east, there are als=
o
continued signals in the guidance for TC activity in the western Atlantic a=
nd
possible heavy precipitation over the coastal Southeast and Mid-Atlantic
regions. While the GEFS reforecast tool is less supportive of heavy rainfal=
l
reaching the eastern seaboard, the ECMWF maintains this potential across th=
e
Carolinas, thus a broad slight risk area of heavy precipitation remains iss=
ued
for the southeastern CONUS for Sep 18 to 22.



Over Alaska, there is lesser support in the guidance for potentially heavy
precipitation early in the period. However, uncalibrated precipitation
guidance
and reforecast tools show this potential returning by the middle of the per=
iod
as the aforementioned anomalous troughing is favored to shift northward ove=
r
the Gulf of Alaska by day 10 (Sep 20). Thus, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is maintained for the Panhandle and is now valid for Sep 20 t=
o
22. The slight risk of high winds is also maintained for this region during
early week-2 as supported in the latest reforecast guidance.  The combined
elevated risk of heavy precipitation and high winds is expected to increase
the
potential for debris flow and landslides in the Panhandle during week-2.

...Heavy Rain Increasingly Likely Across Coastal Texas and
Southwest Louisiana Late Sunday into Early Next Week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The faster, quasi-zonal flow setting up across the northern tier
of the U.S. is becoming better resolved by the latest model
guidance such that a deterministic model blend yields a solution
tied closely to the consensus and trends well with continuity. For
days 3-5, a blend of the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and 06Z GFS was used
while later days used a higher component of the ECENS and GEFS
means. The GFS continued to a be a flatter and somewhat more
progressive solution but compared to recent cycles, the trend come
toward a consensus. The UKMET was slower than a lot of the other
guidance and by day 5 onward, the CMC over amplifies the
developing Intermountain West trough expected. A ECMWF/GFS
weighted blend was preferred overall for the CONUS.

There is still considerable uncertainty with the potential
development and possible heavy rainfall along the western Gulf
coasts late Sunday into early/middle next week. The model signal
for multiple inches (possibly 10+" over the multiple days) is
still there but spatial spread is quite high. The CMC was on the
southern/southwest edge of the spread while the ECMWF has trended
toward a slow moving low approaching southwest Louisiana by day
4/5. The GFS and its ensemble members, generally keep the bulk of
the higher QPF amounts close to the coast and somewhat lighter
amounts. For the WPC QPF, a blend of the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GFS, and
in-house bias corrected ensemble was used primarily with some
inclusion of the 13Z NBM. This resulted in a slight northeastward
shift of the higher amounts to the upper TX and southwest LA
coasts while decreasing amounts along the central TX coast and
especially inland areas. Overall, there is higher than normal
uncertainty and lower confidence in the locations and amounts, but
the potential for several inches of the multi-day period exists.
The National Hurricane Center has increased probabilities of
tropical development with this disturbance as it emerges into the
western Gulf and interests along those areas should monitor the
latest forecasts closely.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The eventual track and evolution of a tropical disturbance in the
western Gulf late this weekend into the early/middle portions of
next week may bring multiple rounds of heavy rainfall along the
immediate Texas and southwest Louisiana coasts. Heavy rain is
becoming increasingly likely with the potential for several
inches. Some isolated total amounts near or above 10 inches are
possible but it is too early to determine the areas at greatest
risk.  These amounts could lead to flooding impacts, particularly
for the more sensitive locations, urban areas, and those areas
that have already seen above normal rainfall over the past couple
of weeks. Interests along these areas should monitor the latest
rainfall forecasts from WPC and tropical development from the NHC.

Otherwise, mostly lighter rainfall will follow frontal passages
through the central and northeastern parts of the CONUS with some
potential for isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts.
Temperatures across the Western and northern tiers should be near
or below normal, while periods of above normal temperatures shift
across the Southwest/Central U.S. into the East ahead of a couple
frontal passages. Expect the western Gulf Coast to be below normal
through much of next week as well associated with clouds and ample
tropical moisture.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri September 10 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 16 - 20 2021

Today's ensemble mean solutions from the ECMWF, GEFS, and CMC depict a 500-=
hPa
trough stretching from Alaska to portions of the northwest CONUS and mean
ridging over much of the remainder of the CONUS, with a weakness in the mea=
n
ridging over parts of the Southeast. The 0z ECMWF ensemble and 6Z GEFS mean
forecasts are in very good agreement with respect to the locations and
amplitudes of the main 500-hPa height features across North America. Howeve=
r,
the CMC ensemble mean depicts broader and stronger mean ridging over the
Northeast Pacific and eastern North America, respectively, with mean trough=
ing
forecast across much of the central CONUS. The ECMWF ensemble mean has show=
n
the best run to run continuity over the past several days, and is favored i=
n
today's manual 500-hPa blend. The 500-hPa height blend features negative
height
anomalies over the eastern Aleutians, the Alaska Mainland and Panhandle, an=
d
over the northwestern CONUS. Positive height anomalies are favored over the
western Aleutians and much of the remainder of the CONUS, underneath mean
ridging. Negative height anomalies are favored over parts of the Gulf Coast=
,
associated with the weakness in the subtropical ridge.

Predicted 500-hPa ridging forecast over the southwestern CONUS and most of =
the
eastern CONUS leads to enhanced chances of above-normal temperatures.
Amplified
troughing over the Gulf of Alaska favors near to below-normal temperatures =
for
Alaska and the northwestern CONUS.

The forecast trough over the Gulf of Alaska favors an active storm track an=
d
increased onshore flow across the Alaska Panhandle and portions of the Paci=
fic
Northwest, leading to enhanced odds of above normal precipitation. Along an=
d
west of the mean trough axis, easterly and northeasterly surface flow is
predicted, increasing odds of below-normal precipitation across much of the
Alaska Mainland and eastern Aleutians. Southeast of the predicted trough ov=
er
the Gulf of Alaska, forecast surface high pressure increases the likelihood=
 of
near to below-normal precipitation across much of the west-central CONUS.
Ahead
of the predicted trough, several storm systems with trailing frontal
boundaries
are forecast to sweep eastward, favoring above-normal precipitation for muc=
h
of
the eastern half of the U.S.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the ECMWF and GEFS ensemble models and tools in depict=
ing
a relatively amplified pattern, offset by differences in the position and
strength of the western trough, increasing uncertainty a bit across Alaska.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 18 - 24 2021

Heading into the Week-2 period, the 500-hPa pattern shows a slight progress=
ion
of the 6-10 day mean 500-hPa pattern, though the amplitude of most features=
 is
expected to be lower due to increased uncertainty. Due to the pattern being
very similar to the 6-10 day period, the Week-2 temperature and precipitati=
on
probability forecasts are very similar as well. The potential for tropical
cyclone activity later during the Week-2 period increases the likelihood of
above-normal precipitation in the Southeast and along the Gulf Coast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 4 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the models and tools, and a relatively amplified and
persistent
pattern across the domain with good day-to-day consistency.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Fri Sep 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The latest fuel guidance suggests pockets of ERCs exceeding the
70-80th percentile tomorrow across portions of western Oklahoma, the
eastern Oklahoma Panhandle, and the far eastern Texas Panhandle. The
combination of critical meteorological conditions, with minimum RH
values less than 20% and sustained surface winds exceeding 20 mph
coupled with at least modestly receptive fuels will promote several
hours of elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions during
the afternoon. An Elevated fire weather area has been introduced
where the driest fuels are expected.

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop tomorrow
across eastern portions of the Great Basin into the Rockies. While
storms may be mixed mode (wet/dry) with some wetting rainfall
potential, critically dry fuels across portions of southeastern
Idaho, southwestern Wyoming, far northeast Utah, and northwestern
Colorado suggest that new lightning ignitions are possible --
especially along the periphery of storm cores. An Isolated Dry
Thunderstorm area has been introduced where the driest fuels are
expected.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 09/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0110 AM CDT Fri Sep 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Saturday, strengthening cyclogenesis is forecast across the
northern Plains. As a result, increased surface flow is forecast
across portions of the central and southern Plains. Currently, fuels
are not quite to critical thresholds and thus an elevated
delineation has not been added. However, an increase in initial
attack may be seen across portions of the Texas Panhandle,
western/central Oklahoma, much of Kansas and far southern Nebraska,
where surface winds of 20 to 25 mph are expected with relative
humidity of 15 to 20 percent.

The only other area of concern could be portions of southeast
Wyoming into the NE Panhandle. ERCs are near the 90th percentile in
this area and stronger northwest surface flow is expected as the
surface low deepens. However, cooler air is also forecast to move
into the region, and thus relative humidity is currently forecast to
stay above 25 percent. However, if drier surface conditions appear
more likely, an elevated delineation may need to be added at a later
time.

...Heatwave moves to the Plains with temperatures 10 to 20 degrees
above average...

...There is a low risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Northwest through Saturday morning...

...Increase in tropical moisture along the Gulf of Mexico will
increase the threat of excessive rainfall on Sunday...

Upper-level energy moving over the Northwest will aid in bringing
to an end the heatwave over the West Coast, while upper-level high
moves eastward to Southern Plains by Sunday.  Temperatures over
the Plains will be 10 to 20 degrees above average through
Saturday. Record high temperatures move into the Central/Southern
High Plains with temperatures forecast to be in the low 100s and
upper 90s, cooling slightly on Sunday.

The upper-level energy will aid in producing showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the Northwest into the Northern
Intermountain Region and the Great Basin. However, there is a low
risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Northwest through
Saturday morning. Furthermore, there is an Elevated Risk of fire
weather over parts of the Northern Rockies, as dry thunderstorms
over parts of the Great Basin will increase the fire weather
threat in that region through Saturday morning. Therefore, Red
Flag Warnings are over parts of the Pacific Northwest/Northern
California into parts of the Northern Rockies.  Moreover, Air
Quality Alerts up over parts of the Pacific Northwest, Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado due to wildfire smoke.

Meanwhile, a front over the Northern Tier States will move to the
Northeast while trailing westward into the Central Plains by
Sunday evening.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along and
ahead of the boundary extending from the Northeast to the Great
Lakes/Middle Mississippi Valley by Sunday.

In the meantime, tropical moisture will increase over the Western
and Central Gulf Coast starting late Saturday night.  The increase
in moisture will produce uptake in showers and thunderstorms along
the Gulf Coast through Sunday evening.  The expansion of tropical
moisture will also boost the threat of excessive rainfall over the
Western/Central Gulf Coast by late Sunday.

...Heavy Rain Increasingly Likely Across Coastal Texas and
Southwest Louisiana Late Sunday into Early Next Week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The faster, quasi-zonal flow setting up across the northern tier
of the U.S. is becoming better resolved by the latest model
guidance such that a deterministic model blend yields a solution
tied closely to the consensus and trends well with continuity. For
days 3-5, a blend of the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and 06Z GFS was used
while later days used a higher component of the ECENS and GEFS
means. The GFS continued to a be a flatter and somewhat more
progressive solution but compared to recent cycles, the trend come
toward a consensus. The UKMET was slower than a lot of the other
guidance and by day 5 onward, the CMC over amplifies the
developing Intermountain West trough expected. A ECMWF/GFS
weighted blend was preferred overall for the CONUS.

There is still considerable uncertainty with the potential
development and possible heavy rainfall along the western Gulf
coasts late Sunday into early/middle next week. The model signal
for multiple inches (possibly 10+" over the multiple days) is
still there but spatial spread is quite high. The CMC was on the
southern/southwest edge of the spread while the ECMWF has trended
toward a slow moving low approaching southwest Louisiana by day
4/5. The GFS and its ensemble members, generally keep the bulk of
the higher QPF amounts close to the coast and somewhat lighter
amounts. For the WPC QPF, a blend of the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GFS, and
in-house bias corrected ensemble was used primarily with some
inclusion of the 13Z NBM. This resulted in a slight northeastward
shift of the higher amounts to the upper TX and southwest LA
coasts while decreasing amounts along the central TX coast and
especially inland areas. Overall, there is higher than normal
uncertainty and lower confidence in the locations and amounts, but
the potential for several inches of the multi-day period exists.
The National Hurricane Center has increased probabilities of
tropical development with this disturbance as it emerges into the
western Gulf and interests along those areas should monitor the
latest forecasts closely.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The eventual track and evolution of a tropical disturbance in the
western Gulf late this weekend into the early/middle portions of
next week may bring multiple rounds of heavy rainfall along the
immediate Texas and southwest Louisiana coasts. Heavy rain is
becoming increasingly likely with the potential for several
inches. Some isolated total amounts near or above 10 inches are
possible but it is too early to determine the areas at greatest
risk.  These amounts could lead to flooding impacts, particularly
for the more sensitive locations, urban areas, and those areas
that have already seen above normal rainfall over the past couple
of weeks. Interests along these areas should monitor the latest
rainfall forecasts from WPC and tropical development from the NHC.

Otherwise, mostly lighter rainfall will follow frontal passages
through the central and northeastern parts of the CONUS with some
potential for isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts.
Temperatures across the Western and northern tiers should be near
or below normal, while periods of above normal temperatures shift
across the Southwest/Central U.S. into the East ahead of a couple
frontal passages. Expect the western Gulf Coast to be below normal
through much of next week as well associated with clouds and ample
tropical moisture.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 PM CDT Fri Sep 10 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
On Sunday, a surface low is forecast to continue to drift south
across Kansas. Gusty surface winds are forecast near this surface
low, especially across the TX Panhandle into western Oklahoma and
southwest Kansas. In this area, winds are forecast to be around 15
to 20 mph with relative humidity around 15 to 20 percent. Presently,
ERCs are only around the 80th percentile, but dry and breezy
conditions on Saturday should continue to dry fuels. Therefore,
fuels should be even more dry by Sunday. Even though fuels are not
expected to be critically dry, they are forecast to be close, and
with near critical meteorological conditions forecast, an elevated
delineation is warranted.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1144 PM CDT Fri Sep 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough will traverse the northern Rockies
today and deamplify as it moves into the northern Plains. At the
surface, a low pressure center is forecast to deepen to around
1006mb as it moves south into northwest Kansas. As the pressure
gradient tightens in the vicinity of the surface low, dry and breezy
conditions are expected across the Texas Panhandle into portions of
western Oklahoma and southwest Kansas. Winds are forecast around 20
to 25 mph with relative humidity around 12 to 18 percent. Fuels in
this area are starting to dry out with ERCs around the 80th
percentile. If fuels were more dry, a critical delineation would be
appropriate, but given the fuels which are not quite to critical
thresholds, an elevated delineation should appropriately cover the
fire weather threat.

Additionally, dry and breezy conditions are forecast on the
northwest side of the surface low in the wake of the surface cold
front. Cooler air advecting into the region will keep relative
humidity higher across much of the region, but in southeast Wyoming
and into the Nebraska Panhandle, temperatures are still forecast to
be high enough in the immediate wake of the cold front for sub 20
percent relative humidity. Therefore, a small elevated area is
warranted across this region.

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are forecast across much of the
Rockies and into portions of the eastern Great Basin. PWAT values
around 0.75 to 1 inch and moderate storm motions should support a
combination of both wet and dry storms. There is a region from
southeast Idaho, across far northeast Utah, much of southern
Wyoming, and northern Colorado where critically dry fuels are
present based on latest fuel guidance. Therefore, there may be some
threat of new lightning induced fire starts in this region from the
mix of wet and dry thunderstorm activity, especially outside of main
precipitation cores.

...Heavy Rain Likely Across Coastal Texas and Louisiana into mid
next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

A fast, quasi-zonal flow will set up across the northern tier of
the U.S. during the medium range period with frontal systems
quickly progressing from the West/central U.S. into the East. For
days 3 and 4, model guidance shows good enough agreement for a
general model compromise between the latest deterministic
solutions. For the second half of the period, models continue to
struggle both with the timing and amplification of troughing
reaching the Western U.S. next Friday-Saturday. A blend of
majority ECENS/GEFS mean with minority contributions from the
ECMWF/GFS provided a good starting point and was most consistent
with previous WPC continuity as well.

There remains quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding potential
tropical development in the western Gulf of Mexico late this
weekend and the resulting heavy rainfall threat along the
Texas/Louisiana coasts through the middle of next week. Most of
the guidance agrees that there will be heavy rainfall associated
with this system (regardless of development into a tropical
cyclone) but the bigger question is exactly where that will occur.
Both the ECMWF and GFS bring some kind of surface low along the
Texas coast Monday-Tuesday and eventually inland into either
southeast Texas (ECMWF) or Louisiana (GFS). The CMC remains well
south of the consensus bringing the low closer to Brownsville
region. The WPC QPF for this system was based largely on a blend
of the ECMWF and GFS with our in-house bias corrected model and
the NBM. Refer to the National Hurricane Centers tropical weather
outlook for additional details on development potential with this
system.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The eventual track and evolution of a tropical disturbance in the
western Gulf late this weekend into the early/middle portions of
next week will likely bring multiple rounds of heavy rainfall
along the immediate Texas coast and into parts of Louisiana.
Models continue to suggest some isolated storm total amounts near
or above 10 inches are possible but it is too early to determine
the areas at greatest risk. These kinds of amounts would lead to
at least some flash and urban flooding, particularly for more
sensitive locations... urban regions and those areas that have
already seen above normal rainfall over the past couple of weeks.

Otherwise, mostly lighter rainfall will follow frontal passages
through the central and northeastern parts of the CONUS with some
potential for isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts.
Moderate to locally heavy rainfall may also reach the Pacific
Northwest late this week with some snow possible in the highest
elevations of the Washington Cascades. Periods of above normal
temperatures will shift across the Southwest/Central U.S. into the
East ahead of a couple frontal passages, with below to much below
normal temperatures probable by late week across the Pacific
Northwest. Elsewhere, expect the western Gulf Coast to be below
normal through much of next week associated with clouds and ample
tropical moisture.

...Surge of tropical moisture in the Gulf of Mexico to deliver
Excessive Rainfall to the western Gulf Coast late Sunday and into
next week...

...Sizzling temperatures in the the Nation's Heartland and
Southwest...

...Severe weather possible from the Northern Plains to the Great
Lakes; Air Quality Alerts continue in the Northwest...

Focusing on the tropics, attention turns to a tropical wave near
the Yucatan Peninsula tracking into the Bay of Campeche on Sunday
and into the northwestern Gulf of Mexico by early this week. The
NHC currently gives this feature a 70% chance for development over
the weekend and an 80% chance over the next five days. Rounds of
showers and thunderstorms arrive along the Texas Coast on Sunday
and continue into the upcoming week. As the atmosphere becomes
increasingly favorable environment for shower and thunderstorm
development, excessive rainfall rates and areas of flash flooding
are likely to transpire by Monday. A Day 3 Slight Risk for
Excessive Rainfall has been issued for the Texas Coast in
anticipation of the growing threat for flash flooding on Monday.
There remains uncertainty in whether this tropical wave becomes a
named storm early next week and where the axis of the heaviest
rainfall sets up. No matter the tropical wave's classification,
this feature will deliver rich tropical moisture into southeast
Texas and as far north as southwest Louisiana. Interests along the
western Gulf Coast should monitor this situation closely in the
coming days.

Elsewhere, an expansive dome of upper level ridging stretching
across the southern two-thirds of the U.S. mainland means more
stifling heat from the Southwest to the East Coast. Today, the
hottest temperatures are focused in the Central Plains where high
temperature anomalies look to range between 15-20F above normal.
Record high temps will also be challenged throughout the region as
temperatures soar above the century mark in spots. Some record
warm minimum temps are expected as far west and the Great Basin
and the Desert Southwest. By Sunday, August-like temperatures
arrive in the Mid-Atlantic and sultry conditions return to the
Desert Southwest. In fact, Excessive Heat Warnings have been
issued in parts of Arizona and the Lower Colorado River Valley for
both Sunday and Monday. The coolest temperatures will be confined
to the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Plains.

An elongated frontal boundary stretching from southeast Canada to
the northern High Plains is set to trigger daily episodes of
showers and thunderstorms today and Sunday. The Upper Great Lakes
and central High Plains/Rockies have the best odds for witnessing
scattered showers and storms today. The front progresses east into
the Northeast by Sunday, leading to a renewed chance for storms
across the region while the central and northern High Plains
remain at risk for additional severe weather. Farther south, a
lingering frontal boundary over Florida helps to spawn hit-or-miss
showers and storms each day across the Sunshine State. Last but
not least, raging wildfires in the West continue to generate
massive amounts of smoke that is sweeping across the country. Air
Quality Alerts remain in effect in the Northwest and northern High
Plains while smoke high up in the atmosphere will make for
discolored skies and potentially vivid sunrises and sunsets from
the Plains to the East Coast.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1123 AM CDT Fri Sep 24 2021

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

Minor southeastward expansion of the elevated in the northern
Plains. Observations indicate greater potential for elevated
conditions farther into South Dakota. The driest conditions are
expected from western North Dakota into central South Dakota. With
stronger winds to the east, critical conditions are expected to
remain brief and localized. Elsewhere the forecast remains
unchanged.

..Wendt.. 09/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Fri Sep 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a deepening trough will pivot eastward through
upper Midwest toward the Great Lakes while weak zonal flow persists
across much of the western US. Weak monsoonal flow over the
Southwest will continue with showers and thunderstorms likely across
southern California and western Arizona. At the surface, a cold
front will stall across the Plains with stronger northwesterly flow
aloft supporting dry and gusty conditions across parts of Texas,
Oklahoma, and Kansas.

...Southern Plains...
At the start of the forecast period a cold front is forecast to move
slowly south through Kansas and into northern Oklahoma before
stalling by early afternoon. Along and south of the front, gusty
south/southwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph are expected to
develop by early afternoon. Bolstered by increasing mid-level flow
on the western flank of the upper Midwest trough, the gusty winds
will accompany a dry airmass with widespread surface RH below 20%.
With dry fuels in place, elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions are possible through the afternoon. Weakening winds
overnight should curtail the fire weather threat by early evening.

...Northern Plains...
In the dry post-frontal airmass across the western Dakotas and far
eastern Montana, strong northwesterly flow aloft on the backside of
the trough will bolster breezy northwesterly surface winds of 15-20
mph. Downslope trajectories behind the front will favor low surface
humidity of 15-20% through the afternoon. At least a few hours of
elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions appear probable
given dry fuels in place. A rapid cessation of fire danger is
expected in the evening, as winds weaken and temperatures fall into
the 50s/60s F supporting higher humidity recoveries overnight.

300 PM EDT September 24 2021

SYNOPSIS: A strong area of mid-level high pressure is forecast to become
centered over the east-central U.S. early in week-2, deamplifying toward th=
e
end of the period. Surface low pressure is expected to bring wetter than
normal
conditions to parts of the Southern Plains and Four Corners early in week-2=
.
Mid-level low pressure is predicted to move into the Pacific Northwest late=
r
in
the period, likely ushering in cooler than normal temperatures. There is an
increased likelihood for Hurricane Sam, currently located in the central
Tropical Atlantic, to remain well offshore of the East Coast of the U.S, bu=
t
its future track should be closely monitored.

FOR SATURDAY OCTOBER 02 - FRIDAY OCTOBER 08: Early in week-2, an amplified
500-hPa trough centered over eastern Alaska is anticipated to increase chan=
ces
of below normal minimum temperatures over much of the Mainland, but not
reaching hazardous thresholds. Over the CONUS, there is an increased risk o=
f
below normal minimum temperatures across parts of the Great Basin and
Southeast
during the period, and the Northeast during the latter half of the period.
However, minimum temperatures are not expected to reach hazardous threshold=
s
in
those regions either.



Ensemble means of multiple models depict a high amplitude 500-hPa ridge axi=
s
located east of the Mississippi River during week-2, which is likely to res=
ult
in the most anomalous warmth shifting to the higher latitudes of the
north-central CONUS. Despite the potential for large positive anomalies ear=
ly
in the period, forecast high temperatures are not expected to reach hazardo=
us
criteria. The mean ridge over the east-central CONUS is expected to broaden
and
deamplify throughout week-2, decreasing chances for much above normal maxim=
um
temperatures.



An active storm track is likely across much of Alaska, particularly for the
southeastern Mainland and the Panhandle. Over the CONUS, surface low pressu=
re
over the Great Plains early in the period increases the odds for above norm=
al
precipitation over the Central and Southern High Plains and parts of the Fo=
ur
Corners. However, no precipitation hazards are warranted at this time, give=
n
the anticipated magnitude of the anomalies and the duration over which
rainfall
is likely to occur in these locations.



The forecast mean long-wave pattern during week-2 is not conducive to
increased
likelihood of sustained high wind risk, which is also evidenced by the lack=
 of
signal in the probabilistic extremes winds tool for high wind criteria.
Therefore no wind hazards are posted for this time across the U.S.



Hurricane Sam recently developed across the Main Development Region of the
tropical Atlantic. As of 2pm EDT, the National Hurricane Center (NHC)
forecasts
Sam to become a major hurricane by the end of Saturday, Sep 26. The amplitu=
de
of a 500-hPa trough near the East Coast and the strength of the Atlantic
subtropical ridge will be major factors on the eventual track of Sam during
the
next week to ten days. However, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs GEFS and =
ECMWF ensemble model
guidance
both depict Hurricane Sam remaining well offshore of the East Coast of the
U.S.
Despite increased confidence in an eastward (offshore) solution in the
ensemble
model guidance, areas along the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. need to contin=
ue
to be monitored closely as time progresses toward week-2. Please refer to t=

305 PM EDT Fri Sep 24 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Sep 27 2021 - 12Z Fri Oct 01 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period begins on Monday with a closed upper low
offshore British Columbia and another across far southeastern
Canada, with a compact upper low moving across the Southwest and
southern High Plains. This general pattern should maintain itself
through the entire week and gradually amplify as the initial
trough pushes into the Western U.S.,ridging sharply amplifies over
the Central U.S., and additional energy strengthens the trough in
the East as well. The latest suite of guidance suggests a cut-off
low may form over/just off the Mid-Atlantic coast by Friday, with
a second possible cut-off low over the Southwest/Four Corners.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

While model guidance generally is agreeable with the overall
trough-ridge-trough pattern described above, differences in
placement of the features as well as their evolution remain. On
day 3/Monday, mainly minor placement issues remain with the upper
low across southeast Canada, with the 00z CMC now the outlier with
being farther south with it. Most of the guidance now shows
troughing hanging through the week over the East Coast before
northern stream energy lifts into Maritime Canada and then
possible energy breaking off forming a cut-off closed low which
slowly drifts south near the coastal Mid-Atlantic by Friday.
Confidence in this feature and associated details remains low
however, just given the current spread in the ensembles. Out West,
there is overall good agreement as troughing moves into the West
Coast and ridging amplifies over the central states. It's not
until later in the week when detail uncertainties arise regarding
both northern stream energy moving inot the northern High
Plains/southern Canada as well as southern stream/cut-off energy
in the Southwest.

The WPC forecast used a blend of the latest deterministic guidance
for the first half of the period. Increased the ensemble means the
second half of the week to mitigate some of the detail
differences, but continued to maintain at least 50% combined of
the GFS/ECMWF for some added definition to Eastern U.S. and
Southwest features. This maintained fairly good continuity with
the previous shift as well.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Increasing return flow moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is
forecast to spread showers and thunderstorms into Texas early
week, with southerly flow ahead of a Southwest closed low sliding
eastward continuing the threat for moderate to at least locally
heavy rain across the southern and central Plains later in the
week. Scattered showers in parts of the Four Corners states may
also become more widespread and heavier through the period as
well. The Pacific Northwest should see periods of orographically
enhanced precipitation during next week with snow possible in the
highest elevations, generally after the cold front passage. Rain
should begin to break out ahead of the front late week across the
northern Plains with continued shower chances across southern
Florida associated with a weakening stationary front.

Temperatures are expected to be warmer than average for the
north-central U.S. throughout the period underneath the
upper-level ridge. The Northern Plains in particular could see
temperatures around 15-25 degrees above normal, with highs in the
mid to upper 80s. Troughing across the western U.S. will result in
below normal temperatures, with highs 10-20 degrees below average
spreading from the Pacific Northwest into the Great Basin.
Meanwhile, temperatures in the East will generally be right around
average.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Fri Sep 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The primary area of concern across the northern Rockies will be in
the immediate lee of the Rockies in central Montana. Terrain-driven
flow could reach above 20 mph locally. Confidence in strong winds
occurring broadly remains low to moderate. Fuels in these areas have
remained susceptible to fire spread.

Fuels dryness across much of southern Wyoming has moderated. The
exception to this is within the Laramie Mountains vicinity. As
mentioned, the limited spatial overlap of stronger winds with dry
fuels continues to preclude highlights.

..Wendt.. 09/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CDT Fri Sep 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
Troughing over the Midwest and Great Lakes will move eastward toward
the Northeastern US while shortwave ridging develops over the center
of the country. A second trough will move onshore across the Pacific
Northwest late, bringing increasing mid-level flow and dry
conditions to the Rockies and western US.

...Northern/Central Rockies...
Ahead of the Pacific Northwest trough, westerly mid-level flow will
begin to increase in the wake of shortwave ridging across the
Rockies. In response, a lee trough is expected to form early Day 2
enhancing low-level westerly winds through portions of Montana and
southern Wyoming. The dry westerly flow will support low surface RH
of 15-25% with winds of 15-20 mph. However, the greatest overlap
with dry and windy conditions is forecast to remain within areas of
less receptive and available fuels. This suggests the threat for
elevated fire weather conditions should remain mostly local in
nature.

...Southern Plains...
Widespread elevated fire weather conditions are not expected during
the forecast period on day 2. However, a prolonged dry period will
continue with gusty surface winds near the lee trough, and surface
RH below 20%. With dry fuels in place, a risk for locally elevated
fire weather conditions may linger for a few hours across portions
of The Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri September 24 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 30 - OCT 04, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. All models depict a strong 500-hPa ridge from northern Can=
ada
southward into a large part of the CONUS. Models also agree that there will=
 be
a deep mean trough through Alaska and southward, with the largest mid-level
height anomalies over the northern Pacific Ocean off the south Alaskan Coas=
t.
The models are less consistent on the southeastern and northwestern
extremities
of the CONUS. With respect to the trough west of North America, models come=
 to
a variety of solutions regarding how far negative height anomalies will ext=
end
into the Pacific Northwest and extreme southeastern Alaska. Along the East
Coast, models disagree on the shape and magnitude of a negative 500-hPa
anomaly
that is expected to form on the southeastern fringe of the large North
American
ridge. Several models align with the European Model from yesterday, placing=
 an
area of mean negative height anomalies into the southeastern CONUS. But mos=
t
still favor a weaker solution farther offshore. The forecast again leans in
the
direction of the flatter, more eastward solution, but some consideration wa=
s
given to the other possibility.

This pattern results in a broad area of enhanced above-normal temperature
probabilities extending from the northern Rockies and southern Plains throu=
gh
New England and into the Southeast. The highest probabilities for above nor=
mal
temperatures exist closest to the mid-level height anomaly center, in the
Upper
Mississippi Valley and adjacent areas. Farther west, uncertainty in the
configuration of the trough centered west of North America led to a broad a=
rea
of near-normal climatological probabilities favoring neither above- nor
below-normal temperatures. There is only a small area of marginally-enhance=
d
chances for subnormal temperatures over extreme western Texas and New Mexic=
o
where there was a little more agreement among model solutions. With the tro=
ugh
extending through and south of Alaska, subnormal temperatures are favored
statewide.

Between the 500-hPa ridge in eastern North America and the trough farther
west,
an area of enhanced moisture inflow from the south should lead to above-nor=
mal
precipitation from much of Texas northward to the Canadian border. Drier
weather seems more likely near and along the ridge axis in the eastern CONU=
S,
and from the northern Rockies through northern California west of the enhan=
ced
moisture inflow. A small area of enhanced above-normal precipitation
probabilities also covers northwestern Washington, where there is closer
proximity to the western trough tilting their odds toward wetness. This
wetness
should extend up through the Alaskan Panhandle, but a more continental flow=
 of
air to the northwest of the anomalous trough favors unusually dry condition=
s
farther west in Alaska.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's operational 0z ECMWF
centered on Day 8, and 35% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offse=
t
by
some disparities in the configuration of the trough off the West Coast of
North
America and the potential for subnormal 500-hPa heights in the Southeast.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 02 - 08 2021

Models remain in relative agreement through week-2. Early in the period, th=
e
strong anomalous ridge in eastern North America is expected to flatten, but
not
dissipate, keeping a broader, flatter ridge over most of the U.S., includin=
g
much of the West Coast. The trough west of North America is also forecast t=
o
de-amplify, but there is uncertainty regarding how much. In addition, the
models are in better agreement than in the 6 to 10 day period in the
Southeast,
with the broad flattening ridge to the north squelching any significant
incursion of significantly below-normal 500-hPa heights into the Southeast.
The
operational GFS offers upper-level ridging farther west, extending
significantly into the western states, but the model has been inconsistent =
the
past few runs and for now this solution is disregarded.

The broad, flattening ridge should bring above-normal temperatures to most =
of
the CONUS, except for the northwestern and southeastern fringes, where weak
troughing nearby should keep temperatures down. The best chances for anomal=
ous
warmth remain nearest the center of the 500-hPa height anomalies in the upp=
er
Midwest.

The precipitation outlook is similar to the one expected in the 6 to 10 day
period, but with lower magnitudes reflecting the flattening of the mid-leve=
l
flow and the uncertainty of its evolution, particularly in the western U.S.
Below-normal precipitation remains favored from the Mississippi Valley
eastward
through the Northeast and the interior Southeast. Fewer models support a we=
t
solution in the Southeast, so climatological probabilities favoring neither
wet
nor dry weather remain in place. A flattening ridge favors less moisture
streaming northward into the central states, with enhanced chances for surp=
lus
precipitation restricted to the southern High Plains, and some tilt of the
odds
toward dryness farther north. The weakening trough west of North America
should
keep a similar pattern in place across Alaska, but with lower probabilities
reflecting the uncertainty in the evolution of the western trough.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Yesterday's =
6z
GFS Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, 50% of Yesterday's GFS Superensemble
Mean
centered on Day 10, and 35% of Yesterday's 0z European Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 10


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the models on the broad mid-level ridge and temperature
forecasts, offset by some differences among the precipitation tools and the
evolution of the decaying trough near the West Coast.


FORECASTER: Rich Tinker

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...Overview...

The medium range period begins on Monday with a closed upper low
offshore British Columbia and another across far southeastern
Canada, with a compact upper low moving across the Southwest and
southern High Plains. This general pattern should maintain itself
through the entire week and gradually amplify as the initial
trough pushes into the Western U.S.,ridging sharply amplifies over
the Central U.S., and additional energy strengthens the trough in
the East as well. The latest suite of guidance suggests a cut-off
low may form over/just off the Mid-Atlantic coast by Friday, with
a second possible cut-off low over the Southwest/Four Corners.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

While model guidance generally is agreeable with the overall
trough-ridge-trough pattern described above, differences in
placement of the features as well as their evolution remain. On
day 3/Monday, mainly minor placement issues remain with the upper
low across southeast Canada, with the 00z CMC now the outlier with
being farther south with it. Most of the guidance now shows
troughing hanging through the week over the East Coast before
northern stream energy lifts into Maritime Canada and then
possible energy breaking off forming a cut-off closed low which
slowly drifts south near the coastal Mid-Atlantic by Friday.
Confidence in this feature and associated details remains low
however, just given the current spread in the ensembles. Out West,
there is overall good agreement as troughing moves into the West
Coast and ridging amplifies over the central states. It's not
until later in the week when detail uncertainties arise regarding
both northern stream energy moving inot the northern High
Plains/southern Canada as well as southern stream/cut-off energy
in the Southwest.

The WPC forecast used a blend of the latest deterministic guidance
for the first half of the period. Increased the ensemble means the
second half of the week to mitigate some of the detail
differences, but continued to maintain at least 50% combined of
the GFS/ECMWF for some added definition to Eastern U.S. and
Southwest features. This maintained fairly good continuity with
the previous shift as well.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Increasing return flow moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is
forecast to spread showers and thunderstorms into Texas early
week, with southerly flow ahead of a Southwest closed low sliding
eastward continuing the threat for moderate to at least locally
heavy rain across the southern and central Plains later in the
week. Scattered showers in parts of the Four Corners states may
also become more widespread and heavier through the period as
well. The Pacific Northwest should see periods of orographically
enhanced precipitation during next week with snow possible in the
highest elevations, generally after the cold front passage. Rain
should begin to break out ahead of the front late week across the
northern Plains with continued shower chances across southern
Florida associated with a weakening stationary front.

Temperatures are expected to be warmer than average for the
north-central U.S. throughout the period underneath the
upper-level ridge. The Northern Plains in particular could see
temperatures around 15-25 degrees above normal, with highs in the
mid to upper 80s. Troughing across the western U.S. will result in
below normal temperatures, with highs 10-20 degrees below average
spreading from the Pacific Northwest into the Great Basin.
Meanwhile, temperatures in the East will generally be right around
average.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
223 AM EDT Sat Sep 25 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Sep 28 2021 - 12Z Sat Oct 02 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period begins on Tuesday with a mid/upper-level
trough axis along the Pacific Northwest, troughing across the
Northeast stemming from an upper low in eastern Canada, with
mainly ridging in between in the central U.S., with the exception
of a small vort max in the Southern Rockies. This general
trough-ridge-trough pattern should maintain itself through the
rest of the week while amplifying, as additional energy
strengthens both troughs and narrows the ridge, and potentially
creates closed lows over portions of both the West and the East by
the end of the week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

While model guidance is generally agreeable with the overall
trough-ridge-trough pattern described above, differences in
placement of the features as well as their evolution certainly
remain. In the East, models are well clustered with the upper low
position in Canada and subsequent troughing on day 3/Tuesday, but
the 12Z UKMET became an outlier by Wednesday by dropping a
shortwave into the northeastern U.S. unlike other guidance. For
the latter part of the week, most deterministic guidance is now
suggesting that an upper low will close off somewhere along the
Eastern Seaboard/western Atlantic. There is low confidence with
the positioning and movement of this upper low, however, with the
12Z ECMWF and CMC showing the upper low centered over the
Mid-Atlantic on Friday and retrograding on Saturday, while GFS
runs have the low's centroid remaining offshore. Cluster analysis
of the multi-suite ensemble members shows that these are both
possibilities, along with showing latitudinal variations and even
some solutions without a closed low. So attempted to take a middle
ground approach for now in the upper low position and strength,
with changes expected in future forecasts with newer guidance.

In the West, there is good model agreement through midweek as the
trough pushes through the West. By around Thursday, differences
begin to arise with the potential northern/southern stream
separation as energy spins into the Southwest, with some guidance
forming a closed low at times. Then additional shortwaves stemming
from the northeast Pacific vary with their timing and tracks by
Friday/Saturday, indicating lower predictability by then.

The WPC forecast utilized a blend of the 12/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF
and CMC deterministic guidance for the early part of the period,
and reliance on the GEFS and EC ensemble means increased by the
end of the period to reduce some of the differences between
individual models.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Showers and thunderstorms are likely across the Southern Plains
beginning around Tuesday, but rain should become heavier and more
widespread there for the latter part of the week, as moisture from
both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific streams into the region
ahead of the second round of energy in the Southwest. Some rain is
also forecast to spread farther north in the Plains especially
around midweek focusing along and ahead of a cold front. Scattered
showers in parts of the Four Corners states may also become more
widespread and heavier through the period as well. The Pacific
Northwest should see periods of orographically enhanced
precipitation next week, with snow possible in the highest
elevations. Meanwhile, a round of light to moderate rain is
possible along a front in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday into
Wednesday. Then depending on the eastern upper low's track,
moisture may spread into the Northeast by the end of the week.

Temperatures are expected to be warmer than average for the
north-central U.S. throughout the period underneath the
upper-level ridge. The Northern Plains in particular could see
temperatures around 15-25 degrees above normal, with highs in the
mid to upper 80s on Tuesday. Troughing across the western U.S.
will result in below normal temperatures, with highs 10-20 degrees
below average spreading from the Pacific Northwest into the Great
Basin. Meanwhile, temperatures in the East will generally be right
around average.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
223 AM EDT Sat Sep 25 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Sep 28 2021 - 12Z Sat Oct 02 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period begins on Tuesday with a mid/upper-level
trough axis along the Pacific Northwest, troughing across the
Northeast stemming from an upper low in eastern Canada, with
mainly ridging in between in the central U.S., with the exception
of a small vort max in the Southern Rockies. This general
trough-ridge-trough pattern should maintain itself through the
rest of the week while amplifying, as additional energy
strengthens both troughs and narrows the ridge, and potentially
creates closed lows over portions of both the West and the East by
the end of the week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

While model guidance is generally agreeable with the overall
trough-ridge-trough pattern described above, differences in
placement of the features as well as their evolution certainly
remain. In the East, models are well clustered with the upper low
position in Canada and subsequent troughing on day 3/Tuesday, but
the 12Z UKMET became an outlier by Wednesday by dropping a
shortwave into the northeastern U.S. unlike other guidance. For
the latter part of the week, most deterministic guidance is now
suggesting that an upper low will close off somewhere along the
Eastern Seaboard/western Atlantic. There is low confidence with
the positioning and movement of this upper low, however, with the
12Z ECMWF and CMC showing the upper low centered over the
Mid-Atlantic on Friday and retrograding on Saturday, while GFS
runs have the low's centroid remaining offshore. Cluster analysis
of the multi-suite ensemble members shows that these are both
possibilities, along with showing latitudinal variations and even
some solutions without a closed low. So attempted to take a middle
ground approach for now in the upper low position and strength,
with changes expected in future forecasts with newer guidance.

In the West, there is good model agreement through midweek as the
trough pushes through the West. By around Thursday, differences
begin to arise with the potential northern/southern stream
separation as energy spins into the Southwest, with some guidance
forming a closed low at times. Then additional shortwaves stemming
from the northeast Pacific vary with their timing and tracks by
Friday/Saturday, indicating lower predictability by then.

The WPC forecast utilized a blend of the 12/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF
and CMC deterministic guidance for the early part of the period,
and reliance on the GEFS and EC ensemble means increased by the
end of the period to reduce some of the differences between
individual models.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Showers and thunderstorms are likely across the Southern Plains
beginning around Tuesday, but rain should become heavier and more
widespread there for the latter part of the week, as moisture from
both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific streams into the region
ahead of the second round of energy in the Southwest. Some rain is
also forecast to spread farther north in the Plains especially
around midweek focusing along and ahead of a cold front. Scattered
showers in parts of the Four Corners states may also become more
widespread and heavier through the period as well. The Pacific
Northwest should see periods of orographically enhanced
precipitation next week, with snow possible in the highest
elevations. Meanwhile, a round of light to moderate rain is
possible along a front in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday into
Wednesday. Then depending on the eastern upper low's track,
moisture may spread into the Northeast by the end of the week.

Temperatures are expected to be warmer than average for the
north-central U.S. throughout the period underneath the
upper-level ridge. The Northern Plains in particular could see
temperatures around 15-25 degrees above normal, with highs in the
mid to upper 80s on Tuesday. Troughing across the western U.S.
will result in below normal temperatures, with highs 10-20 degrees
below average spreading from the Pacific Northwest into the Great
Basin. Meanwhile, temperatures in the East will generally be right
around average.

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper trough across the Great Lakes will continue to deepen
as it moves eastward into the northeastern US and southeastern
Canada today. To the west, weak ridging is forecast to become
established within the northern branch of split mid-level flow
across the northern and central Rockies. At the same time, a closed
low will meander eastward off Baja California, as a strong trough
approaches the Pacific Northwest. The increase in mid-level ridging
will support warm and dry conditions across the central Rockies.

...Montana and Wyoming...
Beneath the aforementioned ridge, warm temperatures and dry
conditions are expected across much of Montana and Wyoming through
the afternoon. The dry airmass will support surface relative
humidity values below 20% in the lee of the Rockies. Although,
locally higher RH appears likely over western Montana where
temperatures are expected to be cooler. With relatively weak
mid-level flow in place due to the shortwave ridging, surface winds
are not expected to support of widespread fire weather conditions.
However, local enhancement to near 20 mph from terrain and the
development of a weak lee trough may support a few hours of locally
elevated fire weather conditions across portions of Wyoming and
Montana.

...Southern Plains...
Broad but weak high pressure over the southern half of the CONUS
will support warm and dry conditions across much of the southern
Plains this afternoon/evening. Widespread surface humidity values
below 20% are expected across portions of western Oklahoma, Kansas
and into the Texas Panhandle. Here, fuels remain dry and favorable
for fire spread. However, winds generally below 15 mph should limit
the spatial extent of any sustained fire weather conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0202 AM CDT Sat Sep 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
Across the western US, southwesterly mid-level flow will begin to
increase ahead of a strong Pacific trough moving onshore across the
Northwest. To the south, a cutoff low will move eastward, rejoining
broad westerly flow across the Southwest. At the surface, a lee low
will move southeastward across the central Plains, trailing a weak
cold front. Dry and windy conditions are expected ahead of the low
through much of the southern Plains and across the Great Basin where
fuels are dry.

...Southern Plains...
As the previously mentioned lee low develops and moves southeastward
across the Plains early Sunday, increasing surface pressure
gradients will bolster low-level southwesterly flow across portions
of the southern Plains. Aided by the development of a low-level jet,
widespread surface winds of 20-25 mph are expected with higher gusts
possible nearer the low in eastern Kansas. Model soundings show a
dry airmass in place with surface RH below 20% likely across western
Oklahoma and portions of the Texas Panhandle. Increasing cloud cover
and greater surface moisture in eastern Kansas will favor slightly
higher humidity values generally below 30%. With regional fuels near
the 80th percentile of dryness, widespread elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions appear likely. More widespread
critical conditions may develop should the corridor of stronger
winds become better aligned with drier surface conditions across
portions of Oklahoma and Texas.

...Northern Great Basin...
As southwesterly flow from the approaching Pacific trough begins to
spread inland, low-level winds are projected to increase to near
15-20 mph across portions of northern California and northwestern
Nevada. Here, persistent warm and dry conditions with surface RH
below 15%, along with mostly dry fuels will support elevated fire
weather conditions through the afternoon.

...Isolated chances for flash flooding found across parts of Maine
and the Southwest through the weekend...

...Unsettled weather to enter the Pacific Northwest by Sunday...

...Well above average temperatures build into the central United
States...

A majority of the nation will enjoy a dry autumn weekend, with
precipiation chances confined to the Great Lakes and all four
corners of the Lower 48. Starting in the east, a slow moving cold
front extending from Maine to southern Florida is expected to
become quasi-stationary and lead to scattered showers and
thunderstorms. A few instances of flash flooding will be possible
today across both Maine and southern Florida, with moderate to
locally heavy rain chances lingering into Sunday across
northern/central Maine as a low pressure system develops in the
Gulf of Maine. Meanwhile, a cold front zipping through the Lower
Great Lakes today may produce scattered showers and thunderstorms
that extend into the Ohio Valley. For the western U.S., an
upper-level low located off the coast of southern California will
continue funneling moisture into the Desert Southwest. This will
help spark scattered thunderstorms, a few of which could produce
intense rainfall rates and isolated flash flooding. This weather
pattern is expected to remain through at least early Monday, with
the greatest chances for rain found across southern/central
Arizona and western New Mexico. Unsettled weather is also set to
infiltrate the Pacific Northwest by Sunday as a potent cold front
approaches the region. Gusty winds and rough seas can be expected
along the coasts of Washington and Oregon as well.

After a chilly start this morning, much of the central U.S. will
experience a quick warming trend as highs soar above average this
afternoon and even more so by Sunday. High temperatures into the
80s and low 90s throughout the Great Plains will make it feel more
like the end of August than the final weekend of September.
Elsewhere, average to slightly below average temperatures will be
found across the eastern third of the country behind a pair of
cold fronts.

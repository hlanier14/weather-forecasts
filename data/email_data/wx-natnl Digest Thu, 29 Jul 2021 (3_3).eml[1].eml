information will be provided in supplementary messages.


FORECASTS OF TSUNAMI ACTIVITY

  arrive at the following locations and specified times.

* Forecast tsunami duration is the approximate length of time which
  the tsunami may produce dangerous currents and waves.

* Forecast max tsunami height is the highest expected water level
  above the tide.

* Forecasts are not provided for sites which have been impacted
  more than an hour prior to the time of this message.

PRELIMINARY EARTHQUAKE PARAMETERS
---------------------------------

* Magnitude  8.2
* Origin Time  2216 AKDT Jul 28 2021
  2316PDT Jul 28 2021
  0616UTC Jul 29 2021
* Coordinates  55.3 North 157.8 West
* Depth  20 miles
* Location  75 miles SE of Chignik, Alaska
  500 miles SW of Anchorage, Alaska


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS - UPDATED
-----------------------------
Actions to protect human life and property will
vary within tsunami advisory areas.

If you are in a tsunami advisory area;

* Move out of the water, off the beach, and away from
  harbors, marinas, breakwaters, bays and inlets.

* Be alert to and follow instructions from your local
  emergency officials because they may have more detailed or
  specific information for your location.

* If you feel a strong earthquake or extended ground rolling
  take immediate protective actions such as moving inland
  and/or uphill preferably by foot.

* Boat operators,
    * Where time and conditions permit, move your boat out to
      sea to a depth of at least 180 feet.

    * If at sea avoid entering shallow water, harbors,
      marinas, bays, and inlets to avoid floating and
      submerged debris and strong currents.

* Do not go to the shore to observe the tsunami.

* Do not return to the coast until local emergency officials
  indicate it is safe to do so.


IMPACTS
-------
Impacts will vary at different locations in the advisory
areas.

If you are in a tsunami advisory area;

* A tsunami with strong waves and currents is possible.

* Waves and currents can drown or injure people who are
  in the water.

* Currents at beaches and in harbors, marinas,
  bays, and inlets may be especially dangerous.

* Some impacts may continue for many hours to days after
  arrival of the first wave.

* The first wave may not be the largest so later waves may
  be larger.

* Each wave may last 5 to 45 minutes as a wave encroaches
  and recedes.

* Coasts facing all directions are threatened because the
  waves can wrap around islands and headlands and into bays.

* Strong shaking or rolling of the ground indicates an
  earthquake has occurred and a tsunami may be imminent.

* A rapidly receding or receded shoreline, unusual waves and
  sounds, and strong currents are signs of a tsunami.

* The tsunami may appear as water moving rapidly out to sea,
  a gentle rising tide like flood with no breaking wave,
  as a series of breaking waves, or a frothy wall of water.

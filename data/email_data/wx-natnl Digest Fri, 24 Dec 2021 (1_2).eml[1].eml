Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1001 AM CST Thu Dec 23 2021

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The only change to the outlook was to expand the southern High
Plains Elevated area slightly north-northeastward across most of the
TX Panhandle into adjacent parts of southwest OK. After modifying
the 12Z AMA RAOB with a maximum temperature in the lower/middle 70s,
RH reductions of 15 percent with boundary-layer winds of 25-30 mph
will support a few hours of elevated fire-weather conditions this
afternoon. While brief locally critical conditions will be possible,
the lack of a tighter pressure gradient and only modest surface
winds generally near 15 mph should limit a higher-end fire-weather
threat. For additional details, see the previous discussion below.

..Weinman.. 12/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CST Thu Dec 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough is expected to amplify while progressing east
across the Interior West, encouraging surface lee-trough
intensification along the lee of the Rockies today. Breezy, dry
conditions are expected across the central and southern High Plains,
where critically dry fuels will foster a wildfire-spread threat.

Elevated highlights remain in place across parts of northeast
Colorado, where 15 mph southerly surface winds and 20 percent RH are
expected to coincide for at least a few hours during the afternoon.
Broader Elevated highlights have also been maintained across eastern
New Mexico into west Texas, where a broad swath of overlapping 10-15
mph westerly surface winds and 15-20 percent RH are likely. While
the surface winds may struggle to sustain above 15 mph in both
Elevated areas, the low RH and very dry fine fuels are expected to
compensate to support Elevated fire-weather conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1247 PM CST Thu Dec 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments
were made with this update. The Elevated area was expanded slightly
eastward into parts of central OK, where a multi-model consensus
depicts sustained southwesterly surface winds of 20-25 mph with
higher gusts. While marginal RH reductions across the Elevated area
cast some uncertainty on the overall fire-weather threat, a
conditional risk of critical fire-weather conditions remains
plausible -- especially if RH values fall 5-10 percent lower than
guidance currently suggests. Presently, this conditional risk
appears greatest across parts of the TX Panhandle into the TX South
Plains and far western OK, where winds in the top of the boundary
layer could approach 40-55 mph amid critically dry fuels. For
additional details on the southern Plains fire-weather threat, see
the previous discussion below.

..Weinman.. 12/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CST Thu Dec 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
Surface lee troughing will continue to intensify to the lee of the
Rockies as a mid-level trough impinges on the central U.S.
tomorrow/Friday. Modestly dry but windy conditions are expected
south of a cold front across the southern High Plains, where at
least some wildfire-spread concerns exist given very receptive fine
fuels in place. An Elevated area has been introduced to account for
widespread 25-30 mph sustained westerly winds, though RH may only
dip to 25 percent in spots by afternoon peak heating. Despite the
modestly dry air, the very strong winds atop critically dry fuels
are still expected to support high-end Elevated fire-weather
conditions for at least a few hours tomorrow afternoon. If guidance
trends any lower with RH, Critical highlights may be added in future
outlooks.

SYNOPSIS: During week-2, strong mid-level low pressure forecast across west=
ern
North America increases the potential for much below normal temperatures
throughout the western and north-central contiguous U.S. and southeastern
Alaska. Tied to this mid-level feature, enhanced moisture may bring heavy
precipitation over the West Coast, and possible heavy snowfall accumulation=

to
the higher elevations of California, Pacific Northwest, Great Basin and the
Rockies during the period. Downstream, surface low formation favors
above-normal and possibly heavy precipitation across the southeastern U.S.

FOR FRIDAY DECEMBER 31 - THURSDAY JANUARY 06: There continues to be good
agreement among the dynamical models (GEFS, ECMWF, Canadian) favoring an
amplified negative Pacific North American (PNA) pattern during the outlook
period. As part of this pattern, much of the week-2 hazards perspective
continues to center around full latitude troughing favored throughout weste=
rn
North America, as this mid-level feature looks to remain the culprit for
multiple temperature, wind and precipitation related hazards over the CONUS
persisting into the New Year. Compared to previous model runs, the 0z GEFS =
and
ECMWF ensembles 500-hPa height forecasts have backed off somewhat on the me=
an
amplitude of this full latitude troughing, but are showing a better depicti=
on
of shortwave disturbances propagating along the mean trough axis across the
western U.S to help reinforce the potential for weather related hazards lat=
er
in week-2.



By the outset of the period, predominant northwesterly flow and anomalously
cold temperatures are anticipated to be in place across much of western and
north-central CONUS. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict elevat=
ed
probabilities in excess of 60% for minimum temperatures falling below the 1=
5th
percentile during the first few days of the period to support the continuat=
ion
of a high risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the northwest=
ern
and north-central CONUS from Dec 31 to Jan 1. Within this highlighted regio=
n,
there remains increased chances of minimum temperatures falling below the
lowest climatological percentiles over parts of the eastern Washington and
northeastern Montana, suggestive of possible near record minimum temperatur=
es
for these areas. By day 10 (Jan 2), both reforecast tools indicate some
reduction of the elevated cold signals throughout the region before reemerg=
ing
again later in period, which appears to be tied to the favored re-
strengthening
of negative height departures across the West. While the reforecast tools d=
o
not show much support for the reintroduction of a high risk area, they
generally maintain at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures falling be=
low
the 15th percentile over portions of the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockie=
s
and Northern Plains through the end of the period. Thus, a moderate risk fo=
r
much below normal temperatures remains posted for the entirety of week-2.
Similarly, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures remains posted f=
or
week-2 over the western third and north-central CONUS where there is at lea=
st
a
20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below 15th percentile in the
reforecast guidance.



The mid-level troughing across the West is also expected to support
above-normal precipitation much of the western half of the CONUS throughout
the
period. Compared to yesterday, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles show an
increased potential for surface low development in the eastern Pacific to
provide another period of enhanced precipitation over parts of the West Coa=
st
by the middle of week-2. This is reflected in the reforecast tools which
indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the
85th percentile and 1 (2) inch(es) over northern California (Pacific
Northwest), supporting the addition of a slight risk of heavy precipitation
for
the region from Jan 2 to Jan 6. With anomalously cold air favored to be pla=
ce,
a pair of slight risk areas of heavy snow remain posted over the higher
elevations of California and the Pacific Northwest, and farther east over t=
he
Four Corners region where reforecast tools show at least an increased chanc=
e
of
3-day liquid equivalent accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile. Relati=
ve
to yesterday's outlook, these slight risk areas are now extended through th=
e
entirety of week-2 given the wetter solutions now favored throughout the
period. In addition, the slight risk of heavy precipitation is removed over
the
Southwest, as much of the higher precipitation amounts favored in the
ensembles
now appear to be timed off.  Lastly, both reforecast tools continue to
indicate
a broad region across the western and central CONUS with at least a 20% cha=
nce
of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile. The latest ensemble surface
analyses are favoring the development of strong pressure gradients associat=
ed
with the aforementioned potential surface low in the eastern Pacific. Thus,=
 a
broad slight risk area of high winds remains posted and is expanded to incl=
ude
the northwestern CONUS relative to yesterday's outlook and extend through t=
he
end of the period. There are increasing signals in the ECMWF reforecast too=
l
for high winds across portions of southern California suggestive of Santa A=
na
winds, but this is less supported by the GEFS and not included in the outlo=
ok.



Further east, surface low formation over the Great Plains continues to be
favored early in the period. With return flow favored along the western
periphery of surface high pressure over the western Atlantic, this increase=
s
the potential for heavy precipitation over the southeastern CONUS. There is
good agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depicting a regi=
on
with at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85t=
h
percentile and 1 inch, supporting a slight risk of heavy precipitation from
the
Lower Mississippi Valley to the Appalachians (Dec 31-Jan 2).



Over the Central Pacific, guidance favors another Kona low developing to th=
e
west of the Hawaiian Islands during week-1, with much of the anomalous
mid-level troughing and surface low pressure expected to persist underneath
highly amplified ridging over the northern Pacific during week-2. This heig=
ht
pattern is expected to promote above-normal precipitation over the central
Pacific, where reforecast tools show increased chances of precipitation
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile over parts of Hawaii throughout
the
outlook period. A continuation of above-normal and possibly heavy
precipitation
over the Hawaiian islands may worsen already saturated soils and trigger
localized flooding due to antecedent rainfall over the Hawaiian islands sin=
ce
early December.



Across Alaska, prevailing northwesterly flow on the east side of the ridge
axis
is expected to keep much of eastern Alaska Mainland and the Panhandle on th=
e
cold side during week-2. Early in the period, both the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles
continue to favor the redevelopment of positive mid-level height departures
over the Bering Sea, which would help to promote another period of arctic a=
ir
descending into southeastern Alaska. Relative to yesterday, reforecast tool=
s
show a longer period and greater coverage of probabilities in excess of 40%=
 of
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile. Thus, the moderate
risk
of much below normal temperatures is extended from Jan 2 to Jan 5, and
expanded
through much of the Panhandle. A broader slight risk area of much below nor=
mal
temperatures is also expanded from the Kenai Peninsula through the Alaska
Panhandle from Jan 1 to Jan 6.

215 PM EST Thu Dec 23 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Dec 26 2021 - 12Z Thu Dec 30 2021

...Potential for heavy mountain snow and light/moderate lower
elevation Pacific Northwest snow continues through early next week
across much of the West...

...Bitterly cold temperatures are forecast across portions of the
Northwest to Northern Plains next week...


...Overview...

A rather stagnant pattern is forecast for the medium range period
led by a persistent and highly amplified northern Pacific
ridge/upper high. Downstream, deep troughing is expected over the
western U.S. as a likely closed mid-upper low drifts eastward over
southwestern and south-central Canada, while shortwaves eject from
the upper trough and are carried along in fast west-southwesterly
mean flow, which will support a series of low pressure systems
developing and tracking over the central and northeastern U.S.
Meanwhile, another upper high moving from the Gulf of Mexico early
week into the Bahamas by midweek will spread ridging and above
normal temperatures to the southeastern quadrant of the country
south of the storm track.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance remains in good agreement with the large-scale
pattern described above, especially through the middle of next
week. Less certain aspects of the forecast include the rounds of
shortwave energy propagating eastward from the main trough. There
are some variations in the 00/06Z model guidance with a Northeast
shortwave already by early Sunday, with the 00Z GFS among the
strongest with the energy, which also brings its associated
surface low closer to the Northeast coast compared to the
consensus that is farther east in the Atlantic. That solution was
not favored and the early part of the medium range forecast was
based on a blend favoring the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, along with
smaller proportions of the 00Z UKMET and CMC. Good model agreement
with this blend also persisted with frontal timing in the central
U.S. for early week, despite some variability in location of
surface lows along the front.

By Tuesday through Thursday, most guidance indicates a mid-upper
low closing off over southwestern/south-central Canada as a piece
of the polar vortex likely drops southward, and this was indicated
by the latest WPC forecast. Shortwaves spinning around the low
have less certainty with strength and timing once again. There is
a good bit of run-to-run variability in model guidance, but for
the 00Z/06Z cycle, the 06Z GFS appeared to be the greatest outlier
in deterministic guidance, essentially dividing the upper low by
early Thursday with one closed low along the OR/CA border. Thus by
the latter part of the forecast period, transitioned to using a
proportion of the 00Z GFS rather than the 06Z while still favoring
the 00Z ECMWF, and ended the forecast period with 50% GEFS and EC
ensemble means combined with 50% deterministic models to temper
the individual forecast differences.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Rounds of precipitation are forecast for the West as shortwave
energy rounding the persistent upper trough periodically enhances
moisture inflow. The highest snow totals are likely for the
typical terrain enhanced areas of the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and
portions of the Rockies, while coastal Oregon and California could
see locally heavy precipitation as well. Snow levels could lower
enough under the cold upper trough to bring snow to cities like
Seattle and Portland continuing from the short range period into
Sunday, while other parts of the West could also see lowering snow
levels as the upper trough axis nudges inland.

Generally progressive low pressure systems will spread periodic
precipitation across the north-central and northeastern U.S.
through next week. Snow chances should be confined to the Midwest
to Great Lakes and interior Northeast, with a round of heavier
snow possible for the Upper Midwest Sunday into Monday. Additional
chances for wintry weather are possible later next week as well,
but precipitation type, coverage, and amounts are still uncertain.
The associated trailing cold front slowly sinking southeastward
could provide a focus for enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley
around Tuesday-Wednesday and toward the Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachians by Thursday of next week, but with
uncertainty remaining regarding the amounts and axis of the
heaviest rain.

Mild to warm weather is expected across the south-central U.S.
northeastward through next week. The southern Great Plains will be
at the center of the greatest warm temperature anomalies on Sunday
(20-35F above normal), with record daily high minimum and maximum
temperatures likely. Anomalous to record warmth may press slightly
eastward as the week progresses, with temperatures 20+ degrees
above average expected to spread into parts of the Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys. Highs in the 70s will be widespread in the Gulf
Coast states, with some temperatures exceeding 80F. Meanwhile,
frigid temperatures are likely in parts of the northwestern and
north-central U.S., spreading from Montana Sunday into more of the
Northwest and Northern Plains through midweek. With temperatures
20-40 degrees below average, even high temperatures could remain
below 0F for Montana and North Dakota around Tuesday and
Wednesday. Temperatures are also expected to trend colder in the
rest of the western U.S., with expanding coverage of highs 10-25F
below normal next Monday-Thursday. Increasing numbers of locations
along and just inland from the West Coast could see daily records
for low maxima Sunday through Wednesday.

...Series of storm systems to bring heavy mountain snow, moderate
lowland snow, and coastal heavy rain to the western U.S. into the
Holiday weekend...

...Anomalous, record-breaking warmth will continue to spread
across most of the eastern half of the country...

...Scattered rain showers and a wintry mix forecast along a
frontal system moving northward across the Great Lakes and
Northeast...


The focus for the short-range forecast period (Thursday afternoon
through Saturday) will be on a series of storm systems sweeping
through the western United States, with impacts enhanced by waves
of increased moisture due to an Atmospheric River. Significant,
heavy mountain snow is forecast from the Sierra Nevada in
California north to the Cascades in the Pacific Northwest. Snow
totals will likely exceed a foot through the end of the forecast
period Saturday evening, with several feet possible for northern
portions of the Sierra Nevada. Meanwhile, each system will bring
in cooler and cooler air across the the Northwest, lowering snow
levels later in the forecast period to sea level. Snow showers and
the potential for light accumulations will begin by Saturday from
Seattle to Portland. High temperatures will drop down to the 30s
for most locations across the Northwest. In addition to snow,
heavy rain and the potential for flooding will continue for
Southern California as waves of moisture overspread the region due
to the Atmospheric River. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
remains in effect through Friday morning for southern portions of
the Los Angeles metro area and the the northern Peninsular
Mountains, with a broader, Marginal Risk continuing north up the
coast to the Bay Area. The threat for a couple inches of heavy
rain will continue through this evening, with the highest flood
threat concentrated along burn scars for both the Peninsular and
Transverse Mountains surrounding metro Los Angeles. The heavy rain
threat spreads southward on Friday, with a Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall in effect from the Peninsular Mountains and the
southern Inland Empire south across the greater San Diego area.
Another 1 to 3 inches of rain is forecast, with rain rates of 0.5
inches per hour possible. The flood threat will continue to remain
concentrated across burn scars.

In contrast to the West, large-scale ridging will increase over
the eastern half of the country with conditions trending warmer
and drier into the Holiday Weekend. Daily high temperatures will
be well above normal for most, with near-record and
record-breaking highs forecast from the Midwest to the Southern
Plains. High temperatures Friday will range from the 40s and 50s
from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic; the 50s and 60s for the
Central Plains, Ohio Valley, and Southeast; and the 70s and 80s
for the Southern Plains. Highs in northwest Texas may even
approach 90 degrees. A cold front will move south through the
Midwest and northern portions of the Southern Plains on Saturday,
dropping forecast high temperatures by about 10 degrees compared
to Friday, though this will still be well above normal. The warm
temperatures, along with dry, windy conditions has led to an
Elevated Risk of fire weather issued by the Storm Prediction
Center for the Southern High Plains through Friday. One exception
to this anomalous warmth will be in the Northern Plains as a cold
front ushers in frigid air from Canada and then remains stalled
south of the region. Highs on Friday for much of Montana will be
in the teens, with single digit highs forecast for both Montana
and North Dakota on Saturday.

Both rain showers and a wintry mix will likely continue from the
Great Lakes to the Northeast as a warm front moves northward
across the region. Snow showers are likely north of the front from
the Great Lakes through New York overnight Thursday. Light rain
showers are forecast to move east from the Great Lakes on Friday
to the Mid-Atlantic Saturday as the warm front moves northward. A
wintry mix is forecast north of the boundary for the northern
Great Lakes, upstate New York, and New England.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 29, 2021 - JAN 02, 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
strong ridging over the northern Pacific is forecast, leading to deep
troughing
downstream across the western CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights
extending
northeastward to the Great Lakes. Anomalous ridging is likely farther to th=
e
south across parts of the Southern Plains and much of the eastern CONUS
associated with above-normal 500-hPa heights.

Above normal 500-hPa heights favor increased chances of above normal
temperatures across parts of southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians=
,
while below normal temperatures are favored over parts of Northern and
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle due to the influence of
relatively cold surface high pressure over parts of western Canada. Troughi=
ng
over the western and north-central CONUS favors elevated probabilities for
below-normal temperatures over the western CONUS, north-central CONUS, and
western Great Lakes. Conversely, ridging over the south-central and eastern
CONUS leads to increased chances of above-normal temperatures from the
Southern
Plains to the Eastern Seaboard.

Above-normal precipitation is likely for Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians
related to mean surface westerly flow predicted over the Bering Sea. Mean
offshore flow leads to increased chances of near to below-normal precipitat=

due to unusually strong model agreement.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 31, 2021 - JAN 06, 2022

The Week-2 forecasts are very similar to the 6-10 day period. There is good
model agreement on most features, which are expected to remain in place but
may
deamplify a bit toward the end of the period. Meanwhile, the ridge in the
northern Pacific and the trough over the western CONUS are expected to shif=

slightly eastward, increasing the probability of below-normal temperatures =
for
much of Mainland Alaska and the Northeast.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

Valid 12Z Sun Dec 26 2021 - 12Z Thu Dec 30 2021

...Potential for heavy mountain snow and light/moderate lower
elevation Pacific Northwest snow continues through early next week
across much of the West...

...Bitterly cold temperatures are forecast across portions of the
Northwest to Northern Plains next week...


...Overview...

A rather stagnant pattern is forecast for the medium range period
led by a persistent and highly amplified northern Pacific
ridge/upper high. Downstream, deep troughing is expected over the
western U.S. as a likely closed mid-upper low drifts eastward over
southwestern and south-central Canada, while shortwaves eject from
the upper trough and are carried along in fast west-southwesterly
mean flow, which will support a series of low pressure systems
developing and tracking over the central and northeastern U.S.
Meanwhile, another upper high moving from the Gulf of Mexico early
week into the Bahamas by midweek will spread ridging and above
normal temperatures to the southeastern quadrant of the country
south of the storm track.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance remains in good agreement with the large-scale
pattern described above, especially through the middle of next
week. Less certain aspects of the forecast include the rounds of
shortwave energy propagating eastward from the main trough. There
are some variations in the 00/06Z model guidance with a Northeast
shortwave already by early Sunday, with the 00Z GFS among the
strongest with the energy, which also brings its associated
surface low closer to the Northeast coast compared to the
consensus that is farther east in the Atlantic. That solution was
not favored and the early part of the medium range forecast was
based on a blend favoring the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, along with
smaller proportions of the 00Z UKMET and CMC. Good model agreement
with this blend also persisted with frontal timing in the central
U.S. for early week, despite some variability in location of
surface lows along the front.

By Tuesday through Thursday, most guidance indicates a mid-upper
low closing off over southwestern/south-central Canada as a piece
of the polar vortex likely drops southward, and this was indicated
by the latest WPC forecast. Shortwaves spinning around the low
have less certainty with strength and timing once again. There is
a good bit of run-to-run variability in model guidance, but for
the 00Z/06Z cycle, the 06Z GFS appeared to be the greatest outlier
in deterministic guidance, essentially dividing the upper low by
early Thursday with one closed low along the OR/CA border. Thus by
the latter part of the forecast period, transitioned to using a
proportion of the 00Z GFS rather than the 06Z while still favoring
the 00Z ECMWF, and ended the forecast period with 50% GEFS and EC
ensemble means combined with 50% deterministic models to temper
the individual forecast differences.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Rounds of precipitation are forecast for the West as shortwave
energy rounding the persistent upper trough periodically enhances
moisture inflow. The highest snow totals are likely for the
typical terrain enhanced areas of the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and
portions of the Rockies, while coastal Oregon and California could
see locally heavy precipitation as well. Snow levels could lower
enough under the cold upper trough to bring snow to cities like
Seattle and Portland continuing from the short range period into
Sunday, while other parts of the West could also see lowering snow
levels as the upper trough axis nudges inland.

Generally progressive low pressure systems will spread periodic
precipitation across the north-central and northeastern U.S.
through next week. Snow chances should be confined to the Midwest
to Great Lakes and interior Northeast, with a round of heavier
snow possible for the Upper Midwest Sunday into Monday. Additional
chances for wintry weather are possible later next week as well,
but precipitation type, coverage, and amounts are still uncertain.
The associated trailing cold front slowly sinking southeastward
could provide a focus for enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley
around Tuesday-Wednesday and toward the Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachians by Thursday of next week, but with
uncertainty remaining regarding the amounts and axis of the
heaviest rain.

Mild to warm weather is expected across the south-central U.S.
northeastward through next week. The southern Great Plains will be
at the center of the greatest warm temperature anomalies on Sunday
(20-35F above normal), with record daily high minimum and maximum
temperatures likely. Anomalous to record warmth may press slightly
eastward as the week progresses, with temperatures 20+ degrees
above average expected to spread into parts of the Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys. Highs in the 70s will be widespread in the Gulf
Coast states, with some temperatures exceeding 80F. Meanwhile,
frigid temperatures are likely in parts of the northwestern and
north-central U.S., spreading from Montana Sunday into more of the
Northwest and Northern Plains through midweek. With temperatures
20-40 degrees below average, even high temperatures could remain
below 0F for Montana and North Dakota around Tuesday and
Wednesday. Temperatures are also expected to trend colder in the
rest of the western U.S., with expanding coverage of highs 10-25F
below normal next Monday-Thursday. Increasing numbers of locations
along and just inland from the West Coast could see daily records
for low maxima Sunday through Wednesday.

...Potential for heavy mountain snows in the West continues
through early next week...

...Bitterly cold temperatures are forecast across portions of the
Northwest to Northern Plains next week...


...Overview...

A rather stagnant pattern is forecast for the medium range period
led by a persistent and highly amplified northern Pacific
ridge/upper high. Downstream, deep troughing is expected over the
western U.S. as a likely closed mid-upper low drifts eastward over
southwestern and south-central Canada, while shortwaves eject from
the upper trough and are carried along in fast west-southwesterly
mean flow, which will support a series of low pressure systems
developing and tracking over the central and northeastern U.S..
Meanwhile, another upper high moving from the Gulf of Mexico early
week into the Bahamas by midweek will spread ridging and above
normal temperatures to the southeastern quadrant of the country
south of the storm track.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance remains in more or less good agreement
with the large scale pattern through much of next week. There are
some uncertainties in the details, particularly pertaining to a
couple of short waves rotating out of the Western U.S. trough. The
12z/yesterday UKMET was much weaker with an initial shortwave on
Monday-Tuesday into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually the
Northeast than the consensus so it was not included in the WPC
blend. Mid week, energy should drop down the West Coast with some
guidance (such as the 12z and 18z yesterday ECMWF and GFS runs)
indicating potential for a closed low over or off the central
California coast by later next week. There is plenty of
variability in this forecast with regards to timing and evolution
so the forecast remains highly uncertain at this time.

For the WPC blend, the guidance presented enough agreement for
days 3-5 to warrant a purely deterministic model blend between the
GFS, ECMWF, and CMC. After that, the ensemble means were
introduced to help mitigate the smaller scale details differences
which will take several days to resolve still. This approach
provided good continuity with yesterdays WPC forecast as well.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Rounds of precipitation should continue into the West as the
medium range period begins Monday as shortwave energy rounding the
persistent upper trough periodically enhances moisture inflow. The
highest snow totals are likely for the typical terrain enhanced
areas of the Sierra Nevada, and portions of the Rockies Monday and
Tuesday. The best moisture/precipitation focus should shift
southward with time into southern California and the Southwest on
Wednesday into Thursday.

Generally progressive low pressure systems will spread periodic
precipitation across the north-central and northeastern U.S.
through next week. The best snow chances should be confined to the
Great Lakes and interior Northeast, with rain to the south. The
associated trailing cold front slowly sinking southeastward could
provide a focus for enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley
around Tuesday-Wednesday and toward the Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachians/Southeast by Thursday-Friday of next week,
but with uncertainty remaining regarding the amounts and axis of
the heaviest rain.

Mild to warm weather is expected across the south-central U.S.
northeastward through next week. The southern Great Plains will be
at the center of the greatest warm temperature anomalies on Sunday
(20-35F above normal), with record daily high minimum and maximum
temperatures likely. Anomalous to record warmth may press slightly
eastward as the week progresses, with temperatures 20+ degrees
above average expected to spread into parts of the Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys. Highs in the 70s will be widespread in the Gulf
Coast states, with some temperatures exceeding 80F. Meanwhile,
frigid temperatures are likely in parts of the northwestern and
north-central U.S., spreading from Montana Sunday into more of the
Northwest and Northern Plains through midweek. With temperatures
20-40 degrees below average, even high temperatures could remain
below 0F for Montana and North Dakota around Tuesday and
Wednesday. Temperatures are also expected to trend colder in the
rest of the western U.S., with expanding coverage of highs 10-25F
below normal next Monday-Thursday. Increasing numbers of locations
along and just inland from the West Coast could see daily records
for low maxima Sunday through Wednesday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHWEST TO WESTERN TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
Early-morning water vapor imagery shows an upper-level wave digging
southeastward towards southern California. While this feature is
bringing widespread precipitation west of the Rockies, it will also
support a deepening surface low over the central Plains. The
resulting increase in southwesterly winds will drive a fire weather
threat for portions of the southern High Plains where conditions
remain dry and little to no precipitation is expected.

...West Texas...
Surface observations across west/southwest TX and southeast NM show
a pocket of reduced moisture (denoted by dewpoints in the teens and
RH values in the teens to low 20s) from west TX into southeast NM.
While coarser guidance has struggled to assimilate this dry pocket,
recent hi-res solutions seem to capture this feature well and advect
the air mass northeastward across west TX this afternoon. As a
result, latest NBM ensemble guidance has trended towards higher
probabilities of RH values between 15-20%. Although this is still
marginal RH for some locations, the combination of critically dry
fuels (ERC values near or above the 90th percentile) and high
confidence in 20-25 mph sustained winds (gusting to 30-40 mph)
warrant a Critical risk area to delineate the corridor of the
driest/windiest conditions.

Further to the northwest across the TX Panhandle, guidance continues
to show a swath of stronger sustained winds near 30 mph. Confidence
in RH values falling to near critical thresholds remains low due to
recent dewpoint observations in the mid 20s and low ensemble
probabilities for sub-20% RH. Despite this mitigating factor, the
strong winds coupled with receptive fuels will still support a
robust fire weather threat. Conditions will continue to be
monitored, and an expansion of the Critical risk area may be
warranted if observations trend towards drier solutions.

...Potential for heavy mountain snows in the West continues
through early next week...

...Bitterly cold temperatures are forecast across portions of the

...Overview...

A rather stagnant pattern is forecast for the medium range period
led by a persistent and highly amplified northern Pacific
ridge/upper high. Downstream, deep troughing is expected over the
western U.S. as a likely closed mid-upper low drifts eastward over
southwestern and south-central Canada, while shortwaves eject from
the upper trough and are carried along in fast west-southwesterly

Meanwhile, another upper high moving from the Gulf of Mexico early

normal temperatures to the southeastern quadrant of the country
south of the storm track.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance remains in more or less good agreement
with the large scale pattern through much of next week. There are
some uncertainties in the details, particularly pertaining to a
couple of short waves rotating out of the Western U.S. trough. The
12z/yesterday UKMET was much weaker with an initial shortwave on
Monday-Tuesday into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually the
Northeast than the consensus so it was not included in the WPC

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Rounds of precipitation should continue into the West as the
medium range period begins Monday as shortwave energy rounding the
persistent upper trough periodically enhances moisture inflow. The
highest snow totals are likely for the typical terrain enhanced
areas of the Sierra Nevada, and portions of the Rockies Monday and

around Tuesday-Wednesday and toward the Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachians/Southeast by Thursday-Friday of next week,
but with uncertainty remaining regarding the amounts and axis of
the heaviest rain.

Mild to warm weather is expected across the south-central U.S. and
northeastward through next week. The southern Plains to
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys will be at the center of the
greatest warm temperature anomalies, especially Monday-Wednesday
where many places could be 20 to 30 degrees above normal. Daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures are likely. Anomalous
to record warmth should press slightly eastward as the week
progresses, with well above average temperatures expected to
spread into parts of the Ohio Valley parts of the East later next
week. Meanwhile, bitterly cold temperatures are likely in parts of
the northwestern and north-central U.S., with daytime highs (and a
lesser extent overnight lows) nearly 20-40 degrees below average.
These values combined with gusty winds could result in dangerously
cold wind chills especially for parts of the northern High Plains
where wind chill values could dip well below 0F. Temperatures are
also expected to trend colder in the rest of the western U.S.,
with expanding coverage of highs 10-25F below normal next week.
Increasing numbers of locations along and just inland from the
West Coast could see daily records for low maxima Monday through
Wednesday.

...Potential for heavy mountain snows in the West continues
through early next week...

...Bitterly cold temperatures are forecast across portions of the
Northwest to Northern Plains next week...


...Overview...

A rather stagnant pattern is forecast for the medium range period
led by a persistent and highly amplified northern Pacific
ridge/upper high. Downstream, deep troughing is expected over the
western U.S. as a likely closed mid-upper low drifts eastward over
southwestern and south-central Canada, while shortwaves eject from
the upper trough and are carried along in fast west-southwesterly
mean flow, which will support a series of low pressure systems
developing and tracking over the central and northeastern U.S..
Meanwhile, another upper high moving from the Gulf of Mexico early
week into the Bahamas by midweek will spread ridging and above
normal temperatures to the southeastern quadrant of the country
south of the storm track.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance remains in more or less good agreement
with the large scale pattern through much of next week. There are
some uncertainties in the details, particularly pertaining to a
couple of short waves rotating out of the Western U.S. trough. The
12z/yesterday UKMET was much weaker with an initial shortwave on
Monday-Tuesday into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually the
Northeast than the consensus so it was not included in the WPC
blend. Mid week, energy should drop down the West Coast with some
guidance (such as the 12z and 18z yesterday ECMWF and GFS runs)
indicating potential for a closed low over or off the central
California coast by later next week. There is plenty of
variability in this forecast with regards to timing and evolution
so the forecast remains highly uncertain at this time.

For the WPC blend, the guidance presented enough agreement for
days 3-5 to warrant a purely deterministic model blend between the
GFS, ECMWF, and CMC. After that, the ensemble means were
introduced to help mitigate the smaller scale details differences
which will take several days to resolve still. This approach
provided good continuity with yesterdays WPC forecast as well.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Rounds of precipitation should continue into the West as the
medium range period begins Monday as shortwave energy rounding the
persistent upper trough periodically enhances moisture inflow. The
highest snow totals are likely for the typical terrain enhanced
areas of the Sierra Nevada, and portions of the Rockies Monday and
Tuesday. The best moisture/precipitation focus should shift
southward with time into southern California and the Southwest on
Wednesday into Thursday.

Generally progressive low pressure systems will spread periodic
precipitation across the north-central and northeastern U.S.
through next week. The best snow chances should be confined to the
Great Lakes and interior Northeast, with rain to the south. The
associated trailing cold front slowly sinking southeastward could
provide a focus for enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley
around Tuesday-Wednesday and toward the Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachians/Southeast by Thursday-Friday of next week,
but with uncertainty remaining regarding the amounts and axis of
the heaviest rain.

Mild to warm weather is expected across the south-central U.S. and
northeastward through next week. The southern Plains to
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys will be at the center of the
greatest warm temperature anomalies, especially Monday-Wednesday
where many places could be 20 to 30 degrees above normal. Daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures are likely. Anomalous
to record warmth should press slightly eastward as the week
progresses, with well above average temperatures expected to
spread into parts of the Ohio Valley parts of the East later next
week. Meanwhile, bitterly cold temperatures are likely in parts of
the northwestern and north-central U.S., with daytime highs (and a
lesser extent overnight lows) nearly 20-40 degrees below average.
These values combined with gusty winds could result in dangerously
cold wind chills especially for parts of the northern High Plains
where wind chill values could dip well below 0F. Temperatures are
also expected to trend colder in the rest of the western U.S.,
with expanding coverage of highs 10-25F below normal next week.
Increasing numbers of locations along and just inland from the
West Coast could see daily records for low maxima Monday through
Wednesday.

...Wet, wintry, windy, and a White Christmas for some in the West
with hazardous travel conditions in mountainous terrain...

...Anomalous, record-breaking warmth will continue to overtake
much of the South...

...Scattered rain showers and a wintry mix forecast along a
frontal system moving across the Great Lakes and Northeast...

The weather for both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day is
highlighted by a stormy upper level troughing pattern along the
West Coast and strong upper level high pressure over the
South-Central U.S.. In Christmas-speak, it means Snow Miser has
control of the West while Heat Miser has full control of the
weather in Southtown with no compromise of snow in Southtown this
Christmas. Starting out West, a pair of storm systems are set to
produce measurable snow in the higher elevations of the
Intermountain West and along the West Coast. One disturbance
tracking into southern California this morning is responsible for
the snow in the southern and central Rockies while persistent
onshore flow ushers Pacific moisture into the Northwest today.
Snow totals exceeding a foot are expected in the Sierra, Cascades,
and most of the higher elevations of the Rockies today. By
Christmas Day, the Four Corners region dries out, but the next
storm system diving south from the northeast Pacific delivers the
next round of heavy mountain snow and coastal/valley rainfall to
the West Coast. By Christmas night, parts of the Sierra Nevada,
Cascades, and Salmon mountains will measure anywhere from 2 to 4
feet of snow with locally higher totals possible. Travel will be
be hazardous, even impassable at times, in the hardest hit
locations with towering snow drifts and whiteout conditions.
Meanwhile, the immediate West Coast from western Washington to
southern California can anticipate 1 to 2 inches of rain on
average today through Christmas night. The areas most at risk for
flooding today are far southern California and central Arizona
where excessive rainfall rates could lead to areas of flash
flooding this morning.

In contrast to the West, those dreaming of a White Christmas
throughout much of the South and East Central U.S. will have to
settle for spring-like temperatures this Christmas. Daytime highs
Christmas Eve from the Middle Mississippi Valley to West Texas are
forecast to reach the 70s and 80s with some locations not only
breaking daily record highs, but potentially challenging December
record highs. Christmas Eve night temperature anomalies will be 25
to 35 degrees above normal from the Ohio Valley to the Southern
Plains with record breaking warm daily minimum temps likely.
Temperatures so mild, that Santa may want to pack a lighter red
coat when going house to house. By Christmas Day, the spring-like
air-mass reaches the Mid-South and Mid-Atlantic with highs in the
60s and 70s. More record warmth is likely, most notably from the
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys to "Deep in the Heart of Texas". Aside
from the cooler than normal conditions on the West Coast, the only
other area forecast to witness below normal temperatures are the
High Plains of Montana and North Dakota. A cold front pushing
south through these states will introduce an injection of frigid
Canadian temperatures, causing daily lows to plummet below zero
Christmas morning and high temps struggling to get out of the
single digits Christmas Day.

Elsewhere, Rudolph will need his red nose at full power over the
Great Lakes Christmas Eve night thanks to a storm system producing
showers and overcast conditions. By early Christmas morning,
precipitation will fall in the form of snow and/or a wintry mix in
New England. Light snow and ice accumulations could make for dicey
travel conditions on Christmas Day. As a new area of low pressure
forms along a frontal boundary off the Northeast coast,
precipitation may switch over to all snow in northern New England
Christmas night and into early Sunday morning. In the North
Central U.S., a weak area of low pressure is set to trigger show
showers in Northern Plains and Upper Midwest Christmas Eve night
and into early Christmas morning with light snow accumulations
possible.

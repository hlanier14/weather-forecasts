Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1117 AM CDT Wed May 26 2021

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

Very dry conditions are in place across much of the Southwest. While
winds are still mostly light and variable, they are expected to
strengthen in the next few hours as mixing deepens.

..Bentley.. 05/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0203 AM CDT Wed May 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move across parts of the central and
northern Rockies today. Within the southern jet stream, a weaker
shortwave trough will move into southern Arizona and New Mexico
later in the period. A weak surface trough/cold front will move into
the eastern Great Basin by the afternoon. The deepest portion of the
lee trough will be in the northern High Plains, but some extension
of lower surface pressure may reach as far south as the Colorado/New
Mexico border latitude.

...Northwest Arizona into northwest Colorado...
Ahead of the approaching weak front, southwesterly winds are
expected to increase during the day and afternoon. While areas of
15-20 mph winds will occur, it is uncertain how broad 20+ mph winds
will become across this region. The mid-level jet will generally be
over Wyoming during the afternoon and the stronger winds aloft
across Arizona and Utah will occur earlier in the day. Secondly,
high and mid-level clouds are expected for a significant portion of
the day which could limit the efficiency of momentum transfer to the
surface. That being said, the airmass will be quite dry with 5-15%
fairly common and a few other areas of 15-20%. Locally,
terrain-driven critical conditions are possible. The greater
potential for sustained critical conditions will be in northwest
Colorado where stronger mid-level winds remain even into late
afternoon.

...Central New Mexico...
A very subtle enhancement to the flow aloft will be in place during
the afternoon across parts of the Southwest. However, the main
shortwave trough and mid-level jet will not arrive until the
overnight period. With some surface pressure gradient enhancement
from a high Plains trough to the east/northeast, areas of locally
elevated to elevated conditions are possible in New Mexico. Winds of
15-20 mph are expected with 5-15% RH during the afternoon. Stronger
winds aloft will exist in northeast New Mexico and adjacent parts of
the High Plains, but fuels are less receptive there. The greatest
potential for sustained elevated conditions with at least marginally
receptive fuels will be in central New Mexico. As in the Great
Basin, high and perhaps mid-level clouds will potentially curtail
mixing of the modest winds aloft.

No changes. Previous discussion follows.

..Bentley.. 05/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0555 AM CDT Wed May 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
The northern stream shortwave trough will move through the central
Plains on Thursday. A much weaker southern stream shortwave trough
will continue to lose amplitude as it moves into the southern High
Plains. With the surface low tracking into the mid Missouri Valley,
the pressure pattern across the Southwest will be a bit more diffuse
than on Wednesday. What will be slightly improved is the mid-level
winds across southern New Mexico along with single digit RH values.
There, areas of 15-20 mph winds are possible. However, with the weak
surface gradient and mid/upper clouds, elevated conditions appear
that they will be relatively localized and transient.

...Record highs possible in the Pacific Northwest/Northern
California next week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

The medium range period will begin with a shortwave upper trough
moving across the Great Lakes region over the weekend, with a
surface frontal system pushing off the East Coast and sinking well
southward over the eastern half of the country into the northern
Gulf of Mexico. The western end of this front should linger over
the Plains while another front moves in from the west/northwest as
rounds of upper troughing move through the southwestern to central
U.S., helping to promote episodes of showers and storms that may
contain locally heavy rainfall. Farther west, upper ridging is
likely to build into the Pacific Northwest, leading to abundant
warmth there by next week, while the eastern U.S. cools down
through the weekend into next week after a recent warm spell.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The 00Z/06Z model cycle was in generally good agreement with the
pattern described above, but with differences in details of the
flow. By Sunday into Monday, some differences arose with whether
the Great Lakes energy cut off from the main flow in eastern
Canada along with some minor timing issues as the shortwave lifts,
but not too unreasonable. It appears guidance may be clustering on
a slower solution for the surface front/low given the shortwave
track compared to previous forecasts. With the central to
southwestern U.S. trough, once again there are some questions with
stream separation and some potential for closing off mid-level
lows around northern Mexico (with the 00Z ECMWF and CMC in favor).
Upstream ridging into the Pacific Northwest (at least +2 sigma)
may be squeezed by next Wednesday as a Pacific front edges into
Washington. Overall, through early next week, a multi-model
deterministic blend was able to be used, with somewhat increasing
weight on the ensemble means by the end of the period, which
helped smooth out differences between individual models.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains along the west end of the wavy frontal
boundary and ahead of a weaker northern stream cold front. High
pressure that builds in behind the latter front could lead to some
areas of low level upslope flow that would help to enhance
convective development over the High Plains. It will take
additional time to monitor potential overlap of heavy rainfall
potential with areas that have seen above normal rainfall over the
past week or so. The West Coast should see little to no
precipitation given the ridge, but areas near and east of the
Great Basin to the Divide may see at least scattered showers as
the upper trough moves in. Along the East Coast, the offshore
frontal boundary and low pressure is likely to bring showers to
the region. Rainfall amounts will depend on the evolution of the
system, but current expectations are for slower frontal movement
compared to previous forecasts; thus, rainfall forecasts were
increased onshore as the front lingers, but the heaviest rain
amounts still look to be offshore.

Temperatures will be cool in the Great
Lakes/Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Saturday with northeast winds over
most areas. Expect readings to be 10-15F below normal in general
(many areas only in the 60s). Though the cold front may dip into
the Gulf of Mexico by Sunday, this may only cool temperatures in
the Southeast to a few degrees below normal (low 80s but dew
points in the 50s to low 60s). The Pacific Northwest can expect a
warming trend with temperatures 10-25F above normal by Memorial
Day into next Tue-Wed. This could approach or exceed record levels
for parts of WA/OR/ID and northern CA. On the other hand the
cloudy/stormy pattern setting up over the central/southern Plains
and eastern slopes of the Rockies should bring highs down to
10-15F below normal by next Mon-Wed.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed May 26 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 01 - 05 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
North Pacific, centered over the Aleutians, and ridging over the eastern North
Pacific and western North America. Downstream, a trough is predicted over the
south-central CONUS, and ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over the eastern CONUS. The manual blend of models forecasts
positive
500-hPa height anomalies across most of the northern CONUS, with stronger
positive height anomalies centered over the Pacific Northwest under the
amplified ridge axis. Slightly negative 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast
over the south-central CONUS, associated with the trough there. Southerly
low-level surface flow is predicted into the central and eastern CONUS, around
surface high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean.

Above normal temperatures are favored for the eastern Aleutians and
southwestern Mainland Alaska, associated with enhanced southerly flow ahead of
the predicted trough. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies lead to likely below
normal temperatures for eastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.
Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced for the western CONUS
extending eastward across the Northern Plains, the Great Lakes region, and the
Northeast region, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
temperatures are most favored over the south-central CONUS, as a trough and
storm systems are predicted to traverse the region, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the Aleutians and North Pacific and associated onshore
flow lead to increased chances of near to above normal precipitation for
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. A predicted ridge over the
northwestern CONUS and positive 500-hPa height anomalies across the northern
tier lead to increased probabilities of near to below normal precipitation for
the West and the north-central CONUS. Increased probabilities of above normal
precipitation are indicated over an area of the southern CONUS from the
southern High Plains eastward to the Southeast, ahead of a predicted trough,
and consistent with the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 03 - 09 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is generally forecast to
persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, while ensemble spread
and uncertainty increases. Troughing over the Aleutians deamplifies relative
to
the 6-10 day period. Flow becomes increasingly zonal over the western CONUS.
Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF ensemble mean slightly
greater than the NCEP GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to recent model
skill.

Probabilities of near to above normal temperatures continue to be favored for
the Aleutians, associated with enhanced mid-level southerly flow ahead of a
predicted trough. Below normal temperatures are likely over southern Alaska
and
the Alaska Panhandle, while near normal temperatures are favored for northern
Alaska, where temperature tools are less consistent. Above normal temperatures
are favored for the western and northern CONUS, under positive 500-hPa height
anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favored over south-central CONUS, due
to a shortwave trough traversing the region and consistent with the
temperature
consolidation tool.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored for Mainland Alaska, the
Aleutians and the Alaska Panhandle, due to predicted onshore flow. Near to
below normal precipitation is likely over much of the western CONUS, under
positive 500-hPa height anomalies associated with the predicted ridge. Chances
of above normal precipitation are slightly enhanced over much of the central
and eastern CONUS, related to potential storm systems associated with
shortwave troughs and anomalous southerly surface flow.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 26 2021

SYNOPSIS: Many models favor above normal mid-level heights across the western
and northeastern lower 48 during week-2, starting out as a high amplitude
pattern and weakening by the middle of the period. This pattern increases
chances for areas to the west of the Rockies in the contiguous U.S. reaching
excessive heat criteria during the beginning to middle portion of week-2.
Possible frontal activity across the central U.S. at the beginning of the
period supports enhanced rainfall across the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley. Mid-level low pressure forecast across the North-Central
Pacific favors a wetter pattern for Alaska, but amounts are not anticipated to
reach pre-defined hazards thresholds.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for parts of the Central and Northern Great Basin,
Thu, Jun 3.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for parts of the CONUS west of the Rockies,
Thu-Fri, Jun 3-4.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the CONUS west of the Rockies,
The-Sun, Jun 3-6.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Southern Plains,
Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Alabama, Thu-Sat, Jun 3-5.

Flooding possible for parts of the eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi
Valley.

consistency as well as agreement across multiple models regarding an amplified
mid-level ridge over the western CONUS extending from the end of week-1 into
the middle of week-2. This pattern supports increased chances for excessive
heat across many parts of the CONUS west of the Rockies. A slight risk (>20%
chance) of excessive heat is posted for the western CONUS (west of the
Rockies)
for June 3 to 6, with an embedded area of moderate risk (>40% chance)
highlighted for June 3 to 4. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools show
enhanced probabilities in these highlighted areas of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile. Temperatures across the Northwest may exceed 90
deg F, while areas across the Desert Southwest may exceed 105 deg F. A high
risk of excessive heat is included in today's outlook for parts of the Central
and Northern Great Basin for June 3 where the reforecast tools indicate at
least a 60% chance of temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile. These tools
also show a greater than a 20% chance potential of some areas across the West
exceeding the 95th percentile. Some areas may approach daily temperature
records. The ongoing severe to extreme drought conditions being felt across
the
region are likely to exacerbate heat related impacts. The ridging is forecast
to weaken by the end of week-2, bringing a moderation in temperatures.



Downstream of the ridge over the West, amplified mid-level troughing is
anticipated to form across the central CONUS at the beginning of the period,
potentially supporting surface low formation and frontal activity across the
Great Plains and Mississippi Valley. This pattern, combined with favored
southerly moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico, supports a slight risk of heavy
rainfall across parts of the Southern Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley,
Tennessee Valley, and Alabama, June 3 to 5. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools
both depict at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the
85th percentile and 1 inch across the highlighted heavy precipitation risk
areas. Uncalibrated ECMWF guidance also shows some of these areas having at
least a 40% chance for 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding 1 inch, further
supporting the precipitation hazard. Interestingly, the uncalibrated ECMWF
ensemble indicates the heaviest rainfall further east, across parts of the
Tennessee Valley and Carolinas, whereas the uncalibrated GEFS highlights a
similar area as the calibrated counterpart. The anticipated heavy rainfall is
a
concerning trend due to persistent above-normal rainfall observed resulting in
ongoing river flooding in these areas. The risk for possible flooding
continues
to be posted for today for parts of eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi
Valley, with the area slightly expanded to include areas where streamflows are
greater than the 90th percentile.



Ensemble means from multiple models (0Z ECMWF, 0Z GEFS, 0Z Canadian) indicate
anomalously positive mid-level heights across the Northeast and Great Lakes
area during week-2. The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools depict at least a 20%
chance of temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile throughout the period
across the Northeast, Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, expanding southward to the
Ohio and Tennessee Valley from the middle to end of week-2. However, at this
time, temperatures are generally forecast to remain below 90 deg F in many of
these areas, precluding a related temperature hazard from being designated.



Mid-level troughing is forecast over the North-Central Pacific, with
associated
surface low pressure depicted in the vicinity of the Aleutians. As a result,
enhanced southwesterly flow is forecast across Alaska, bringing intermittent
rounds of precipitation to the southern part of the state. However,
precipitation amounts are not expected to reach pre-defined hazardous
thresholds, and the increased cloud cover and precipitation favored near to
below-normal temperatures over much of the southern half of the Mainland and
the Panhandle during week-2.

...Moderate and Enhanced risk of strong to severe thunderstorms
over portions of the central US Thursday and Friday,
respectively...

...Showers and potentially severe thunderstorms continue in the
Northeast before being ushered offshore overnight by a passing
cold front...

...Cold spell in store for the northern Great Plains, Midwest, and
Northeast Thursday into Friday...

Throughout the Great Plains showers and thunderstorms will
continue overnight and spread eastward as a low pressure system
moves across the central US, deepening along its path. It is
expected that several of these thunderstorms will become severe,
bringing with them intense damaging winds, very large hail, and
potentially strong tornadoes. At present, the Storm Prediction
Center has issued a moderate risk of severe weather for portions
of Nebraska and Kansas. In addition to the severe weather threat,
heavy downpours from thunderstorms could result in flash flooding.
The Weather Prediction Center has issued a slight risk of
excessive rainfall for portions of the central Plains through
Thursday morning. As the system progresses east, so will the areas
of concern for severe weather and flash flooding. For Thursday,
the Storm Prediction Center has issued an enhanced risk of severe
thunderstorms across parts of the southern and central Plains and
the Middle Mississippi Valley, where very large hail, significant
severe wind gusts, and the potential for several tornadoes to
develop will be the hazards of concern. The Weather Prediction
Center has flagged a similar area as being at slight risk for
excessive rainfall and flash flooding. Having been pushed south
and east by a descending area of high pressure, showers and
thunderstorms are expected along the Gulf and East Coasts on
Friday.

A strong cold front trailing off a deep Canadian low pressure
system will pass through the Northeast overnight. Ahead of the
front warm temperatures and shortwave instability are expected to
aid the development of showers and thunderstorms, some of which
may become severe and produce damaging winds. Behind the cold
front a high pressure system in southern Canada is forecast to
build and spread east, transporting colder arctic air south into
the northern Great Plains, Midwest, and Northeast. On Thursday and
Friday, daily highs across these regions will likely drop as much
as 15 to 20 degrees below normal into the 50s and 60s.

Out in the Pacific Northwest, a low pressure system moving onshore
Thursday morning will bring widespread rain to the area, with
mixed precipitation and even some wet snow possible in the
northern Cascades. As the system moves inland the rain is forecast
to expand eastward into the northern Rockies, some of which may
transition into wet snow at higher elevations overnight as
temperatures drop behind a cold front. The northern Cascades could
see wet snow lingering into Friday morning as well.

...Record highs possible in the Pacific Northwest/Northern
California next week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

The medium range period will begin with a shortwave upper trough
moving across the Great Lakes region over the weekend, with a
surface frontal system pushing off the East Coast and sinking well
southward over the eastern half of the country into the northern
Gulf of Mexico. The western end of this front should linger over
the Plains while another front moves in from the west/northwest as
rounds of upper troughing move through the southwestern to central
U.S., helping to promote episodes of showers and storms that may
contain locally heavy rainfall. Farther west, upper ridging is
likely to build into the Pacific Northwest, leading to abundant
warmth there by next week, while the eastern U.S. cools down
through the weekend into next week after a recent warm spell.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The 00Z/06Z model cycle was in generally good agreement with the
pattern described above, but with differences in details of the
flow. By Sunday into Monday, some differences arose with whether
the Great Lakes energy cut off from the main flow in eastern
Canada along with some minor timing issues as the shortwave lifts,
but not too unreasonable. It appears guidance may be clustering on
a slower solution for the surface front/low given the shortwave
track compared to previous forecasts. With the central to
southwestern U.S. trough, once again there are some questions with
stream separation and some potential for closing off mid-level
lows around northern Mexico (with the 00Z ECMWF and CMC in favor).
Upstream ridging into the Pacific Northwest (at least +2 sigma)
may be squeezed by next Wednesday as a Pacific front edges into
Washington. Overall, through early next week, a multi-model
deterministic blend was able to be used, with somewhat increasing
weight on the ensemble means by the end of the period, which
helped smooth out differences between individual models.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains along the west end of the wavy frontal
boundary and ahead of a weaker northern stream cold front. High
pressure that builds in behind the latter front could lead to some
areas of low level upslope flow that would help to enhance
convective development over the High Plains. It will take
additional time to monitor potential overlap of heavy rainfall
potential with areas that have seen above normal rainfall over the
past week or so. The West Coast should see little to no
precipitation given the ridge, but areas near and east of the
Great Basin to the Divide may see at least scattered showers as
the upper trough moves in. Along the East Coast, the offshore
frontal boundary and low pressure is likely to bring showers to
the region. Rainfall amounts will depend on the evolution of the
system, but current expectations are for slower frontal movement
compared to previous forecasts; thus, rainfall forecasts were
increased onshore as the front lingers, but the heaviest rain
amounts still look to be offshore.

Temperatures will be cool in the Great
Lakes/Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Saturday with northeast winds over
most areas. Expect readings to be 10-15F below normal in general
(many areas only in the 60s). Though the cold front may dip into
the Gulf of Mexico by Sunday, this may only cool temperatures in
the Southeast to a few degrees below normal (low 80s but dew
points in the 50s to low 60s). The Pacific Northwest can expect a
warming trend with temperatures 10-25F above normal by Memorial
Day into next Tue-Wed. This could approach or exceed record levels
for parts of WA/OR/ID and northern CA. On the other hand the
cloudy/stormy pattern setting up over the central/southern Plains
and eastern slopes of the Rockies should bring highs down to
10-15F below normal by next Mon-Wed.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1152 PM CDT Wed May 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Ridging will build aloft in portions of the West. Subtle enhancement
to the mid-level winds across parts of New Mexico will be present
during the afternoon. A weak lee trough to the east and a cold front
moving in from the north may promote areas of 15-20 mph westerly
winds in southern New Mexico. A very dry airmass will remain in the
Southwest with 5-15% RH likely. With the diffuse surface pressure
gradient and mid/high level clouds in much of the area, elevated
fire weather conditions that develop are likely to be localized and
generally brief.

Valid 12Z Sun May 30 2021 - 12Z Thu Jun 03 2021

...Record highs likely in parts of the West next week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

Upper troughing initially in the Southwest will slowly shear
eastward into Texas/lower Mississippi Valley while ridging asserts
itself into the Northwest. A system in the Atlantic will lift
northeastward and spread some rain over parts of the Northeast
Sun-Mon before exiting on Tuesday. Temperatures will be cool in
much of the East to start before moderating, but very warm/hot in
the Northwest into the Great Basin where record heat is likely for
some locations. Areas in the central and southern Plains will see
several chances of rain and cooler than normal temperatures with
abundant cloud cover.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance cycle, the 18Z GFS and 12Z
ECMWF/Canadian were in generally good agreement through the period
with the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means. This maintained an area of low
pressure along the frontal boundary just off the East Coast late
Sun into early Mon, not as far west as some earlier GFS runs and
not as far east as the ensembles were several cycles ago. In the
Northwest, GFS and Canadian were a bit quicker to bring in
troughing compared to the ECMWF and most ensembles, but upstream
pattern of a modest jet across the northern Pacific certainly
deems that plausible. For now, consensus solution toward the
ensemble means kept good continuity. Over the Plains, somewhat
messy upper pattern with lower amplitude waves interacting with
the stationary frontal boundary (initially two, then focusing
around one) that should trend toward a less active period later in
the week next week. Again a consensus served well due to lower
predictability of the smaller wavelength features, contingent
partially on how the southwestern extension of the Southwest upper
low evolves.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains along the west end of the wavy frontal
boundary and ahead of a weaker northern stream cold front. High
pressure that builds in behind the latter front could lead to some
areas of low level upslope flow that would help to enhance
convective development over the High Plains. Some areas could see
several inches of rainfall over the multi-day period, perhaps
adding to flooding concerns over areas that have seen above normal
rainfall recently. Others may welcome at least some of the
rainfall as little has been observed in the past week for some
areas.

The West Coast should see little to no precipitation given the
ridge, but coastal Washington may see at least some scattered
showers as the upper trough and cold front move in next Wednesday.
Along the East Coast, the offshore frontal boundary and low
pressure is likely to bring showers to the region. Rainfall
amounts will depend on the evolution of the system, but the
heaviest rain amounts still look to be offshore. Nevertheless, at
least some light rainfall is forecast for areas east of the
Appalachians with higher chances along I-95 from NJ into New
England.

Cool temperatures in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Sunday will
moderate through the rest of the week as skies clear and high
pressure moves offshore. The Pacific Northwest can expect
temperatures 10-25F above normal by Memorial Day into next
Tue-Wed. This could approach or exceed record levels for parts of
WA/OR/ID and northern CA. As the cold front comes ashore, the warm
temperatures will push through the Great Basin to the Divide. The
cloudy/stormy pattern setting up over the central/southern Plains
and eastern slopes of the Rockies should bring highs down to
10-15F below normal by next Mon-Wed, sinking into Texas by next
Thursday while moderating.

Valid 12Z Sun May 30 2021 - 12Z Thu Jun 03 2021

...Record highs likely in parts of the West next week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

Upper troughing initially in the Southwest will slowly shear
eastward into Texas/lower Mississippi Valley while ridging asserts
itself into the Northwest. A system in the Atlantic will lift
northeastward and spread some rain over parts of the Northeast
Sun-Mon before exiting on Tuesday. Temperatures will be cool in
much of the East to start before moderating, but very warm/hot in
the Northwest into the Great Basin where record heat is likely for
some locations. Areas in the central and southern Plains will see
several chances of rain and cooler than normal temperatures with
abundant cloud cover.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance cycle, the 18Z GFS and 12Z
ECMWF/Canadian were in generally good agreement through the period
with the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means. This maintained an area of low
pressure along the frontal boundary just off the East Coast late
Sun into early Mon, not as far west as some earlier GFS runs and
not as far east as the ensembles were several cycles ago. In the
Northwest, GFS and Canadian were a bit quicker to bring in
troughing compared to the ECMWF and most ensembles, but upstream
pattern of a modest jet across the northern Pacific certainly
deems that plausible. For now, consensus solution toward the
ensemble means kept good continuity. Over the Plains, somewhat
messy upper pattern with lower amplitude waves interacting with
the stationary frontal boundary (initially two, then focusing
around one) that should trend toward a less active period later in
the week next week. Again a consensus served well due to lower
predictability of the smaller wavelength features, contingent
partially on how the southwestern extension of the Southwest upper
low evolves.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains along the west end of the wavy frontal
boundary and ahead of a weaker northern stream cold front. High
pressure that builds in behind the latter front could lead to some
areas of low level upslope flow that would help to enhance
convective development over the High Plains. Some areas could see
several inches of rainfall over the multi-day period, perhaps
adding to flooding concerns over areas that have seen above normal
rainfall recently. Others may welcome at least some of the
rainfall as little has been observed in the past week for some
areas.

The West Coast should see little to no precipitation given the
ridge, but coastal Washington may see at least some scattered
showers as the upper trough and cold front move in next Wednesday.
Along the East Coast, the offshore frontal boundary and low
pressure is likely to bring showers to the region. Rainfall
amounts will depend on the evolution of the system, but the
heaviest rain amounts still look to be offshore. Nevertheless, at
least some light rainfall is forecast for areas east of the
Appalachians with higher chances along I-95 from NJ into New
England.

Cool temperatures in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Sunday will
moderate through the rest of the week as skies clear and high
pressure moves offshore. The Pacific Northwest can expect
temperatures 10-25F above normal by Memorial Day into next
Tue-Wed. This could approach or exceed record levels for parts of
WA/OR/ID and northern CA. As the cold front comes ashore, the warm

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns across the CONUS are expected to be low on
Friday. Both the Great Basin and the Southwest will be beneath
upper-level, shortwave ridging. These areas, which have the driest
fuels, will only see weak surface winds despite continued very dry
conditions. Shortwave troughs will be over the northern Rockies and
the Midwest. Any elevated/critical meteorological conditions are
expected to occur over fuels that are not yet receptive.

...A low pressure system will bring strong to severe thunderstorms
from the central Plains eastward toward the central/southern
Appalachians into Friday...

...The same low pressure system will bring moderate to heavy rain
for parts of the Northeast and possibly severe thunderstorms for
the Mid-Atlantic by the Memorial Day weekend...

A developing low pressure system currently in the central High
Plains will be the main weather maker for the central and eastern
U.S. as we head into the Memorial Day weekend.  Showers and
thunderstorms will generally expand eastward into the Midwest
today ahead of the low pressure center while additional
thunderstorms clusters are expected to form across the central
Plains today ahead of a cold front.  Some of these thunderstorms
are expected to become severe. In addition, heavy downpours from
the thunderstorms could result in flash flooding.  By later on
Friday, the low pressure system is forecast to move across the
central Appalachians.  Showers and thunderstorms over the Ohio and
Tennessee Valley early on Friday will move to much of the East
Friday night near the advancing cold front. Thunderstorms over the
Mid-Atlantic could be severe Friday night.  Meanwhile, moderate to
heavy rain is forecast to develop across southern New England
early on Saturday as new low pressure center is forecast to form
off Long Island.

A strong cold front trailing off a deep Canadian low pressure
system will pass through the Northeast overnight. Ahead of the
front warm temperatures and shortwave instability are expected to
aid the development of showers and thunderstorms, some of which
may become severe and produce damaging winds. Behind the cold
front a high pressure system in southern Canada is forecast to
build and spread east, transporting colder arctic air south into
the northern Great Plains, Midwest, and Northeast. On Thursday and
Friday, daily highs across these regions will likely drop as much
as 15 to 20 degrees below normal into the 50s and 60s.

Out in the Pacific Northwest, a low pressure system moving onshore
Thursday morning will bring widespread rain to the area, with
mixed precipitation and even some wet snow possible in the
northern Cascades. As the system moves inland the rain is forecast
to expand eastward into the northern Rockies, some of which may
transition into wet snow at higher elevations overnight as
temperatures drop behind a cold front. The northern Cascades could
see wet snow lingering into Friday morning as well.

Across the Deep South, scattered thunderstorms will move slowly
southward toward the Gulf Coast in association with the cold front
later on Friday into the Memorial Day weekend.

Across the Northeast, cooler air behind a cold front will settle
into the area today.  Much of the northern Great Plains into the
Midwest will have cool afternoons due to clouds and rain tracking
to the north of the developing low pressure system.  In fact,
parts of North Dakota could see some wet snow early this morning.

Out in the Pacific Northwest, a low pressure system moving onshore
Thursday morning will bring widespread rain to the area.  Mixed
precipitation and even some wet snow is possible in the northern
Cascades.  As the system moves inland, mixed precipitation is
expected for the northern Rockies early on Friday.  By Friday
night into Saturday morning, showers and some thunderstorms are
forecast to move across the northern Plains ahead of a front,
while a new low pressure center is forecast to develop in the
central High Plains.

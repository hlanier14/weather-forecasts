Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1041 AM CST Sun Jan 02 2022

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 01/02/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Sun Jan 02 2022/

...Synopsis...
A deep mid-level trough is forecast to eject eastward across the
southern Plains and southeast today, while at the same time, a
strong cold front moves south toward the Gulf Coast. Gusty winds and
a much colder air mass are expected behind the front. However, dry
and breezy conditions may result in a few hours of elevated fire
weather potential across portions of far South Texas.

...South Texas...
In the wake of an early day cold front, strong north winds are
forecast to develop across much of southern Texas. Enhanced by
vertical mixing of strong winds aloft along the backside of the deep
upper trough, surface gusts of 25-30 mph will be possible through
mid afternoon. The rapid cooling and drying airmass should also
result in quickly falling humidity values through much of the day.
While diurnal minimums may struggle to reach elevated criteria, the
rapid drying may support elevated to near-elevated fire weather
conditions for a few hours. Highest confidence in 3+ hours of
elevated conditions appears to be farther west near the
international border where enhanced down sloping and the driest
fuels exist. Fire weather concerns will quickly abate later in the
afternoon and overnight as temperatures fall below freezing and
winds weaken.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
152 PM EST Sun Jan 02 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 05 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 09 2022

...Arctic air sets stage for multiple heavy snow threats from the
Great Lakes and OH/TN Valleys/Appalachians to the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast...

...Additional rounds of heavy coastal rain and mountain focusing
snow from the Northwest/Northern California through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies/High Plains...


...Guidance assessment and uncertainty...

Model and ensemble forecast spread and uncertainty remains lower
than normal for the most part through medium range time scales. A
composite of reasonably well clustered mass field guidance from
the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, the 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble
mean/UKMET/Canadian along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models
seems to offer a good basis for the WPC product suite for days 3/4
(Wed/Thu). Opted to increase WPC blend weight emphasis on the
ensemble means into days 5-7 (Fri/next weekend) to maintain max
WPC continuity. The composite tends to mitigate lingering embedded
system timing/strength differences and run to run variable lower
atmospheric temperature profiles. It should be noted that by
Thu/Fri with the Southern to Eastern U.S./coastal system, the
plausible but less likely 00/06/12 UTC GFS and a minority amount
of GEFS/ECMWF ensemble members are more suppressed by the cold
airmass in the wake of a midweek deep Great Lakes low than the
00/12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian runs, with a farther offshore track
of the southern based coastal low/storm.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The upper level flow pattern over the nation will be rather
amplified through the end of the week with a large scale trough
over the east-central U.S. and a broad ridge over the West Coast,
before transitioning to a more quasi-zonal flow by next weekend.

A deepening storm will track into the Great Lakes and eastern
Canada Wed/Thu. Arctic air will dig across the central then
eastern U.S. behind the windy and precipitation focusing low to
include a threat of plowable snow from the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
to the Northeast. Another quickly developing heavy snow/ice threat
with some aforementioned uncertainty is on tap underneath Thu into
Fri from the TN/OH Valleys through the Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic
to the Northeast by frontal low/coastal storm genesis.

Meanwhile, multiple Pacific systems with moderate atmospheric
river blueprints will meanwhile take aim at the Pacific
Northwest/northern CA this week, that will fuel multi-day coastal
rainfall and terrain/mountain enhancing snows. Energies will work
inland across a snowy north-central Great Basin/Rockies/High
Plains where lift will be further enhanced by post-frontal
upslope. Downstream by next weekend, return flow from the Gulf of
Mexico is also expected to fuel an emerging enhanced rainfall area
inland over the Gulf Coast states/TN Valley in advance of yet
another Arctic frontal surge down through the central to
east-central U.S..

Temperatures are expected to be frigid across the central/northern
Plains to the Upper Midwest through the end of the week with a
large surface high of arctic origin governing the weather pattern
for this region. Highs in the double digits below zero are once
again likely for portions of eastern Montana and into North
Dakota, and highs in the teens settling as far south as southern
Kansas on Thursday. Some abatement in the severe cold may come to
pass across this region ahead of the next arctic surge next

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
152 PM EST Sun Jan 02 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 05 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 09 2022

...Arctic air sets stage for multiple heavy snow threats from the
Great Lakes and OH/TN Valleys/Appalachians to the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast...

...Additional rounds of heavy coastal rain and mountain focusing
snow from the Northwest/Northern California through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies/High Plains...


...Guidance assessment and uncertainty...

Model and ensemble forecast spread and uncertainty remains lower
than normal for the most part through medium range time scales. A
composite of reasonably well clustered mass field guidance from
the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, the 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble
mean/UKMET/Canadian along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models
seems to offer a good basis for the WPC product suite for days 3/4
(Wed/Thu). Opted to increase WPC blend weight emphasis on the
ensemble means into days 5-7 (Fri/next weekend) to maintain max
WPC continuity. The composite tends to mitigate lingering embedded
system timing/strength differences and run to run variable lower
atmospheric temperature profiles. It should be noted that by
Thu/Fri with the Southern to Eastern U.S./coastal system, the
plausible but less likely 00/06/12 UTC GFS and a minority amount
of GEFS/ECMWF ensemble members are more suppressed by the cold
airmass in the wake of a midweek deep Great Lakes low than the
00/12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian runs, with a farther offshore track
of the southern based coastal low/storm.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The upper level flow pattern over the nation will be rather
amplified through the end of the week with a large scale trough
over the east-central U.S. and a broad ridge over the West Coast,
before transitioning to a more quasi-zonal flow by next weekend.

A deepening storm will track into the Great Lakes and eastern
Canada Wed/Thu. Arctic air will dig across the central then
eastern U.S. behind the windy and precipitation focusing low to
include a threat of plowable snow from the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
to the Northeast. Another quickly developing heavy snow/ice threat
with some aforementioned uncertainty is on tap underneath Thu into
Fri from the TN/OH Valleys through the Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic
to the Northeast by frontal low/coastal storm genesis.

Meanwhile, multiple Pacific systems with moderate atmospheric
river blueprints will meanwhile take aim at the Pacific
Northwest/northern CA this week, that will fuel multi-day coastal
rainfall and terrain/mountain enhancing snows. Energies will work
inland across a snowy north-central Great Basin/Rockies/High
Plains where lift will be further enhanced by post-frontal
upslope. Downstream by next weekend, return flow from the Gulf of
Mexico is also expected to fuel an emerging enhanced rainfall area
inland over the Gulf Coast states/TN Valley in advance of yet
another Arctic frontal surge down through the central to
east-central U.S..

Temperatures are expected to be frigid across the central/northern
Plains to the Upper Midwest through the end of the week with a
large surface high of arctic origin governing the weather pattern
for this region. Highs in the double digits below zero are once
again likely for portions of eastern Montana and into North
Dakota, and highs in the teens settling as far south as southern
Kansas on Thursday. Some abatement in the severe cold may come to
pass across this region ahead of the next arctic surge next
weekend. Elsewhere, seasonably cold conditions are expected west
of the Continental Divide with readings generally within 10
degrees of climatological averages, and cold next weekend over the
East with highs 10+ degrees below normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0116 PM CST Sun Jan 02 2022

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Locally elevated conditions are still possible across northeastern
New Mexico into the Texas Panhandle. Recent snowfall is already
melting today and will continue to do so with the dry and breezy
conditions on Monday. Fuels were quite dry prior to the
precipitation and Monday will serve to help prime fuels ahead of
Tuesday's critical meteorological conditions in parts of the region.

..Wendt.. 01/02/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CST Sun Jan 02 2022/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing over the southeast will move offshore early in
the period as zonal flow returns to much of the CONUS. Flow aloft
will weaken across the center of the country as surface high
pressure in the post frontal airmass across the Plains shifts to the
east. While relatively cool and benign fire weather conditions are
expected, southerly return flow along the western periphery of the
surface high pressure may result in a few hours of dry and gusty
conditions across portions of the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Low-level southerly flow should gradually return through early
Day2/Monday as surface high pressure across the eastern Plains
shifts south. A weak lee low resulting from westerly flow aloft
across the Rockies may support a few hours of gusty south/southwest
winds of 15-20 mph through mid to late afternoon. The airmass should
remain cool but quite dry supporting RH of 10-15%. While recent
precipitation has likely moderated fuels, continued drought
conditions and the very dry surface conditions suggest some recovery
of fine fuels is possible. While confidence remains low on
widespread concerns given weak overall forcing and questions
regarding fuel availability, some potential for locally elevated
fire weather conditions will likely exist across portions of the
Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
North Carolina through Monday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southeast, southern Mid-Atlantic, and the Central Gulf Coast
through Monday morning...

...Heavy Snow for the Central/Southern Appalachians and the
Mid-Atlantic on Monday; Heavy Snow for the Cascades...

...Freeze Warning for the Western/Central Gulf Coast through
Monday morning...

On Sunday evening, a wave of low pressure developing over the
Southeast will move northeastward off the Mid-Atlantic Coast by
Monday afternoon.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along
and ahead of the associated front from the Mid-Atlantic to parts
of the Central Gulf Coast and Southeast.  Some of these
thunderstorms will be severe.  Therefore, the SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast,
southern Mid-Atlantic, and the Central Gulf Coast through Monday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.

Moisture will pool along the boundary over the Southeast and
southern Mid-Atlantic will aid in the development of heavy rain
with the showers and thunderstorms over the region.  Therefore,
the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts
of North Carolina through Monday morning.  The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through
Sunday morning.  Furthermore there are Freeze Warning for the
Western/Central Gulf Coast through Monday morning.

On Monday, the severe thunderstorm threat will continue over parts
of the southern Mid-Atlantic.  Therefore, the SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the southern
Mid-Atlantic on Monday into late Monday afternoon.  The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, a few tornadoes, and minimal risk for
hail.  However, severe thunderstorms will not be the only threat
on Monday.  In addition, significant winter weather will impact
the Central/Southern Appalachians and the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.
On Monday, heavy snow will develop over parts of Central/Southern
Appalachians, Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula, with up to six
inches of snow.  The snow will result in reduced visibility and
hazardous driving conditions.  On Monday, the threat for excessive
rainfall will be marginal over portions of southeast Virginia and
northeast North Carolina.  Light snow will also move into parts of
the Northeast on Monday.  The rain and snow will end overnight
Monday, with the Cape Cod area ending by Tuesday morning.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy and a front will move onshore over
the Pacific Northwest overnight Sunday.  As a result, rain and
higher elevation snow will develop over parts of the Pacific
Northwest on Sunday evening into Monday.  Coastal rain and higher
elevation snow will develop over parts of Northern California on
Monday.  The snow will move inland over the Northern Intermountain
Region into parts of the Northern Rockies by Tuesday morning,
while the coastal rain and snow will continue over the Northwest
through Tuesday.  The Cascades will get heavy snow during this
period.

A front moving southward out of Central Canada overnight Sunday
will move along the Northern Tier States into the Upper Great
Lakes by Monday afternoon into evening.  A wave of low pressure
will develop over the Northern High Plains on Monday evening and
move southeastward to the Middle Mississippi Valley by Tuesday
evening.  The wave of low pressure will aid in producing light
snow over parts of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi
Valley on Tuesday, as light snow develops over parts of the Upper
Great Lakes.

On Sunday evening, a wave of low pressure developing over the
Southeast will move northeastward off the Mid-Atlantic Coast by
Monday afternoon.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along
and ahead of the associated front from the Mid-Atlantic to parts
of the Central Gulf Coast and Southeast.  Some of these

Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast,
southern Mid-Atlantic, and the Central Gulf Coast through Monday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.

Moisture will pool along the boundary over the Southeast and
southern Mid-Atlantic will aid in the development of heavy rain
with the showers and thunderstorms over the region.  Therefore,
the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts
of North Carolina through Monday morning.  The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through
Sunday morning.  Furthermore, there are Freeze Warnings for the
Western/Central Gulf Coast through Monday morning.

On Monday, the severe thunderstorm threat will continue over parts
of the southern Mid-Atlantic.  Therefore, the SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the southern
Mid-Atlantic on Monday into late Monday afternoon.  The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, a few tornadoes, and minimal risk for
hail.  However, severe thunderstorms will not be the only threat
on Monday.  In addition, significant winter weather will impact
the Central/Southern Appalachians and the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.
On Monday, heavy snow will develop over parts of Central/Southern
Appalachians, Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula, with up to six
inches of snow.  The snow will result in reduced visibility and
hazardous driving conditions.  On Monday, the threat for excessive
rainfall will be marginal over portions of southeast Virginia and
northeast North Carolina.  Light snow will also move into parts of
the Northeast on Monday.  The rain and snow will end overnight
Monday, with the Cape Cod area ending by Tuesday morning.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy and a front will move onshore over
the Pacific Northwest overnight Sunday.  As a result, rain and
higher elevation snow will develop over parts of the Pacific
Northwest on Sunday evening into Monday.  Coastal rain and higher
elevation snow will develop over parts of Northern California on
Monday.  The snow will move inland over the Northern Intermountain
Region into parts of the Northern Rockies by Tuesday morning,
while the coastal rain and snow will continue over the Northwest
through Tuesday.  The Cascades will get heavy snow during this
period.

A front moving southward out of Central Canada overnight Sunday
will move along the Northern Tier States into the Upper Great
Lakes by Monday afternoon into evening.  A wave of low pressure
will develop over the Northern High Plains on Monday evening and
move southeastward to the Middle Mississippi Valley by Tuesday
evening.  The wave of low pressure will aid in producing light
snow over parts of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi
Valley on Tuesday, as light snow develops over parts of the Upper
Great Lakes.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over much of
coastal North Carolina today...

...Heavy Snow for parts of the Central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic on today; Heavy Snow for the Cascades and northern
Sierra...

...Freeze Warnings from south Texas to the Western/Central Gulf
Coast through this morning; Critical Fire Weather risk for a
portion of eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle on Tuesday...

A dynamic low pressure system will be the fuel for significant
weather impacts across parts of the Southeast coast and
Mid-Atlantic over the next day or so. A cold front associated with
the deepening area of low pressure will be the focus for scattered
showers and thunderstorms across the Carolinas and down into
Florida today. A Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms is in effect
for much of coastal North Carolina today as Gulf moisture streams
into the region from the south and interacts with the approaching
cold front from the west. Damaging winds and a few tornadoes
appear to be the main concerns with this severe weather threat.
Rain will changeover to snow across much of the Central
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic this morning as temperatures fall
below freezing. Generally, a swath of between 4-8 inches of snow
is possible from the Central Appalachians through Washington DC
and into southern New Jersey by this evening. The heaviest snow is
likely to fall right after the transition from rain this morning,
which will make for a tricky commute to work.

Meanwhile, the active period continues for the Pacific Northwest
as a series of low pressure systems bring rain and heavy snow to
the region. The first system will spread rain across the low
elevations of the Pacific Northwest and northern California over
the next couple of days. The heaviest rainfall is likely to occur
over central and southwestern Oregon down into northwestern
California where between 3-6 inches may fall. Heavy snow is
forecast to impact the Cascades as well, where between 2-4 feet of
snow is expected over the next couple of days. The second system
will spread snow into the Northern Rockies and northern Sierra by
Tuesday, where several inches to over a foot is possible.
Temperatures are expected to drop precipitously across northern
Montana and North Dakota beginning Monday night as a strong cold
front descends into the lower 48 from southern Canada. This frigid
airmass will plunge high temperatures into the single digits for
much of the Northern Plains and foothills of the Northern Rockies
on Tuesday, before sinking south across the rest of the plains and
Mississippi Valley over the subsequent days. There's potential for
a winter storm to impact parts of the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes
Tuesday night into Wednesday, where between 3-6 inches of snowfall
are possible.

High pressure, currently plopped over the Southern Plains, will be
responsible for freezing temperatures across south Texas and the
Western/Central Gulf coast this morning. Temperatures are forecast
to be anywhere between the mid 20s to the low 30s for these areas
before warming up into the 50s later today. Increased winds,
thanks to an approaching deep low pressure system from the north,
and falling dew points will contribute to the potential for fire
weather across portions of eastern New Mexico and the Texas
Panhandle on Tuesday. A Critical Risk of Fire Weather is in effect
as a result.

***Additional rounds of heavy coastal rain and mountain snow for
the northwestern states***

***Frigid air mass for the north-central U.S. and potential snow
for inland portions of the East Coast region late in the week***


...General Pattern Overview...

The upper level flow pattern over the nation will be rather
amplified through the end of the week with a large scale trough
over the east-central U.S. and a broad ridge over the West Coast,
before transitioning to a more quasi-zonal flow by the weekend.
An organized low pressure system is expected near the East Coast
to close out the week, and another low affects the Great Lakes by
Saturday night into Sunday.  An arctic air mass will settle
southward across much of the north-central U.S. in the wake of the
strong cold front.

...Guidance assessment and uncertainty...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in very good synoptic scale
agreement through Saturday with some mesoscale timing and
amplitude differences with the individual shortwave passages.  One
of the main differences is with the 00Z GFS by depicting a more
offshore track with the East Coast low and thus much less
impactful for the Northeast, and this was also the case with
yesterday's GFS run.  By Sunday, the GFS becomes considerably
stronger with a potential closed low over the West Coast region,
which does not have much ensemble support.  The greatest
differences by day 7 are apparent this same general region, whilst
the trough over the East has good model agreement.

The WPC forecast was based primarily on a multi-deterministic
model blend through Friday, and then gradually increasing use of
the ECENS and GEFS means through next weekend and into Monday.

...Sensible Weather...

There will be multiple Pacific storm systems that will affect the
Pacific Northwest and inland across portions of the Great Basin
and the Northern Rockies.  This will result in heavy rain and
heavy mountain snow for Thursday and Friday, with a potential
atmospheric river event for northern Oregon and southwest
Washington during this time.  A drying trend should commence in
time for the weekend across much of the West as high pressure
builds back into the region.  Meanwhile, widespread light to
moderate precipitation is likely across the eastern third of the
U.S. in association with the East Coast low on Friday, with heavy
snow possible for portions of the Appalachians.  More showers and
storms are likely to make a return to the Gulf Coast region by
Sunday ahead of the next front.

Temperatures are expected to be frigid across the central/northern
Plains to the Upper Midwest through the end of the week with a
large surface high of arctic origin governing the weather pattern
for this region.  Subzero highs are once again likely for portions
of eastern Montana, North Dakota, and northern Minnesota, and
highs in the teens settling as far south as Kansas on Thursday.
Some abatement in the severe cold may come to pass across this
region on Saturday ahead of the next arctic surge Sunday, which is
not expected to be as intense as the earlier arctic blast.
Elsewhere, seasonably cold conditions are expected west of the
Continental Divide with readings generally within 10 degrees of
climatological averages, and mild across the southern Plains and
Deep South with highs running 5 to 15 degrees above average this
weekend.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
In the wake of the strong trough moving offshore across the East
Coast, mid-level flow is forecast to weaken temporarily as the flow
pattern becomes more zonal. A weak surface low/trough in the lee of
the Rockies will support southerly flow returning to the southern
High Plains through the afternoon. The warming of the already dry
airmass may result in localized fire weather potential and drying of
fine fuels.

...Southern High Plains...
As overall forcing slackens under the zonal flow regime, southerly
return flow should result in a quick warm up in temperatures across
the southern High plains through the afternoon. South/southwesterly
flow may periodically reach 15+ mph through the day in response to
troughing in the lee of the southern/central Rockies. Diurnal RH
minimums are expected to be low, (10-15%) given the dry airmass and
little moisture in place. Fine fuel moisture has decreased following
the freeze and precipitation event several days ago. The warming and
dry airmass should further augment fuel availability supporting some
fire weather potential today. However, the lack of stronger
background winds should keep the threat primarily local in nature.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow will dominate the mid levels across the CONUS as a strong
jet streak and shortwave trough move across the West Coast and nose
eastward into the central Rockies. Surface high pressure will shift
eastward as a surface low moves out of the northern High Plains
toward the Great Lakes. Warming temperatures and strengthening
low-level winds across the Southern High Plains will produce
critical fire weather conditions within already dry fuels.

...Southern High Plains...
Strong winds aloft associated with a low amplitude shortwave trough
and an attendant mid-level jet will overspread the region starting
early D2/Tuesday. The development of a lee trough will further
enhance surface flow through the day as widespread winds of 20-30
mph develop from the west/southwest. Downsloping will further
augment the dry antecedent airmass with model soundings showing
boundary-layer mean RH of 8-15% through the afternoon across much of
the High Plains. With several days of drying occurring after the
hard freeze and precipitation event, fine fuels across the Texas
Panhandle and eastern New Mexico have shown rapid increase in
dryness. Continued drying suggests sufficiently dry fuels will be in
place along with a favorable overlap of strong winds and low RH for
elevated and critical fire weather conditions.

Localized elevated fire weather conditions may also occur further
north across portions of the central High Plains where stronger
downslope westerly flow is expected to materialize. Here greater
uncertainty in humidity values and fuel status suggests a more
localized threat.

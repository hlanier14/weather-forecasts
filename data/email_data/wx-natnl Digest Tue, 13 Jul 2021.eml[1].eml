Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1128 AM CDT Mon Jul 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

Mid-morning water vapor imagery shows a weak shortwave trough moving
onshore across the Pacific Northwest. Morning guidance has captured
this feature and recent wind/RH trends well, lending confidence to
the ongoing forecast with only minor adjustments needed. The
isolated dry-thunderstorm risk area was expanded into the UT/WY/CO
region where morning guidance suggests at least a low-end chance for
afternoon convection amid similar fuel conditions and boundary-layer
dryness. Recent satellite imagery shows developing cumulus along the
terrain features, which supports recent model trends. For additional
details see the previous discussion below.

..Moore.. 07/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1217 AM CDT Mon Jul 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will remain entrenched across the West today.
Another shortwave trough will move into the Northwest, though this
particular trough will be weaker than on Sunday. Mid-level moisture
will continue to work its way to the north and west across the
Southwest and Great Basin. Strong heating from the Columbia Basin
into the northern Great Basin will deepen a thermal pressure trough.

...Northern/central Great Basin...
Though the approaching shortwave trough will be relatively weak, an
enhancement in mid-level winds will occur across parts of Oregon
into northern Nevada. These increasing winds aloft and the thermal
pressure trough will combine to bring dry and windy conditions
across these areas. Sustained elevated conditions are most likely
across northern Nevada. Winds will reach 15-20 mph with RH falling
to 10-20%. East of the Cascades in Oregon, a few areas of
terrain-enhanced winds from the Columbia Gorge southward may reach
15-20 mph for an hour or two. RH will likely fall to near 15-20%.
Ongoing fires in the lee of the Cascades may be impacted.

A mix of wet and dry thunderstorms is possible over areas of dry
fuels in central Nevada into central Utah. Storm motions will be
greater and PWAT a bit lower with northward extent, especially in
Nevada, leading to a higher probability of dry storms.

...Remaining hot in the northern Great Basin to the High Plains...


...Overview...

Upper pattern will remain somewhat anchored during the period with
troughing just west of British Columbia and over the Great
Lakes/Northwest with building upper ridging into the Four Corners
Region. This will promote above normal temperatures for much of
the interior West, especially into Montana and the High Plains. A
frontal boundary will slowly push eastward out of the Corn Belt
into the Northeast and eventually Mid-Atlantic with showers and
storms along and ahead of the boundary. Some rainfall may be
locally heavy. Over the Southwest, the Monsoon will help touch off
some showers and storms around the upper high across portions of
AZ/NM/CO.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles showed better than average predictability in
the longwave pattern evolution/orientation but less agreement on
the embedded shorter-scale features. The 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF
offered reasonable clustering with their ensemble means and each
other such that a blended solution (with added detail from the
UKMET and somewhat the Canadian) sufficed as a starting point. The
GFS was a little quicker to bring in some height falls to the Pac
NW early next week compared to the ECMWF (along with their
ensembles), but this may be a function of how the upper low may
send shortwaves around its base and has limited predictability.
Over the East, the GFS and Canadian were slower to move the upper
trough eastward than the ECMWF, with the ensemble consensus a
little on the slower side.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

As the cold front moves out of the Midwest to the East, showers
and storms will be capable of producing scattered light to
moderate rainfall with locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms
maximize. Moisture will be above normal, though modestly, along
with dew points well into the 60s and low 70s. Temperatures will
be near to above normal ahead of the front by a few degrees, with
only a few to several degree drop in its wake. Areas of highest
rainfall chances will slowly shift southward and eastward this
weekend into early next week.

In the West, rising heights will maintain dry and warming
conditions for the Interior through Montana where temperatures
will climb from the 90s to low 100s in eastern lower elevation
areas by next Sun/Mon (as well as in favored/warmer valley
locations in ID and UT). Temperatures in the Southwest will be
near to perhaps slightly below normal due to increased cloud cover
and higher rainfall chances. Rainfall will be favored over higher
elevations of AZ/NM/CO during the afternoon and early evening
(perhaps into some valley locations).

...Remaining hot in the northern Great Basin to the High Plains...


...Overview...

Upper pattern will remain somewhat anchored during the period with
troughing just west of British Columbia and over the Great
Lakes/Northwest with building upper ridging into the Four Corners
Region. This will promote above normal temperatures for much of
the interior West, especially into Montana and the High Plains. A
frontal boundary will slowly push eastward out of the Corn Belt
into the Northeast and eventually Mid-Atlantic with showers and
storms along and ahead of the boundary. Some rainfall may be
locally heavy. Over the Southwest, the Monsoon will help touch off
some showers and storms around the upper high across portions of
AZ/NM/CO.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles showed better than average predictability in
the longwave pattern evolution/orientation but less agreement on
the embedded shorter-scale features. The 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF
offered reasonable clustering with their ensemble means and each
other such that a blended solution (with added detail from the
UKMET and somewhat the Canadian) sufficed as a starting point. The
GFS was a little quicker to bring in some height falls to the Pac
NW early next week compared to the ECMWF (along with their
ensembles), but this may be a function of how the upper low may
send shortwaves around its base and has limited predictability.
Over the East, the GFS and Canadian were slower to move the upper
trough eastward than the ECMWF, with the ensemble consensus a
little on the slower side.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

As the cold front moves out of the Midwest to the East, showers
and storms will be capable of producing scattered light to
moderate rainfall with locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms
maximize. Moisture will be above normal, though modestly, along
with dew points well into the 60s and low 70s. Temperatures will
be near to above normal ahead of the front by a few degrees, with
only a few to several degree drop in its wake. Areas of highest
rainfall chances will slowly shift southward and eastward this
weekend into early next week.

In the West, rising heights will maintain dry and warming
conditions for the Interior through Montana where temperatures
will climb from the 90s to low 100s in eastern lower elevation
areas by next Sun/Mon (as well as in favored/warmer valley
locations in ID and UT). Temperatures in the Southwest will be
near to perhaps slightly below normal due to increased cloud cover
and higher rainfall chances. Rainfall will be favored over higher
elevations of AZ/NM/CO during the afternoon and early evening
(perhaps into some valley locations).

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 121857
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 12 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is strong model agreement in regards to mid-level high
pressure
expanding across the western half of the lower 48 later in week-1 and
persisting into week-2. This feature is expected to bring yet another round of
excessive heat to portions of the western and north-central lower 48, with the
highest positive temperature anomalies likely across the Northern Rockies and
Northern Plains. An active North American Monsoon circulation is forecast to
promote above-normal precipitation and possible flooding over the Desert
Southwest. Downstream across the eastern U.S., frontal activity is predicted
to
slowly shift southward into the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast,
becoming a focus for increased chances for heavy rain across already saturated
areas.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Rockies and Northern
Plains, Tue-Wed, Jul 20-21.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Great Basin, Northern and
Central Rockies, Northern Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley, Tue-Fri, Jul
20-23.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western and north-central CONUS,
Tue-Mon, Jul 20-26.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southern Appalachians, and Southeast, Tue-Wed, Jul
20-21.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across coastal portions of California,
Tue-Thu, Jul 20-22.

Possible flooding for portions of Missouri and Illinois.

Possible flooding for portions of Arizona and New Mexico.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY JULY 15 - MONDAY JULY 19:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!tc9jmBL4ZSaCO6yEKJAr4G6AaxDpMLOvvAQ8r-9xvymavEKgLZ0ivj5KbEhyJbJiL_yV4gzu$

FOR TUESDAY JULY 20 - MONDAY JULY 26: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles depict amplified ridging returning across the western CONUS late in
week-1 with positive height anomalies building across the north-central CONUS.
By day-8, the model ensemble means indicate 500-hPa heights of 595-596 dm
centered over the Four Corners region, with heights greater than 588 dm
expanding through south-central Canada. This pattern translates into increased
chances for excessive heat across portions of the western and north-central
CONUS. The greatest potential exists across portions of the Northern Rockies
and Northern Plains where the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts at least a 60%
chance that maximum temperatures exceed the 85th climatological percentile
early in week-2. Triple digit temperatures are probable, especially over the
lower elevation areas of eastern Montana. The GEFS reforecast tool is less
robust compared to the ECMWF tool, but given the ongoing drought and seemingly
relentless heat across the region and likely exacerbation of impacts, a high
risk for excessive heat is posted for the Northern Rockies and Plains on July
20-21. A moderate risk continues through July 23, and is highlighted over a
broad area including parts of the Great Basin, Northern and Central Rockies,
Northern Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley where the reforecast tools
indicate some of these areas having at least a 40% chance maximum temperatures
exceed the 85th climatological percentile, which translates to actual
temperatures reaching the 90s deg F across the valleys of the Great Basin, and
also over eastern portions of the Northern Plains and into the Upper
Mississippi Valley. A slight risk for excessive heat continues for all of
week-2 for much of the western and north-central CONUS with the slight risk
chances shifting more east with time.



The predicted placement of the mid-level height maximum across the Four
Corners
Region is expected to promote enhanced monsoonal moisture flow across portions
of the Desert Southwest. Increased tropical activity in the Eastern Pacific is
also likely to contribute to enhanced moisture surges as well. Although actual
precipitation amounts in the model guidance are not supportive of a heavy
precipitation hazard due to lack of coherency in terms of timing and
placement,
the localized convective nature of the precipitation could result in flash
flooding across the valleys. The highest risk remains across parts of Arizona
and New Mexico where a flooding possible hazard remains posted. Flash flooding
can occur even in areas that do not receive any rain, and be a direct result
of
runoff from precipitation upstream.



Mean surface high pressure remains forecast across the northeastern Pacific,
into parts of the Pacific Northwest, while thermal low pressure is anticipated
over the Great Basin and Desert Southwest during week-2 related to the
aforementioned anomalous ridging predicted. The strong mean pressure gradient
situated over coastal California increases chances for episodic high winds in
the region, where both reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph during the
early
portion of week-2. Therefore, a slight risk of high winds remains posted
across
coastal portions of northern and central California for July 20-22. Increased
wind speeds could promote the spread of wildfires due to the ongoing hot and
dry conditions.



Downstream of the ridge over the western CONUS, the overall mid-level flow
pattern is favored to be weaker with a slow moving front forecast to sag
southward through the Lower Midwest and into the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southeast from late in week-1 to early week-2. Heavy rain is forecast across
portions of the Middle Mississippi Valley late in week-1. This favors
increased
chances for river flooding across parts of Missouri and Illinois near the
Mississippi River persisting into week-2, resulting in a possible flooding
hazard. At the start of week-2, the heaviest rainfall chances are favored to
have shifted south over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee
Valley, Southern Appalachians, and the Southeast, corresponding with the
slight
risk for heavy precipitation highlighted on July 20-21. Although the
reforecast
tools are generally not supportive of rainfall amounts reaching hazards
criteria, uncalibrated guidance, particularly from the 0z ECMWF and Canadian
ensembles, indicates increased chances for daily rainfall amounts exceeding  a
half an inch on days 8 and 9 over these areas. Given the convective nature of
the threat, locally higher amounts are possible. The already saturated soils,
and resultant lower threshold for flash flooding also supports the inclusion
of
this otherwise marginal threat.



A low amplitude pattern is favored for Alaska during week-2 with weak
troughing
in the Bering Sea favoring increased precipitation chances across portions of
the western Mainland. While the chances of 3-day precipitation totals
exceeding
the 85th percentile are greater than 20% in the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools
over some areas, actual 3-day precipitation totals are forecast to be under an
inch, precluding a related hazard. Generally seasonable temperatures are
forecast across the state, with slight tilts toward above normal temperatures
across the southeastern Mainland, and below normal temperatures across the
western Mainland.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0212 PM CDT Mon Jul 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

Recent hi-res ensemble guidance maintains reasonable probabilities
for elevated fire weather conditions from northwest NV into
southeast ID and southwest WY. Brief critical conditions remain
possible through the Snake River Plain, but confidence in the
duration and spatial extent of the threat is not sufficient to
introduce a Critical area.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Recent CAM guidance shows increasing thunderstorm chances as a
shortwave trough approaches the northern Rockies. These model
solutions, as well as recent ensemble guidance, suggest a narrow
corridor will exist featuring sufficient instability and 0.4 to 0.7
inch PWAT values from far northeast UT into eastern ID/western MT.
Confidence in the propensity for dry lightning is not overly high
given a somewhat weak convective signal across northeast UT/west WY
and the potential for a wet/dry mix across MT/ID, but near
historical ERCs within this corridor may support a fire risk with
any thunderstorm activity.

..Moore.. 07/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0117 AM CDT Mon Jul 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
The low-amplitude shortwave trough in the Northwest will continue to
the east into the northern Rockies on Tuesday. This will flatten the
upper ridge across the West. Continued mid-level moisture influx
into the Great Basin will bring another day of thunderstorm chances
across much of the region, though storms will trend more towards the
wet side of the spectrum.

...Northwest Nevada...
Zephyr winds will reach 15-20 mph with RH in the 10-20% range during
afternoon and evening. With weaker winds aloft than on Monday,
elevated conditions will generally be tied to the lee of the Sierra.
Locally elevated conditions could occur farther east.

...Southern Idaho into southwest Wyoming...
Mid-level flow will be enhanced on the southern flank of the
shortwave trough. Winds will reach 15-20 mph, though localized
speeds of 20-25 mph will be possible. RH is expected to be in the
15-20% range.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
The potential for dry thunderstorms appears low on Tuesday as an
increase in PWAT and slow storm speeds will increase wetting rain
potential in the Great Basin. A dry storm or two would be most
likely to occur within the Uintas, along the fringes of higher PWAT
and boundary layer RH.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 18 - 22 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a ridge over the
Aleutians with above normal 500-hPa heights extending to Mainland Alaska, and
a
trough over the eastern North Pacific centered near the coast of western North
America. A ridge is predicted over the western CONUS with positive height
anomalies extending to the Northern Plains, Great Lakes, and Northeast.
Downstream a positively tilted trough is predicted over the eastern CONUS with
below normal 500-hPa heights from parts of the Southern Plains to the
Southeast
and Mid-Atlantic region.

Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated across much of Mainland
Alaska, the Aleutians and parts of the Alaska Panhandle underneath predicted
above normal heights, while below normal temperatures are favored for parts of
western Mainland Alaska, consistent with the consolidation tool. Above normal
temperatures are also favored for much of the western CONUS, the Northern
Plains and parts of the Northeast due to the persistent ridging. A predicted
trough over the eastern CONUS, as well as a weakness in the ridge over parts
of
the Southwest, favors enhanced probabilities of near to below normal
temperatures from the Southwest, eastward to the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic
region.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over northwestern
Mainland Alaska due to forecast westerly surface flow and storm systems
development. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over
southeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle near the predicted trough. Below
normal precipitation is favored for the northwestern CONUS and much of the
Northern Tier due to positive height anomalies. The positively tilted trough
forecast in the eastern U.S. supports a more southerly storm track, increasing
the likelihood of above normal precipitation for parts of the Southern Plains,
Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic region, except for southern parts of the Florida
Peninsula, where below normal precipitation is favored, consistent with the
ERF
consolidation forecast tool. The position of the predicted 500-hPa trough and
low-level flow is favorable for increased monsoonal moisture and above normal
precipitation in parts of the Southwest.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 20 - 26 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to shift eastward and deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. The
temperature probability forecast during the week-2 period is very similar to
the 6-10 day period, with a couple of exceptions. Above normal temperature
probabilities are lower and cover less area in parts of Mainland Alaska due to
increased uncertainty. Below normal temperatures are favored over the Alaska
Peninsula due to forecast shortwave troughs moving onshore. The precipitation
probability forecast is also very similar to the 6-10 day period, though
conditions are more favorable for monsoonal moisture to become a bit more
widespread, and conditions in the eastern U.S. are expected to become driver,
favoring less above normal precipitation and more below normal precipitation.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Heavy rain and potential flooding for parts of the Eastern U.S.
and the Desert Southwest...

...Heat wave continues for much of the western U.S. through early
this week...

...Heavy rain and severe weather threat for the Midwest midweek...

Unsettled weather continues in the Northeast U.S. as a slow moving
warm front advances northward along with a very moist airmass,
with dewpoints in the low to mid-70s. Widespread moderate to heavy
rainfall with embedded thunderstorms are forecast through the
period. Of greatest concern is a Moderate Risk for Excessive
rainfall for the New York City area through tomorrow morning.
Rainfall of 2 inches and higher is forecast for heavily urbanized
areas that have recently seen significant rainfall leading to
saturated soils. A broader Slight Risk for excessive rainfall is
in effect for portions of eastern Pennsylvania and southern New
York where 1 to 2 inches of additional rainfall is possible
through tomorrow. A Slight Risk is also in effect for portions of
Upstate New York east of Lake Ontario for tomorrow with 2 inches
and potentially higher rain totals forecast. The heavy rain may
lead to flooding and rises on area rivers as the region has seen
above normal rainfall recently. Some additional heavy rainfall is
expected further south along a trailing cold front moving east
across the Midwest and South, but the threat will decrease with
time as the front weakens tomorrow.

The intense heat wave that has been setting records across the
western U.S. has peaked for most areas, with a gradual return to
more seasonal temperatures by later in the week as the upper-level
ridge that has been in place continues to weaken.  However,
excessive heat warnings remain in effect for most areas through
Tuesday evening. Forecast highs on Tuesday include the mid- to
upper 100s for the Desert Southwest and San Joaquin Valley in
central California, low 100s for the Great Basin, and upper 90s to
low 100s for the Interior Pacific Northwest. Cooler high
temperatures are forecast for central California and the Great
Basin on Wednesday, with upper 90s expected in most areas, but
will remain relatively hotter in the Interior Pacific Northwest
with upper 90s to low 100s once again possible.  Some relief from
the extreme heat will also arrive in the form of monsoonal showers
and storms each day across portions of Arizona and New Mexico.
Slight Risks for excessive rainfall are in effect each day. Heavy
rain of 1-2 inches can be expected each day across the area, with
higher amounts of 3-4 inches locally where the greatest downpours
occur. The flood threat is most likely in more urbanized areas and
for burn scars.

As the storm system in the east moves north into Canada, a series
of fronts will move through the Northern and Central Plains.
Showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop on Tuesday from
the Northern High Plains east through the Upper Missouri Valley. A
Marginal Risk for excessive rain is in effect with heavy rain of 1
to 2 inches is possible. More organized storms are expected on
Wednesday, and there is a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall in
effect. Heavy rainfall of 1 to 3 inches with locally higher
amounts of up to 5 inches is forecast. Severe weather is also a
threat, and the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk
for portions of the Upper Missouri and Mississippi Valleys. The
organized line of thunderstorms may produce high winds and
short-lived tornadoes.

...Remaining hot in the northern Great Basin to the High Plains...

...Overview...

Upper pattern will remain slowly evolving during the period with
troughing just west of British Columbia and over the Great Lakes
and Ohio Valley with building upper ridging into the Four Corners
Region across the central Rockies and northern Plains. This will
promote above normal temperatures for much of the interior West,
especially into Montana and the High Plains. A frontal boundary
will slowly push south across the MS, OH and TN Valleys, the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic with showers and storms along and ahead
of the boundary. Some rainfall may be locally heavy. Over the
Southwest, the Monsoon will help touch off some showers and storms
around the upper high across portions of AZ/NM/CO.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles showed better than average predictability in
the longwave pattern evolution/orientation out west due to the
large sprawling, and slowly moving anticyclone and eastern pacific
trough. There remains differences in the timing/amplitude of the
downstream developing eastern US trough.
The 18z GFS was an outlier with the deepest closed low developing
over the northeast US within the upper trough axis. Manual progs
blended the 12Z ECMWF/12z ECMWF Ensemble Mean/18z GEFS Mean, with
continued good agreement on the trough axis among the means. The
GFS and Canadian were slower to move the upper trough eastward
than the ECMWF, with the ensemble consensus a little on the slower
side.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

In the West, rising heights will maintain dry and warming
conditions for the northern Great Basin through Montana where
temperatures will climb from the 90s to low 100s in eastern lower
elevation areas by next Sun/Mon (as well as in favored/warmer
valley locations in ID and UT). Anomalies next Sun 18 Jul-Tue 20
Jul climb to near 15 degrees above normal in eastern MT and
portions of northern ND and northern MN.

Temperatures in the Southwest will be slightly below normal due to
increased cloud cover and higher rainfall chances. Showers and
storms will be scattered across AZ/NM/CO during the afternoon and
early evening. Below normal temperatures may also develop in the
southern high Plains as northerly flow advects cooler air aloft
across the area.

As the cold front moves out of the Midwest to the East, showers
and storms will be scattered to numerous, with locally heavier
amounts where thunderstorms locally train.  Temperatures will be
near to above normal ahead of the front by a few degrees, with
only a few to several degree drop in its wake. Areas of highest
rainfall chances will slowly shift southward across the MS Valley,
TN Valley, Appalachians, and mid Atlantic to the southeast.

...Remaining hot in the northern Great Basin to the High Plains...

...Overview...

Upper pattern will remain slowly evolving during the period with
troughing just west of British Columbia and over the Great Lakes
and Ohio Valley with building upper ridging into the Four Corners
Region across the central Rockies and northern Plains. This will
promote above normal temperatures for much of the interior West,
especially into Montana and the High Plains. A frontal boundary
will slowly push south across the MS, OH and TN Valleys, the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic with showers and storms along and ahead
of the boundary. Some rainfall may be locally heavy. Over the
Southwest, the Monsoon will help touch off some showers and storms
around the upper high across portions of AZ/NM/CO.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles showed better than average predictability in
the longwave pattern evolution/orientation out west due to the
large sprawling, and slowly moving anticyclone and eastern pacific
trough. There remains differences in the timing/amplitude of the
downstream developing eastern US trough.
The 18z GFS was an outlier with the deepest closed low developing
over the northeast US within the upper trough axis. Manual progs
blended the 12Z ECMWF/12z ECMWF Ensemble Mean/18z GEFS Mean, with
continued good agreement on the trough axis among the means. The
GFS and Canadian were slower to move the upper trough eastward
than the ECMWF, with the ensemble consensus a little on the slower
side.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

In the West, rising heights will maintain dry and warming
conditions for the northern Great Basin through Montana where
temperatures will climb from the 90s to low 100s in eastern lower
elevation areas by next Sun/Mon (as well as in favored/warmer
valley locations in ID and UT). Anomalies next Sun 18 Jul-Tue 20
Jul climb to near 15 degrees above normal in eastern MT and
portions of northern ND and northern MN.

Temperatures in the Southwest will be slightly below normal due to
increased cloud cover and higher rainfall chances. Showers and
storms will be scattered across AZ/NM/CO during the afternoon and
early evening. Below normal temperatures may also develop in the
southern high Plains as northerly flow advects cooler air aloft
across the area.

As the cold front moves out of the Midwest to the East, showers
and storms will be scattered to numerous, with locally heavier
amounts where thunderstorms locally train.  Temperatures will be
near to above normal ahead of the front by a few degrees, with
only a few to several degree drop in its wake. Areas of highest

0106 AM CDT Tue Jul 13 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge across the West will weaken slightly. Flow
aloft across the northern third of the CONUS will become nearly
zonal through the period. A low-amplitude shortwave trough in the
northern Rockies will bring potential for thunderstorms in the
region. It will also be followed by a weak surface boundary sagging
southward into the northern Great Basin. Mid-level moisture will
promote scattered to numerous thunderstorms within the Southwest as
well as the southern/central Great Basin. Most of that activity will
bring wetting rainfall.

...Northern Great Basin and southern Wyoming...
Dry and breezy conditions are expected from northwest Nevada into
southern Idaho and southern Wyoming. Strong surface heating will
drive a thermally induced pressure gradient in the northern Great
Basin. Winds will further be enhanced by moderate mid-level winds
mixing to the surface. RH will fall to 10-20%. Some locally critical
conditions are possible in the Snake River Plain and southwest
Wyoming, where the terrain will channel winds. Due to the
thunderstorm activity in the Great Basin and northern Rockies, some
portions of the elevated area may be impacted by outflow winds and
cloud debris. Though this would limit duration of elevated
conditions, confidence is low as to where this will occur.

...Northern Rockies...
Mid-level moisture moving north will be sufficient for thunderstorm
development along the Rockies ahead of the shortwave trough. Storms
will only initially be dry and will quickly become wetting as they
move east. Storms in Wyoming and Utah are expected to move quickly
enough that initial activity in areas where PWAT values are higher
will still bring potential for lightning ignitions.

...Heavy rain and potential flooding for parts of the Eastern U.S.
and the Desert Southwest...

...Heat wave continues for much of the western U.S. through mid
week...

The active summertime pattern of mainly afternoon/evening intense
thunderstorms with heavy downpours will continue to make weather
headlines through the middle of the week.  This especially holds
true for portions of the Northeast U.S., Florida, and the Northern
Plains to the Upper Midwest.  A quasi-stationary frontal boundary
will be nearly anchored in place across New York and southern New
England, and this in combination with multiple mid-upper level
impulses will fuel additional rounds of storms with high rainfall
rates, and any storms that develop will have the potential to
produce flash flooding.  The threat for flooding will be even
greater across those areas that have observed well above normal
rainfall over the past few days.

Afternoon and evening showers and storms are expected to be in
place across the Four Corners region, and especially southern
Arizona and New Mexico, as the southwest monsoon kicks into high
gear.  Given relatively weak steering flow aloft, many of these
storms will likely be slow moving and result in flash flooding for
canyons, across burn scars, and other vulnerable areas.  Showers
and storms are also expected to increase across portions of the
Dakotas and extending eastward across much of the Upper Midwest as
a cold front intercepts a moist and unstable airmass ahead of it.
Training of convection may also lead to flooding concerns for this
region, mainly on Wednesday.

In the temperature department, the heat wave is beginning to show
signs of abatement across the Southwest as the stubborn upper
ridge begins to break down some and monsoonal moisture increases.
However, readings are still expected to remain above mid-July
averages from California to the Great Basin, and heat-related NWS
bulletins remain in effect for many of those areas.  Hot and humid
conditions will also be present across much of the southern and
eastern U.S. with heat indices reaching above 100 degrees at times.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 AM CDT Tue Jul 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
The shortwave trough in the northern Rockies will continue east into
the northern Plains and upper Great Lakes on Tuesday. In its wake,
shortwave ridging will develop in the Northwest. The weak boundary
in the northern Great Basin will remain stationary through the
period. A subtle shortwave trough may impact parts of western
Nevada, though there is some differences in the timing of this
feature evident in guidance. Strong heating in the Northwest and
northern Great Basin will promote another thermal pressure trough.

...Northwest Nevada...
A slightly deeper thermal pressure trough will develop as compared
to Monday. However, it is likely that mid-level winds will be
weaker. Should the shortwave trough be favorably timed, some flow
enhancement aloft would occur. For now, elevated highlights will be
kept in the lee of the Sierra given the uncertainty. Winds of 15-20
mph are likely with 10-20% RH.

...Cascade Gaps...
Dry conditions are expected within the Columbia Basin into eastern
Oregon. Winds, though, will generally be light. Fire weather
concerns are possible in the Columbia Gorge and other gap regions as
the thermal pressure trough drives onshore flow during the afternoon
and evening. Locally elevated to near critical conditions may occur,
particularly in the Gorge. Due to the onshore winds, RH is expected
to increase. Duration of sustained elevated conditions is not
certain enough for highlights.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Wetting rainfall is generally expected again in the Southwest and
Great Basin. While some drier storms could occur in far northern
Nevada into southern/central Idaho, model signals for this outcome
are weak on account of the shortwave ridging aloft.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1056 AM CDT Thu Oct 14 2021

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

No changes. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 10/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0103 AM CDT Thu Oct 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery shows the gradual eastward
progression and slight deepening of an upper-level wave over the
Four Corners. This feature will traverse the southern Rockies
through the day, strengthening westerly downslope winds in the
process. To the west, building surface high pressure over the
southern Pacific Northwest/northern Great Basin will induce
northerly flow through parts of the Sacramento Valley. With dry
conditions already in place, elevated fire weather conditions are
possible.

...Southern High Plains...
In addition to the synoptic wave, water-vapor imagery also reveals
an embedded speed maxima upstream from the southern Rockies that
should overspread the southern High Plains this afternoon.
Strengthening mid-level flow associated with this feature will help
augment downslope warming/drying. As a result, relative humidity
values are forecast to fall into the low teens and perhaps single
digits. Diurnal boundary-layer mixing will allow downward transfer
of the stronger low to mid-level winds, manifesting as gusts between
25-30 mph by late afternoon. ERC values are only slightly above
seasonal values for most locations, but fine-fuel moisture values
between 3-6% suggest at least a low-end fire weather concern is
likely.

...Northern California...
Surface observations across southern OR and far northern CA have
shown steady surface pressure rises over the past 6-12 hours. This
trend is expected to continue as a surface high builds amid
upper-level height rises. The resulting pressure gradient will
induce northerly down-valley winds through the Sacramento Valley
today. Sustained winds around 15 mph are expected and may gust
upwards of 20-25 mph by late afternoon. Dewpoint values at Readding,
CA are currently near the 10th percentile for this time of year,
suggesting an anomalously dry air mass is in place. This supports
recent guidance that shows reasonably high probability of RH
reductions into the low 20s and upper teens later this afternoon.
With dry fuels already in place per recent fuel reports, elevated
conditions are likely.

FOR FRIDAY OCTOBER 22 - THURSDAY OCTOBER 28: Ensemble means from multiple
models continue to depict an amplified, persistent 500-hPa trough axis
offshore
of the West Coast during late October. This longwave trough favors an
increased
chance of atmospheric rivers and heavy precipitation affecting California a=
nd
the Pacific Northwest. The reforecast model tool guidance remains consisten=
t
regarding at least a 20 percent chance of 3-day precipitation amounts
exceeding
the 85th percentile of the climatological distribution throughout week-2 fo=
r
much of the Pacific Northwest and California. Therefore, a slight risk of
heavy
precipitation is maintained for the region, Oct 22 to 28. Given the better
skill of the GEFS recently compared to the ECMWF, its reforecast precipitat=
ion
tool guidance is preferred. Based on raw model output and the GEFS reforeca=
st
tool, a moderate risk of heavy precipitation is posted for parts of norther=
n
California and Oregon from Oct 22 to 24. The moderate risk generally covers
areas where there is a 40 percent chance of 3-day precipitation amounts
exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches, liquid equivalent. Heavy rainfa=
ll
may trigger flooding and debris flows, especially over burn scarred areas o=
f
the West. However, the early season precipitation would be beneficial to
drought-stricken areas of the West. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor
valid
on Oct 12, more than a third of California is designated with severe (D2) t=
o
exceptional (D4) drought. Due to the expectation for high snow levels with =
the
trough axis remaining offshore of the West Coast, no heavy snow hazards are
posted but accumulating snow is expected at the highest elevations of the
Cascades and Sierra Nevada Mountains. The amplified trough and increased
chance
of atmospheric rivers support a slight risk of high winds for much of the
West.
Based on the GEFS reforecast tool, the slight risk of high winds extends
through Oct 24.



Model guidance is beginning to feature a closed 500-hPa low or amplifying
trough developing over the middle latitudes of eastern North America later
next
week. Recent deterministic ECMWF model runs depict a deepening surface low
either over the Great Lakes or Mid-Atlantic early in week-2, in response to=
 a
closed 500-hPa low. If this model solution occurs, then there would be an
increasing chance of heavy precipitation and high winds across the Mid-
Atlantic
and Northeast from Oct 22 to 24. The ECMWF reforecast tool also shows an
increasing chance of the first freeze of the season throughout the Corn Bel=
t
by
around Oct 24 which would be slightly late for much of that region.



Tropical development (TC) is unlikely during the next week across the Atlan=
tic
basin and East Pacific. Although any favorable influence from the Madden-
Julian
Oscillation is uncertain, chances of TC formation may start to increase acr=
oss
the western Caribbean by week-2 as a Central America gyre develops and wind
shear diminishes with a building ridge aloft.



Downstream of a 500-hPa trough, above normal precipitation is only slightly
favored across parts of southeastern Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Howev=
er,
reforecast tools are unsupportive of precipitation amounts reaching hazard
thresholds.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
258 PM EDT Thu Oct 14 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 17 2021 - 12Z Thu Oct 21 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with troughing pushing a
cold front offshore the Eastern Seaboard, with some lake effect
rain showers behind, while another frontal system comes into the
West ahead of troughing/energy expected to track across the
central U.S. as the week progresses. Model guidance has become
more consistent with this energy separating into the southern
stream and disrupting upper ridging on either side of it. A cold
front and light to moderate precipitation should track east to
west over the western and central U.S. ahead of this feature.
Persistent amplified troughing with multiple energy centers in the
eastern Pacific may lead to precipitation coming onshore the West
Coast for the latter part of the week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

After an agreeable start to the medium range period, model
guidance signal continues to increase that the shortwave energy
coming into the West should separate to form a closed low likely
tracking through the Intermountain West and into the Plains Monday
through Wednesday. After some waffling in guidance over the past
couple of days, the consensus shows a slower track of this upper
low for the most part--in terms of the 00/06Z solutions, the 00Z
ECMWF was actually the fastest deterministic model at moving the
small closed low out into the Plains, with the UKMET/CMC/GFS runs
in better alignment. The new 12Z ECMWF has slowed down to be
closer to consensus. Ensemble member variability does show that
the timing and depth differences are not completely resolved yet,
but today's forecast for the bulk of the medium range period used
a blend of the deterministic guidance with less weighting on the
00Z ECMWF. By around midweek onward, increased weighting on the
06Z GEFS mean and 00Z EC ensemble mean, as greater differences
arise with possibly absorbing the shortwave energy back into the
northern stream. Other features of the forecast including the
trough lifting out of the eastern U.S. but forming a closed low
spinning over eastern Canada, as well as rounds of troughing
across the eastern Pacific, seem to be in fairly good agreement
and could be handled with the above blend as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system affecting the Northwest through the weekend will bring
mostly moderate precipitation to western Washington/Oregon and
northern California on Sunday. It looks increasingly likely that
there will be an axis of rain and higher elevation snow across
portions north-central portions of the West as an upper low closes
off and progresses eastward. Though confidence regarding the
strength, track, and timing of this upper low is increasing,
confidence in the details of the associated precipitation remain
lower than desired. Some of this moisture should continue across
similar latitudes of the central U.S. while some rain could
develop along the leading cold front. Flow on the eastern side of
the Pacific upper trough should bring one or more periods of rain
to central/northern parts of the West Coast Tuesday onward. On
Sunday there will be some lingering rain to the lee of the eastern
Great Lakes and over favored windward terrain in New England. The
Florida Peninsula may see an increase of rainfall toward midweek
as low level easterly flow develops.

Coverage of temperature anomalies 10F or more from normal should
be relatively low through the period, pending resolution of some
forecast details. Warm flow ahead of a front crossing the northern
tier may bring area of plus 10F or higher anomalies to locations
from Montana into the Great Lakes Sunday-Tuesday. Similar
anomalies for lows may continue into the Northeast thereafter.
Meanwhile central/north-central parts of the West may see some
highs 10-15F below normal early next week with the upper low
closing off and tracking over the region. Otherwise moderately
cool temperatures over the South and East on Sunday will quickly
moderate heading into next week, yielding near to slightly above
average highs by midweek. Clouds/moisture will keep highs modestly
below normal near the West Coast on some days.

tier may bring area of plus 10F or higher anomalies to locations
from Montana into the Great Lakes Sunday-Tuesday. Similar
anomalies for lows may continue into the Northeast thereafter.
Meanwhile central/north-central parts of the West may see some
highs 10-15F below normal early next week with the upper low
closing off and tracking over the region. Otherwise moderately
cool temperatures over the South and East on Sunday will quickly
moderate heading into next week, yielding near to slightly above
average highs by midweek. Clouds/moisture will keep highs modestly
below normal near the West Coast on some days.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu October 14 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 20 - 24 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on a predicted large-amplitud=
e
500-hPa circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions
during
the 6-10 day period. A trough with below normal 500-hPa heights is forecast
over Alaska, extending southward into the northeastern Pacific and off the
west
coast of the CONUS. Downstream, strong mean ridging and positive 500-hPa
height
anomalies are predicted over much of the interior western CONUS and the Gre=
at
Plains. In the eastern U.S., today's models all predict troughing developin=
g
during the 6-10 day period, but are in disagreement on the strength and tim=
ing
of the trough. Today's 0z ECMWF ensemble mean predicts the deepest trough,
while the 0z GEFS ensemble mean predicts the weakest trough. This variabili=
ty
in the models results in some uncertainty in the temperature and precipitat=
ion
forecasts over parts of the eastern half of the U.S. Overall, today's manua=
l
500-hPa blend favors near to slightly below normal height anomalies over pa=
rts
of the East.

Below normal temperatures are favored over most of central and southern
California under predicted mean troughing and forecast anomalous cloud-cove=
r
and precipitation. Above normal temperatures are favored over the remainder=
 of
the western CONUS associated with ridging and near to above normal 500-hPa
heights. Lingering ridging in the East early in the period favors above nor=
mal
temperatures across the East Coast for the period as a whole. Due to
uncertainty around a developing trough, there is a large area of near norma=
l
temperatures elsewhere in the East.
Near to below normal temperature probabilities are elevated over parts of
western Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutians, under
predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights. Over eastern parts of
the
Mainland and the Panhandle, above normal temperatures are favored due to
positive height anomalies and southerly low-level flow.

Predicted troughing over the northeastern Pacific increases the chances of
above normal precipitation across much of the West Coast of the CONUS. Ridg=
ing
and near to above normal 500-hPa heights increase chances of near to below
normal precipitation for much of the remainder of the CONUS, except for par=
ts
of the Southern Plains, where near to above normal precipitation is favored
due
to forecast frontal activity. Troughing and associated surface low pressure
increase the odds of above normal precipitation over parts of southeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 60% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 40% of Yesterday's operationa=
l
12z ECMWF centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today's model solutions over most of the domain, offse=
t
by
some disagreement over the eastern U.S.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 22 - 28 2021

During week-2, the 500-hPa flow pattern is similar to the 6-10 day mean
mid-level height forecast, with an amplified trough and below normal 500-hP=
a
heights over Alaska, the northeastern Pacific and the far western CONUS.
Ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over most of th=
e
north-central CONUS during week 2, and a weak mean trough is predicted acro=
ss
much of the eastern CONUS.

The temperature probability forecast for the week 2 period is similar to th=
e
6-10 day period, with a few differences. Overall probabilities are lower
across
the U.S. due to a slight deamplification of the large-scale pattern. Since =
the
eastern trough is forecast to shift slightly eastward, higher probabilities
for
near normal temperatures are favored farther east compared to the 6-10 day
period.

Today's models indicate a possible storm system moving across the Great Bas=
in
and into the Southern Plains, increasing the odds of above normal
precipitation
in those areas. The shift in the eastern trough leads to increased chances =
of
below normal precipitation over parts of the East, except the Florida
Panhandle
where possible frontal activity favors above normal precipitation. The trou=
gh
near Alaska is predicted to move eastward, leading to drier conditions that
favor below normal precipitation over parts of the western Mainland and
Aleutians, and lower probabilities of above normal precipitation near and o=
ver
the Panhandle than the 6-10 day period. This trough is forecast to result i=
n a
continuation of onshore Pacific flow into the western CONUS, favoring
increased
probabilities of above normal precipitation west of the Rockies.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the much of the large-scale circulation
pattern, offset by some differences in the large-scale pattern over parts o=
f
the eastern U.S.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...Isolated instances of flash flooding possible across the Middle
Mississippi and Ohio valleys through Friday evening...

...Severe weather threat increases later on Friday for the Ohio
Valley and western Tennessee ahead of a developing low pressure
system...

...Contrasting temperatures between the cold West and warm East to
gradually dissipate by the weekend...

The main weather features responsible for shower and thunderstorm
activity over the next few days will be found across the
south-central and eventually the eastern U.S. by early this
weekend. A cold front currently extending from the Great Lakes to
the Southern Plains is forecast remain quasi-stationary over the
Ohio and Middle Mississippi valleys through Friday afternoon as an
area of low pressure begins to develop along the boundary.
Meanwhile, the aforementioned cold front is expected to surge
southward across the Southern Plains and reach the Gulf Coast by
Friday night. Isolated instances of flash flooding will remain a
concern tonight and Friday throughout the Ohio Valley and parts of
the Lower/Middle Mississippi valleys. Additionally, ahead of the
cold front and near a strengthening low pressure system, severe
thunderstorms may develop from Ohio southwestward through Kentucky
and into western Tennessee on Friday. Damaging wind gusts, large
hail, and isolated tornadoes are possible. Chances for showers and
isolated thunderstorms will shift eastward on Saturday and extend
from the Northeast to the southern Appalachians as the advancing
cold front pushes into the region.

Elsewhere, an upper-level trough swinging over the Central Rockies
tonight will produce areas of scattered snow showers throughout
the mountainous terrain. Unsettled weather will also be found
across parts of the Northern Cascades and western Washington as a
slow moving cold front approaches the Pacific Northwest.

Unseasonably warm temperatures ahead of the previously mentioned
cold front will remain over the eastern U.S. through early this
weekend. High temperatures are forecast to reach the 70s and 80s,
with low temperatures only dropping into the 60s. In fact, dozens
of daily warm minimum temperature records are likely to fall over
the eastern U.S. on Friday and Saturday. Meanwhile, below average
temperatures found throughout the Northern/Central Plains,
Rockies, and Intermountain West will gradually filter into the
Midwest and Southern Plains on Friday before reaching the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys by Saturday. The coldest temperatures are
expected to remain locked across the Rockies and portions of the
northern/central High Plains tonight before milder temperatures
return this weekend. Freeze Warnings remain in effect tonight
across western North Dakota, northeast/southwest Colorado, and
eastern Utah.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Thu Oct 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
Building surface high pressure over the Great Basin on Friday will
support an offshore wind regime across coastal southern California.
Increasing Santa Ana winds coupled with dry conditions will support
elevated fire weather concerns within the coastal mountains and
foothills for most of the day. Elsewhere, fire weather concerns will
generally be localized and confined to the Southwest where pressure
gradient winds may support pockets of elevated conditions amid
seasonally low relative humidity and marginal fuels.

...Southern California Coast...
East to northeasterly Santa Ana winds are forecast to increase early
Friday morning, perhaps as early as the 09-12Z time period, before
peaking during the late morning/early afternoon hours. Latest
guidance suggests an LAX-DAG pressure gradient between -3 to -5 mb
is likely, which typically supports elevated to locally critical
conditions based on past analogs. Hi-res ensembles support this idea
and show high probability for elevated conditions along the southern
CA coastal terrain as RH falls through the day via downslope effects
and diurnal warming. Spread in the magnitude of the pressure
gradient, along with weak upper-level wind support, yield low
confidence in sufficient coverage of critical conditions to warrant
a higher risk category. However, locally critical conditions appear
likely for areas that typically see terrain-augmented winds.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
401 PM EDT Thu Oct 14 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 17 2021 - 12Z Thu Oct 21 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with troughing pushing a
cold front offshore the Eastern Seaboard, with some lake effect
rain showers behind, while another frontal system comes into the
West ahead of troughing/energy expected to track across the
central U.S. as the week progresses. Model guidance has become
more consistent with this energy separating into the southern
stream and disrupting upper ridging on either side of it. A cold
front and light to moderate precipitation should track east to
west over the western and central U.S. ahead of this feature.
Persistent amplified troughing with multiple energy centers in the
eastern Pacific may lead to precipitation coming onshore the West
Coast for the latter part of the week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

After an agreeable start to the medium range period, model
guidance signal continues to increase that the shortwave energy
coming into the West should separate to form a closed low likely
tracking through the Intermountain West and into the Plains Monday
through Wednesday. After some waffling in guidance over the past
couple of days, the consensus shows a slower track of this upper
low for the most part--in terms of the 00/06Z solutions, the 00Z
ECMWF was actually the fastest deterministic model at moving the
small closed low out into the Plains, with the UKMET/CMC/GFS runs
in better alignment. The new 12Z ECMWF has slowed down to be
closer to consensus. Ensemble member variability does show that
the timing and depth differences are not completely resolved yet,
but today's forecast for the bulk of the medium range period used
a blend of the deterministic guidance with less weighting on the
00Z ECMWF. By around midweek onward, increased weighting on the
06Z GEFS mean and 00Z EC ensemble mean, as greater differences
arise with possibly absorbing the shortwave energy back into the
northern stream. Other features of the forecast including the
trough lifting out of the eastern U.S. but forming a closed low
spinning over eastern Canada, as well as rounds of troughing
across the eastern Pacific, seem to be in fairly good agreement
and could be handled with the above blend as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system affecting the Northwest through the weekend will bring
mostly moderate precipitation to western Washington/Oregon and
northern California on Sunday. It looks increasingly likely that
there will be an axis of rain and higher elevation snow across
portions north-central portions of the West as an upper low closes
off and progresses eastward. Though confidence regarding the
strength, track, and timing of this upper low is increasing,
confidence in the details of the associated precipitation remain
lower than desired. Some of this moisture should continue across
similar latitudes of the central U.S. while some rain could
develop along the leading cold front. Flow on the eastern side of
the Pacific upper trough should bring one or more periods of rain
to central/northern parts of the West Coast Tuesday onward. On
Sunday there will be some lingering rain to the lee of the eastern
Great Lakes and over favored windward terrain in New England. The
Florida Peninsula may see an increase of rainfall toward midweek
as low level easterly flow develops.

Coverage of temperature anomalies 10F or more from normal should
be relatively low through the period, pending resolution of some
forecast details. Warm flow ahead of a front crossing the northern
tier may bring area of plus 10F or higher anomalies to locations
from Montana into the Great Lakes Sunday-Tuesday. Similar
anomalies for lows may continue into the Northeast thereafter.
Meanwhile central/north-central parts of the West may see some
highs 10-15F below normal early next week with the upper low
closing off and tracking over the region. Otherwise moderately
cool temperatures over the South and East on Sunday will quickly
moderate heading into next week, yielding near to slightly above
average highs by midweek. Clouds/moisture will keep highs modestly
below normal near the West Coast on some days.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
401 PM EDT Thu Oct 14 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 17 2021 - 12Z Thu Oct 21 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with troughing pushing a
cold front offshore the Eastern Seaboard, with some lake effect
rain showers behind, while another frontal system comes into the
West ahead of troughing/energy expected to track across the
central U.S. as the week progresses. Model guidance has become
more consistent with this energy separating into the southern
stream and disrupting upper ridging on either side of it. A cold
front and light to moderate precipitation should track east to
west over the western and central U.S. ahead of this feature.
Persistent amplified troughing with multiple energy centers in the
eastern Pacific may lead to precipitation coming onshore the West
Coast for the latter part of the week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

After an agreeable start to the medium range period, model
guidance signal continues to increase that the shortwave energy
coming into the West should separate to form a closed low likely
tracking through the Intermountain West and into the Plains Monday
through Wednesday. After some waffling in guidance over the past
couple of days, the consensus shows a slower track of this upper
low for the most part--in terms of the 00/06Z solutions, the 00Z
ECMWF was actually the fastest deterministic model at moving the
small closed low out into the Plains, with the UKMET/CMC/GFS runs
in better alignment. The new 12Z ECMWF has slowed down to be
closer to consensus. Ensemble member variability does show that
the timing and depth differences are not completely resolved yet,
but today's forecast for the bulk of the medium range period used
a blend of the deterministic guidance with less weighting on the
00Z ECMWF. By around midweek onward, increased weighting on the
06Z GEFS mean and 00Z EC ensemble mean, as greater differences
arise with possibly absorbing the shortwave energy back into the
northern stream. Other features of the forecast including the
trough lifting out of the eastern U.S. but forming a closed low
spinning over eastern Canada, as well as rounds of troughing
across the eastern Pacific, seem to be in fairly good agreement
and could be handled with the above blend as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system affecting the Northwest through the weekend will bring
mostly moderate precipitation to western Washington/Oregon and
northern California on Sunday. It looks increasingly likely that
there will be an axis of rain and higher elevation snow across
portions north-central portions of the West as an upper low closes
off and progresses eastward. Though confidence regarding the
strength, track, and timing of this upper low is increasing,
confidence in the details of the associated precipitation remain
lower than desired. Some of this moisture should continue across
similar latitudes of the central U.S. while some rain could
develop along the leading cold front. Flow on the eastern side of
the Pacific upper trough should bring one or more periods of rain
to central/northern parts of the West Coast Tuesday onward. On
Sunday there will be some lingering rain to the lee of the eastern
Great Lakes and over favored windward terrain in New England. The
Florida Peninsula may see an increase of rainfall toward midweek
as low level easterly flow develops.

Coverage of temperature anomalies 10F or more from normal should
be relatively low through the period, pending resolution of some
forecast details. Warm flow ahead of a front crossing the northern
tier may bring area of plus 10F or higher anomalies to locations
from Montana into the Great Lakes Sunday-Tuesday. Similar
anomalies for lows may continue into the Northeast thereafter.
Meanwhile central/north-central parts of the West may see some
highs 10-15F below normal early next week with the upper low
closing off and tracking over the region. Otherwise moderately
cool temperatures over the South and East on Sunday will quickly
moderate heading into next week, yielding near to slightly above
average highs by midweek. Clouds/moisture will keep highs modestly
below normal near the West Coast on some days.

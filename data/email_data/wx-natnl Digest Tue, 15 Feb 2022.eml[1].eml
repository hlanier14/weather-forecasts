...Pacific system to bring light to moderate snowfall and cooler
temperatures to the western US through midweek...

...Elevated to critical fire weather conditions forecast
throughout the southern High Plains and parts of the Southwest...

...Strong winds expected in California, Nevada, and Arizona
overnight with the passage of a strong cold front...

...Heavy rainfall and severe weather likely for portions of the
Great Plains and Mississippi Valley on Wednesday...

The long-awaited return of active weather ended for the western US
today with the arrival of an upper-level trough and strong surface
cold front over the Pacific Northwest. This system is slated to
bring low elevation rain to the region while mixed precipitation
and moderate to heavy snow is expected at higher elevations over
both the Washington and Oregon Cascades. Following the eastward
progression of the cold front, snow will spread further inland
during the overnight hours into the Northern Rockies and
Intermountain West. Snowfall accumulations are anticipated to
remain generally light to moderate in these areas, save for the
tallest mountain ranges of the Northern Rockies. Strong winds will
accompany the gradually strengthening cold front as it passes
through the western states, generating gusts up to 65 mph in some
areas. Given the potential for these wind gusts to blow down
trees, knock out power lines, and reduce visibility by blowing
dust, a menagerie of High Wind Warnings, High Wind Watches, and
Wind Advisories have been raised over portions of California,
Nevada, and Arizona. Additionally, an influx of cooler air behind
the front will finally drop temperatures over the western US
closer to normal starting on Tuesday, providing residents of the
coastal states some relief from the recent string of record warmth.

Further east, upper-level ridging over the central US is expected
to work in tandem with high pressure at the surface over the
eastern US to create a favorable regime for the northward flow of
warm air into the Great Plains. Temperatures are forecast to
skyrocket 15 to 25 degrees above normal over the Southern High
Plains and Central Plains on Tuesday, with daily highs reaching
the 60s and 70s. These high temperatures, in combination with dry
fuels, low relative humidity values, and gusty winds, will
generate critical fire weather concerns for the Southern High
Plains as well as southern New Mexico and Arizona on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, less severe elevated fire weather concerns will extend
from western Texas to southwest Kansas. Fire Weather Watches are
currently in effect from north/west Texas through central Kansas,
while Red Flag Warnings are in effect for portions of southwest
Kansas, far eastern Kansas, and far western Missouri. The arrival
of cooler air over Arizona and western New Mexico will serve to
greatly reduce the fire weather risk in those areas on Wednesday.
However, lingering warmth over the Southern High Plains will
continue the critical risk of fire weather over the region into
Wednesday.

Elsewhere, building high pressure over the eastern US will keep
conditions relatively quiet east of the Plains for the next 36
hours. On and off lake effect snow showers driven by surface
instability and a passing Canadian cold front may produce light
snow accumulations over areas adjacent to the Great Lakes through
Tuesday night. Furthermore, daily highs should remain near or
above normal for the eastern half of the country through Wednesday
with the exception of the Northeast, which will experience
temperatures 10 to 15 degrees below normal on Tuesday. The
tranquility is forecast to come to an abrupt end on Wednesday with
the development of heavy rain and severe weather along and ahead
of the aforementioned cold front as it passes through the
Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley.
According to the Storm Prediction Center the highest potential for
supercell and hail-generating thunderstorms lies in a Slight Risk
area encompassing northeast Texas, southeast Oklahoma, southwest
Arkansas, and northeast Louisiana. Much of the moderate to heavy
rainfall associated with this system is forecast to occur over a
long southwest-northeast oriented swath just to the north of the
severe weather threat. With accumulations of 1 to 2+ inches in 24
hours expected over some areas, the Weather Prediction Center has
issued a Marginal Risk for Excessive rainfall from eastern
Oklahoma to southwest Illinois effective Wednesday morning.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 14 2022

SYNOPSIS: A strong storm system moving from the Plains northeastward is
favored
during the first half of the period to increase the potential for a  variet=
y
of
hazards over the contiguous 48 states. As the system pulls Gulf moisture
northward, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is identified for parts of =
the
southeastern Great Plains and areas near the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tenness=
ee
Rivers' confluence. In the wake of this system, cold air will be pulled
southward into the Four Corners Region and adjacent areas, creating a sligh=
t
risk for much below normal temperatures there. Strong winds will also follo=
w
in
the storms' wake, creating a slight risk for strong winds in the southern H=
igh
Plains and adjacent areas. Increased  snowfall is favored on the north and
west
side of the storm track from parts of the Four Corners Region northeastward
into the northern Great Plains, Upper Midwest, middle Mississippi Valley,
and/or Great Lakes Region, but the intensity and location of any snow is no=
t
clear enough to warrant a hazards risk at this time. The mid-level pattern =
is
expected to deamplify after the storm moves out of the country, so no hazar=
ds
are expected past day 10 (Feb 25).

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Four Corners
Region and adjacent areas, Wed-Thu, Feb 23-24.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the southeastern Great Plai=
ns,
and portions of the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Tue-Thu, Feb 2=
2-
24.

Slight risk of high winds in parts of the Southwest, Tue-Thu Feb 22-24.

FOR TUESDAY FEBRUARY 22 - MONDAY FEBRUARY 28: For week-2, all hazards are
associated with a strong storm system moving from the southern Plains
northeastward for the first half of the period. Some aspects of the storm
system seem more likely than others, so hazards are posted for areas that s=
eem
most likely to experience extreme conditions. At the start of the period, b=
oth
the GEFS and the ECMWF reforecast tools, along with the operational 0z
European
and 12z GFS models favor strong winds into the southern High Plains and
adjacent Rockies in the wake of the storm system established over the south=
ern
Great Plains. In addition, reforecast guidance indicates   increased chance=
s
(20 to 30 percent) for much below normal temperatures to much of the same
region westward into parts of southeastern California. These areas have a 2=
0
to
30 percent chance of temperatures below the 85 percentile threshold, and
freezing temperatures have similar chances all the way to southern New Mexi=
co
and the western Rio Grande River.



Farther east, the advancing storm system will likely pull Gulf moisture int=
o
part of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Mississippi River Valleys and the adjacent
southeastern Great Plains. Both the European ensemble and GEFS reforecast
tools
depict a 20 to 30 percent chance of precipitation exceeding the 85th
percentile
 to this region, and similar chances for precipitation exceeding an inch in
the
southern and eastern parts of the region. To the west, the European ensembl=
e
reforecast tool is bullish on heavy precipitation in parts of the south-
central
Great Plains, with chances that precipitation will exceed hazards threshold=

...Mid-late week system to bring potential for heavy rain and
severe weather from the south-central to eastern U.S. and wintry
weather from the Midwest through Great Lakes and interior
Northeast...

...Overview...

Northern and southern stream upper-level troughs will be in the
process of phasing in the central U.S. as the medium range period
begins Thursday, which will shift eastward through the end of the
week. At the surface, low pressure is forecast to strengthen as it
tracks quickly northeast and the associated strong cold front will
push ahead of the trough axis, drawing moisture northward from the
Gulf of Mexico and producing notable precipitation across the
eastern third of the U.S. on Thursday. Expect rain and
thunderstorms in southern areas, including the possibility of
flash flooding and severe weather, while snow and wintry weather
are likely on the northern and western side of the precipitation
shield across the Middle Mississippi Valley and Midwest, Great
Lakes, and possibly the interior Northeast. There is still
uncertainty in the precise axis of meaningful snow though. By
Friday-Saturday expect a clipper system tracking near the Canadian
border to bring a cold front into the northern tier and some snow
into the Great Lakes, while a weakening ridge making its way into
the West Coast will be overcome by additional troughing entering
the West early next week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The overall pattern shows fairly good agreement to start the
period Thursday-Friday. Model guidance seems to have come to a
"happy medium" midpoint solution with the timing and track of the
trough and surface low/front and thus the precipitation
shield--faster and initially weaker than what was forecast a few
days ago but trending slightly stronger and slower over the past
day or so. Good continuity remains that the surface low will
intensify quickly as it tracks northeast Thursday into Friday.
After a few days of the CMC being out of tolerance with other
solutions, the 12Z run seemed more in line especially later in the
period as well as with its upper pattern. The early part of the
medium range WPC forecast was based on a composite of the 00Z/06Z
GFS and 00Z ECMWF and UKMET runs, with only modest nudges from
continuity.

Upstream of the initial trough, considerable vorticity/energy
drops into central Canada and shifts toward the Great Lakes for
the end of the week, and recent models show better than average
agreement with the associated surface low/clipper track and
strength through early Saturday, until some differences arise with
the exact amplitude of the resulting upper trough and thus
variability with the trailing front into the East. A more
uncertain feature is a compact shortwave rounding the ridge in the
eastern Pacific that could enter the Pacific Northwest around
Friday night and move eastward, but with differences in the timing
and placement, which may not be resolved for a while given the
small scale of this feature. The larger scale trough making its
way toward the West early next week demonstrates notable
differences as energy spills in from the low predictability high
latitudes. GFS runs have been on the stronger and slower side with
the trough, but the 00z and 12z runs are somewhat slow compared to
consensus as well. The ECMWF runs have been fairly stable in the
middle so far, while the CMC has been slightly faster. Thus for
the latter part of the forecast period, the WPC forecast favored
the ECMWF in terms of the deterministic models, and gradually
phased in some of the more agreeable GEFS, CMCE and EC ensemble
means to about half by the end of the period to temper individual
model differences.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

On Thursday, showers and thunderstorms will be widespread from the
Lower Mississippi Valley north and eastward across the
Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, Appalachians, and Eastern Seaboard as a
surface low/frontal system advects substantial moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico northward. Strong storms are possible, with the
Storm Prediction Center outlook showing some severe threat for the
Mid-South. There could also be flash flooding concerns where heavy
rainfall occurs in similar regions and spreading toward much of
the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday and Thursday night. Current
forecasts show the Southern Appalachians could see particularly
high rainfall totals given terrain enhancement there. Continue to
monitor forecasts as uncertain details of these potential threats
become better refined. At the same time, expect a band of snow in
the colder air on the northwestern periphery of the system. The
best potential for meaningful accumulations on Thursday into
Thursday night currently extends from the Middle Mississippi
Valley into the Midwest/Great Lakes region and interior New
England, while mixed precipitation/ice cannot be ruled out in the
transition zone between the snow and rain. Totals/location of the
snow axis will be very sensitive to precise strength and track of
the system given that wintry weather could be within a fairly
narrow band. Gusty winds are possible with the system as well, and
at this point appear most likely near the Northeast coast on
Thursday night/Friday morning in strong southerly flow ahead of
the quickly strengthening surface low.

Dry conditions should prevail over much of the lower 48 behind
this system, with a few exceptions. The clipper system along the
Canadian border may bring some snow into the Great Lakes region by
Friday and Saturday. Meanwhile, some rain showers could persist in
Florida with lingering moisture there, but rainfall amounts remain
uncertain. Light precipitation could also make its way into the
Northwest by Friday, with amounts increasing to locally moderate
and spreading south and eastward across the West over the weekend
as the upper trough comes in.

Ahead of the cold front pushing across the eastern U.S. late in
the workweek, warmer than average temperatures by 10-25F will be
widespread across the eastern third of the U.S. on Thursday, and
daily records could be set for some locations, especially for warm
lows, while a few record high maxima could be challenged as well.
On the backside of the front, temperatures should flip to near or
below average, with some 10-20F below average readings possible
over parts of the central/east-central U.S. on Thursday and then
moderating closer to the East Coast Friday and Saturday. Coldest
anomalies should be over/near Minnesota around Thursday with some
places 20-30F below normal. An increasing portion of the West and
eventually the northern/central Plains should warm up to above
average once again by the end of the week into the weekend. Parts
of the Great Basin and vicinity could see highs at least 10F above
normal, while central parts of the Plains could even reach 20F
above average with temperatures in the 60s by Sunday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon February 14 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 20 - 24 2022

Today's models are in good agreement on an amplified large-scale 500-hPa
pattern across the forecast domain. During the period, an amplified mean ri=
dge
is predicted to remain fairly stationary over the Northeast Pacific.
Downstream, a mean trough is forecast over much of the western CONUS. Ridgi=
ng
is predicted to strengthen over the Eastern U.S. during the period. Today's
manual 500-hPa blend features large positive height anomalies over the
Northeast Pacific and Alaska, negative height anomalies across the western
half
of the CONUS, and large positive height anomalies over the eastern half of =
the
U.S.

There are enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures across much o=
f
the western half of the CONUS beneath amplified troughing. Probabilities of
below normal temperatures are largest over parts of the Southwest, where a
deep
trough this far south is relatively rare. Today's models have transitioned
very
quickly to a more amplified trough over the west, relative to yesterday,
leading to a significant change from near to above normal temperatures over
much of California and Arizona to near to below normal temperatures across =
the
west. For most of the eastern half of the U.S., above normal temperatures a=
re
highly favored underneath large positive height anomalies. Southerly onshor=
e
flow predicted for the Aleutians, southern coastal Mainland Alaska, and muc=
h
of
the Panhandle favors above normal temperatures in those areas. Near to belo=
w
temperatures are favored farther north where colder surface high pressure a=
nd
northerly winds are forecast.

Downstream of the ridge over the Northeast Pacific, near to below normal
precipitation is favored along the west coast of the CONUS. An embedded
shortwave predicted to form within the trough over parts of the West increa=
ses
the chances of above normal precipitation for much of the interior West. An
amplified storm system is forecast to develop in the Plains and track east
across the country, enhancing the likelihood of above normal precipitation =
for
most of the eastern half of the U.S., except across and near the Florida
Peninsula as the strong Southeast ridge is expected to keep the front north=
 of
the Peninsula. A strong low-level flow and several possible storm systems
tracking around a mean surface low west of Mainland Alaska favors above nor=
mal
precipitation for the southern two thirds of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Near average, 3 out of 5, due =
to
very good agreement between today's model forecasts and tools, offset by a
significant change in temperature and precipitation tools over parts of the
western CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 22 - 28 2022

The week-2 forecast pattern remains largely unchanged from the 6-10 day
period.
Amplified ridges are still predicted across the Northeast Pacific and Alask=
a,
and over much of the eastern U.S. Model agreement is very good, particularl=
y
for the week-2 period, resulting in forecast temperature and precipitation
probabilities remaining fairly large across much of the forecast domain.

A trough is forecast to persist across much of the western half of the CONU=
S,
increasing the likelihood of below normal temperatures for most of the West=
.
Probabilities are highest for southern California, Nevada, and parts of the
Four Corners region where troughing is forecast unusually far south. Above
normal temperatures are still highly favored across most of the eastern hal=
f
of
the country beneath large positive height anomalies. A predicted increase i=
n
southerly low-level flow over Alaska favors above normal temperatures for m=
ost
of the state.

The precipitation probability forecast during week-2 is very similar to the
6-10 day period, as the large-scale pattern is likely to remain fairly
consistent. Additionally,  the storm systems responsible for increasing the
likelihood of above-normal precipitation across much of the CONUS during th=
e
6-10 day period are forecast to persist into week-2, leading to a continuat=
ion
of the large coverage of enhanced above normal precipitation chances across
much of the forecast domain.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 60% of Today's
operational 0z GFS centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z European Ensem=
ble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
very good agreement between models and tools, as well as a stable, amplifie=
d
pattern that persists from the 6-10 day period to week-2, offset by the
significant change in tools from yesterday's 6-10 day period to today.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

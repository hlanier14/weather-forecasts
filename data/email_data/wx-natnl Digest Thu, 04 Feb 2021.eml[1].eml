Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0923 AM CST Wed Feb 03 2021

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

Only minor changes are needed for both risk areas based on observed
trends this morning and recent hi-res guidance. In general, the
forecast outlined below remains on track.

..Moore.. 02/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CST Wed Feb 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
The gradient between surface high pressure across the Ohio
Valley/Deep South and a low centered over southeastern Canada will
allow for a dry, north/northwesterly flow across a broad part of the
southeastern CONUS.  The gradient between this high and lee
troughing across the High Plains will also allow for breezy and dry
conditions across portions of New Mexico and west Texas.  Very late
in the forecast period, offshore flow will begin across coastal
ranges of Southern California in response to high pressure
developing over Oregon.  Fuels in this area are largely
unsusceptible to fires, however.

...Central/south Florida...
Recent model guidance has trended drier and a bit breezier compared
to prior runs.  Areas of 10-15 mph surface winds will develop by
midday and persist through sunset across much of the area.
Meanwhile, 60s F surface temperatures will allow for RH values to
fall into the 25-35% range during peak heating hours.  Fuels are dry
and ERCs relatively high.  Thus, an elevated fire-weather
delineation has been maintained for this outlook.

...Southeastern New Mexico and a small part of west Texas...
Surface troughing and terrain-related enhancement of surface winds
will allow for areas of 15-20 mph wind speeds to develop through
peak heating hours.  RH values should also fall into the 12-20%
range during the afternoon in tandem with surface temperatures
nearing 80F.  Although ERCs are not particularly high for this time
of year, an elevated risk for wildland fires will exist where fuels
(especially finer fuels) are dry.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1221 PM CST Wed Feb 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

Only minor changes are needed for the ongoing elevated risk area
based on recent trends in hi-res guidance. Some uncertainty remains
regarding the timing of the cold frontal passage and the duration of
the fire weather threat. However, guidance continues to show at
least a few hours of warm, dry, and windy conditions ahead of the
front on the lee side of the higher terrain of southeast NM and for
much of the Trans Pecos region of southwest TX.

..Moore.. 02/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1253 AM CST Wed Feb 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
Surface cyclogenesis will occur across the central Plains in the
first half of the forecast period (D2/Thu).  This low will migrate
northeastward toward the western Great Lakes while sending a cold
front southward across Texas.  Modest warm/moist advection will
occur across the Lower Mississippi Valley, though much of Florida
will remain dry under the influence of another high pressure area
centered over the Gulf Stream.  Lastly, offshore flow will occur in
coastal ranges of southern California, though recent rainfall should
mitigate any larger-scale fire-weather concerns.

...Southeastern New Mexico toward the Big Bend area of Texas...
A belt of breezy to windy conditions will exist ahead of the
southward-moving front across Texas and eastern New Mexico
throughout the day.  Although the speed/timing of the front is in
question, the expectation is that areas from Lubbock to San Angelo
should reside south of the front for much of the afternoon.  15-25
mph surface winds are expected along and south of the front, with
shifting winds expected within the frontal zone.  RH values will
fall into the 12-25% range as well.  Where fuels are dry, an
elevated fire-weather threat will exist.

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to agree upon broad mean troughing
aloft across the lower 48, to the south of a deep/elongated upper
low likely positioned between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay over
multiple days--in turn forced by an upper ridge that builds from
Baffin Bay into northern Canada. This pattern will support
persistence of Arctic air to the east of the Rockies and a gradual
southward/eastward expansion of much below normal temperatures
with time. Confidence is somewhat lower for embedded details that
will affect precipitation coverage/amounts/type over some regions.
For example, Eastern Pacific mean ridging should be weak enough to
allow one or more impulses through but there is a lot of spread
for shortwave/precip specifics over the West. Pacific shortwave
uncertainties will combine with question marks over the details of
northern stream flow to lower confidence further for precise
coverage of moisture over the eastern half of the country.

Over recent days there had been a signal for potential East Coast
development around Sun-Mon, involving a wave along the
southeastern coast and an approaching wave/front. However recent
trends have been toward a farther offshore track in response to
flow aloft becoming broader and less amplified. Through 00Z/06Z
cycles there was still a broad range with the UKMET on the western
side of the spread and the CMC on the eastern side, with an
intermediate solution favored. New 12Z runs add more support for
the recent offshore trend. Then there are indications that another
front with embedded waviness may evolve over parts of the
southern/eastern U.S. This part of the forecast will depend on
specifics of northern stream troughing/southern Canada upper low
position and orientation.  Models have not yet stabilized on this
aspect of the forecast, favoring a conservative approach to its
depiction for the time being. Farther west, a model/mean blend
approach appears best for resolving low confidence aspects of
shortwave energy filtering through the East Pacific ridge (with
fairly wide ensemble spread). In particular the 00Z/06Z GFS runs
and the 00Z CMC could be overdone with the depth of their
features, with the new 12Z runs looking more reasonable.

The desire to reflect the most agreeable aspects of guidance while
yielding an intermediate or less-defined solution where conflict
existed led to a mostly operational model emphasis during the
first half of the period (somewhat more 00Z ECMWF/00Z-06Z GFS
relative to the UKMET/CMC, along with modest input of the 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means) followed by a trend toward 40-50 percent
ensemble weight. Late in the forecast the GFS/ECMWF runs offset to
maintain the desired mean-like flow over the eastern Pacific.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Cold cyclonic flow on the south side of energetic low pressure
reaching eastern Canada on Saturday will promote lingering
enhanced snows, including lake effect, along with blustery/windy
conditions. Meanwhile upstream, expect upslope snows over the
northern Rockies as shortwaves cross over the region and a potent
Arctic blast surges southward. This energy and subsequent systems
will dive into an amplified central U.S. upper trough position
this weekend into next week and produce periodic snow swaths in
the reinforced Arctic air. A lingering lead front over the
Southeast/Florida should focus weekend showers/thunderstorms. A
Southeast coast wave developing along the front should lift
northeastward Sunday/Monday with precipitation extending to the
northwest of the wave. Recent trends for a more offshore track are
lowering the snow/ice threat across Mid-Atlantic and Northeast,
but a fairly broad model/ensemble spread up to this point (related
to uncertainty over phasing of this wave and mid/upper level
energy) and the lingering possibility of a trend reversal at some
point require continued monitoring of this feature. Impulses
running through the base of the upper trough early-mid next week
offer potential for swaths of overrunning precipitation including
a snow/ice threat deeper into the cold post-frontal airmass over
much of the south-central states and Southeast where modest
amounts have an enhanced impact. Areas to the west of the Rockies
should see fairly light and scattered precipitation, with
uncertainty in specifics due to low confidence for details of one
or more weak supporting shortwaves.

To start the weekend expect the core of coldest air to extend from
the northern half of the Plains into the Midwest and western Great
Lakes with readings generally 15-30F below normal. Through the
rest of the weekend and into next week expect this core of most
extreme anomalies to persist while the cold air also pushes
farther south and east--bringing temperatures down to 10-20F below
normal over areas from the southern Plains through Ohio Valley and
Great Lakes/Northeast.

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to agree upon broad mean troughing
aloft across the lower 48, to the south of a deep/elongated upper
low likely positioned between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay over
multiple days--in turn forced by an upper ridge that builds from
Baffin Bay into northern Canada. This pattern will support
persistence of Arctic air to the east of the Rockies and a gradual
southward/eastward expansion of much below normal temperatures
with time. Confidence is somewhat lower for embedded details that
will affect precipitation coverage/amounts/type over some regions.
For example, Eastern Pacific mean ridging should be weak enough to
allow one or more impulses through but there is a lot of spread
for shortwave/precip specifics over the West. Pacific shortwave
uncertainties will combine with question marks over the details of
northern stream flow to lower confidence further for precise
coverage of moisture over the eastern half of the country.

Over recent days there had been a signal for potential East Coast
development around Sun-Mon, involving a wave along the
southeastern coast and an approaching wave/front. However recent
trends have been toward a farther offshore track in response to
flow aloft becoming broader and less amplified. Through 00Z/06Z
cycles there was still a broad range with the UKMET on the western
side of the spread and the CMC on the eastern side, with an
intermediate solution favored. New 12Z runs add more support for
the recent offshore trend. Then there are indications that another
front with embedded waviness may evolve over parts of the
southern/eastern U.S. This part of the forecast will depend on
specifics of northern stream troughing/southern Canada upper low
position and orientation.  Models have not yet stabilized on this

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 031941
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 03 2021

SYNOPSIS: The main concern for hazards continues to be widespread, increased
risk for much below normal temperatures across many parts of the country.
There
is relatively good model agreement indicating the mean week-2 pattern being
dominated by mid-level low pressure across the eastern two-thirds of the lower
48 states, supporting surface high pressure extending south from the Arctic
Ocean and Canada allowing cold Arctic air to spill southward into widespread
areas of the Contiguous U.S. during the period. The models indicate a shift
from mid-level low pressure to mid-level high pressure across many parts of
mainland Alaska, resulting in lower chances for widespread much below normal
temperatures compared to the last few days for the state.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the Upper and
Middle Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and eastern portions of
the Northern Plains, Thu-Fri, Feb 11-12.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for many areas of the CONUS
east of the Rockies, excluding New England, Thu-Sat, Feb 11-13.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for many parts of the eastern
and
central CONUS and Northwest, Thu-Wed, Feb 11-17.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across the northern half of
mainland Alaska, Thu-Fri, Feb 11-12.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 06 - WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 10:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!sdScj3Zcg7g_CrUTBLKHljpk8owo_jbNuHxIFrhJDVNjzer9b-r18HtWcaI4cJU08-YEr9YH$

FOR THURSDAY FEBRUARY 11 - WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 17: An increased risk for
widespread much below normal temperatures across the U.S. during week-2
continues to be the main hazards concern. This anomalous cold pattern prolongs
the anticipated preceding anomalous cold pattern as denoted by the Weather
Prediction Center's 3-7 day hazards outlook. A series of mid-level troughs are
forecast to propagate across the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS throughout
week-2. This pattern supports strong surface high pressure sinking southward
from the Arctic and Canada, bringing anomalously cold temperatures into many
parts of the CONUS (excluding the Southwest). A broad area of slight risk
(>20%) is maintained from previous outlooks for much below normal temperatures
throughout week-2 for many parts of the Northwest, central, and eastern CONUS.
The areas of moderate and high risk have been expanded today. Moderate risk is
highlighted for much of the CONUS east of the Rockies, Feb 11 to 13, while
high
risk is designated for parts of the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Ohio
Valley, Great Lakes, and eastern portions of the Northern Plains, Feb 11 to
12.
Both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools show a greater potential for many of
the risk areas potentially experiencing temperatures falling to the lowest 5th
percentile and lowest 2nd percentile, locally. The Northern Plains, Midwest,
and Northeast could have minimum temperatures falling below zero (Deg F),
while
temperatures across the southern CONUS could fall to sub-freezing which would
be some of the coldest temperatures observed this season.



The GEFS ensemble forecasts indicates the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index
dropping to significantly negative values at the beginning and middle of
week-2, followed by an increase towards a more neutral phase by the end of the
period. The GEFS and ECMWF model ensemble means indicate a transition to
mid-level ridging across the eastern half of the CONUS, with troughing over
West-Central CONUS toward the end of week-2. This pattern shift as well as
forecast increasing AO values would favor decreasing chances for widespread
much below normal temperatures over time.



In general, the ECMWF, GEFS, and CMCE ensemble means indicate mid-level
ridging
over parts of mainland Alaska, with some possibility of troughing across
northern mainland Alaska. This is a change from the previous days where
troughing was more dominant, resulting in limiting the potential for more
widespread cold arctic air impacting the state for a prolonged period of time.
There is more model disparity today compared to previous days regarding the
week-2 synoptic pattern. Additionally, the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools and
other week-2 guidance tools show a weaker signal for anomalous cold.
Therefore,
the moderate risk for much below normal temperatures has been removed, and a
slight risk is maintained for the northern half of mainland Alaska north of
the
Alaska Range, Feb 11 to 12, where the reforecast tools indicate >20% chance of
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and -40 Deg F.



The 6Z and 12Z deterministic GFS shows some potential for surface low pressure
forming over the Great Lakes at the beginning of the period, which could
support lake effect snow for parts of the Great Lakes region. Anticipated
anomalously cold temperatures, however, would likely minimize the potential
for
widespread heavy lake effect snow due to the limitation on synoptic moisture.
The greatest likelihood for greater snow accumulations would likely be for the
eastern lakes and surrounding areas, downstream of Lake Michigan and Superior
which could contribute more moisture to the atmosphere. Due to the expectation
that possible heavy lake effect snow would be highly localized, a related snow
hazard is not posted at this time.

...Heavy snow for the U.P. of Michigan on Thursday into Friday...

...Snow for the Cascades and the Northern/Central Rockies through
Friday...

...Areas of rain/freezing rain from the Upper Midwest to the Lower
Great Lakes/northern Mid-Atlantic through Friday...

Snow tapered off this morning across New England as the Nor'easter
tracked trough the Canadian Maritimes- this system will continue
its track through the end of the week. A frontal boundary stalled
along the Rockies will keep snow possible across parts of the
Northwest, Intermountain West and near the Northern and Central
Rockies over the next few days.

A vast portion of the Northern Plains to the Upper Mississippi
Valley will have scattered to widespread snow, possibly heavy at
times, along with some areas of freezing rain/sleet  as a
developing low pressure system tracks through the central U.S.
Cold Canadian air will plunge into the region and cause a
significant drop in daily temperatures for nearly half of the
country. Winter Storm Watches, Winter Weather Advisories and
Blizzard warnings are in effect from Nebraska to Upper Michigan
with this system. Along the trailing front over the Central and
Plains rain is expected. Although heavy rainfall is now expected
at this time, several locations could see accumulations of 0.50 to
2 inches by the weekend. Pockets of rain/freezing rain will also
develop over parts of the Lower Great Lakes/northern Mid-Atlantic
overnight Thursday into Friday morning with rain approaching the
Southeast.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Wed February 03 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 09 - 13 2021

Today's models are in good agreement on an amplified 500-hPa pattern across
the
forecast domain. An amplified ridge is forecast over the North Pacific, while
a
downstream trough is expected to persist over much of the CONUS. Much above
normal heights are expected across Greenland and much of northern Canada, with
mean positive height anomalies exceeding 330 meters over northern Baffin
Island.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored for the western Aleutians,
underneath anomalous ridging. Below normal temperatures are forecast for the
remainder of Alaska due to near surface easterly flow from western Canada, and
also underneath below normal 500-hPa heights predicted over parts of the
state.
Probabilities of below normal temperatures are enhanced for much of the CONUS
underneath the forecast below normal heights and consistent with dynamical
forecast tools. The highest chances of below normal temperatures (exceeding
90%) exist over parts of the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valleys.

Below normal precipitation is favored for parts of southern Alaska underneath
forecast near to above normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal precipitation is
likely for parts of east-central Mainland Alaska consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. Downstream of the large-amplitude ridge off the
West Coast of the CONUS, relatively dry conditions favor increased below
normal
precipitation chances for most of the western CONUS. One or more shortwaves
are
expected to intensify and travel through the central CONUS, moving eastward
and
spreading precipitation across parts of the Great Plains eastward to the
Southeast. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the
Upper
and Middle Mississippi Valley y, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and Northeast,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
very good model agreement on a large-amplitude pattern over the domain and
relatively good agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 11 - 17 2021

During the week-2 period, a strong ridge is forecast to remain over the
northeastern Pacific, with the northern extension of the ridge moving west to
extend over the Bering Sea. Downstream, a persistent mean trough is forecast
over much of the CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are favored for much of Alaska due to forecast
low-level easterly flow from western Canada, and also consistent with
dynamical
forecast tools. Predicted large scale troughing leads to enhanced
probabilities
of below normal temperatures for much of the CONUS, except parts of the
Southwest, where near to above normal temperatures are favored, consistent
with
the Consolidation forecast tool.

Troughing forecast over the Bering Sea area favors above normal precipitation
for southeastern Mainland Alaska. Below normal precipitation is likely for
parts of northwestern Alaska underneath forecast above normal heights. Below
normal precipitation is favored for much of the West Coast and parts of the
southwest, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Arctic surface
high
pressure is forecast to progress south from Canada, increasing the potential
for upslope flow and associated above normal precipitation across parts of the
Northern and Central Plains. Above normal precipitation is also likely for
parts of the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley due to return
moisture flow from the Gulf of Mexico. Below normal precipitation is favored
for parts of the Southeast and parts of the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Above normal
precipitation is likely for parts of the southern Florida Peninsula consistent
with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement on the large-scale patterns, offset by model disagreements
among
the temperature and precipitation forecasts.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to agree upon broad mean troughing
aloft across the lower 48, to the south of a deep/elongated upper
low likely positioned between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay over
multiple days--in turn forced by an upper ridge that builds from
Baffin Bay into northern Canada. This pattern will support
persistence of Arctic air to the east of the Rockies and a gradual
southward/eastward expansion of much below normal temperatures
with time. Confidence is somewhat lower for embedded details that
will affect precipitation coverage/amounts/type over some regions.
For example, Eastern Pacific mean ridging should be weak enough to
allow one or more impulses through but there is a lot of spread
for shortwave/precip specifics over the West. Pacific shortwave
uncertainties will combine with question marks over the details of
northern stream flow to lower confidence further for precise
coverage of moisture over the eastern half of the country.

Over recent days there had been a signal for potential East Coast
development around Sun-Mon, involving a wave along the
southeastern coast and an approaching wave/front. However recent
trends have been toward a farther offshore track in response to
flow aloft becoming broader and less amplified. Through 00Z/06Z
cycles there was still a broad range with the UKMET on the western
side of the spread and the CMC on the eastern side, with an
intermediate solution favored. New 12Z runs add more support for
the recent offshore trend. Then there are indications that another
front with embedded waviness may evolve over parts of the
southern/eastern U.S. This part of the forecast will depend on
specifics of northern stream troughing/southern Canada upper low
position and orientation.  Models have not yet stabilized on this
aspect of the forecast, favoring a conservative approach to its
depiction for the time being. Farther west, a model/mean blend
approach appears best for resolving low confidence aspects of
shortwave energy filtering through the East Pacific ridge (with
fairly wide ensemble spread). In particular the 00Z/06Z GFS runs
and the 00Z CMC could be overdone with the depth of their
features, with the new 12Z runs looking more reasonable.

The desire to reflect the most agreeable aspects of guidance while
yielding an intermediate or less-defined solution where conflict
existed led to a mostly operational model emphasis during the
first half of the period (somewhat more 00Z ECMWF/00Z-06Z GFS
relative to the UKMET/CMC, along with modest input of the 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means) followed by a trend toward 40-50 percent
ensemble weight. Late in the forecast the GFS/ECMWF runs offset to
maintain the desired mean-like flow over the eastern Pacific.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Cold cyclonic flow on the south side of energetic low pressure
reaching eastern Canada on Saturday will promote lingering
enhanced snows, including lake effect, along with blustery/windy
conditions. Meanwhile upstream, expect upslope snows over the
northern Rockies as shortwaves cross over the region and a potent
Arctic blast surges southward. This energy and subsequent systems
will dive into an amplified central U.S. upper trough position
this weekend into next week and produce periodic snow swaths in
the reinforced Arctic air. A lingering lead front over the
Southeast/Florida should focus weekend showers/thunderstorms. A
Southeast coast wave developing along the front should lift
northeastward Sunday/Monday with precipitation extending to the
northwest of the wave. Recent trends for a more offshore track are
lowering the snow/ice threat across Mid-Atlantic and Northeast,
but a fairly broad model/ensemble spread up to this point (related
to uncertainty over phasing of this wave and mid/upper level
energy) and the lingering possibility of a trend reversal at some
point require continued monitoring of this feature. Impulses
running through the base of the upper trough early-mid next week
offer potential for swaths of overrunning precipitation including
a snow/ice threat deeper into the cold post-frontal airmass over
much of the south-central states and Southeast where modest
amounts have an enhanced impact. Areas to the west of the Rockies
should see fairly light and scattered precipitation, with
uncertainty in specifics due to low confidence for details of one
or more weak supporting shortwaves.

To start the weekend expect the core of coldest air to extend from
the northern half of the Plains into the Midwest and western Great
Lakes with readings generally 15-30F below normal. Through the
rest of the weekend and into next week expect this core of most
extreme anomalies to persist while the cold air also pushes
farther south and east--bringing temperatures down to 10-20F below
normal over areas from the southern Plains through Ohio Valley and
Great Lakes/Northeast.

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to agree upon broad mean troughing
aloft across the lower 48, to the south of a deep/elongated upper
low likely positioned between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay over
multiple days--in turn forced by an upper ridge that builds from
Baffin Bay into northern Canada. This pattern will support
persistence of Arctic air to the east of the Rockies and a gradual
southward/eastward expansion of much below normal temperatures
with time. Confidence is somewhat lower for embedded details that
will affect precipitation coverage/amounts/type over some regions.
For example, Eastern Pacific mean ridging should be weak enough to
allow one or more impulses through but there is a lot of spread
for shortwave/precip specifics over the West. Pacific shortwave
uncertainties will combine with question marks over the details of
northern stream flow to lower confidence further for precise
coverage of moisture over the eastern half of the country.

Over recent days there had been a signal for potential East Coast
development around Sun-Mon, involving a wave along the
southeastern coast and an approaching wave/front. However recent
trends have been toward a farther offshore track in response to
flow aloft becoming broader and less amplified. Through 00Z/06Z
cycles there was still a broad range with the UKMET on the western
side of the spread and the CMC on the eastern side, with an
intermediate solution favored. New 12Z runs add more support for
the recent offshore trend. Then there are indications that another
front with embedded waviness may evolve over parts of the
southern/eastern U.S. This part of the forecast will depend on
specifics of northern stream troughing/southern Canada upper low
position and orientation.  Models have not yet stabilized on this
aspect of the forecast, favoring a conservative approach to its
depiction for the time being. Farther west, a model/mean blend
approach appears best for resolving low confidence aspects of
shortwave energy filtering through the East Pacific ridge (with
fairly wide ensemble spread). In particular the 00Z/06Z GFS runs
and the 00Z CMC could be overdone with the depth of their
features, with the new 12Z runs looking more reasonable.

The desire to reflect the most agreeable aspects of guidance while
yielding an intermediate or less-defined solution where conflict
existed led to a mostly operational model emphasis during the
first half of the period (somewhat more 00Z ECMWF/00Z-06Z GFS
relative to the UKMET/CMC, along with modest input of the 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means) followed by a trend toward 40-50 percent
ensemble weight. Late in the forecast the GFS/ECMWF runs offset to
maintain the desired mean-like flow over the eastern Pacific.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Cold cyclonic flow on the south side of energetic low pressure
reaching eastern Canada on Saturday will promote lingering
enhanced snows, including lake effect, along with blustery/windy
conditions. Meanwhile upstream, expect upslope snows over the
northern Rockies as shortwaves cross over the region and a potent
Arctic blast surges southward. This energy and subsequent systems
will dive into an amplified central U.S. upper trough position
this weekend into next week and produce periodic snow swaths in
the reinforced Arctic air. A lingering lead front over the
Southeast/Florida should focus weekend showers/thunderstorms. A
Southeast coast wave developing along the front should lift
northeastward Sunday/Monday with precipitation extending to the
northwest of the wave. Recent trends for a more offshore track are
lowering the snow/ice threat across Mid-Atlantic and Northeast,
but a fairly broad model/ensemble spread up to this point (related
to uncertainty over phasing of this wave and mid/upper level
energy) and the lingering possibility of a trend reversal at some
point require continued monitoring of this feature. Impulses
running through the base of the upper trough early-mid next week
offer potential for swaths of overrunning precipitation including
a snow/ice threat deeper into the cold post-frontal airmass over
much of the south-central states and Southeast where modest
amounts have an enhanced impact. Areas to the west of the Rockies
should see fairly light and scattered precipitation, with
uncertainty in specifics due to low confidence for details of one
or more weak supporting shortwaves.

To start the weekend expect the core of coldest air to extend from
the northern half of the Plains into the Midwest and western Great
Lakes with readings generally 15-30F below normal. Through the
rest of the weekend and into next week expect this core of most
extreme anomalies to persist while the cold air also pushes
farther south and east--bringing temperatures down to 10-20F below
normal over areas from the southern Plains through Ohio Valley and
Great Lakes/Northeast.

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Medium range guidance strongly supports broad mean troughing aloft
across the lower 48, to the south of a deep/elongated upper low
likely positioned between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay over
multiple days. This pattern will support persistence of Arctic
air, mainly east of the Rockies and a gradual southward/eastward
expansion of much below normal temperatures with time. Confidence
is low for local details that will affect precipitation
coverage/amounts/type due to significant embedded shortwave
uncertainties and focus within the larger scale flow.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite of reasonably well clustered mid-larger
scale guidance from the 12 UTC GFS/ECMWF/Canadian and GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models.
This blend tends to mitigate the less predictable smaller scale
features and maintained decent WPC product continuity. Latest 18
UTC and 00 UTC models and ensembles offer varied trends with these
harder to predict systems and stream interactions, lowering
forecast confidence to a degree.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Terrain/upslope snows are expected for the northern Rockies as
shortwaves cross the region and potent Arctic blasts surge
southward. These systems will dive into an amplified central U.S.
upper trough position to produce periodic, but uncertain snow
swaths in the reinforced Arctic air. The best bets may be from the
Midwest/Great Lakes to the Northeast. Well south, a lingering lead
front and secondary surges over the Southeast will pool moisture
for showers/thunderstorms through this period. A Southeast coast
wave developing along the front will lift northeastward Sunday
with precipitation extending to the northwest of the wave, but now
on a more offshore path. Impulses running through the base of the
upper trough next week offer modest moisture/precipitation, but
any swaths of overrunning snow/ice deeper into the cold
post-frontal airmass from the south-central states to the
Mid-South/TN Valley and Appalachians would be locally impactful.
These systems then offer potential up the east coast considering
how far west the main upper trough may settle. Areas to the west
of the Rockies should see fairly light and scattered
precipitation, with with uncertainty in specifics due to low
confidence for supporting shortwave details.

Expect the core of coldest air to extend from the northern half of
the Plains into the Midwest and western Great Lakes with readings
generally 15-30F below normal this weekend through next midweek.
Cold temperatures will also spread robustly far south and east,
bringing temperatures down to 10-20F below normal over areas from
the southern Plains through the TN/OH Valleys and Great Lakes.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1252 AM CST Thu Feb 04 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
Most fire-weather concerns will be concentrated across areas of
southwest Texas and southeastern New Mexico ahead of a surface front
that should extend from the Texas South Plains into the Big Country
by noon.  Ahead of this front, northwesterly surface wind
trajectories will help maintain a dry airmass supportive of fire
weather - though dry, breezy conditions will also exist north of the
front across western Oklahoma and vicinity.  Farther southeast, A
dry airmass will reside across much of Florida, although surface
winds should remain rather light over land areas.  Offshore flow
will commence across portions of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties
through much of the forecast period, though fuels should remain
unsupportive of larger-scale fire weather given recent
precipitation.

...Southeast New Mexico and southwest Texas...
The elevated area in the prior outlook is maintained for this update
despite a trend toward lighter surface wind and slightly higher RH
values.  Nevertheless, areas of 15 mph surface winds will develop
amidst 15-25% RH values during peak heating hours.  Dry finer fuels
should support a risk of fire spread despite relatively low ERCs for
this time of year.

...Western Oklahoma...
Dry northerly flow will develop during the afternoon behind the
surface cold front.  As temperatures rise into the low 50s F, RH
values will fall to around 20% in tandem with 15-25 mph surface
winds.  Again, ERCs are relatively low for this time of year, though
locally elevated fire-weather conditions will exist where dry fuels
are present.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1252 AM CST Thu Feb 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A weak surface pressure gradient will exist between a weak surface
trough centered over Nebraska and a high near the ArkLaTex D2/Friday
afternoon.  This regime will foster areas of westerly flow from
eastern New Mexico through much of Oklahoma and a small part of
western north Texas.  This flow will be strongest locally in eastern
New Mexico, although most speeds should remain around 15 mph or so.
The regime will also maintain a relatively dry airmass, with 20-30%
RH values across most of Oklahoma - slightly lower across areas of
west Texas.  The generally weak surface flow regime should allow for
only locally elevated fire-weather, though model trends will be
monitored for any stronger wind fields in later outlooks.

Elsewhere, locally elevated fire-weather conditions are expected
across portions of the TransPecos, where localized, terrain-related
surface wind enhancement will occur amidst a very dry low-level
airmass.  A dry airmass will also reside across coastal ranges of
southern California, though recent precipitation and light surface
winds should mitigate any fire-weather threat there.

...Snow for the Cascades and the Northern/Central Rockies through
Saturday...

...Areas of rain/freezing rain from the Upper Midwest to the Lower
Great
Lakes/Northern New England through Saturday...

A storm over the Upper Midwest will move eastward off the East
Coast and the Gulf of Mexico Coast by Saturday.  The system will
produce snow over the Upper Midwest on Thursday, expanding into
the Great Lakes on Thursday evening.  Rain will develop over parts
of the Middle Mississippi Valley that will expand into the Lower
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys by Thursday evening.
Additionally, rain/freezing rain will develop over parts of the
Upper Midwest into the Northeast on Thursday and Friday.  On
Friday, the snow and rain move into the Northeast.  Areas of
rain/freezing rain will move into parts of Northern New England on
Friday into Saturday.  In addition, on Friday morning, the rain
will move into the Mid-Atlantic into the Southeast and the Central
Gulf Coast.  The Rain will continue from the southern
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast to parts of the Western Gulf Coast through
Saturday.

Meanwhile, onshore flow over the Pacific Northwest will aid in
producing coastal rain and higher elevation snow over parts of the
Northwest through Saturday.  Additionally, high pressure will
slowly move southward over the Northern High Plains/Northern
Plains through Saturday.  Upslope flow associated with the high
pressure will aid in producing snow over the Northern/Central
Rockies and the Northern High Plains/Northern Plains through
Saturday.

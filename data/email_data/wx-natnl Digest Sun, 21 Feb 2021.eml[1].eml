...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous discussion remains valid with no changes. Fuels remain
unsupportive of large fire potential, but locally elevated
conditions may occur across portions of southeastern Arizona.

..Lyons.. 02/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0102 AM CST Sat Feb 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will deepen while traversing the southwest CONUS,
with an 80+ knot 500 mb jet streak expected to overspread the Lower
Colorado River Basin into the southern High Plains during the
afternoon hours. The surface mass response will be the development
of a surface cyclone which will eject into the southern High Plains
by early evening. Gradient winds, downslope flow, and downward
momentum transport of the stronger flow aloft via a dry, well-mixed
boundary layer will serve to promote widespread 20+ mph sustained
westerly winds across portions of the lower Colorado River Basin
into the southern High Plains. By afternoon peak heating, several
locales across the Southwest may also see surface RH drop into the
15-20% range. While the surface meteorological conditions are
expected to reach Elevated to potentially Critical criteria
(especially in southern Arizona and New Mexico), fuels poorly
receptive to wildfire spread mitigate the need for fire weather
highlights.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sat Feb 20 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Feb 23 2021 - 12Z Sat Feb 27 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium range period is forecast to begin Tuesday with
generally zonal upper-level flow, as a trough deamplifies across
the eastern CONUS but as troughing begins to develop in the
Northwest. The flow pattern should be relatively progressive
through the week, as the Northwest trough deepens and tracks
eastward, and then additional troughing and energy come into the
West for the latter part of the week.

Model guidance is in generally good agreement with the longwave
pattern through the medium range period. For Tuesday/Wednesday, a
deterministic model blend was able to be used with the initial
trough dropping southward and with an emerging surface low over
the south-central CONUS. Some differences arise with the depth,
position, and degree of separation from the main flow with a
shortwave making its way through the broad trough around the Four
Corners region Thursday. ECMWF runs have tended to be on the
stronger and more separated side with this shortwave, with the 00Z
UKMET fairly strong as well, and the 00Z/06Z GFS on the weaker
side, and this does have implications for the location of the
mid-upper trough axis in the East Fri. Tended a little toward the
stronger side of the guidance envelope for this feature. Then,
overall there was good clustering with ensemble guidance with
troughing across the western half of the U.S. by Friday into
Saturday. Deterministic 00Z/06Z model guidance was more
disagreeable with that trough axis and the eastern extent of the
trough, so decided to heavily utilize the 00Z ECENS/06Z GEFS means
by the end of the period to minimize those differences.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Things will be relatively uneventful across most regions of the
nation compared to the extreme winter weather that has been
endured by many locations this past week. The West could be
reasonably active in terms of precipitation, with heavy snow
possible in higher elevations of the Cascades and Rockies. Snow
could spread across the Interstate 25 corridor in Colorado as well
around midweek, but model differences remain with the extent of
lower elevation snow. By the end of the week, a corridor of light
to moderate rainfall will be possible across portions of the
south-central U.S. and extending towards the southern
Appalachians, with perhaps some snow on the northern edge of the
precipitation. There is still a good deal of model spread
regarding the placement of this QPF axis, so changes in the
forecast going forward are expected.

In the temperature department, the building trough and the passage
of the cold front across the Intermountain West will herald a
change to readings falling to 10-20 degrees below average for the
western High Plains to the Rockies, along not nearly as impressive
as the recent Arctic blast based on our current forecasts.
Temperatures will likely be 10-20 degrees above average ahead of
that same storm system across the north-central U.S. on Tuesday,
spreading to the Northeast midweek. By the end of the forecast
period next Saturday, expect temperatures to be near to slightly
below normal for most of the CONUS.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sat Feb 20 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Feb 23 2021 - 12Z Sat Feb 27 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium range period is forecast to begin Tuesday with
generally zonal upper-level flow, as a trough deamplifies across
the eastern CONUS but as troughing begins to develop in the
Northwest. The flow pattern should be relatively progressive
through the week, as the Northwest trough deepens and tracks
eastward, and then additional troughing and energy come into the
West for the latter part of the week.

Model guidance is in generally good agreement with the longwave
pattern through the medium range period. For Tuesday/Wednesday, a
deterministic model blend was able to be used with the initial
trough dropping southward and with an emerging surface low over
the south-central CONUS. Some differences arise with the depth,
position, and degree of separation from the main flow with a
shortwave making its way through the broad trough around the Four
Corners region Thursday. ECMWF runs have tended to be on the
stronger and more separated side with this shortwave, with the 00Z
UKMET fairly strong as well, and the 00Z/06Z GFS on the weaker
side, and this does have implications for the location of the
mid-upper trough axis in the East Fri. Tended a little toward the
stronger side of the guidance envelope for this feature. Then,
overall there was good clustering with ensemble guidance with
troughing across the western half of the U.S. by Friday into
Saturday. Deterministic 00Z/06Z model guidance was more
disagreeable with that trough axis and the eastern extent of the
trough, so decided to heavily utilize the 00Z ECENS/06Z GEFS means
by the end of the period to minimize those differences.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Things will be relatively uneventful across most regions of the
nation compared to the extreme winter weather that has been
endured by many locations this past week. The West could be
reasonably active in terms of precipitation, with heavy snow
possible in higher elevations of the Cascades and Rockies. Snow
could spread across the Interstate 25 corridor in Colorado as well
around midweek, but model differences remain with the extent of
lower elevation snow. By the end of the week, a corridor of light
to moderate rainfall will be possible across portions of the
south-central U.S. and extending towards the southern
Appalachians, with perhaps some snow on the northern edge of the
precipitation. There is still a good deal of model spread
regarding the placement of this QPF axis, so changes in the
forecast going forward are expected.

In the temperature department, the building trough and the passage
of the cold front across the Intermountain West will herald a
change to readings falling to 10-20 degrees below average for the
western High Plains to the Rockies, along not nearly as impressive
as the recent Arctic blast based on our current forecasts.
Temperatures will likely be 10-20 degrees above average ahead of
that same storm system across the north-central U.S. on Tuesday,
spreading to the Northeast midweek. By the end of the forecast
period next Saturday, expect temperatures to be near to slightly
below normal for most of the CONUS.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0121 AM CST Sat Feb 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject into the Plains states during the Day
2/Sunday period, with widespread dry northerly low-level flow
expected across much of the southwest CONUS into the southern High
Plains as surface high pressure ushers in from the Great Basin. The
approaching surface high will also support an intensifying surface
pressure gradient across southern California, with dry offshore flow
expected. Elevated to potentially locally Critical conditions may
occur from portions of southern California into the southern High
Plains, mainly during the afternoon. However, mediocre fuel
receptiveness to wildfire spread is expected to limit widespread
significant wildfire growth, precluding the need for wildfire
highlights at this time.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat February 20 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Light snow from parts of the Midwest to the Northeast and
Central Appalachians on Sunday into Monday...

...Isolated areas drizzle/freezing drizzle will develop over
Midwest overnight Saturday into Sunday...

...Temperatures to moderate across the central U.S....

A developing storm over the Central Rockies/Central High Plains
will move eastward to the Mid-Atlantic Coast by Monday evening.
Meanwhile, light snow over parts of the higher elevations of the
Pacific Northwest/Northern California and snow over the Great
Basin and Northern/Central Rockies will mostly end by Sunday
morning.  Overnight Saturday, light snow will develop over parts
of the Upper Midwest and isolated areas of drizzle/freezing
drizzle will develop over the Midwest overnight Saturday into
Sunday.  On Sunday, moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will
begin to move northward over the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
By Sunday evening, the moisture pooling along the associated front
will start to produce rain over parts of the Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southern Plains and into parts
of the Ohio Valley by Monday morning.  Likewise, light snow will
also develop over parts of the Great Lakes spreading into the
Northeast and Central Appalachians.  Additionally, as snow/rain
moves into portions of the Mid-Atlantic, isolated areas of
rain/freezing rain will develop over parts of the Central
Appalachians and the Virginia Piedmont. By Monday evening, light
snow will move into parts of northern New England.

In the west, moisture ahead of the next Pacific front will move
onshore over the Northwest, producing coastal rain and higher
elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest late Sunday into Monday.
 Light snow will also develop over parts of the Northern
Intermountain Region on Sunday into Monday.  Elsewhere,
temperatures will remain below average for much of the Central and
Eastern U. S. today before moderating on Sunday and Monday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
156 AM EST Sun Feb 21 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Feb 24 2021 - 12Z Sun Feb 28 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium range period is forecast to begin on Wednesday with
generally zonal upper-level flow, with a noticeable separation of
northern and southern stream flow for the middle of the week.  The
flow pattern should be relatively progressive through the week, as
the Northwest trough deepens and tracks eastward, and then
additional troughing and energy come into the West for the latter
part of the week and becomes a broader synoptic scale trough over
the western U.S. by next weekend.

Model guidance is in generally good agreement with the synoptic
scale pattern through the first half of the medium range period.
The 12Z CMC was nearly completely out of phase with the model
consensus across the western Pacific for next weekend, but the new
00Z run appears more reasonable.  Similar to yesterday, the GFS
parallel is slightly slower with most shortwave features compared
to the more progressive operational GFS, and the parallel version
was favored more for the WPC fronts and pressures.  The 12Z ECMWF
was also incorporated along with gradually increasing
contributions from the EC and GEFS mean.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The West could be moderately active in terms of precipitation
through early Saturday, with heavy snow possible for higher
elevations of the Cascades and the northern Rockies.  There will
likely be a round of moderate snow for the Colorado Rockies and
Front Range on Wednesday along and west of the Interstate 25
corridor.  By next weekend, a southern stream disturbance may tap
enough Gulf of Mexico moisture to produce a swath of moderate
rainfall across portions of the Mid-South and potentially some
light wintry precipitation across portions of the Midwest.

In the temperature department, the building trough and the passage
of the cold front across the Intermountain West will herald a
change to readings falling to 10-20 degrees below average for the
western High Plains to the Rockies.  Ahead of the front,
temperatures will likely be about 5 to 10 degrees above average
across the East Coast region for midweek.  By the end of the
forecast period next weekend, expect temperatures to be near to

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
156 AM EST Sun Feb 21 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Feb 24 2021 - 12Z Sun Feb 28 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium range period is forecast to begin on Wednesday with
generally zonal upper-level flow, with a noticeable separation of
northern and southern stream flow for the middle of the week.  The
flow pattern should be relatively progressive through the week, as
the Northwest trough deepens and tracks eastward, and then
additional troughing and energy come into the West for the latter
part of the week and becomes a broader synoptic scale trough over
the western U.S. by next weekend.

Model guidance is in generally good agreement with the synoptic
scale pattern through the first half of the medium range period.
The 12Z CMC was nearly completely out of phase with the model
consensus across the western Pacific for next weekend, but the new
00Z run appears more reasonable.  Similar to yesterday, the GFS
parallel is slightly slower with most shortwave features compared
to the more progressive operational GFS, and the parallel version
was favored more for the WPC fronts and pressures.  The 12Z ECMWF
was also incorporated along with gradually increasing
contributions from the EC and GEFS mean.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The West could be moderately active in terms of precipitation
through early Saturday, with heavy snow possible for higher
elevations of the Cascades and the northern Rockies.  There will
likely be a round of moderate snow for the Colorado Rockies and
Front Range on Wednesday along and west of the Interstate 25
corridor.  By next weekend, a southern stream disturbance may tap
enough Gulf of Mexico moisture to produce a swath of moderate
rainfall across portions of the Mid-South and potentially some
light wintry precipitation across portions of the Midwest.

In the temperature department, the building trough and the passage
of the cold front across the Intermountain West will herald a
change to readings falling to 10-20 degrees below average for the
western High Plains to the Rockies.  Ahead of the front,
temperatures will likely be about 5 to 10 degrees above average
across the East Coast region for midweek.  By the end of the
forecast period next weekend, expect temperatures to be near to
slightly below normal for most of the nation.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface low are expected to
traverse the Mississippi Valley while surface high pressure and
ridging aloft will prevail from the Rockies westward through the
period. Moist conditions east of the Rockies, along with cool and
dry conditions accompanying the building surface high pressure
across the Inter-mountain West will serve to limit widespread major
wildfire-spread concerns across much of the CONUS. A few small
exceptions would be the southern High Plains and the southern
Transverse/Peninsular Ranges in southern California, where sustained
gradient surface winds may reach 15-20 mph, coincident with 15-25%
RH by afternoon peak heating. Nonetheless, poor fuel receptiveness
to fire spread precludes any fire weather highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0113 AM CST Sun Feb 21 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Mainly zonal flow aloft will overspread the southwest CONUS while a
series of mid-level impulses traverse the northwestern to
east-central U.S during the Day 2/Monday period. Widespread surface
high pressure and overall cool conditions are expected to prevail
across the western and central U.S, mitigating significant
wildfire-growth potential. However, dry downslope flow is likely
across the southern High Plains, and a surface pressure gradient
across southern California is expected to continue supporting dry
offshore flow across the southern Transverse/Peninsular Ranges. Both
of these regions have been relatively devoid of meaningful
precipitation accumulations over the past two weeks, and given
multiple days of persistent breezy, dry conditions, some of the
finer fuels may cure enough to support brief, localized
wildfire-spread concerns. Nonetheless, the overall lack of robust
fuel receptiveness precludes fire weather delineations at this time.

Valid 12Z Sun Feb 21 2021 - 12Z Tue Feb 23 2021

...Light snow from parts of the Midwest to the Northeast and
Central Appalachians through Monday...

...Heavy snow for Northwest mountains...

...Temperatures to moderate across the central U.S....

A deep area of upper-level energy will traverse the central CONUS
through the beginning of the week. This amplified trough will help
develop and propagate an area of low pressure north and eastward
across the Upper Midwest today and into the Northeast by Monday.
Light with locally moderate snowfall will spread from the Upper
Midwest, across the Great Lakes and into the Northeast during this
period. An area of 2-4 inches of snow is likely for much of the
Upper Midwest with locally higher amounts possible in Iowa today.
The Central Appalachians and interior Northeast will also see a
general area of 2-4 inches while locally heavier amounts are
expected for areas downwind of the Lower Great Lakes tonight and
into tomorrow. Some light freeing rain may develop across much of
the Central Appalachians this evening. Rain showers will spread
across the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley,
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic through Monday evening. Some areas of
scattered to isolated thunderstorms may develop along the Carolina
and Southeast coast on Monday night.

Persistent troughing and the emergence of another upper-level
disturbance will be the driving mechanisms for the potential of
heavy snow in the Cascades and Northern Rockies over the next
couple of days. Around a foot of snow is likely to fall over parts
of the Northern Rockies while multiple feet of snow are expected
over parts of the northern Cascades during this period. There's
the potential for heavy rain to impact the Pacific Northwest coast
in the meantime. High temperatures are expected to rise well above
normal over parts of the Northern Plains today and Monday, while
highs in the 40s, 50s and 60s will return to the rest of the
Plains and Midwest.

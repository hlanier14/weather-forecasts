Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1053 AM CDT Wed Mar 24 2021

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. In addition, 25-35% RH is
expected across portions of the Florida Peninsula this afternoon,
with the northern High Plains experiencing RH minima around 20-30%
by afternoon peak heating. Sustained wind speeds below 15 mph are
expected across both locations, precluding fire weather highlights,
though localized wildfire-spread potential exists given modestly
receptive fuels in place.

..Squitieri.. 03/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Wed Mar 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will be focused to a relatively confined area
of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico today.  Enhanced mid-level
flow will continue to reside across the region today although
surface cooling and increased RH values will occur as a result of
clouds and proximity to lift from a positive-tilt shortwave just
upstream over New Mexico.  Elsewhere, locally elevated fire-weather
conditions may develop along the Lower Colorado River Valley as dry
northerly surface flow increases to around 15-20 mph.  Fire-weather
concerns should be limited elsewhere.

...Portions of west Texas and far southeastern New Mexico...
A relatively confined area of dry and breezy conditions will develop
along and east of the TransPecos this afternoon and early evening.
Wind speeds will exceed 20 mph in these areas for several hours as
RH values flirt with critical thresholds at times.  RH values are a
bit in question with northward and westward extent, however, as a
cold airmass migrates southward out of central New Mexico during the
period.  This will create shifting winds (to northwesterly) at times
during the afternoon that may complicate any fire-suppression
efforts.

...Heavy rain threat continues for the Tennessee Valley Saturday
night...

...Overview...

A progressive pattern is on tap for the CONUS over the next week.
A northern stream trough digging over the interior western US
(starting tonight) closes and becomes cutoff over Arizona by
Saturday and merely drifts east across New Mexico Sunday before
ejecting northeast from the southern Plains Monday ahead of the
next western trough which digs to the Four Corners through
Tuesday. The northern stream energy that cuts off the low in the
Southwest ejects east across the northern Great Plains Saturday,
spinning into a low over the Great Lakes early Sunday and further
develops over northern New England into Sunday night. That next
western trough shifts east across the Great Plains Tuesday,
reaching the Great Lakes on Wednesday. Broad southwesterly flow
ahead of the lead trough maintains a heavy rain threat for the
Tennessee Valley Saturday night with snow shifting from the
northern Great Lakes Sunday to northern New England Sunday
night/Monday.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The key feature with differences among the latest global guidance
is the cutoff low in the Southwest Days 3/4. The 00Z ECMWF and 06Z
GFS are in decent agreement for depth and placement, while the 00Z
CMC is slow/farther west and the 00Z UKMET is rather
open/progressive. Therefore, the preference through Day 4 is a
GFS/ECMWF blend. As usual with cutoff lows, progression is
uncertain with a need for ensemble means to be weighed heavier a
bit sooner than normal with the 00Z ECENS/06Z GEFS becoming a
significant part of the preference blend starting on Day 5 (where
sometimes this can wait until Day 6). New Mexico and west Texas
precip is anticipated, particularly on Day 4 from the GFS/ECMWF
positions of the closed low which further weighed into the
preference leaning toward those models. The other noted area of
uncertainty is in the Days 5-7 with the timing and track of the
closed low that develops in the next western US trough. The 00Z
ECMWF keeps the low closer to the Canadian border (over the inter
Northwest CONUS) while the GFS is farther south, so the GFS has
more precip in the CONUS/northern Rockies than any other model,
particularly on Day 6. This further emphasized the need for
heavier weight to ensemble means late in the period.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A frontal boundary will linger over the Mid-South Saturday before
lifting north as a warm front ahead of the next low crossing the
Great Lakes. Heavy rain continues across the Tennessee Valley
Saturday night which may overlap areas of heavy rain through
Thursday, further enhancing a flood threat. This northern system
sends another cold front into the Northeast on Sunday with
widespread light to moderate precipitation likely to impact the
Eastern states. The Storm Prediction Center states this threat is
too low at the time for a Day 4 outlook, so continue to refer to
products from SPC for more information. This system could undergo
cyclogenesis Sunday into Monday as the center nears the New
England coast, and should result in accumulating wintry
precipitation for northern New England. Out West, the trend should
be towards warmer and drier weather this weekend, ahead of the
next system into the Pacific Northwest which likely brings another
round of rain and mountain snow to the region early next week.
Showers and storms should also break out into the Central Plains
and Midwest next Monday and Tuesday ahead of the Western U.S.
trough.

The Eastern half of the nation starts warm this weekend, but
trends back towards normal Sunday/Monday after the cold front
moves through. Above normal temperatures will also progress from
the West to Central states this weekend underneath of upper level
ridging. The greatest anomalies will be across the Northern Plains
where daytime highs look to be 15 to 25 degrees above normal
Sunday and Monday. Below normal temperatures are on tap for the
Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West Monday/Tuesday as a cold
front crosses the region, while above normal temperatures are
anticipated ahead of this front Tuesday/Wednesday.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 24 2021

SYNOPSIS: At the start of the period a frontal system is expected to bring
cooler temperatures and increased precipitation to portions of the southern
and
eastern U.S. Thereafter, mid-level high pressure is favored to promote
unseasonably warm temperatures and drier than normal conditions for much of
the
lower 48 during week-2. Mid-level low pressure forecast over Alaska favors
below-normal temperatures and above-normal precipitation across much of the
state during the period.

HAZARDS

No hazards are depicted in today's outlook as odds are not anticipated to
reach
pre-defined criteria during the forecast period at this time.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY MARCH 27 - WEDNESDAY MARCH 31:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!sxqthsUZnyPcZp8wmm6gOakXUq-QBbwLGpXSH2JGpQNxTVR_HWAf5iHG0nemGn6ckIGeH-lL$

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 01 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 07: During early week-2, there is fair
agreement between the GEFS and the ECMWF ensemble means featuring a mid-level
trough shifting eastward over the northeastern U.S. with anomalous ridging
favored predominately across the remainder of the CONUS. Compared to previous
guidance, a key difference is seen in the 0z ECMWF which favors a more
amplified mid-level trough with negative mid-level height departures
overspreading much of the Great Lakes, Northeast, mid-Atlantic and the
Southeast during early week-2. There are also indications GEFS and ECMWF
regarding the development of anomalous troughing across the northwestern CONUS
by late week-2, which may increase the risk of hazardous weather later in the
outlook period. Outside of these regions, the majority of the lower 48 is
favored to be under the influence of anomalous mid-level ridging, promoting
unseasonably warm temperatures and drier than normal conditions, and reducing
the risk of weather related hazards during early April.



At the start of the outlook period, the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensemble means
feature a surface low traversing eastern Canada, with an accompanying cold
front extending southward into the southern tier of the CONUS. Enhanced
precipitation along this front is likely, with the ECMWF ensemble favoring
wetter conditions than the GEFS over the Northeast tied to a stronger mean
surface low and the aforementioned amplified trough aloft. Despite the
increased precipitation in the ECMWF, reforecast tool guidance remains
unsupportive of heavy precipitation potential, thus no related hazards are
issued. By day 10 (Apr 3), multiple models continue to advertise cooler
temperatures and a broad area of surface high pressure settling across the
eastern half of the CONUS in the wake of the front to quell any hazard risks
for the remainder of the period. This lower-level pattern supports Gulf
moisture advection and increased precipitation into portions of Texas during
week-2. However, with synoptic forcing absent, none of the anticipated
precipitation is expected to be deemed hazardous and any rainfall should
provide some moisture relief to portions of Texas affected by severe drought.



Farther west, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles have trended towards the
development of anomalous mid-level troughing across the Pacific Northwest
later
in the outlook period. The ECMWF appears slightly stronger than the GEFS
regarding this feature, while favoring higher chances for below normal
temperatures in the reforecast tool guidance. The threat of hazardous minimum
temperatures and/or precipitation amounts are marginal at this time, however
this region will continue to be monitored in upcoming outlooks. Across the
Alaska region, cyclone activity in the Bering Strait and Gulf of Alaska is
favored to bring anomalous cold and enhanced precipitation to many parts of
the
state. While temperature and precipitation impacts are expected to remain
below
hazard thresholds, there are growing concerns that the cold and wet pattern
could increase snow water across the Mainland, leading to an increased risk of
flooding during eventual river ice break-up later in April.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed March 24 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 30 - APR 03, 2021

Todays model solutions are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern forecast across North America and adjacent ocean
areas during the 6-10 day period. Shortwave troughing is predicted to move
through the central and eastern CONUS. Otherwise, broad ridging is favored to
develop over the CONUS. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF
ensemble mean slightly greater than the  GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due
to recent model skill. The resultant manual blend features negative 500-hPa
height anomalies across parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes,
and
Northeast, and positive height anomalies elsewhere across the CONUS. Anomalous
ridging is forecast across much of the central and eastern Pacific, with a
series of shortwave troughs predicted to track to the north of this feature
across Alaska. This intermittent troughing favors near to below normal heights
for most of the Mainland. Above normal heights are forecast over the
Aleutians.

Prior to the start of the period, shortwave troughing is forecast to be moving
off the East Coast, resulting in relatively cooler temperatures over the East.
However, due to the transient nature of the pattern, this cool down is
predicted to be brief with above normal temperatures returning by the middle
of
the period. For the period overall, a slight tilt toward above normal
temperature probabilities are favored across parts of the Great Lakes and the
Northeast. Probabilities for above normal temperatures are higher across
Florida, the Northern and Central Plains, Upper and Mississippi Valley, and
for
much of the southwestern CONUS extending northward across California and
western Nevada, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Below normal
temperature probabilities are increased across Alaska, given the potential for
shortwave troughing to lower heights across the state, as well as decreased
solar heating across the southern part of Alaska and the Panhandle. These
elevated below normal temperature probabilities also extend into parts of
Washington.

Troughing forecast to move through the central and eastern CONUS favors an
active frontal zone across parts of Southern Texas, the Lower Mississippi,
Tennessee , and Ohio Valleys,as well as  the Eastern Great Lakes, Middle
Atlantic and Northeast, where there is a slight tilt toward above normal
precipitation probabilities. Near to below normal precipitation is favored
across the rest of the CONUS due to limited synoptic forcing. The highest
probabilities of below normal precipitation are highlighted over the Central
Great Basin, underneath the greatest influence from ridging. Troughing over
Alaska and increased westerlies result in above normal precipitation chances
across most of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement, offset by some differences among temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 01 - 07 2021

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement on the
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
Anomalous ridging is forecast across the CONUS. The manual blend for the
week-2
period shows above normal 500-hPa heights for the entire CONUS, with positive
height anomalies exceeding 90 meters across parts of the Central Plains and
Middle Mississippi Valley. Negative height anomalies are forecast over much of
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle underneath troughing. Positive height
anomalies remain forecast for the Aleutians.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored across most of the CONUS. The
overall transition to broad synoptic ridging favors a tilt toward above normal
temperatures, which is supported by the ECMWF reforecast tool. The GEFS
reforecast tool depicts higher probabilities of below normal temperatures
across the Southern Plains and southeastern CONUS, but given the positive
height anomalies depicted in the GEFS for the period as a whole, increased
probabilities of near normal temperatures is the favored solution. A forecast
trend toward a neutral or slightly negative phase of the North Atlantic
Oscillation may promote increased backdoor cold front activity into the
Northeast, which may reduce the chances of having a sustained period of
warmth.
While probabilities for above normal temperatures remain elevated over the
Northeast, they are not as high as depicted in the ECMWF reforecast tool.
Increased troughing across Alaska and associated north to northwesterly
mid-level flow favor increased probabilities of below normal temperatures
across the state. Some of these colder temperatures may also expand into
portions of the Pacific Northwest, where a slight tilt toward increased near
to
below normal temperature probabilities are forecast.

Below normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced across most of the
CONUS,
given the lack of any defined mid-level features and the aforementioned broad
ridging forecast to expand across the CONUS. The exception is over parts of
southern Texas where moist, southeasterly surface flow out of the Gulf of
Mexico favors enhanced precipitation chances. Troughing over Alaska and a
series of surface lows forecast to track in the vicinity of the state result
in
elevated above normal precipitation chances.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement, offset by some differences among temperature and
precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

The Elevated delineation across the New Mexico/Texas border was
adjusted to reflect the latest guidance consensus. Otherwise, the
previous forecast for the Southern Plains remains on track.
Relatively low surface RH (25-35%) is still expected across the
Florida Peninsula tomorrow afternoon, where fuels are modestly
receptive to fire spread. An Elevated delineation has been withheld
given the lack of a stronger surface wind field, but brief/localized
fire-weather spread concerns exist wherever gusty conditions can
manifest.

..Squitieri.. 03/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Wed Mar 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
A negative-tilt mid-level wave over the southern Plains will eject
northeastward toward the southern Great Lakes region during the
D2/Thu forecast period.  As this occurs, an upstream wave will
amplify across Nevada and Utah that will maintain a belt of strong
flow aloft across dry areas of the southern Rockies.  At the
surface, a low will deepen quickly over Arkansas as high pressure
temporarily settles into Texas.  Upstream, another lee trough will
organize across eastern New Mexico and vicinity that will increase
surface flow across portions of Arizona and New Mexico.
Fire-weather concerns will exist across deep south Texas, while a
more conditional risk will develop across southern Arizona/New
Mexico and far west Texas.

...Deep south Texas...
Northwesterly low-level flow will exist across the region for much
of the morning through early afternoon.  This flow will occur within
a dry airmass characterized by RH values in the 10-15% range in
conjunction with surface temperatures rising well into the 80s F.
Wind speeds may be a limiting factor for a prolonged fire-weather
threat, however, as most guidance indicates that wind speeds will
taper during peak heating hours due to a weakening surface pressure
gradient.  Critical fire weather may exist for 1-2 hours before the
winds weaken.  Nevertheless, the dry surface conditions and lack of
rainfall will combine with aforementioned atmospheric conditions to
foster at least elevated fire weather.

...Southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and far west Texas...
Another axis of dry and windy conditions will materialize across
this region during the afternoon and early evening hours.  RH values
should flirt with critical thresholds across several areas during
the afternoon as surface winds increase to 15-25 mph at times.  Any
fire-weather threat will also be conditional upon the extent of
antecedent rainfall (or even snowfall) during the D1/Wed forecast
period.  Where dry fuels exist (most likely in lower elevation
areas), an elevated fire-weather threat is likely.

...A developing low pressure system will bring an increasing
threat of severe weather outbreak and flash flooding across the
Mid-South to the Tennessee Valley on Thursday...

...Unsettled weather and cool temperatures throughout much of the
West but near record warmth in the Northeast and Florida Thursday
into Friday...

The weather pattern across the U.S. will continue to favor
frequent formation of low pressure systems to track from the
central/southern Plains towards the Great Lakes.  One such low
pressure system currently over the Great Lakes will move away into
Canada, bringing an end to the wintry weather across the upper
Great Lakes by early Thursday morning.  Further south near the
Gulf Coast, a narrow band of heavy rain and embedded thunderstorms
that keeps redeveloping in southern Louisiana should shift
slightly to the east toward the coastal section of Mississippi and
Alabama by tonight where excessive rainfall remains possible.
Meanwhile, another energetic upper level disturbance responsible
for periods of heavy snow in the Southern Rockies is currently
exiting into the southern High Plains.  Additional snowfall is
expected in the higher elevations of southern Rockies into this
evening. As the winter weather threat concludes late in the day,
scattered showers and thunderstorms look to develop this afternoon
with some storms becoming severe in some cases. A Slight Risk for
severe storms has been issued from the Storm Prediction Center for
parts of the Ark-La-Tex region and southern Oklahoma, with heavy
rainfall rates within these storms also possible in eastern Texas
and the Lower Mississippi Valley Wednesday night.

As the upper trough ejects east on Thursday towards the
Mississippi Valley, attention turns to the Mid-South where
confidence is increasing in a severe weather outbreak transpiring
the second half of the day. Intense thunderstorms are forecast to
breakout across the Deep South and track towards the Tennessee
Valley Thursday afternoon and into the evening hours. All modes of
severe weather: tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail are
likely to be on display Thursday afternoon. The Storm Prediction
Center has posted a Moderate Risk for severe weather over southern
Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and northern Alabama, while an
expansive Slight Risk area is in place from the central Gulf Coast
on north into the Ohio Valley. In addition to the severe hazards,
hydrologic hazards are also a concern as widespread heavy showers
and thunderstorms may trigger areas of flash flooding. As a
result, a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall is in place from
northern Mississippi and Alabama on north into the Tennessee
Valley. A myriad of weather hazards; both severe and rainfall, are
a recipe for a dangerous weather setup in the Mid-South on
Thursday. The severe threat may linger into Thursday night across
the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys while the Northeast contends with
periods of rain overnight Thursday.

Elsewhere, another frontal system ushers in more rounds of rain
and mountain snow to the Northwest today. Snowfall accumulations
over a foot are anticipated along the Cascades and the highest
elevations of the northern Rockies. The front steadily pushes
south on Thursday as an upper level trough plunges south into the
Great Basin and Intermountain West. Expect more mountain snow to
take shape in these regions on Thursday with light rainfall
amounts in the lower elevations. Temperature-wise, the
Intermountain West and Southwest will remain mired and below
normal temperatures due to the active storm track and intrusions
of colder air aloft. It is a very different story though along the
East Coast, for once a nearby coastal low and its assortment of
showers exits Wednesday night, a balmy air-mass rolls in courtesy
of warm southerly flow. Daily record warm max and min temperatures
may be broken in the Northeast on Thursday with the list of
potentially record breaking warmth growing across the region on
Friday. Even the Sunshine State may see a handful of record warm
highs on Thursday as temperatures soar to above 90 degrees in some
locations.

...Heavy rain threat continues for the Tennessee Valley Saturday
night...

...Overview...

A progressive pattern is on tap for the CONUS over the next week.
A northern stream trough digging over the interior western US
(starting tonight) closes and becomes cutoff over Arizona by
Saturday and merely drifts east across New Mexico Sunday before
ejecting northeast from the southern Plains Monday ahead of the
next western trough which digs to the Four Corners through
Tuesday. The northern stream energy that cuts off the low in the
Southwest ejects east across the northern Great Plains Saturday,
spinning into a low over the Great Lakes early Sunday and further
develops over northern New England into Sunday night. That next
western trough shifts east across the Great Plains Tuesday,
reaching the Great Lakes on Wednesday. Broad southwesterly flow
ahead of the lead trough maintains a heavy rain threat for the
Tennessee Valley Saturday night with snow shifting from the
northern Great Lakes Sunday to northern New England Sunday
night/Monday.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The key feature with differences among the latest global guidance
is the cutoff low in the Southwest Days 3/4. The 00Z ECMWF and 06Z
GFS are in decent agreement for depth and placement, while the 00Z
CMC is slow/farther west and the 00Z UKMET is rather
open/progressive. Therefore, the preference through Day 4 is a
GFS/ECMWF blend. As usual with cutoff lows, progression is
uncertain with a need for ensemble means to be weighed heavier a
bit sooner than normal with the 00Z ECENS/06Z GEFS becoming a
significant part of the preference blend starting on Day 5 (where
sometimes this can wait until Day 6). New Mexico and west Texas
precip is anticipated, particularly on Day 4 from the GFS/ECMWF
positions of the closed low which further weighed into the
preference leaning toward those models. The other noted area of
uncertainty is in the Days 5-7 with the timing and track of the
closed low that develops in the next western US trough. The 00Z
ECMWF keeps the low closer to the Canadian border (over the inter
Northwest CONUS) while the GFS is farther south, so the GFS has
more precip in the CONUS/northern Rockies than any other model,
particularly on Day 6. This further emphasized the need for
heavier weight to ensemble means late in the period.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A frontal boundary will linger over the Mid-South Saturday before
lifting north as a warm front ahead of the next low crossing the
Great Lakes. Heavy rain continues across the Tennessee Valley
Saturday night which may overlap areas of heavy rain through
Thursday, further enhancing a flood threat. This northern system
sends another cold front into the Northeast on Sunday with
widespread light to moderate precipitation likely to impact the
Eastern states. The Storm Prediction Center states this threat is
too low at the time for a Day 4 outlook, so continue to refer to
products from SPC for more information. This system could undergo
cyclogenesis Sunday into Monday as the center nears the New
England coast, and should result in accumulating wintry
precipitation for northern New England. Out West, the trend should
be towards warmer and drier weather this weekend, ahead of the
next system into the Pacific Northwest which likely brings another
round of rain and mountain snow to the region early next week.
Showers and storms should also break out into the Central Plains
and Midwest next Monday and Tuesday ahead of the Western U.S.
trough.

The Eastern half of the nation starts warm this weekend, but
trends back towards normal Sunday/Monday after the cold front
moves through. Above normal temperatures will also progress from
the West to Central states this weekend underneath of upper level
ridging. The greatest anomalies will be across the Northern Plains
where daytime highs look to be 15 to 25 degrees above normal
Sunday and Monday. Below normal temperatures are on tap for the
Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West Monday/Tuesday as a cold
front crosses the region, while above normal temperatures are
anticipated ahead of this front Tuesday/Wednesday.

The low pressure system is forecast to intensify rather rapidly as
it tracks across the Mid-Mississippi Valley on Thursday and into
the lower Great Lakes early on Friday.  Rain, with some embedded
thunderstorms, is expected to overspread the Ohio Valley followed
by lower Great Lakes on Thursday, and across much of the Northeast
on Friday.  Winds around the intensifying storm will become strong
and very gusty, which could result in broken tree limbs in these
areas through Friday.  Meanwhile, thunderstorms ahead of the
trailing cold front should move into the East Coast by Friday but
they are not expected to be severe.

Elsewhere, another frontal system ushers in more rounds of rain

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1249 AM CDT Thu Mar 25 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
A vigorous, negative-tilt shortwave will traverse the southern
Plains early in the forecast period before reaching the
mid-Mississippi Valley and eventually Michigan late.  Meanwhile,
another longer-wave trough will become established across the
Southwest.  The overall pattern will maintain a belt of enhanced
flow aloft from the southern Rockies across Texas and on to the Ohio
Valley.  At the surface, cyclogenesis will occur from Arkansas into
Indiana, spreading a relatively dry airmass across portions of deep
south Texas while maintaining dry air across portions of the
southern Rockies.  Another lee trough will organize in the New
Mexico Plains as well during the day.

...Deep South Texas...
Models are less pronounced with lowering surface RH values during
the period of peak wind gusts (15Z-21Z).  Nevertheless, areas of
15-30% RH are likely to develop over the course of the afternoon as
surface temperatures rise into the 80s F.  15-25 mph northwesterly
surface flow will persist through early afternoon before tapering
off, as the deepening low over the middle of the country departs the
region.  Fuels are quite dry, however, and ERCs are relatively high
for this time of year, supporting an elevated fire-weather threat.

...Southeastern Arizona through far west Texas...
Vertical mixing processes beneath strong flow aloft and lee
troughing along the New Mexico Plains will encourage areas of 20-30
mph surface winds in the area through much of the forecast period.
This flow will occur within an airmass characterized by 15-25% RH
values and among areas of dry fuels in part due to drought.  RH
values will be a bit too high to justify critical highlights,
however.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1250 AM CDT Thu Mar 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
Although the southwestern U.S. mid/upper trough will meander and
begin to cut off from the northern branch of flow across the
northern Rockies, a belt of 50-60 kt flow aloft will persist across
the southern and central Plains throughout the forecast period.
This jet will encourage cyclogenesis in the general area of
southeastern Colorado/western Kansas and vicinity while maintaining
a dry airmass across portions of the southern Rockies and adjacent
High Plains.  Elevated to critical fire weather will develop
especially where fuels are dry.

...Southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and the western third
of Texas...
The aforementioned synoptic features will combine to foster areas of
20-30 mph westerly surface winds with higher gusts across a broad
part of the region during peak heating hours.  Additionally, drier
near-surface air will result in an axis of sub-15% RH values during
peak heating from the TransPecos to the eastern Texas Panhandle.
15-25% RH values will exist northwest of these areas from
southwestern to northeastern New Mexico.  These conditions would
ordinarily support broad critical areas, although recent rainfall
across the Texas Panhandle and South Plains regions have stunted
fuel dryness substantially in these areas and ERCs are low.  As a
result, the critical delineation is confined to the general axis
from El Paso, Texas to Hobbs, New Mexico where dry fuels are most
likely to coincide with critical atmospheric conditions.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
221 AM EDT Thu Mar 25 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 28 2021 - 12Z Thu Apr 01 2021

...Overview...

The upper level pattern during the medium range period should be
pretty progressive with two main systems of note. The first, a
vigorous northern stream shortwave, will send another deep surface
low through the Great Lakes and Northeast Sunday and Monday, with
a trailing cold front exiting the East Coast. This sets the stage
for continued unsettled weather from the Southern Plains to the
Northeast, with some snowfall possible across northern New England
to end the weekend. Meanwhile, the next system enters the Western
U.S. on Sunday, driving a well developed system and cold front
eastward coast to coast through the remainder of the extended
range.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles show very good agreement on the overall
synoptic pattern through the medium range, with typical questions
in the details. A cut off upper low over the Southwest on Sunday
continues to show some uncertainty regarding timing and ejection
eastward early next week/interactions with approaching Western
U.S. troughing. The GFS continues to struggle run to run with
handling of this energy, so a non-GFS consensus was preferred for
this system. Elsewhere, the deterministic models show good
agreement with both the northern stream energy through the Great
Lakes and Northeast Days 3-4, as well as amplifying Western U.S.
troughing progressing from the West on Sunday, across the Central
Plains, and into the Northeast next Thursday. WPCs blend leaned
more on the ECMWF days 3-4, with smaller contributions from the
rest of the deterministic guidance. Increased the usage of the
ensemble means days 5-7 just to mitigate the smaller scale
differences, but continued inclusion of the ECMWF for some
increased strength and definition of systems. This resulted in
good continuity with the previous WPC forecast as well.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Widespread showers and thunderstorms are likely ahead of the cold
front on Sunday from the Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic, with
moderate to locally heavy rainfall possible in spots. Given heavy
rainfall also expected over the Southeast/Tennessee Valley during
the short range, this may enhance a possible flooding threat for
some areas. Expect some showers farther west into Texas as well
along the trailing frontal boundary. The associated deepening
surface low into the Northeast Sunday-Monday should result in
accumulating snowfall across portions of northern New England, as
well as gusty winds across much of the Northeast.

The next system into the West will bring another round of rain and
mountain snow to the region early next week. As the cold front
enters the Central U.S. by Monday/Tuesday, it should tap into Gulf
of Mexico moisture to produce showers and storms ahead of it
initially across Texas and expanding northeastward into the
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys by the middle of next week. Locally
heavy rainfall is possible, but the details on this are dependent
on intensity and timing of the Southwest U.S. closed low and
interactions with the Western-Central U.S. trough.

East Coast states begin above average on Sunday, through trend
back towards normal Monday/Tuesday following the passage of the
cold front. Above normal temperatures will also steadily progress
eastward from the West to the Plains and the Midwest/parts of the
East by middle of next week underneath of upper level ridging. The
greatest anomalies are expected across the Northern Plains where
daytime highs 15-25 degrees above normal are possible Sunday and
Monday. The upper level trough into the Pacific Northwest will
bring temperatures back down towards normal or below normal in the
same regions by early to mid next week.

...A Tornado Outbreak is expected to occur later today in the
Mid-South; a Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in place in
portions of the Tennessee Valley...

...Unsettled weather and cool temperatures throughout much of the
West, gusty winds and blowing dust in the Desert Southwest today...

...Record warm temperatures to take shape up and down the East
Coast by Friday...

An active and dangerous day of weather is set to unfold across the
Mid-South today, highlighted by a High Risk of severe weather
issued by the Storm Prediction Center. The primary weather driver
of this impending tornado outbreak is a strengthening area of low
pressure out ahead of a sharp and intense upper level trough
tracking into the middle Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley this
evening. Powerful thunderstorms are forecast to blossom in the
South this afternoon and track into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys
tonight. These intense thunderstorms are may contain a myriad of
hazards that include violent long-track tornadoes, damaging wind
gusts, and large hail. In addition to the severe threats,
hydrologic hazards are also a serious concern from northern
Alabama and Mississippi to the Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians. Torrential rainfall rates in these areas that also
contain overly saturated soil is a recipe for flash flooding. As a
result, a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in place with a
Moderate Risk located over northern Alabama, northwest Georgia,
and southeast Tennessee. Residents in these areas should have a
plan of action if severe weather threaten their respective
locations. In addition, high winds from the lower Great Lakes to
the northern Mid-Atlantic Thursday night into Friday morning. High
Wind Watches are in place for portions of these regions as strong
winds may result in downed trees and power lines.

The impactful storm system responsible for Thursday's tornado
outbreak heads for the Great Lakes tonight. The cold front is
forecast to clear the Mid-South and Ohio Valley shortly after
midnight, thus ending the severe threat for these regions as high
pressure builds in from the west in the early morning hours
tomorrow. By Friday, the cold front reaches the East Coast with a
Marginal Risk of severe weather in place in the Southeast. Further
north, a damp and gusty Friday is in the cards for the Northeast
with drier conditions returning by evening and sticking around
into Saturday.

In the West, another upper level disturbance digging into the
Southwest on Thursday will set off scattered showers and areas of
mountain snow from the Northwest to the Four Corners region. This
upper trough is also playing a role in favorable conditions for
blowing dust in parts of the Desert Southwest today. This has
resulted in the issuance of Wind Advisories and Blowing Dust
Advisories for parts of far southern California and southern
Arizona this afternoon. By Friday, the footprint of rain and
mountain snow showers will decrease, but periods of snow look to
continue in the central and southern Rockies. Snowfall totals
through Friday night are forecast to be heaviest in the San Juan
Mountains where 1 to 2 feet of snow are possible. Elsewhere, the
higher ridge lines throughout the Intermountain West could receive
up to a foot of snow over the next couple days.

Temperature-wise, most of the western third of the CONUS remains
seasonably cool today with a gradual warm-up arriving along the
West Coast Friday and Saturday. On the flip side, the East Coast
will feel more like late spring with highs in the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast soaring into the 70s with even some highs even reaching
the low 80s. Numerous daily record warm min temps are on tap from
Florida to Maine on Friday with highs over 90 degrees possible
across the Sunshine State.

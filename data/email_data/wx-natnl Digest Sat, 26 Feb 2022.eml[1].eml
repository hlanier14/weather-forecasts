Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1003 AM CST Fri Feb 25 2022

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, with no changes

..Squitieri.. 02/25/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CST Fri Feb 25 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will generally remain low through the period,
as cold surface ridging and below average temperatures persist over
much of the western and central CONUS. The one exception will be
over parts of New Mexico, where breezy southerly surface winds will
develop in response to a weak surface low/trough in the immediate
lee of the southern Rockies. However, minimum RH should generally
remain in the 20-30 percent range where the breezy surface winds are
expected.

Extended Forecast Discussion

139 PM EST Fri Feb 25 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 28 2022 - 12Z Fri Mar 04 2022

...Overview...

Most guidance expects flow across the lower 48 to have moderate
amplitude next Monday-Friday.  A general western ridge/broad
eastern mean trough pattern through at least midweek should
progress eastward thereafter as a Pacific trough moves into the
western U.S.  Moisture ahead of the Pacific trough will likely
bring meaningful precipitation into the Pacific Northwest with
somewhat lighter amounts eventually spreading across other parts
of the West.  Many areas east of the Rockies will be fairly dry,
with any precipitation generally light and confined to northern
areas with one or more waves and possibly southern parts of the
Plains mid-late week.  Near to above normal temperatures will be
most common next week.  Best potential for below normal readings
will be over/near the southern Plains early in the week and in
northern parts of the eastern U.S. on some days.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model blends consisting of deterministic guidance from days 3-5
then ensemble means on days 6 & 7 provided a reasonable solution
for the medium range. For Monday, a greater weighting was given to
the 00z EC/CMC due to the uncertainty around an impulse moving
through the West. The GFS amplified this shortwave into a closed
low and had it move at a slow pace compared to the rest of the
deterministic suite so it was excluded from Tuesday's blend. The
00z UK and CMC join the 06z GFS in losing weighting on Wednesday,
due to difficulties and spread in handling a trough approaching
the Pacific Northwest. Therefore, a blend of 00z EC and the
ensemble means were utilized through Thursday. The EC was dropped
and a full ensemble blend was used by Friday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Expect the heaviest precipitation next week to be over the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies.  A series of systems embedded in
moist flow ahead of an initially slow-moving eastern Pacific upper
trough may produce an atmospheric river event over these regions
early-mid week.  Eventual progression of the upper trough should
bring a lighter trend to the Northwest and spread precipitation
farther south and east later in the week.  Exactly how far south
the moisture reaches into California and the Great Basin/Rockies
will depend on the amplitude of the upper trough.  Farther east, a
couple clipper systems may bring mostly light snow from the Upper
Midwest through the Great Lakes and Northeast.  Additional
northern tier snow will be possible late in the week ahead of low
pressure organizing over the north-central Plains.  A weak
shortwave crossing the Southeast Monday may produce some light
rain before departing.  Another weak upper feature may generate
light/scattered rain over the southern Plains around mid-late week.

Aside from chilly morning lows over the southern Plains on Monday
(up to 10-15F below normal), the forecast pattern will support
above normal temperatures over a majority of the western and
central U.S. Monday-Wednesday followed by a cooling trend over the
West and a warmer trend over the East.  Plus 10-20F anomalies will
be possible for max and/or min temperatures for one or more days
over the Great Basin/Southwest and parts of the Rockies/Plains.
Areas from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast will tend to stay
below normal though, with some locations in the Northeast 10-20F
below normal early in the week.

...Overview...

Most guidance expects flow across the lower 48 to have moderate
amplitude next Monday-Friday.  A general western ridge/broad
eastern mean trough pattern through at least midweek should
progress eastward thereafter as a Pacific trough moves into the
western U.S.  Moisture ahead of the Pacific trough will likely
bring meaningful precipitation into the Pacific Northwest with
somewhat lighter amounts eventually spreading across other parts
of the West.  Many areas east of the Rockies will be fairly dry,
with any precipitation generally light and confined to northern
areas with one or more waves and possibly southern parts of the
Plains mid-late week.  Near to above normal temperatures will be
most common next week.  Best potential for below normal readings
will be over/near the southern Plains early in the week and in
northern parts of the eastern U.S. on some days.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model blends consisting of deterministic guidance from days 3-5
then ensemble means on days 6 & 7 provided a reasonable solution
for the medium range. For Monday, a greater weighting was given to
the 00z EC/CMC due to the uncertainty around an impulse moving
through the West. The GFS amplified this shortwave into a closed
low and had it move at a slow pace compared to the rest of the
deterministic suite so it was excluded from Tuesday's blend. The
00z UK and CMC join the 06z GFS in losing weighting on Wednesday,
due to difficulties and spread in handling a trough approaching
the Pacific Northwest. Therefore, a blend of 00z EC and the
ensemble means were utilized through Thursday. The EC was dropped
and a full ensemble blend was used by Friday.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 25 2022

SYNOPSIS: Dynamical models remain in good agreement regarding the 500-hPa
height pattern across North America during week-2. Mid-level high pressure =
is
forecast to amplify across the northeastern Pacific and Alaska and mid-leve=
l
low pressure is forecast downstream over the western and central contiguous
U.S. Multiple areas of surface low pressure may eject out of the Rockies
during
the period, increasing the potential for heavy rainfall over flood prone ar=
eas
of the east-central CONUS, along with wintry precipitation to the north of =
the
storm tracks. Above normal mid-level heights are favored for much of the Ea=
st,
leading to relatively warmer temperatures compared to the late week-1
timeframe.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk for heavy precipitation for parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and
Lower and Middle Mississippi Valleys, Sat-Mon, Mar 5-7.

Slight risk for heavy precipitation for parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and
Lower
and Middle Mississippi Valleys, southern Great Lakes, Appalachians, and the
Southeast, Sat-Fri, Mar 5-11.

Slight risk for heavy snow for parts of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississi=
ppi
Valley, and Great Lakes, Sat, Mar 5.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the western CONU=
S,
Northern and Central Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley, Sat-Fri, Mar 5-1=
1.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of southwestern Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians, Sat, Mar 5.

Flooding possible across portions of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower and Mid=
dle
Mississippi Valleys.

DETAILED SUMMARY

v1T6huu8xmK$

FOR SATURDAY MARCH 05 - FRIDAY MARCH 11: The Pacific-North American Pattern
(PNA) is forecast to trend more negative in week-2. This is reflected in
today's 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble mean 500-hPa height forecasts=
,
which favor strong mid-level ridging expanding over the Northeastern Pacifi=
c
and Alaska during week-2, with troughing indicated over the western CONUS. =
The
trough over the West is forecast to become more positively tilted with time=
,
resulting in an eastward expansion of the associated negative mid-level hei=
ght
anomalies into the central CONUS.



Anomalously cold temperatures are forecast over parts of the western CONUS,
with a cooling trend forecast across the central CONUS by the middle of the
period. Although the reforecast tools are not overly aggressive regarding t=
he
hazardous cold potential, the uncalibrated temperature guidance from the 0z
ECMWF indicates minimum temperature anomalies of at least -10 deg F over pa=
rts
of the region throughout the period. Although the GEFS is not as robust ear=
ly
on with the anomalous cold in the West compared to the ECMWF, the signal
becomes stronger for below normal temeprtures across the north-central COUN=
S
by
the second half of week-2. Given that there are still some model difference=
s
related to the exact timing and placement of the anomalous cold, a broad
slight
risk for much below normal temperatures is highlighted over parts of the
western CONUS, extending into the Northern and Central Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley for all of week-2. Minimum temperatures are forecast to
range from near 0 deg F across the highest elevations and near the Canadian
Border to near freezing closer to the Pacific Coast.



The troughing across the West is favored to set up an active storm track
across
the central CONUS during week-2, with increased chances for heavy rainfall
over
portions of the east-central CONUS tied to frontal activity. The ECMWF
reforecast tool depicts some areas having at least a 30-50 percent chance o=
f
precipitation totals exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 1-inc=
h
during the first 3 days of the period, with probabilities in the 20-30 perc=
ent
range thereafter. A moderate risk for heavy precipitation is highlighted
across
parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower and Middle Mississippi Valleys for =
Mar
5-7 coinciding with the highest probabilities in the ECMWF reforecast tool.
The
GEFS is not as robust compared to the ECMWF, but has trended wetter compare=
d
to
yesterday. Both models continue to support a slight risk for heavy
precipitation across parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower and Middle
Mississippi Valleys, southern Great Lakes, Appalachians, and the Southeast =
for
all of week-2 as uncalibrated guidance from the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensembles all indicate precipitation totals of 1.5-3 inches for the entire
period. The axis of heaviest precipitation may begin to shift southeastward
later in week-2 as the trough axis expands over the central CONUS. Ongoing
river flooding across parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Middle and Lower
Mississippi Valleys may be exacerbated with any additional precipitation an=
d/
or
increased snowmelt runoff from areas to the north, resulting in a flooding
possible hazard highlighted over these areas.



Models continue to waver in regards to a late week-1/early week-2 snow thre=
at
across the north-central CONUS. The 0z deterministic ECMWF song with its
ensemble continue to be the most robust compared to the GEFS and Canadian
ensembles, depicting increased snowfall potential across the Upper Mississi=
ppi
Valley and Northern Great Lakes. Although the threat is considered marginal=
,
the slight risk of heavy snow remains highlighted over these areas on day-8
(Mar 5) to maintain continuity with yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs o=
utlook. Additional systems
are
likely to bring a threat of snow or mixed wintry precipitation to the north=
ern
tier of the CONUS throughout week-2, although there is no coherency within =
the
model solutions, precluding an expansion of the heavy snow hazard at this
time.



Early in week-2, mid-level ridging is forecast to expand across Alaska,
resulting in a retrogression of the trough over the Bering sea. Increased w=
ind
speeds remain possible across the Aleutians and southwestern Mainland at th=
e
start of the period, with the dynamical guidance indicating the enhanced
pressure gradient persisting a bit longer compared to yesterday. Therefore,
the
slight risk for high winds is extended an additional day through Mar 5,
supported by the ECMWF reforecast tool which depicts some of the highlighte=
d
areas with at least a 20 percent chance wind speeds exceed the 85th percent=
ile
and 25-mph. The increased ridging across the state favors anomalously warm
temperatures, with the highest anomalies predicted across the western and
northern Mainland (greater than +10 deg F for the week-2 period as a whole
based on the consolidated temperature forecast tool).

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CST Fri Feb 25 2022/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will build over the western states, resulting
in dry offshore flow over portions of southern California. Periods
of breezy/gusty northeasterly surface winds (particularly over parts
of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties) may overlap critically low RH
during the morning and afternoon hours. With that said, the brief
nature of these conditions and generally unreceptive fuels cast
uncertainty on the overall fire-weather risk -- precluding
highlights at this time.

Farther east, strong midlevel flow accompanying a shortwave trough
will cross the central Rockies, supporting the potential for
modestly dry and breezy conditions over portions of the central
Plains. However, a limited overlap of the breezy surface winds and
low RH should temper the fire-weather threat. Elsewhere,
fire-weather concerns will generally remain low with high pressure
encompassing much of the CONUS.

evening...

...A strong cold front may produce brief but intense snow and
windy conditions across the Great Lakes and Northeast on Sunday...

...Increasing chances of precipitation moving across the southern
Plains to the Southeast, as well as the Pacific Northwest...

Across the Northeast, Winter Storm Warnings remain in effect into
the evening as a system continues to produce areas of moderate to
heavy snow, as well as mixed precipitation across portions of
Upstate New York and New England.  Improving conditions are
expected overnight as the associated area of low pressure tracks
away from the New England coast.  With the exception of lake
effect snow showers downwind of the lakes, drier conditions can be
expected across much of the Northeast and Great Lakes region on
Saturday.  Then on Sunday, a strong cold front dropping south from
Canada is expected to sweep across the Northeast.  Snow squalls
are likely to accompany and follow the front as it moves across
the region.  In addition to brief but intense snow, windy
conditions are possible as well.  Where these squalls occur,
hazardous travel conditions are likely.

As an upper level system moves across the region, generally light
precipitation is expected to develop across portions of eastern
Texas and Oklahoma, into Louisiana and southern Arkansas
overnight.  From central Texas to the Ozarks, shallow cold air at
the surface may support some freezing rain, however widespread
significant ice accumulations are not expected.  Precipitation is
forecast to shift east across the lower Mississippi and Tennessee
valleys Saturday night, before reaching across the southern
Appalachians into the southern Mid Atlantic and Southeast on
Sunday.  Amounts through the period are forecast to remain light,
with no widespread winter weather or hydrologic concerns expected.

Across the Pacific Northwest, dry conditions are expected to
continue into early Saturday before an approaching Pacific system
brings precipitation back into western Washington, Oregon, and
northwestern California by late in the day.  By early Sunday,
precipitation is expected to spread east of the Cascades and into
portions of the northern Rockies.  This system is forecast to
weaken as it begins to move onshore, however unsettled weather is
expected to continue through late Sunday ahead of another
approaching Pacific system.

Freeze warnings are in effect for California's San Joaquin Valley
tonight.  For the remainder of the weekend and into early next
week, temperatures are expected to moderate, with seasonal to
above normal temperatures spreading across much of the western U.S.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri February 25 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 03 - 07 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. An enhanced trough is predicted over the Bering Sea and th=
e
western Aleutians with below normal 500-hPa heights. A ridge and associated
above normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over the North Pacific extending
north through Alaska and toward the North Pole. Troughing with below normal
500-hPa heights are forecast over much of the western CONUS. Above normal
500-hPa heights are predicted over the eastern and central CONUS.

Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures are favored over the
western CONUS extending eastward to the Upper Mississippi Valley, beneath a
mean mid-level trough. There are enhanced chances for near to above normal
temperatures across the remainder of the CONUS under near to above normal 5=
00
h-Pa heights. Meanwhile, the strong ridge building across Alaska should bri=
ng
above normal temperatures to the entire state, particularly toward the end =
of
the period, supported by the GEFS and ECMWF Calibrated reforecast tools.

An active storm track ahead of a mean mid-level trough over the Bering Sea
favors increased above normal precipitation probabilities across Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians. Predicted mid-level ridging and above normal 500-=
hPa
heights favor below normal precipitation over the Alaska Panhandle, and par=
ts
of the Middle Atlantic and the Southeast. Enhanced below normal precipitati=
on
probabilities are also favored over the West Coast and parts of the Southwe=
st,
while above normal precipitation is forecast over the remainder of the CONU=
S,
consistent  with the consolidation precipitation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
general good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation
pattern,
offset by some disagreement in the forecast temperature and precipitation
fields in the forecast tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 05 - 11 2022

During the week-2 period, the overall 500-hPa flow pattern is forecast to b=
e
dominated by very strong ridging predicted over the North Pacific extending
north through Alaska and toward the North Pole. This ridge is forecast to
continue strengthening and to retrograde west of the mean position for the =
6
to
10 day period, stronger, and highly meridional from the mid-latitudes to th=
e
Arctic. Downstream, trouging and associated below normal 500-hPa heights ar=
e
predicted over much of the western and central CONUS. Ridging and positive
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over the eastern CONUS.

Enhanced above normal temperature probabilities are favored for all of Alas=
ka
due to mean southerly flow associated with the strong full-latitude ridge.
Chances for above normal temperatures top 60 percent along the western tier=
 of
the state. Meanwhile, increased chances for below normal temperatures are
favored across the western and central CONUS and the western Great Lakes un=
der
the influence of the mean mid-level trough and below normal 500-hPa heights
expected to cover this region. The enhanced chances for warmer than normal
temperatures are likely over most of the eastern CONUS and parts of the
Southern Plains, due to the ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights.

The broadening trough and resultant storm track will establish increased od=
ds
for above normal precipitation across most areas from the central and North=
ern
Rockies through the Southern Plains and into the eastern CONUS. South and w=
est
of the anticipated mean mid-level ridge, below normal precipitation is favo=
red
along the western and southwestern fringes of the CONUS. Meanwhile, near an=
d
west of the strong ridge over Alaska, a stormy pattern is expected to conti=
nue
into week-2 in the expected humid, southerly flow except for the Alaska
Panhandle where below normal precipitation is favored.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
general good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation
pattern,
offset by some disagreement in the forecast temperature and precipitation
fields in the forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

...Overview...

Most guidance expects flow across the lower 48 to have moderate
amplitude next Monday-Friday.  A general western ridge/broad
eastern mean trough pattern through at least midweek should
progress eastward thereafter as a Pacific trough moves into the
western U.S.  Moisture ahead of the Pacific trough will likely
bring meaningful precipitation into the Pacific Northwest with
somewhat lighter amounts eventually spreading across other parts
of the West.  Many areas east of the Rockies will be fairly dry,
with any precipitation generally light and confined to northern
areas with one or more waves and possibly southern parts of the
Plains mid-late week.  Near to above normal temperatures will be
most common next week.  Best potential for below normal readings
will be over/near the southern Plains early in the week and in
northern parts of the eastern U.S. on some days.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model blends consisting of deterministic guidance from days 3-5
then ensemble means on days 6 & 7 provided a reasonable solution
for the medium range. For Monday, a greater weighting was given to
the 00z EC/CMC due to the uncertainty around an impulse moving
through the West. The GFS amplified this shortwave into a closed
low and had it move at a slow pace compared to the rest of the
deterministic suite so it was excluded from Tuesday's blend. The
00z UK and CMC join the 06z GFS in losing weighting on Wednesday,
due to difficulties and spread in handling a trough approaching
the Pacific Northwest. Therefore, a blend of 00z EC and the
ensemble means were utilized through Thursday. The EC was dropped
and a full ensemble blend was used by Friday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Expect the heaviest precipitation next week to be over the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies.  A series of systems embedded in
moist flow ahead of an initially slow-moving eastern Pacific upper
trough may produce an atmospheric river event over these regions
early-mid week.  Eventual progression of the upper trough should
bring a lighter trend to the Northwest and spread precipitation
farther south and east later in the week.  Exactly how far south
the moisture reaches into California and the Great Basin/Rockies
will depend on the amplitude of the upper trough.  Farther east, a
couple clipper systems may bring mostly light snow from the Upper
Midwest through the Great Lakes and Northeast.  Additional
northern tier snow will be possible late in the week ahead of low
pressure organizing over the north-central Plains.  A weak
shortwave crossing the Southeast Monday may produce some light
rain before departing.  Another weak upper feature may generate
light/scattered rain over the southern Plains around mid-late week.

Aside from chilly morning lows over the southern Plains on Monday
(up to 10-15F below normal), the forecast pattern will support
above normal temperatures over a majority of the western and
central U.S. Monday-Wednesday followed by a cooling trend over the
West and a warmer trend over the East.  Plus 10-20F anomalies will
be possible for max and/or min temperatures for one or more days
over the Great Basin/Southwest and parts of the Rockies/Plains.
Areas from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast will tend to stay
below normal though, with some locations in the Northeast 10-20F
below normal early in the week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1226 AM CST Sat Feb 26 2022

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough and strong midlevel west-southwesterly flow will
emerge over the central Plains by this afternoon, while a
mid/upper-level ridge builds over the western CONUS.

...Central Plains...
As the shortwave trough crosses the central Rockies, downslope
warming/drying and efficient diurnal heating will result in minimum
afternoon RH of 15-20 percent over parts of NE. Over southern NE,
modest west-southwesterly surface winds near 15 mph may coincide
with the low RH for a few hours, where fuels remain dry owing to a
lack of snow cover. However, these conditions appear too marginal
and localized for Elevated highlights at this time.

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient will tighten over southern
California, where a few hours of critically low RH and breezy/gusty
northeasterly surface winds are expected. This will especially be
the case over parts of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, where gusts
of 25-45 mph will be possible during the morning and afternoon
hours. With that said, high live fuel moisture should generally
mitigate the fire-weather risk, precluding highlights at this time.

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level ridging will build eastward across the central
Rockies, allowing maximum temperatures to climb into the upper 50s
to near 60 over parts of the central and southern Plains. This will
result in widespread minimum afternoon RH below 15 percent, though
surface winds should generally remain below 15 mph where the
greatest RH reductions are expected. The one exception may be over
parts of Montana and Wyoming, where breezy surface winds of 15-20
mph will be possible. However, fire-weather concerns will still
remain low owing to residual snow cover across the region.

Across southern California, dry offshore flow will continue, though
a weakening pressure gradient and minimal upper-level support should
generally mitigate the fire-weather threat.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
158 AM EST Sat Feb 26 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Mar 01 2022 - 12Z Sat Mar 05 2022

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show an upper pattern consisting of a
western ridge and broad eastern mean trough through midweek,
followed by a transition toward a mean trough settling into the
western U.S. while upper heights rise farther to the east.  The
primary precipitation focus early in the period will be over the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies ahead of the eastern
Pacific trough that eventually moves into the West.  Progression
of this trough later in the week into next weekend will spread
precipitation over other parts of the West and then bring a
variety of precipitation types to the central U.S. as low pressure
emerges over the Plains.  Ahead of this system, expect most
precipitation east of the Rockies to be confined to a couple
episodes of snow across northern areas with associated surface
waves.  The pattern evolution will favor above normal temperatures
over a majority of the western/central U.S. through Wednesday or
Thursday and then a cooler trend over the West and warmer readings
over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Two dominant uncertainties remain within what continues to be an
agreeably depicted mean pattern evolution through the period.  The
first involves the east-west shortwave energy forecast to be over
central Canada on Tuesday and then drop into the cyclonic flow
downstream, with Tuesday-Thursday surface low pressure and frontal
system very sensitive to the exact details of the energy aloft.
The upper feature is south/southeast of a closed high and such a
configuration tends to yield low predictability, with
model/ensemble spread demonstrating this idea so far.  In latest
cycles the ECMWF/GFS have tended to be most sheared with the
shortwave energy and thus weak with low pressure, while the
UKMET/CMC's more concentrated depiction of energy aloft results in
a stronger surface system.  Ensemble means generally reflect the
ideas of their parent models.  For now the preference leans on the
weaker side to maintain better continuity until there is reason to
be more confident in the alternative.  The second uncertainty
involves the upper trough moving into the West by Thursday.  There
has been progress toward better agreement to some degree, as
latest GFS runs have stabilized toward a fairly amplified trough
that had been advertised by most other guidance.  The CMC is still
a little questionable as it is more amplified than most other
solutions at some valid times and the new 00Z run has an extra
embedded low within the trough as it comes ashore.  The character
of upstream small-scale energy dropping into the overall trough
(00Z CMC an amplified extreme) still complicates the forecast.
The 12Z ECMWF was reasonable for this feature but still strayed on
the fast side with the central U.S. dynamics and surface system by
next Saturday--due in part to being quicker to lift out eastern
troughing.

For the updated forecast, guidance comparisons led to an
operational model emphasis early followed by partial incorporation
of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means.  ECMWF input consisted of both
the 12Z run and prior 00Z version through the period due to the
older run having some appealing traits for both systems of
interest.  Two-thirds total weight of the GFS/ECMWF into early
Thursday yielded the desired outcome for the eastern U.S. wave
whose character remains a significant question mark.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moist flow ahead of the upper trough initially over the eastern
Pacific should continue a Pacific Northwest atmospheric river
event already in progress at the start of the period early
Tuesday.  Amounts during Tuesday-Wednesday should be somewhat
lower than in the short range at the start of the week but could
still be meaningful at some locations.  Some of this moisture will
extend into the northern Rockies.  Progression of the upper trough
into the West after midweek should lead to a lighter trend along
the West Coast and spread precipitation into central California
and some other parts of the West, mostly with light to moderate
amounts of rain and higher elevation snow.  Expect precipitation
to expand across the central U.S. late week into the weekend as
western trough energy reaches far enough east to support Plains
low pressure.  Best potential for some wintry weather will be over
the northern third of the Plains into the Upper Midwest.  Areas
from the Upper Midwest into Northeast may see a couple periods of
snow Tuesday-Thursday in association with clipper systems, the
first one fairly well forecast but the second having much greater
uncertainty for strength/track details.  Thus confidence is a lot
lower for coverage and amounts of snow with the second system.

Above normal temperatures will prevail over a majority of the
western and central U.S. Tuesday-Wednesday.  Progression of the
initial eastern Pacific upper trough will promote a cooler trend
over the West after midweek and then favor northward expansion of
above normal temperatures (plus 10-15F or so anomalies) from the
South across a greater portion of the eastern U.S.  Plus 10-20F
anomalies will be possible for max and/or min temperatures for one
or more days over the Great Basin/Southwest through midweek and
parts of the Rockies/Plains into later in the week.  Central
Plains locations could exceed plus 20F anomalies for highs.  Areas
from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast will tend to be moderately
below normal and colder air filtering into Montana/North Dakota
could bring highs down to 10-20F below normal by next Saturday.

As the latest winter storm rapidly exited New England, colder and
drier conditions will dominate the Northeast for today.  The
exception will be downwind of the lower Great Lakes where of lake
effect snows could result in locally heavy snowfall.  In the mean
time, an upper level system moving across the southern Plains is
expected to expand the coverage of rain across eastern Texas
today.  Portions of north-central Texas will be cold enough to
support freezing rain early this morning.  The precipitation is
forecast to spread quickly eastward through the interior Deep
South tonight where shallow cold air is expected to support some
freezing rain across portions of the Arklatex to the Ozarks,
reaching portions of the Tennessee Valley early on Sunday.
Widespread significant ice accumulations are not expected.
Farther south, rain is forecast to shift east across the southern
Appalachians into the southern Mid Atlantic and Southeast during
the day on Sunday.  The associated low pressure wave is forecast
to move off the southeast U.S. coast on Monday as the rain begins
to move off the coast and dip into northern Florida.

Across the Northeast, a strong cold front dropping south from
Canada is expected to sweep across with a good chance of snow
squalls through the region.  In addition to brief but intense
snow, windy conditions are expected.  Where these squalls occur,
hazardous travel conditions are likely.

Across the Pacific Northwest, an approaching Pacific system will
bring precipitation back into western Washington, Oregon, and
northwestern California by late in the day.  By early Sunday,
precipitation is expected to spread east of the Cascades and into
portions of the northern Rockies.  This system is forecast to
weaken as it begins to move onshore, however unsettled weather is
expected to continue through late Sunday ahead of another
approaching Pacific system.

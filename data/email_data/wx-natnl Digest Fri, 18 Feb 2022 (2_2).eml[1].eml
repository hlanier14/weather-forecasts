Extended Forecast Discussion

212 AM EST Fri Feb 18 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 21 2022 - 12Z Fri Feb 25 2022

...Early-mid next week heavy snow threat from the central Great
Basin/Rockies to the northern plains/Upper Midwest and northern
Northeast...

...Heavy rain/runoff threat from the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee
Valleys to the Mid-Atlantic Monday-Friday, with a heavy snow/ice
threat from the southern plains and Mid-Mississippi/Ohio Valleys
to the Northeast Wednesday-Friday as an early week central U.S.
Arctic surge spreads eastward...


...Pattern Overview...

An active weather pattern will develop next week as upper troughs
dig over a cooling West and as ejecting energies and induced
frontal waves progress downstream over a Canadian high pressure
cooled central to eastern U.S. and a warming Southeast/East upper
ridge.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles offer a quite similar mid-larger scale flow
evolution next week in a pattern with above normal predictability.
A composite of overall well clustered guidance from the
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means along with
the National Blend of Models provides a seemingly good forecast
basis that tends to mitigate lingering smaller scale system
variances while maintaining good WPC product continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moderate to heavy mountain snows are likely to focus early to mid
next week across the Great Basin and Rockies as ample trough
energies dig into a amplified western U.S. trough position. A wavy
front on the leading edge of an Arctic surge set to dig through
the Northern Rockies and central U.S. early next week with have
upper support to favor a swath of heavy snow from the northern
plains/Upper Midwest to the northern Northeast. Meanwhile, ample
upper energies working downstream from the West next week will
also act to induce waves along a lead front and tap deepening
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico moisture. This is expected to
fuel a heavy rain and runoff threat from the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the Mid-Atlantic starting early
next week along with potential for re-development along the
wavy/slowed trailing front later next week. This may also support
a heavy snow/ice threat from the southern plains and
Mid-Mississippi/Ohio Valleys to the Northeast Wednesday-Friday as
the early week central U.S. Arctic blast spreads eastward. Expect
a few record cold temps over the northern Rockies/plains to
starkly contrast a few record warm pre-frontal temperatures under
the Southeast/East upper ridge.

...Early-mid next week heavy snow threat from the central Great
Basin/Rockies to the northern plains/Upper Midwest and northern
Northeast...

...Heavy rain/runoff threat from the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee
Valleys to the Mid-Atlantic Monday-Friday, with a heavy snow/ice
threat from the southern plains and Mid-Mississippi/Ohio Valleys
to the Northeast Wednesday-Friday as an early week central U.S.
Arctic Blast spreads eastward...


...Pattern Overview...

An active weather pattern will develop next week as upper troughs
dig over a cooling West and as ejecting energies and induced
frontal waves progress downstream over a Canadian high pressure
cooled central to eastern U.S. and a warming Southeast/East upper
ridge.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles offer a quite similar mid-larger scale flow
evolution next week in a pattern with above normal predictability.
A composite of overall well clustered guidance from the
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means along with
the National Blend of Models provides a seemingly good forecast
basis that tends to mitigate lingering smaller scale system
variances while maintaining good WPC product continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moderate to heavy mountain snows are likely to focus early to mid
next week across the cooling West/Rockies as potent trough
energies dig into an amplified western U.S. upper trough position.
A wavy front on the leading edge of a cold surge set to dig into
the central U.S. early-mid next week will have upper support to
favor a swath of heavy snow from the northern plains/Upper Midwest
to the northern Northeast. Meanwhile, ample upper energies working
downstream from the West next week will also act to induce waves
along a lead front and tap deepening moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico moisture. This is expected to fuel a heavy rain and runoff
threat from the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the
Mid-Atlantic starting early next week along with potential for
re-development along the wavy/slowed trailing front later next
week. This may also support a heavy snow/ice threat from the
southern plains and Mid-Mississippi/Ohio Valleys to a cold air
dammed Northeast Wednesday-Friday as the early week central U.S.
Arctic surge spreads eastward. Some record cold temps developing
into the West and over the Plains will starkly contrast record
warm pre-frontal temperatures under the Southeast/East upper ridge.

...A strong winter storm will impact the Great Lakes and Northeast
on Friday...

...Moderate snow for Midwest on Friday...

...Pockets of rain/freezing rain from parts of the Ohio Valley to
the Northeast on Friday...

A front extending from the Lower Great Lakes/Northeast
southwestward to the Central Gulf Coast will move eastward off the
East Coast by Friday evening. The system will produce showers and
thunderstorms over the Central Gulf Coast to rain along most of
the East Coast to snow and rain/freezing rain from the Ohio Valley
to the Northeast. On Friday, the strong winter storm will impact
the Great Lakes to Northern New England, producing wintry hazards
of moderate to heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain. A swath of
moderate snow is expected across far northern New York and
northern Maine by Friday morning, with the highest snowfall totals
likely just north of the Canadian border. The combination of wet
snow and strong, gusty winds will lead to reduced visibility and
hazardous travel conditions, particularly for untreated roads. A
corridor of light freezing rain and sleet are likely just to the
south of the heavy snow axis, with more than 0.1 inches of
freezing rain likely for portions of northern New York. Some
impacts to travel and power are possible in these areas.
Temperatures are expected to drop quickly behind the front. Any
untreated wet surfaces could freeze quickly. The rain and snow
will end over the Northeast by Friday evening and over the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast later Friday night. High wind will be
associated with the low moving across the Northeast as High Wind
Warnings and Wind Advisories are posted from the Northeast to the
Mid-Atlantic through mid-morning on Friday.

Meanwhile, a fast-moving area of low pressure over Western Canada
will move into the Upper Great Lakes by Friday evening and into
Northern New England by Saturday evening. The system will produce
light to moderate snow over the Upper Midwest into the Upper Great
Lakes on Friday morning into Friday evening. Along and behind this
front, narrow bands of snow squalls are likely to move rapidly
from northwest to southeast. These bands will be accompanied by
heavy snowfall rates of 1=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD/hr or more, gusty winds which m=
ay
exceed 50 mph and extremely limited visibility. This heavy snow
and wind combination will likely create dangerous travel and
slippery roads and may impact the evening rush hour around Duluth,
Minneapolis, and Green Bay. In addition, temperatures are likely
to crash rapidly behind the front leading to a rapid refreeze of
wet roadways. This front and accompanying intense snow squalls may
spread across Lower Michigan Friday night and into parts of the
Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and New England on Saturday. In addition,
Blizzard Warnings are up over parts of the Upper Mississippi
Valley through 6 Pm local time on Friday. Light snow will also
develop over parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern High
Plains ending by Friday evening. Overnight Friday, the low will
cross Ontario, Canada, crossing into the Northeast on Saturday
afternoon. The system will produce light snow over parts of the
Northeast into the Central Appalachians on Saturday. The snow will
end over the Northeast by Sunday morning.

Furthermore, another area of low pressure will move along the U.
S./Canadian border on Saturday evening into Sunday morning. As a
result, light snow will develop along the border from Saturday
evening into Sunday morning. Additionally, a weak front will move
into the Pacific Northwest also on Saturday evening into Sunday
morning. The system will produce coastal rain and higher elevation
snow from late Saturday afternoon into Sunday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CST Fri Feb 18 2022

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Within the northwesterly flow aloft across the western 2/3 of the
CONUS, a shortwave trough is forecast to traverse the Rockies and
move over the Plains by early this evening. At the surface, a weak
cold front will meander southward across the central High Plains
with westerly downslope flow developing behind it. While dry and
breezy conditions appear possible across portions of the High
Plains, uncertainty remains high regarding the potential for
sustained fire weather conditions.

...High Plains...
Westerly downslope flow will accompany a weak frontal passage early
in the day across portions of eastern CO, southern NE, and western
KS. 15-20 mph surface winds may briefly coincide with 25% surface RH
within the modest downslope flow regime. However, model guidance
shows the brunt of stronger winds will likely remain behind the
front, displaced from the lowest surface humidity. In addition to
concerns on the overlap of gusty winds and dry surface conditions,
recent snowfall may limit the availability of fine fuels. As such,
only brief, locally elevated fire weather conditions appear likely.
Fire weather concerns should remain local in nature.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 AM CST Fri Feb 18 2022

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
Northwesterly flow aloft across the CONUS will give way to more
zonal flow Saturday. A series of low-amplitude shortwave troughs
will cross the Rockies, enhancing lee troughing and forcing surface
high pressure eastward into the Ohio Valley. At the surface,
southerly return flow will strengthen, drawing a warm and dry
airmass northward across the Plains. Dry and breezy conditions will
favor elevated fire weather potential across portions of the High
Plains Saturday.

...High Plains...
Southerly surface winds will strengthen across the central and
southern High Plains Saturday in response to a deepening lee trough
and surface high pressure over the Ohio Valley. Efficient diurnal
heating/mixing and downslope flow will support RH minimums of 15-20
percent, where sustained southerly winds of 15-25 mph are expected.
This will likely result in elevated meteorological conditions across
a narrow strip of the central High Plains west of cooler
temperatures and returning surface moisture. Some uncertainty exists
regarding the availability of fine fuels across eastern CO given
recent light snowfall. While some fuels may be impacted, finer fuels
should recover quickly given the dry surface conditions and gusty
winds. As such, elevated highlights had been added for the expected
dry and breezy conditions supportive of fire weather concerns
Saturday afternoon.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A mid-level shortwave trough and accompanying strong flow aloft will
overspread the Mid-Atlantic with breezy/gusty westerly surface winds
likely across parts of VA, MD, and NC. Here, temperatures will climb
into the upper 40s to lower/middle 50s, and downslope trajectories
off the central Appalachians, combined with diurnal heating/mixing
could support minimum RH of 25-35 percent. Confidence is limited
regarding the temporal overlap of the breezy surface winds and low
RH minimums. A strong cold front will rapidly approach in the
afternoon potentially limiting the window for sustained fire weather
conditions. Recent precipitation may also limit fuel availability,
but at least brief locally elevated conditions may occur within the
drier fuels.

...A strong winter storm will be exiting the Northeast this
morning...

...Strong winds and snow squalls expected today and tonight for
the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes...

...Storm system to bring rain to the Pacific Northwest Sunday with
higher elevation snowfall from the Cascades to the Northern
Rockies...

A strong winter storm will gradually be exiting the Northeast this
morning, but not before some light snowfall accumulations and some
light icing from freezing rain occurs across portions of northern
New England. High winds though will be a concern this morning as
low pressure advances across the region, and there are High Wind
Warnings and Wind Advisories in effect through early to
mid-morning for the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, a
strong cold front associated with the departing low center will
approach the East Coast and move offshore by this afternoon. The
front will produce showers and thunderstorms across the Southeast
this morning with much colder and drier conditions arriving this
afternoon behind the front.

Meanwhile, a fast-moving area of low pressure and attendant cold
front over Western Canada will move into the Upper Great Lakes
through this evening, and into northern New England on Saturday.
Ahead of the low center, an area of light to moderate snow is
expected to overspread parts of the Upper Midwest and the Upper
Great Lakes. However, along and behind the cold front, narrow
bands of snow squalls are likely to move rapidly from northwest to
southeast. These bands will be accompanied by heavy snowfall rates
of 1=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD/hour or more, gusty winds which may exceed 50 mph an=
d
extremely limited visibility. This heavy snow and wind combination
will likely create dangerous travel and slippery roads and may
impact the evening rush hour for several major cities including
Duluth, Minneapolis, and Green Bay. In addition, temperatures are
likely to crash rapidly behind the front leading to a rapid
refreeze of any wet roadways. This front and accompanying intense
snow squalls may spread across Lower Michigan Friday night and
into parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Saturday. The
approach of this system has necessitated the issuance of Blizzard
Warnings for parts of eastern North Dakota and northwest
Minnesota, with Winter Weather Advisories in effect elsewhere
across much of the Upper Midwest and Upper Great Lakes. This
entire system will exit the Northeast by Sunday morning.

Elsewhere, a storm system and associated front will arrive across
the Pacific Northwest by Saturday evening and advance inland
across the Northwest on Sunday. This will produce rain for the
coastal ranges, but there will be enough cold air for heavy
snowfall over the higher elevations of the Cascades. This heavy
snowfall will spread east across the northern Rockies on Sunday.

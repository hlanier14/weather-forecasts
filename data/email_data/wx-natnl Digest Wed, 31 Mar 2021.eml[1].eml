CORRECTED FOR AREAL DESCRIPTION

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST ARIZONA...SOUTHERN NEW
MEXICO...AND SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough, currently noted in water-vapor imagery over
the northwestern CONUS, will shift east over the next 24 hours into
the central Plains with broad upper-level ridging expected over the
West Coast. The evolution of this upper-level pattern will favor
surface pressure falls across the far southern High Plains ahead of
a southeastward surging cold front as well as building surface high
pressure over the Great Basin. The resulting windy conditions will
introduce fire weather concerns for portions of the southern High
Plains, the central Plains, and portions of California.

...Southern Rockies/Southern High Plains...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions appear likely again
this afternoon as winds increase to around 15-25 mph amid modest
surface pressure falls over the region. Strengthening southwesterly
mid and upper-level flow coupled with deep boundary-layer mixing by
late afternoon will support wind gusts up to 30-35 mph. A
considerable westerly wind component over the southern Rockies will
favor downslope warming/drying and foster RH values falling well
below 15% over the region. Recent fuel analyses continue to show
dry, receptive fuels (which were likely exacerbated by Monday's dry,
windy conditions). As such, critical fire weather conditions are
expected again today within a broader zone of elevated conditions.

...Central Plains...
Morning observations show a very dry post-frontal air mass
(featuring dewpoints in the low single digits) upstream from the
broader NE region. Building surface high pressure over the Northwest
this afternoon will help maintain pressure gradient winds as the dry
air advects into the region. Clear skies will allow for sufficient
diurnal warming for RH values to fall into the 20-25% range.
Coincidentally, deep boundary-layer mixing and a uni-directional
wind profile will allow for efficient downward transfer of stronger
flow aloft, which could manifest at the surface as wind gusts up to
35-40 mph. Fine fuels across this region remain receptive after the
recent dry frontal passage on Monday afternoon. Elevated fire
weather conditions appear most likely over central NE, but may
extend into adjacent portions of SD and KS.

...California...
Building surface high pressure over the Northwest/northern Great
Basin will augment the offshore pressure gradient across coastal
southern CA as well as northerly flow through the Sacramento Valley.
For coastal southern CA, northeast winds are forecast to increase
through the morning and should peak this evening into early
Wednesday morning with sustained winds between 20-30 mph. Wind gusts
up to 35-55 mph are possible, especially in the more wind prone
locations along the coastal mountains and hills. Strong downslope
warming and drying will help RH values fall into the single digits
for some locations. Fuel analyses and reports continue to suggest
that fuels are generally not yet receptive across this region, but
pockets of drier fuels will support an elevated fire weather
concern.

Further north across the Sacramento Valley, diurnal heating and
falling RH into the 15-20% range, coupled with breezy northerly
winds, will support areas of elevated fire weather conditions.
Despite somewhat weaker mid-level flow compared to locations further
south, wind gusts up to 20-25 mph will be possible during peak
daytime heating.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1209 PM CDT Tue Mar 30 2021

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST ARIZONA...SOUTHERN NEW
MEXICO...AND SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

Expanded the elevated area slightly across the central Plains where
cool, but dry and breezy northwesterly flow is expected. Otherwise,
no changes.

..Bentley.. 03/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0613 AM CDT Tue Mar 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough, currently noted in water-vapor imagery over
the northwestern CONUS, will shift east over the next 24 hours into
the central Plains with broad upper-level ridging expected over the
West Coast. The evolution of this upper-level pattern will favor
surface pressure falls across the far southern High Plains ahead of
a southeastward surging cold front as well as building surface high
pressure over the Great Basin. The resulting windy conditions will
introduce fire weather concerns for portions of the southern High
Plains, the central Plains, and portions of California.

...Southern Rockies/Southern High Plains...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions appear likely again
this afternoon as winds increase to around 15-25 mph amid modest
surface pressure falls over the region. Strengthening southwesterly
mid and upper-level flow coupled with deep boundary-layer mixing by
late afternoon will support wind gusts up to 30-35 mph. A
considerable westerly wind component over the southern Rockies will
favor downslope warming/drying and foster RH values falling well
below 15% over the region. Recent fuel analyses continue to show
dry, receptive fuels (which were likely exacerbated by Monday's dry,
windy conditions). As such, critical fire weather conditions are
expected again today within a broader zone of elevated conditions.

...Central Plains...
Morning observations show a very dry post-frontal air mass
(featuring dewpoints in the low single digits) upstream from the
broader NE region. Building surface high pressure over the Northwest
this afternoon will help maintain pressure gradient winds as the dry
air advects into the region. Clear skies will allow for sufficient
diurnal warming for RH values to fall into the 20-25% range.
Coincidentally, deep boundary-layer mixing and a uni-directional
wind profile will allow for efficient downward transfer of stronger
flow aloft, which could manifest at the surface as wind gusts up to
35-40 mph. Fine fuels across this region remain receptive after the
recent dry frontal passage on Monday afternoon. Elevated fire
weather conditions appear most likely over central NE, but may
extend into adjacent portions of SD and KS.

...California...
Building surface high pressure over the Northwest/northern Great
Basin will augment the offshore pressure gradient across coastal
southern CA as well as northerly flow through the Sacramento Valley.
For coastal southern CA, northeast winds are forecast to increase
through the morning and should peak this evening into early
Wednesday morning with sustained winds between 20-30 mph. Wind gusts
up to 35-55 mph are possible, especially in the more wind prone
locations along the coastal mountains and hills. Strong downslope
warming and drying will help RH values fall into the single digits
for some locations. Fuel analyses and reports continue to suggest
that fuels are generally not yet receptive across this region, but
pockets of drier fuels will support an elevated fire weather
concern.

Further north across the Sacramento Valley, diurnal heating and
falling RH into the 15-20% range, coupled with breezy northerly
winds, will support areas of elevated fire weather conditions.
Despite somewhat weaker mid-level flow compared to locations further
south, wind gusts up to 20-25 mph will be possible during peak
daytime heating.

Upper ridging/blocking will meander over the northern Atlantic and
Pacific with another upper high near Baja California Sur will
favor troughing easing toward the west coast and lingering off the
Northeast coast. This will leave ridging across much of the middle
of the lower 48 amid a rather dry pattern. Some precipitation will
move into the West next week with uncertainty in its timing.

...Model Preferences and Predictability Assessment...

Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the models and ensembles were in good
agreement to start the forecast with the exiting upper low in the
Northeast/southeast Canada that will split into a northern and
southern entity. The southern portion will linger just off
southeastern New England early next week until ridging from the
west nudges it farther out to sea. However, that also depends on
how troughing off the West coast evolves through the period. A
trough will sink southward out of the Gulf of Alaska late this
week into the weekend and split off another trough to its
southwest. The northern part will either move east-southeastward
through the Pac NW/northern Rockies and atop the central CONUS
ridging while the southern part may close off an upper low well
west of California (~150W). The difference then lies in the
quicker vs slower northern portion (generally GFS vs ECMWF) and
how quickly (or not) the southern upper low moves east toward
California. The ECMWF has been more consistent in its evolution
that brings that southern upper low to the CA coast sometime late
Mon into Tue (and mostly absorbing the northern portion into it)
which seemed to fit more with its own ensemble mean as well as the
GEFS mean. Given such an amplified pattern (which fits
climatologically with the time of year) preferred to side with the
slower side of the guidance but not as slow as the ECMWF. This fit
nicely with the best ECMWF/GEFS ensemble overlap.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Broad ridging will maintain a rather dry period for much of the
CONUS, with the exception of 1) the West as the upper trough
likely approaches CA and southwest flow aloft overspreads the
Great Basin and Rockies and 2) the Upper Midwest along a frontal
zone. In either case, limited moisture may prevent much more than
light to perhaps modest amounts. Off the East Coast, an ocean
system may stay just far enough offshore to keep any precipitation
associated with it off the coast, but a weakening front and/or a
surface trough may touch off a few showers this weekend.

Temperatures will be well below normal Friday into Saturday
morning in the Southeast 1/4 of the CONUS where some record lows
are possible. In addition, freezes are likely for some areas that
may have passed their average last freeze date. Temperatures
between the Rockies and Great Lakes will be above normal through
the period, perhaps by as much as 15-25 degrees (well into the 70s
to low 80s for the Plains). This will extend to the Southwest as
well where the deserts may approach 100 degrees. This will be the
hottest temperature so far this year for many locations and record
highs may be broken from the Southwest to the northern Plains this
weekend. The West coast will trend cooler with time as troughing
inches closer.

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 301848
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 30 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is fair model agreement regarding an amplified mid-level
pattern at the beginning of the period, with high pressure dominating the
eastern half of the lower 48 and mid-level low pressure across the western
half, deamplifying throughout the period. There is less model agreement from
the middle to end of the period as the pattern weakens and waves of mid-level
low pressure progresses across the Contiguous U.S. These mid-level lows may
support series of surface lows forming over the central and western lower 48
with associated frontal boundaries moving eastward across the country. A
series
of surface lows are anticipated to form over the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska
throughout the outlook period. Surface high pressure over many parts of
mainland Alaska may bring much below normal temperatures to the region at the
beginning of week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of high winds across parts of the Northern and Central Great
Plains, Central Rockies, and Central Great Basin, Wed-Fri, Apr 7-9.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of eastern
Mainland Alaska, Wed-Thu, Apr 7-8.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across many inland parts of
Mainland Alaska, Wed-Fri, Apr 7-9.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 02 - TUESDAY APRIL 06:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!uj75XwZQTbXJ_eTZh3eAW5DVB1lbX65zvjfXZnW8ANfkodoTYGN1bFP8c5haBv5Zm3Z6AQNj$

FOR WEDNESDAY APRIL 07 - TUESDAY APRIL 13: There is relatively good model
agreement and run to run model consistency amongst the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble
means indicating amplified mid-level high pressure over the eastern half of
the
CONUS and mid-level low pressure over the western half at the start of week-2.
Model agreement decreases by the middle of the period as the mid-level pattern
is forecast to deamplify, with a series of shortwave troughs traversing the
lower 48. The signal for much below normal temperatures is significantly
weaker
in the model guidance today, as well as weakening negative mid-level height
departures across the western CONUS. Therefore, the slight risk for much below
normal temperatures across the northwestern quadrant of the CONUS is removed
in
today's hazards outlook.





A series of surface lows are predicted to form over the central and western
CONUS, with associated frontal activity possibly moving across the central and
eastern CONUS throughout week-2. These surface lows and fronts may support
periods of localized high winds across parts of the southwestern and central
CONUS during the period. A slight risk of high winds is posted across parts of
the Northern and Central Great Plains, Central Rockies, and Central Great
Basin, Apr 7 to 9, where both the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20%
chance of sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph.
There
are greater than 30% probabilities indicated by the reforecast tools for
maximum wind speeds exceeding the aforementioned thresholds over the Four
Corners Region and the Northern Rockies. Enhanced wind speeds may also support
increase the risk for wildfires across parts of the Southwest, western Texas,
and parts of the Great Plains, where the National Interagency Fire Center
shows
increased risk of significant fire potential during week-1, amidst anomalously
dry conditions. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools do not indicate any strong
signals for a widespread area receiving 3-day accumulated precipitation
amounts
reaching predetermined hazards criteria, precluding designation of a related
heavy precipitation hazard.



There continues to be good agreement amongst the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means
indicating negative mid-level 500-hPa height departures over many parts of
Mainland Alaska during week-2, excluding the southwestern Mainland. Surface
high pressure over much of the Mainland is anticipated to bring anomalous cold
into many parts of the state. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools generally
show lower probabilities compared to yesterday regarding minimum temperatures
falling to the lowest 10th percentile. Despite a slightly weaker signal in the
reforecast tools, there is still relatively good agreement between them
supporting a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is maintained
across
many inland portions of Mainland Alaska, Apr 7 to 9, where there is the
greatest likelihood for temperatures to be deemed hazardous. A moderate risk
for much below normal temperatures is posted across eastern Mainland Alaska,
where there is greater than 40% chances of minimum temperatures falling to the
lowest 10th percentile, Apr 7 to 8. Some areas may experience minimum
temperatures falling below -20 DegF, with localized areas possibly reaching or
approaching record low temperatures in Interior Alaska at the beginning of
week-2. High pressure across the Yukon combined with possible surface low
formation over the Gulf of Alaska could increase chances for localized gap and
outflow winds, mainly over the Kenai Peninsula, at the beginning of week-2.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue March 30 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 05 - 09 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement in predicting an amplified
500-hPa pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10
day period. Dynamical models forecast a 500-hPa ridge and associated above
normal heights over the Northern Pacificextending across southwestern Alaska.
A
trough with below normal heights is forecast from northern Mainland Alaska
down
to the western CONUS. A broad ridge is favored to strengthen over the central
and eastern CONUS, resulting in predicted above normal heights.

Probabilities of below normal temperatures are enhanced across the West Coast
of the CONUS to parts of the Great Basin and the Northern Rockies, associated
with below normal heights. Broad ridging predicted over the central and
eastern
CONUS favors above normal temperatures for most of the rest of the CONUS.
Forecast surface low pressure systems over southern Alaska increase the odds
of
below normal temperatures across the Mainland and the Panhandle. Above normal
500-hPa heights increase chances of above normal temperatures over the western
Aleutians.

The troughing continues to favor above normal precipitation for Alaska.
Enhanced troughing over the western CONUS leads to elevated chances of near to
above normal precipitation over the Northern Rockies, extending to much of the
Great Plains, Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes. Increased odds of below
normal precipitation are indicated across the eastern CONUS, underneath
predicted mean ridging. Above normal heights also favor below normal
precipitation over parts of the Southern High Plains and Southern Rockies,
consistent with the forecast from the consolidation tool.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 07 - 13 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is generally forecast to
shift eastward and deamplify compared to the 6-10 day period. A 500-hPa ridge
is forecast across the central and eastern CONUS with associated above normal
heights. Below normal heights are forecast over the western CONUS due to a
persistent through. Ridging is forecast across southwestern Alaska with the
manual blend depicting above normal heights, while troughing is forecast
across
much of the remainder of Alaska, with below normal heights likely.

Forecast surface low pressure leads to increased chances of below normal
temperatures across Alaska, except over parts of the Aleutians. Troughing
favors below normal temperatures across the western CONUS. Elevated chances of
near to above normal temperatures are forecast across the remainder CONUS
associated with mean ridging.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across much of Alaska
due to predicted troughting. Anomalous trouging across the western CONUS
elevates chances of above normal precipitation over parts of the Northern
Plains and Mississippi valley, while below normal precipitation is favored for
the southwestern CONUS, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.
Below normal precipitation is also favored for the Eastern Seaboard ahead of
the predicted ridging.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty in regards to the temperature and precipitation
forecast
over the CONUS.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Tue Mar 30 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

A broad area of elevated conditions has been highlighted from
eastern Montana across the central Plains and portions of the
mid-Missouri Valley continuing southwestward across Oklahoma and
Texas to the Mexico border. High pressure will be in place across
this entire region which will allow for clear skies and a deeply
mixed boundary layer. Conditions will vary throughout this large
elevated area with some areas experiencing lower relative humidity
and lighter winds and other areas receiving stronger winds but
higher relative humidity. Regardless, most of this region is
expected to receive elevated to near critical conditions. Given that
there were several large grass fires yesterday across a similar area
during dry and windy conditions, a broad elevated area seems
appropriate.

Critical fire weather conditions may be possible across portions of
Nebraska and Kansas and across Missouri into Illinois. However,
fuels are not as dry in this region as farther west and therefore an
elevated delineation should be sufficient for the current
meteorological forecast.

..Bentley.. 03/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0306 AM CDT Tue Mar 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will continue to build over the West through
Wednesday, resulting in a northwesterly flow regime over the central
CONUS. A dry, post-frontal air mass will continue to overspread the
Plains and support some fire weather concerns. Additionally, a
persistent off-shore wind event will continue into Wednesday for
coastal southern California.

...Southern California...
Guidance has shown reasonable agreement that the off-shore wind
event will continue from overnight Tuesday into the day Wednesday.
Although winds may be slightly weaker than the overnight Tues/early
Wednesday period, warming temperatures and a prolonged period of
downslope flow will likely result in widespread RH values in the low
single digits. This, combined with drying on Tuesday, may help cure
some fine fuels and contribute to the elevated fire weather concern.
However, most fuels should remain only marginally receptive and
preclude a higher fire weather threat.

...Texas Hill Country...
A dry post-frontal air mass is expected to overspread much of the
southern Plains and extend to the U.S./Mexico border by early
Wednesday. Despite cooler temperatures, clear skies should allow for
enough warming to support RH reductions down to around 20% (and
perhaps as low as 15% for a few locations). Winds between 15-20 mph
with wind gusts up to 25 mph are expected behind the cold front in
the morning hours and should overlap with the diurnally reduced RH
for at least 2-3 hours to support an elevated fire weather concern.
The spatial extent of this threat is not certain due to spread in
guidance, but may extend as far north as the OK/TX border.

...The Central Plains...
Strong northwesterly winds should be in place over a broad swath
from eastern MT southeastward into eastern KS/western MO by
Wednesday afternoon. Deep boundary-layer mixing, perhaps aided by
modest mid-level cold advection, should allow for efficient downward
transfer of 30-35 mph winds. While confidence in widespread elevated
fire weather conditions is low due to uncertainty in the RH
forecast, localized elevated conditions are possible where diurnal
heating allows RH to fall into the 20-25% range and 15-20 mph winds
(with frequent wind gusts above 30 mph) can occur.

...More heavy rain and scattered flash flooding possible for the
lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys into tonight and Wednesday
morning...

...Showers and thunderstorms moving through the East Coast on
Wednesday will be followed rapidly falling temperatures on
Thursday...

...Cold air funneling in behind a developing low pressure system
will bring accumulating snowfall across Upstate New York while
Santa Ana winds are expected to impact parts of California...

The focus for much of the active weather during the next couple of
days will be across the eastern U.S. as a low pressure wave is
forecast to intensify rapidly along a strong cold front.  This
cold front is currently associated with a deep low pressure system
moving across south-central Canada.  Strong and gusty winds behind
this system across the northern Plains will continue to diminish
as the storm moves farther away into tonight.  Temperatures 10 to
20 degrees below average will overspread much of the northern and
central Rockies as well as the Plains on Wednesday but will make a
sharp rebound to as high as the 70s on Thursday.  Farther south,
as the cold front pushes across the southern High Plains and the
southern Rockies, gusty winds and low relative humidity could make
conditions ideal for wildfires to spread uncontrollably.

Meanwhile, a warm front lifting north out of the Gulf of Mexico
today will usher in an abundance of moisture to the Lower
Mississippi Valley, leading to an expansion of showers and
thunderstorms as the aforementioned cold front approaches from the
northwest.  Heavy rain is forecast to spread across the Tennessee
Valley by this evening and last into Wednesday morning. Total
rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches could lead to flooding concerns
from southern Arkansas to Middle Tennessee.  Much of this region
has experienced well above average rainfall over the last week.
Any additional heavy rain will likely cause rivers to overflow
their banks quickly.  Low-lying areas prone to flooding are likely
to see the most impacts.  WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall that includes southern Arkansas, northern
Mississippi, and west/central Tennessee.  A few thunderstorms will
also have the potential to produce damaging wind gusts and large
hail.

By Wednesday, showers and thunderstorms will slowly exit the
Tennessee Valley and enter the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.  A few
isolated instances of flash flooding will be possible from the
southern Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic.  Severe weather will
also be a concern for the Deep South on Wednesday, with a marginal
chance up into the Mid-Atlantic.  As the cold front reaches the
Mid-Atlantic coast Wednesday evening, an area of low pressure is
forecast to develop and strengthen as it swings northeast toward
New England.  This will help usher in much cooler temperatures
behind the cold front, while also focusing moderate rain along the
coast. Rain is likely to changeover to snow across interior
portions of the Northeast and Lower Great Lakes as temperatures
quickly drop to near and below freezing Wednesday night.  A few
inches of wet snow are expected by Thursday morning, mainly across
western and northern New York State.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
457 PM EDT Tue Mar 30 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 02 2021 - 12Z Tue Apr 06 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging/blocking will meander over the northern Atlantic and
Pacific with another upper high near Baja California Sur will
favor troughing easing toward the west coast and lingering off the
Northeast coast. This will leave ridging across much of the middle
of the lower 48 amid a rather dry pattern. Some precipitation will
move into the West next week with uncertainty in its timing.

...Model Preferences and Predictability Assessment...

Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the models and ensembles were in good
agreement to start the forecast with the exiting upper low in the
Northeast/southeast Canada that will split into a northern and
southern entity. The southern portion will linger just off
southeastern New England early next week until ridging from the
west nudges it farther out to sea. However, that also depends on
how troughing off the West coast evolves through the period. A
trough will sink southward out of the Gulf of Alaska late this
week into the weekend and split off another trough to its
southwest. The northern part will either move east-southeastward
through the Pac NW/northern Rockies and atop the central CONUS
ridging while the southern part may close off an upper low well
west of California (~150W). The difference then lies in the
quicker vs slower northern portion (generally GFS vs ECMWF) and
how quickly (or not) the southern upper low moves east toward
California. The ECMWF has been more consistent in its evolution
that brings that southern upper low to the CA coast sometime late
Mon into Tue (and mostly absorbing the northern portion into it)
which seemed to fit more with its own ensemble mean as well as the
GEFS mean. Given such an amplified pattern (which fits
climatologically with the time of year) preferred to side with the
slower side of the guidance but not as slow as the ECMWF. This fit
nicely with the best ECMWF/GEFS ensemble overlap.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Broad ridging will maintain a rather dry period for much of the
CONUS, with the exception of 1) the West as the upper trough
likely approaches CA and southwest flow aloft overspreads the
Great Basin and Rockies and 2) the Upper Midwest along a frontal
zone. In either case, limited moisture may prevent much more than
light to perhaps modest amounts. Off the East Coast, an ocean
system may stay just far enough offshore to keep any precipitation
associated with it off the coast, but a weakening front and/or a
surface trough may touch off a few showers this weekend.

Temperatures will be well below normal Friday into Saturday
morning in the Southeast 1/4 of the CONUS where some record lows
are possible. In addition, freezes are likely for some areas that
may have passed their average last freeze date. Temperatures
between the Rockies and Great Lakes will be above normal through
the period, perhaps by as much as 15-25 degrees (well into the 70s
to low 80s for the Plains). This will extend to the Southwest as
well where the deserts may approach 100 degrees. This will be the
hottest temperature so far this year for many locations and record
highs may be broken from the Southwest to the northern Plains this
weekend. The West coast will trend cooler with time as troughing
inches closer.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0114 AM CDT Wed Mar 31 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals an upper-level longwave
trough in place over the central U.S. as a surface cold front
continues to push south/southeastward into the Southern Plains and
lower MS river valley. This large-scale trough will undergo gradual
amplification as it translates eastward over the next 24 hours amid
mid-level cold advection over the central Plains to the Midwest. The
resulting height rises and northwesterly flow regime over the Plains
will favor breezy conditions and mostly clear skies over a region
with dry fuels and low humidity. To the west, surface high pressure
over the inter-mountain West and an offshore low will foster another
day of dry offshore winds across southern California that will
introduce fire weather concerns.

...Greater Plains region...
A dry air mass is noted across much of the Plains with dewpoints in
the single digits from eastern MT southward into NE (and only
marginal improvements further south into KS). Although temperatures
will be cooler than previous days, mostly clear skies will help
afternoon RH values fall into the 20-30% range for most locations. A
northwesterly flow regime aloft will feature 30-40 mph mid-level
winds that will likely be able to mix down by late afternoon. The
axis of stronger winds should extend from central SD southeastward
into eastern MO. While a variety of RH/wind combinations are
expected within the broader elevated region, the highest potential
for sustained elevated (and perhaps briefly critical) fire weather
conditions will reside within this corridor.

Further south into west TX, 15-25 mph northeasterly winds behind the
cold front are forecast to gradually weaken through the day.
However, dry air advecting into the region from the north combined
with diurnal heating will allow for a few hours of overlapping
15-20% RH and breezy winds. Elevated fire weather conditions are
expected across the broader west TX region, and transient critical
conditions are possible where RH can fall below 15%.

...Southern California...
Although early-morning observations show weak winds, relative
humidity values in the coastal hills and mountains remain in the
5-15% range with little overnight recovery expected through sunrise
for the higher terrain. Winds are expected to increase after sunrise
and into the afternoon hours with peak sustained winds near 25-30
mph (gusting to 45-55 mph). Downslope warming/drying coupled with
antecedent dry conditions should yield RH values in the single
digits for many locations. While critical wind/RH conditions are
possible, fuels remain marginally receptive and precludes the
introduction of a critical risk area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 AM CDT Wed Mar 31 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow is forecast to increase over the northern and southern
Rockies Thursday as an upper-level ridge translates east towards the
Plains. This will favor lee surface pressure falls as well as
increasing downslope flow. With dry fuels already in place across
the northern Plains and along the southern High Plains, elevated
fire weather conditions appear likely.

...Northern Plains...
Recent ensemble guidance suggests an embedded shortwave impulse may
propagate through the apex of the upper-level ridge over the
northern Rockies and into the Canadian Prairies through the day
Thursday. As a result, a lee low will likely deepen over central
Canada and support strong south to southwesterly winds over the
northern Plains. Winds between 15-20 mph appear likely and may be
sustained near 25 mph for a few locations. Little moisture recovery
expected through Thursday and a slight downslope component to the
winds over eastern MT will support RH reductions between 20-30%.
Curing grasses and other fine fuels will support an elevated fire
weather concern, though brief critical conditions are possible where
stronger winds and lower RH can overlap.

...Southern High Plains...
Modest lee troughing along the High Plains juxtaposed next to a
surface high over the MS river valley will augment the pressure
gradient over the southern High Plains Thursday afternoon. Winds
between 15-20 mph appear likely, and although minimal downslope
warming/drying is expected, little to no moisture return into the
region will help afternoon RH values fall to near 15%. Fine fuels
generally remain receptive over this region after several days of
warm/dry conditions and will support an elevated fire weather
concern.

...Central Arizona...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected across central AZ
Thursday afternoon as southeasterly winds increase to 15-20 mph and
RH values fall into the low teens. While confidence in these
meteorological conditions appears high, recent fuel analyses show
ERC values are near normal seasonal values for most locations. While
this precludes the introduction of a broader risk area, locations
with receptive fuels should anticipate periods of elevated fire
weather conditions.

...Southeast...
Elevated fire weather conditions are also possible across southern
AL/GA into northern FL as a dry post-frontal air mass becomes
established over the region. Winds up to 15 mph with RH values as
low as 35% are possible, but as with central AZ, fuels across this
region are generally not receptive (10-hour fuel moisture values
above 20% are noted across this region). Additionally, precipitation
chances on Tuesday may further contribute to fuel moisture.

...Severe weather and flash flooding possible across the Southeast
and Mid-Atlantic today...

...Developing area of low pressure to bring heavy snow across
portions of Upstate New York and northern Vermont between
Wednesday night and Thursday...

...Record-breaking cold to engulf much of the eastern U.S. from
the Lower Mississippi Valley to Northeast by Friday morning...

The final day of March will feature a strong cold front continuing
to swing across the eastern U.S., producing areas of severe
thunderstorms and heavy rain from the Southeast to Mid-Atlantic.
Showers and thunderstorms are currently impacting the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee valleys this morning ahead of an
approaching cold front. This activity is expected to push eastward
and into the Southeast by this afternoon. Moderate-to-heavy rain
may also develop across the Mid-Atlantic as an area of low
pressure forms along the frontal system across the area this
evening. Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches, with locally higher
amounts, are forecast from southern Mississippi to the southern
Appalachians. WPC has issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall
that includes much of this region. Scattered flash flooding will
be possible where repeating downpours occur. Much of this area has
experienced well above average rainfall over the past few weeks,
which will make soils sensitive to additional heavy rain. Flash
Flood Watches are currently in effect across the Tennessee Valley
for rainfall occurring this morning, with watches also extending
across northern Mississippi and the southern Appalachians. Another
hazard to contend with today will be severe weather. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
from southern Mississippi to the central Carolinas. Damaging wind
gusts will be the main concern, with isolated tornadoes possible
particularly throughout south-central Alabama during the late
afternoon to early evening hours.

As a low pressure system gains strength Wednesday night into
Thursday morning across the Northeast and southern New England,
heavy snow is expected to develop across Upstate New York and
northern Vermont. Cold temperatures surging into the region behind
a cold front will set the stage for a potentially impactful spring
snowstorm. Snow showers are forecast to taper off by Thursday
evening, but not before over 4 inches of wet snow accumulates
between the southern tier of New York and the Adirondacks, as well
as northern Vermont. The heaviest snow is expected across the
Adirondack Mountains, where up to a foot of snow is possible.
Winter Storm Watches have been posted. On the warm side of the
storm system, light-to-moderate rain will impact the Northeast
Wednesday night and move into northern New England by Thursday
morning. The combination of warm temperatures, melting snow, and
rain could cause rivers to rise and ice jams to form across
northern Maine. Flash Flood Watches have been issued here to
highlight the potential hazard.

Meanwhile, bitter and winter-like cold will be found across the
eastern U.S. behind the aforementioned cold front. Freeze Warnings
are in effect this morning across the Middle Mississippi and
Tennessee valleys. Temperatures 15 to 25 degrees below average and
even colder wind chill values will enter the Southeast,
Appalachians, and interior sections of the Northeast on Thursday.
However, the coldest time period is expected to be on Friday
morning as a strong high pressure system settles over the Ohio
Valley. This will allow for temperatures to drop into the 20s as
far south as the Mid-Atlantic and Tennessee Valley. This may lead
to damage to early-season crops and foliage. Many record lows are
forecast to be tied or broken throughout the Deep South,
Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys.

Elsewhere, the western and central U.S. will have a tranquil end
of March and beginning of April with virtually no precipitation
forecast. A warming trend will also lead to well above average
temperatures to pair with the dry weather. The Southern Plains and
Pacific Northwest will be the only exceptions, with temperatures
remaining slightly below average through Friday morning. For
southern California, Wind Advisories are in effect today as Santa
Ana winds develop behind a dry cold front. Wind gusts up to 50 mph
could blow around unsecured objects and raise the fire danger
across the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1029 AM CST Fri Feb 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed for the ongoing forecast. Morning surface
observations from southern AZ and NM show humidity values generally
above 30%, which should fall to near 20% as cloud cover decreases by
late afternoon. With winds increasing to 15-20 mph, a few areas of
elevated conditions are possible - especially across southeast AZ
and southern NM. However, these conditions are expected to generally
remain transient and/or localized.

..Moore.. 02/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CST Fri Feb 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
With a 1040+ mb surface high expected to be entrenched in the
northern and central Plains, very cold temperatures east of the
Divide will greatly limit fire weather concerns today. An
upper-level trough will move into the Southwest and bring a Pacific
cold front eastward. Ahead of the front and to the west of the cold
Plains' air, locally elevated conditions are possible in parts of
southern Arizona and New Mexico. Fuels remain dry under drought
conditions, but RH in most areas is unlikely to drop below critical
thresholds given the mid/upper-level clouds expected.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1259 PM CST Fri Feb 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed for the ongoing forecast. Windy conditions are
forecast for portions of southeast CA and southern NV as a surface
low deepens over the Four Corners. Transient elevated conditions are
possible for this region as winds increase to around 20 mph with RH
values in the low 20s and upper teens. However, fuels across this
region are not overly receptive, especially after light rainfall
today. The transient nature of the threat over poor fuels precludes

...Synopsis...
Another upper-level trough will deepen and approach the Four Corners
on Saturday. Cold air will remain east of the Divide. While some
areas of Southwest may remain dry and marginally breezy, slightly
cooler temperatures than Friday and continued possibility of
mid/high clouds should keep fire concerns low. No fire weather
concerns are expected elsewhere across the country.

...Widespread record cold temperatures over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley into early next week followed by only gradual
moderation...

...Stormy pattern will bring multiple wintry precipitation events
from coast to coast, with heavy rainfall potential across parts of
the East late next week...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Today's guidance continues to show a very active synoptic pattern
through much of the medium range period, with a series of systems
digging into and ejecting from a long-term mean trough aloft
anchored over the contiguous U.S.. These systems will bring
periods of active weather for the Western states, as well as parts
of the Southern Plains and through a large part of the East.
Across the Plains and into the Mississippi Valley, record cold is
especially likely through Tuesday and may extend through midweek
at a few locations. As upper troughing heads into the East by late
next week and upstream troughing holds back over the eastern
Pacific, models indicate an evolution toward higher heights aloft
over the western/central U.S., possibly to the point of a flat
ridge building across those areas.

At least through the 06Z cycle the expected pattern and most of
the spread/uncertainties involved did not change much over the
past day, so the forecast approach likewise maintained continuity.
This focused on a composite of 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF/UKMET ideas
for the first half of the period followed by a transition toward
the ECMWF/GFS and their respective ensemble means. Also toward the
latter part of the week the ECMWF component included some of the
prior 12Z/11 run.

The exact structure of the system affecting the East early-mid
week remains uncertain and clustering is still about the
same--ECMWF/ECMWF mean/UKMET a little deeper aloft with slower
timing and somewhat more inland low emphasis versus the GFS/GEFS
mean. In addition the CMC/CMC mean continue to differ from other
guidance in what happens to the upper low that tracks north of
Lake Superior in the short range, offering a lurking risk of
adjustments to a solution somewhere between the GFS and ECMWF
ideas. Sure enough the 12Z ECMWF holds back the upper low with
leading flow yielding a faster eastern system.

Concerning the next shortwave to drop through the West and amplify
into the mean trough early-mid week and continue into toward the
eastern U.S. thereafter, the spread remains moderate relative to
typical disagreements/model errors at extended time frames.
Developing timing differences for the upper trough and associated
surface system are due in part to issues with flow upstream.  By
late in the week the 00Z ECMWF/CMC and their means bring somewhat
more energy into the West, leading to relatively flat flow versus
the GFS/GEFS mean.  New 12Z runs of the GFS/GEFS/CMC show similar
shapes to their previous run but the CMC has raised its western
heights.  The upstream flow in the ECMWF leads to a farther
eastward East Coast system versus some of its prior runs (though
the ECMWF mean has been more consistent with this idea).  On the
other hand operational GFS runs are a bit on the slower/amplified
side with the upper trough heading into the East. Prefer to
maintain an intermediate solution for this system, which happens
to be similar to where the new 12Z CMC has settled by early
Friday.  This intermediate approach also serves well for resolving
differences for late-week Northeast Pacific low pressure and the
trailing front likely to push into the Northwest.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The period starts out with a surface low tracking from the Gulf
into the Eastern U.S. Monday-Tuesday accompanied by a broad area
of precipitation. The greatest winter weather threats will extend
from the Lower Mississippi Valley, across the Ohio Valley, and
into the Northeast. Snow will fall sufficiently far into the cold
air, but there will be potential for areas of significant
sleet/freezing rain south of the snow area. Wintry weather may
extend unusually far southward over the southeastern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley given the extremely cold air in place over the
central U.S. early in the week. Meanwhile rain may be locally
moderate to heavy at times across the Tennessee
Valley/Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic.

The next system that reaches the Northwest early next week should
bring a couple of waves of precipitation into the Pacific
Northwest/northern California with snow mainly confined to the
mountains. The moisture will continue southeastward through the
Great Basin and the Rockies, followed by increasing coverage and
intensity of precipitation over the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley into the East from Wednesday to Friday. As
upper ridging from the Atlantic builds toward southern Florida and
the upper trough heads into the Plains/northern Mexico, combined
with a more favorable surface evolution, the system may feature a
stronger flow of moisture from the Gulf than the preceding system
early in the week. Therefore the heavy precipitation potential
will require monitoring over the coming days. As with the previous
system, expect a broad area of winter weather impacts from the
Southern Plains northeastward.

The upstream Pacific front heading into the Northwest late in the
week will likely bring moisture into the Pacific Northwest around
Wednesday night, with rain and mountain snow continuing for the
next couple days while moisture also spreads farther inland.

The combination of the above systems should generate one area of
significant precipitation totals extending from near the Gulf
Coast into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, with the exact axis of
highest totals to be determined by each system's track/timing.
Also note that the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring severe
potential within the warm sector of both eastern systems, with
further details to be better resolved over coming days.  Over the
West expect favored terrain of the coastal ranges from Washington
into extreme northern California as well as the Cascades to see
the highest liquid equivalents.  The northern Rockies will see
significant precipitation but with somewhat lesser totals, with
more moderate amounts extending farther south over the Sierra
Nevada, Great Basin, and central/southern Rockies.

Still anticipate a widespread area of record lows/cold highs over
the Plains and lower/mid Mississippi Valley into Tuesday with
temperatures of at least 30-45F below normal. A few locations in
Texas/Oklahoma or nearby could even see daytime highs 50F or so
below normal on Monday. Although the central U.S. will see
moderating temperatures by mid-late week, this may involve
anomalies recovering to "only" 20-30F below normal. Highs could
moderate a little more by Friday afternoon. Some of this cold air
will extend in modified fashion into the Ohio Valley and vicinity,
and at times farther eastward. Temperatures in the West will be
near to moderately below normal early-mid week followed by a
warming trend as heights aloft increase. By the end of the week
the Southwest may trend above normal and the northern Plains could
reach above normal values as well. The extreme Southeast/Florida
will be the one area of persistent warmth, with lows in particular
expected to be well above normal most days. However by Friday
below normal temperatures may creep into the Sunshine State as a
front crosses the area late in the week.

300 PM EST February 12 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is likely to promote much below normal
temperatures for much of the central and eastern U.S. during early week-2.
Forecast onshore flow and mid-level low pressure over the Pacific Northwest
increases chances for heavy high-elevation snow over the Cascades and much
below normal temperatures across the contiguous northwestern U.S. Over Alaska,
mid-level low pressure is expected to promote potentially hazardous
below-normal temperatures over much of the Mainland during week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Southeast, and the Great Lakes, Sat,
Feb 20.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the central and
eastern U.S., Sat-Sun, Feb 20-21.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the northwestern
CONUS, Thu-Fri, Feb 25-26.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, Central
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast, Sat-Sun, Feb 20-21.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Cascades, Sat-Fri,
Feb 20-26.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of Mainland Alaska,
Sat-Fri, Feb 20-26.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY FEBRUARY 15 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 19:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!v-FDnU3iw0FRVU7cBPm7RTi5ewF9b6MYf9wLXvuIVfc2egyDy0Aeks16-cWtaqjgZhl_TPnp$

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 20 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 26: A deep mid-level trough is
forecast to promote widespread, anomalously cold temperatures for many parts
of
the country east of the Rockies during late week-1, but is expected to weaken
and lift out by the start of the outlook period. Subtropical ridging is then
favored to develop across the southern tier of the CONUS, with models
depicting
increasing mid-level height departures over the eastern third of the CONUS
during the early portion of week-2. Over the past few days, the GEFS and ECMWF
ensemble means have been in good agreement and consistent with this evolution,
thereby increasing confidence for a moderation of temperatures which should
help mitigate concerns in the livestock, agriculture, and energy sectors
likely
to be adversely impacted by the anomalous cold during mid-February,
particularly across the Plains and the Mississippi Valley. However, attention
is beginning to shift further west as hazard potential looks to increase
across
western North America during late February. Models continue to advertise
onshore flow conducive for potentially heavy precipitation during week-2, as
well as the development of anomalous mid-level troughing shifting south from
Alaska to elevate the risk of much below normal temperatures over the
northwestern CONUS later in the outlook period.



With surface high pressure and anomalous cold air lingering over portions of
the Plains and Mississippi Valley early in the period, reforecast tools
continue to show a fairly broad coverage of elevated chances (>20%) for
minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile. Higher probabilities (>40%)
remain concentrated in the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and a
moderate risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for this region for
Feb 20.  As the axis of the coldest temperatures follows the mid-level trough
weakening and lifting out during this time, a slight risk of much below normal
temperatures remains posted through Feb 21 extending from the Southern Plains
through the Northeast. Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to favor
much
of the surface high pressure to shift eastward, allowing for return flow to
bring warmer temperatures across the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley by
the
middle of the period.



During late week-1, a surface low is forecast to develop across the Southeast
and track across the Northeast. Much of the enhanced precipitation and
potentially heavy snowfall associated with this deepening surface low looks to
occur prior to the start of week-2, and the corresponding slight risk region
for heavy snow has been removed from today's outlook. However, models continue
to depict a fairly strong pressure gradient behind the departing low which
supports increased chances for high surface winds. Reforecast guidance
indicates elevated chances sustained winds exceed the 85th percentile and
25mph
early in the period and a slight risk of high winds is posted for Feb 20 to 21
across the Northeast.  By day 10 (Feb 22), deterministic and ensemble
solutions
hint at the development of another surface low tracking across the Great Lakes
region, though, the risk for heavy precipitation or snow looks tenuous at this
time.



Across the Pacific Northwest, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to
favor onshore flow and increased chances for above-normal precipitation during
week-2. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20%
chance
for precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile throughout
week-2. Although precipitation amounts are not expected to exceed hazards
criteria, the increase in available moisture supports a slight risk of heavy
snow mainly across the higher elevations of the Cascades for the entirety of
week-2. Below-normal temperatures also increasingly favored across the
northwestern CONUS tied to the aforementioned mid-level troughing developing
in
the region. Elevated chances for minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile and below freezing exist later in week-2, and a slight risk for
much
below normal temperatures is issued for the Pacific Northwest, and parts of
northern California, the Great Basin and the Northern Rockies for Feb 25 to
26.
In addition, strong surface pressure gradients to support high winds also
remain evident in the ensemble guidance, and reforecast tools maintain
elevated
chances for sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile from the Pacific
Northwest into the Central Plains. However, the wind values remain below
hazardous thresholds, and no wind related hazards are issued.



Below-normal temperatures continue to be favored over Alaska throughout
week-2.
There is continued agreement in the reforecast tools indicating at least a 20%
chance for minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile for much of
the Mainland, with increased chances of minimum temperatures falling below -40
degrees F across the Brooks Range, North Slope, and across the eastern
Interior. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for the
entirety of week-2.

...Widespread record cold temperatures over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley into early next week followed by only gradual
moderation...

...Stormy pattern will bring multiple wintry precipitation events
from coast to coast, with heavy rainfall potential across parts of
the East late next week...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Today's guidance continues to show a very active synoptic pattern
through much of the medium range period, with a series of systems
digging into and ejecting from a long-term mean trough aloft
anchored over the contiguous U.S.. These systems will bring
periods of active weather for the Western states, as well as parts
of the Southern Plains and through a large part of the East.
Across the Plains and into the Mississippi Valley, record cold is
especially likely through Tuesday and may extend through midweek
at a few locations. As upper troughing heads into the East by late
next week and upstream troughing holds back over the eastern
Pacific, models indicate an evolution toward higher heights aloft
over the western/central U.S., possibly to the point of a flat
ridge building across those areas.

At least through the 06Z cycle the expected pattern and most of
the spread/uncertainties involved did not change much over the
past day, so the forecast approach likewise maintained continuity.
This focused on a composite of 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF/UKMET ideas
for the first half of the period followed by a transition toward
the ECMWF/GFS and their respective ensemble means. Also toward the
latter part of the week the ECMWF component included some of the
prior 12Z/11 run.

The exact structure of the system affecting the East early-mid
week remains uncertain and clustering is still about the
same--ECMWF/ECMWF mean/UKMET a little deeper aloft with slower
timing and somewhat more inland low emphasis versus the GFS/GEFS
mean. In addition the CMC/CMC mean continue to differ from other
guidance in what happens to the upper low that tracks north of
Lake Superior in the short range, offering a lurking risk of
adjustments to a solution somewhere between the GFS and ECMWF
ideas. Sure enough the 12Z ECMWF holds back the upper low with
leading flow yielding a faster eastern system.

Concerning the next shortwave to drop through the West and amplify
into the mean trough early-mid week and continue into toward the
eastern U.S. thereafter, the spread remains moderate relative to
typical disagreements/model errors at extended time frames.
Developing timing differences for the upper trough and associated
surface system are due in part to issues with flow upstream.  By
late in the week the 00Z ECMWF/CMC and their means bring somewhat
more energy into the West, leading to relatively flat flow versus
the GFS/GEFS mean.  New 12Z runs of the GFS/GEFS/CMC show similar
shapes to their previous run but the CMC has raised its western
heights.  The upstream flow in the ECMWF leads to a farther
eastward East Coast system versus some of its prior runs (though
the ECMWF mean has been more consistent with this idea).  On the
other hand operational GFS runs are a bit on the slower/amplified
side with the upper trough heading into the East. Prefer to
maintain an intermediate solution for this system, which happens
to be similar to where the new 12Z CMC has settled by early
Friday.  This intermediate approach also serves well for resolving
differences for late-week Northeast Pacific low pressure and the
trailing front likely to push into the Northwest.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The period starts out with a surface low tracking from the Gulf
into the Eastern U.S. Monday-Tuesday accompanied by a broad area
of precipitation. The greatest winter weather threats will extend
from the Lower Mississippi Valley, across the Ohio Valley, and
into the Northeast. Snow will fall sufficiently far into the cold
air, but there will be potential for areas of significant
sleet/freezing rain south of the snow area. Wintry weather may
extend unusually far southward over the southeastern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley given the extremely cold air in place over the
central U.S. early in the week. Meanwhile rain may be locally
moderate to heavy at times across the Tennessee
Valley/Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic.

The next system that reaches the Northwest early next week should
bring a couple of waves of precipitation into the Pacific
Northwest/northern California with snow mainly confined to the
mountains. The moisture will continue southeastward through the
Great Basin and the Rockies, followed by increasing coverage and
intensity of precipitation over the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley into the East from Wednesday to Friday. As
upper ridging from the Atlantic builds toward southern Florida and
the upper trough heads into the Plains/northern Mexico, combined
with a more favorable surface evolution, the system may feature a
stronger flow of moisture from the Gulf than the preceding system
early in the week. Therefore the heavy precipitation potential
will require monitoring over the coming days. As with the previous
system, expect a broad area of winter weather impacts from the
Southern Plains northeastward.

The upstream Pacific front heading into the Northwest late in the
week will likely bring moisture into the Pacific Northwest around
Wednesday night, with rain and mountain snow continuing for the
next couple days while moisture also spreads farther inland.

The combination of the above systems should generate one area of
significant precipitation totals extending from near the Gulf
Coast into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, with the exact axis of
highest totals to be determined by each system's track/timing.
Also note that the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring severe
potential within the warm sector of both eastern systems, with
further details to be better resolved over coming days.  Over the
West expect favored terrain of the coastal ranges from Washington
into extreme northern California as well as the Cascades to see
the highest liquid equivalents.  The northern Rockies will see
significant precipitation but with somewhat lesser totals, with
more moderate amounts extending farther south over the Sierra
Nevada, Great Basin, and central/southern Rockies.

Still anticipate a widespread area of record lows/cold highs over
the Plains and lower/mid Mississippi Valley into Tuesday with
temperatures of at least 30-45F below normal. A few locations in
Texas/Oklahoma or nearby could even see daytime highs 50F or so
below normal on Monday. Although the central U.S. will see
moderating temperatures by mid-late week, this may involve
anomalies recovering to "only" 20-30F below normal. Highs could
moderate a little more by Friday afternoon. Some of this cold air
will extend in modified fashion into the Ohio Valley and vicinity,
and at times farther eastward. Temperatures in the West will be
near to moderately below normal early-mid week followed by a
warming trend as heights aloft increase. By the end of the week
the Southwest may trend above normal and the northern Plains could
reach above normal values as well. The extreme Southeast/Florida
will be the one area of persistent warmth, with lows in particular
expected to be well above normal most days. However by Friday
below normal temperatures may creep into the Sunshine State as a
front crosses the area late in the week.

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 15 2021 - 12Z Fri Feb 19 2021

...Widespread record cold temperatures over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley into early next week followed by only gradual
moderation...

...Stormy pattern will bring multiple wintry precipitation events
from coast to coast, with heavy rainfall potential across parts of
the East late next week...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Today's guidance continues to show a very active synoptic pattern
through much of the medium range period, with a series of systems
digging into and ejecting from a long-term mean trough aloft
anchored over the contiguous U.S.. These systems will bring
periods of active weather for the Western states, as well as parts
of the Southern Plains and through a large part of the East.
Across the Plains and into the Mississippi Valley, record cold is
especially likely through Tuesday and may extend through midweek
at a few locations. As upper troughing heads into the East by late
next week and upstream troughing holds back over the eastern
Pacific, models indicate an evolution toward higher heights aloft
over the western/central U.S., possibly to the point of a flat
ridge building across those areas.

At least through the 06Z cycle the expected pattern and most of
the spread/uncertainties involved did not change much over the
past day, so the forecast approach likewise maintained continuity.
This focused on a composite of 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF/UKMET ideas
for the first half of the period followed by a transition toward
the ECMWF/GFS and their respective ensemble means. Also toward the
latter part of the week the ECMWF component included some of the
prior 12Z/11 run.

The exact structure of the system affecting the East early-mid
week remains uncertain and clustering is still about the
same--ECMWF/ECMWF mean/UKMET a little deeper aloft with slower
timing and somewhat more inland low emphasis versus the GFS/GEFS
mean. In addition the CMC/CMC mean continue to differ from other
guidance in what happens to the upper low that tracks north of
Lake Superior in the short range, offering a lurking risk of
adjustments to a solution somewhere between the GFS and ECMWF
ideas. Sure enough the 12Z ECMWF holds back the upper low with
leading flow yielding a faster eastern system.

Concerning the next shortwave to drop through the West and amplify
into the mean trough early-mid week and continue into toward the
eastern U.S. thereafter, the spread remains moderate relative to
typical disagreements/model errors at extended time frames.
Developing timing differences for the upper trough and associated
surface system are due in part to issues with flow upstream.  By
late in the week the 00Z ECMWF/CMC and their means bring somewhat
more energy into the West, leading to relatively flat flow versus
the GFS/GEFS mean.  New 12Z runs of the GFS/GEFS/CMC show similar
shapes to their previous run but the CMC has raised its western
heights.  The upstream flow in the ECMWF leads to a farther
eastward East Coast system versus some of its prior runs (though
the ECMWF mean has been more consistent with this idea).  On the
other hand operational GFS runs are a bit on the slower/amplified
side with the upper trough heading into the East. Prefer to
maintain an intermediate solution for this system, which happens
to be similar to where the new 12Z CMC has settled by early
Friday.  This intermediate approach also serves well for resolving
differences for late-week Northeast Pacific low pressure and the
trailing front likely to push into the Northwest.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The period starts out with a surface low tracking from the Gulf
into the Eastern U.S. Monday-Tuesday accompanied by a broad area
of precipitation. The greatest winter weather threats will extend
from the Lower Mississippi Valley, across the Ohio Valley, and
into the Northeast. Snow will fall sufficiently far into the cold
air, but there will be potential for areas of significant
sleet/freezing rain south of the snow area. Wintry weather may
extend unusually far southward over the southeastern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley given the extremely cold air in place over the
central U.S. early in the week. Meanwhile rain may be locally
moderate to heavy at times across the Tennessee
Valley/Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic.

The next system that reaches the Northwest early next week should
bring a couple of waves of precipitation into the Pacific
Northwest/northern California with snow mainly confined to the
mountains. The moisture will continue southeastward through the
Great Basin and the Rockies, followed by increasing coverage and
intensity of precipitation over the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley into the East from Wednesday to Friday. As
upper ridging from the Atlantic builds toward southern Florida and
the upper trough heads into the Plains/northern Mexico, combined
with a more favorable surface evolution, the system may feature a
stronger flow of moisture from the Gulf than the preceding system
early in the week. Therefore the heavy precipitation potential
will require monitoring over the coming days. As with the previous
system, expect a broad area of winter weather impacts from the
Southern Plains northeastward.

The upstream Pacific front heading into the Northwest late in the
week will likely bring moisture into the Pacific Northwest around
Wednesday night, with rain and mountain snow continuing for the
next couple days while moisture also spreads farther inland.

The combination of the above systems should generate one area of
significant precipitation totals extending from near the Gulf
Coast into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, with the exact axis of
highest totals to be determined by each system's track/timing.
Also note that the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring severe
potential within the warm sector of both eastern systems, with
further details to be better resolved over coming days.  Over the
West expect favored terrain of the coastal ranges from Washington
into extreme northern California as well as the Cascades to see
the highest liquid equivalents.  The northern Rockies will see
significant precipitation but with somewhat lesser totals, with
more moderate amounts extending farther south over the Sierra
Nevada, Great Basin, and central/southern Rockies.

Still anticipate a widespread area of record lows/cold highs over
the Plains and lower/mid Mississippi Valley into Tuesday with
temperatures of at least 30-45F below normal. A few locations in
Texas/Oklahoma or nearby could even see daytime highs 50F or so
below normal on Monday. Although the central U.S. will see
moderating temperatures by mid-late week, this may involve
anomalies recovering to "only" 20-30F below normal. Highs could
moderate a little more by Friday afternoon. Some of this cold air
will extend in modified fashion into the Ohio Valley and vicinity,
and at times farther eastward. Temperatures in the West will be
near to moderately below normal early-mid week followed by a
warming trend as heights aloft increase. By the end of the week
the Southwest may trend above normal and the northern Plains could
reach above normal values as well. The extreme Southeast/Florida
will be the one area of persistent warmth, with lows in particular
expected to be well above normal most days. However by Friday
below normal temperatures may creep into the Sunshine State as a
front crosses the area late in the week.

...Significant ice storm to develop over the Mid-Atlantic on
Friday evening into Sunday evening...

...Winter storm to impact Washington State and Oregon through
Sunday...

...Significant Winter Storm to Arrive over the Southern Plains on
Sunday into Monday...

...Bitter arctic air to remain entrenched across the Plains and
Mississippi Valley...

Bitterly cold air will engulf the Plains with temperatures 35 to
55 degrees below average.  A quasi-stationary front at the leading
edge of the cold air mass will remain over the Southeast through
Sunday evening.  An area of low pressure moving along the coast/up
this boundary will spread precipitation in the form of
rain/freezing rain and sleet across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
Saturday and Sunday.  While the probability for significant icing
(>0.25") has decreased, there is still good potential for more
than 0.1" from northern North Carolina through central Virginia
and into the I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C. to Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania on Saturday. Locally more than 0.25" is still likely.
 Light ice accumulations are likely as far north as New York City
and Southern New England on Sunday.  The same storm will produce
rain and embedded thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast
through Sunday evening.  Ice accumulation on trees & power lines
could lead to power outages.  Ice accumulation on sidewalks and
roads may make travel difficult.

A storm just off the Northwest Coast will move onshore overnight
Friday, moving southeastward to the Four Corners Region by Sunday.
The system will produce widespread snow across the mountains and
into Washington and Oregon's lowlands through Sunday.  Significant
snowfall is forecast for both Portland and Seattle, with several
inches likely from Friday evening into Saturday.  Additionally,
icing in excess of 0.25" is forecast for parts of northwest Oregon
through Sunday.  Significant disruptions to travel are likely to
continue with ice, snow, and wind, contributing to power outages.

Upper-level dynamics will help produce snow across the
Northern/Central Rockies into the Central Plains Friday night into
the Middle Mississippi Valley. It will continue into parts of the
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley on Saturday, with a short break over
parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley on Sunday.
Furthermore, the very cold air over the relatively warm Lake
Superior will produce lake-effect snow over parts of the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan through Sunday evening.

A major winter storm is expected to develop out over the Southern
Plains Sunday into Monday, with a large area of snow, sleet, and
freezing rain expected.  While confidence is high on an impactful
winter storm, there remains uncertainty with the location and
magnitude of the heaviest snow, ice, and rain/freezing rain.
However, it appears likely that there will be significant travel
disruption and concern for power outages across a large area of
the Southern Plains going into early Monday.  Snow will develop
over parts of Southwest/Southern Rockies overnight Saturday, with
snow developing over the Central/Southern Plains on Sunday
morning. The snow will spread into parts of the Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley.  Rain will develop along the Western Gulf
Coast also on Saturday evening into Sunday evening.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri February 12 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 18 - 22 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement in regard to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern across North America and adjacent ocean areas
during the 6-10 day period. Dynamical models forecast a broad long-wave 500-
hPa
trough across the CONUS. The manual height blend depicts negative height
anomalies for most of the CONUS. Upstream of this trough, ridging is forecast
over the Northeast Pacific, with positive height anomalies extending eastward
to the southern half of the west coast of the CONUS and into the Southwest. A
deep trough is forecast over most of Alaska by all of today's models, favoring
negative height anomalies throughout most of the state. Positive 500-hPa
height
anomalies are also forecast along the Atlantic Coast, associated with mean
subtropical ridging in the western Atlantic.

Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are enhanced across much of the
CONUS, associated with negative height anomalies spread across much of the
region. Probabilities are highest (> 70%) over parts of the Central and
Southern Great Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley, where a strong,
relatively
cold surface high pressure center is predicted. Some positive height anomalies
in parts of the southwestern CONUS favor near normal temperatures there.
Beneath forecast deep troughing, the likelihood of below normal temperatures
is
increased for Alaska.

A strong frontal system is forecast to track across the Eastern U.S. during
the
early part of the 6-10 day period, increasing odds of above normal
precipitation for parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Region. A continued
active storm track is favored across much of the northwestern CONUS,
coinciding
with enhanced above-normal precipitation probabilities in the Pacific
Northwest. Below-normal precipitation probabilities are increased over parts
of
the southwestern CONUS on the eastern periphery of the Northeast Pacific
ridge.
Elevated below-normal precipitation chances are also favored across the Great
Plains, underneath mean surface high pressure. In Alaska, increased onshore
flow to the east of mean surface low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska favors
above-normal precipitation for the Alaska Panhandle and southern portions of
Mainland Alaska. Near to below-normal precipitation is forecast over northern
parts of Mainland Alaska, to the northwest of this surface low pressure.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's
operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale pattern across the U.S.,
offset significantly by large disagreements among the temperature tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 20 - 26 2021

The synoptic pattern forecast over North America during the week-2 period is
significantly different from the 6-10 day period. Anomalous ridging is still
forecast over the Northeast Pacific, as well as troughing over Alaska.
However,
over the CONUS a significant moderation in 500-hPa heights is predicted,
especially over the southern half of the CONUS where positive height anomalies
are forecast. As forecast heights are somewhat compressed from south to north
over the CONUS, a relatively strong mid-level flow is predicted across the
CONUS, leading to a breakdown in the persistent, amplified pattern we've seen
for some time. Due to a more progressive forecast pattern, uncertainty is
higher, particularly over the eastern half of the CONUS where the largest
change in 500-hPa anomalies is expected.

A few potential shortwave troughs, associated with large negative temperature
anomalies, increases chances of below normal temperatures for the Pacific
Northwest and parts of the Great Basin. Over the south-central CONUS,
moderating air and a forecast increase in 500-hPa heights favors above normal
temperatures. Above normal temperatures are also favored over parts of the
Northern Plains and Great Lakes region, associated with predicted strong
southerly low-level flow towards the end of the week-2 period. The forecast
cold front in the eastern U.S. during the 6-10 day period is expected to exit
the east very early in the week-2 period, allowing much warmer air to return
as
southerly low-level flow increases, enhancing the likelihood of near normal
temperatures for much of the Eastern U.S. This is a large change from
yesterday's week-2 Outlook, which favored below normal temperatures in the
eastern U.S. However, the eastern storm system is forecast to time off early
today, and a strong return flow is now predicted by today's models, supporting
the change to a warmer forecast. Alaska remains under negative height
anomalies
during week-2, favoring below normal temperatures for the state.

Below-normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced across the southern half
of the CONUS due to increased positive 500-hPa height anomalies across the
region and forecast surface high pressure. Odds tilt toward above-normal
precipitation across the Great Lakes region associated with a few forecast
shortwave troughs and precipitation. Increased above-normal precipitation
probabilities are favored across the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies,
associated with increased onshore flow to the southeast of the Gulf of Alaska
low pressure. To the north and west of the mean surface low pressure,
below-normal precipitation is favored for northern parts of Mainland Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's
operational 0z GFS centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well below average, 1 out of 5,
due to good relatively good agreement among the models on today's large-scale
pattern, but significantly offset by significant changes in the temperature
forecast between yesterday and today, between today's temperature tools, and
compared to today's 6-10 day period.

greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1222 AM CST Sat Feb 13 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will deepen as it digs along the West
Coast. An upper-level low in the northern Plains will move through
the upper Great Lakes region. In its wake, another substantial
surface high will build into the upper Missouri Valley. Cold air and
precipitation will greatly limit fire weather concerns across much
of the U.S. Marginally elevated conditions are possible in parts of
the Southwest where drought has kept fuels dry, but cloud cover and
slightly cooler temperatures are likely to keep RH too high for
significant fire weather concerns.

...Widespread record cold temperatures over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley into early next week followed by only gradual
moderation...

...Stormy pattern will bring multiple wintry precipitation events
from coast to coast, with heavy rainfall potential across parts of
the East late next week...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium range continues to feature a very active synoptic
pattern through much of the period, with a series of systems
digging into and ejecting from a long-term mean trough aloft
anchored over the contiguous U.S.. These systems will bring
periods of active weather for the Western states, as well as parts
of the Southern Plains and through a large part of the East.
Across the Plains and into the Mississippi Valley, record cold is
especially likely through Tuesday and may extend through midweek
at a few locations across the South. As upper troughing heads into
the East by late next week and upstream troughing holds back over
the eastern Pacific, models indicate an evolution toward higher
heights aloft over the western/central U.S., possibly to the point
of a flat ridge building across those areas.

Agreement is pretty good on the large scale the first half of the
period, but some questions remain on the details of the first
system exiting the East on Tuesday. The latest runs of the
ECMWF/ECENS mean/UKMET continue to be a bit deeper aloft with
slower timing for the main surface low off the Northeast coast
Tuesday evening versus the GFS/GEFS mean. In addition, the CMC/CMC
mean are significantly deeper with an upper low north of Lake
Superior with faster leading flow on day 3, which offers a surface
low evolution even faster/north than that of the GFS/GEFS. At this
point, a solution somewhere between that of the ECMWF/GFS seems to
be the best location and maintains good continuity.

Things are a little bit more uncertain concerning the next
shortwave to drop through the West and amplify into the mean
trough early-mid week, continuing towards the Eastern U.S.
thereafter. Timing differences really become apparent by next
Friday as the trough enters the East, with the last few runs of
the GFS/GEFS solutions maintaining a noticeably slower progression
of the system, while the ECMWF (and CMC) have trended faster. The
ECENS/CMC means generally support their deterministic
counterparts, with support from the NAEFS as well. Given the day
6-7 time frame, the resulting WPC blend favors a more intermediate
solution towards the ECENS/NAEFS means with the result a slightly
faster Eastern U.S. cold front than depicted by the previous
shift. This approach also serves well for resolving differences
for late-week Northeast Pacific low pressure and the trailing
front likely to push into the Northwest.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The period starts with a surface low deepening as it exits the
Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday. The main threat for wintry weather by
this point will be across much of the Northeast, while the
heaviest rain farther south should be off the coast. Some moderate
rain should linger across Florida along the trailing boundary on
Tuesday.

The next system moving through the West on day 3 should bring a
couple of waves of precipitation into the Pacific
Northwest/northern California with snow mainly confined to the
mountains. The moisture will continue southeastward through the
Great Basin and the Rockies, followed by increasing coverage and
intensity of precipitation over the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley into the East from Wednesday through Friday.
The models continue to show a signal for heavy precipitation from
the lower Mississippi Valley into much of the East. Moderate to
heavy rainfall is likely farther south for the Gulf
Coast/Tennessee Valley/southern Mid-Atlantic, with a broad area of
winter weather impacts on the northern edge of the precipitation
shield from the ArkLaTex region, northeastward into the Northeast.
Also to note, the Storm Prediction Center continues to mention
severe weather potential within the warm sector of this system
(and the preceding system), with details to be better resolved
over the coming days. Out West, another cold front pushes into the
Northwest bringing with it the potential for another round of
heavy mountain snows across the Washington/Oregon Cascades and
into the Northern Rockies next Thursday and Friday.

In terms of temperatures, still anticipate a widespread area of
record lows/cold highs over the Plains and lower/mid Mississippi
Valley into Tuesday, with temperatures at least 30-45 degrees
below normal. Although the central U.S. will see moderating
temperatures by mid-late week, this may involve anomalies
recovering to "only" 20-30F below normal. Highs could moderate a
little more by Friday afternoon. Some of this cold air will extend
in modified fashion into the Ohio Valley and vicinity, and at
times farther eastward. Temperatures in the West will be near to
moderately below normal early-mid week followed by a warming trend
as heights aloft increase. By the end of the week the Southwest
may trend above normal and the northern Plains could reach above
normal values as well. The extreme Southeast/Florida will be the
one area of persistent warmth, with lows in particular expected to
be well above normal most days. However by Friday into Saturday,
below normal temperatures may creep into the Sunshine State as a
front crosses the area late in the week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Sat Jul 24 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A ridge will build through the day today with mostly weak flow
across much of the western CONUS. Beneath this ridge, an upper low
will continue to meander westward across the Southwest. This
upper-low will continue to initiate significant monsoonal
thunderstorm activity across much of the Southwest, southern Great
Basin, and Rockies. However, thunderstorm activity will mostly be in
areas with high PWAT and/or wet fuels and thus fire weather concerns
remain low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CDT Sat Jul 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper level ridge is expected to persist across the western CONUS
on Sunday with mostly weak winds expected across most regions with
dry fuels. Significant monsoon thunderstorm activity should continue
across the Southwest but will once again remain where fuels are wet
and PWAT values are highest. Therefore, the weak winds and lack of
lightning over dry fuels precludes overall fire weather concern on
Sunday.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
348 AM EDT Sat Jul 24 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Jul 24 2021 - 12Z Mon Jul 26 2021

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Southwest through Sunday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Great Lakes through Sunday morning...

...Excessive Heat Watch over parts of Idaho and eastern Oregon...

Monsoonal moisture and upper-level energy will aid in producing
showers and thunderstorms, some of which will produce heavy rain
over the Southwest and the Central/Southern Rockies through
Monday. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall with these thunderstorms. The associated heavy rain will
create numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams
may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers through Sunday
morning.  The excessive rainfall threat will continue from Sunday
into Monday as the showers and thunderstorms remain with the
monsoonal moisture.

A front extending from the Upper Great Lakes southwestward to the
Great Basin will move slowly to the Northeast Coast to the Ohio
Valley by Monday.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along
and ahead of the boundary over parts of the Great Lakes today. The
SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Great Lakes through Sunday morning. The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. While the
severe thunderstorm risk weakens, these showers and thunderstorms
will move into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Sunday. This
activity will continue to advance through the Northeast and into
the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys on Monday.  Additionally, tropical
moisture over the Florida and Central Gulf Coast will spawn
showers and thunderstorms over the region through Sunday.

Meanwhile, there is an Excessive Heat Watch over parts of Idaho
and eastern Oregon, where temperatures rise into the 100s through
Sunday. The 100s will move into Northern Plains and Northern High
Plains on Monday.  Furthermore, Heat Advisories are currently in
effect for portions of the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley, while
an Excessive Heat Warning affects the Kansas City metro area.

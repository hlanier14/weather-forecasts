Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1029 AM CST Fri Dec 17 2021

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

The forecast remains on track, and very minimal adjustments were
made with this update. For details on the central High Plains
fire-weather concerns, see the previous discussion below.

..Weinman.. 12/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CST Fri Dec 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough evident in water vapor imagery this morning
over the central Great Basin is forecast to move eastward across the
central Rockies/Plains today.  At the surface, a lee trough is
expected to move eastward from the High Plains in the morning
followed by a cold front surging southward through the central
Plains during the evening hours.

...Portions of Northwestern Kansas, Southwestern Nebraska, and
Northeastern Colorado...
Despite relatively cool temperatures (highs only approaching 50 F)
across the region, dry and breezy conditions in the midst of dry
fuels (ERC values exceeding 90th percentile) should result in
elevated fire weather conditions.  Sustained afternoon northwesterly
surface winds are expected to approach 20 mph as enhanced flow aloft
is transferred downward through boundary-layer mixing.
Concurrently, afternoon RH values are expected to fall below 20%
given the very dry airmass.  Fire-weather conditions are expected to
improve by late afternoon as cooling and moistening occurs with the
cold-frontal passage.

1830 UTC Update...

No major changes were needed for todays update to the WPC medium
range progs. The 00z/06z suite of models remained fairly
consistent to their previous runs and so only minor changes were
made to frontal structures and placements from the overnight
shift. The forecast was good enough for an operational model blend
through about day 5, quickly increasing incorporation of the means
thereafter to account for forecast variability and instability,
particularly regarding details and evolution of Western U.S.
trough energies. The 00z ECMWF was still considerably faster on
day 7, with a trough making it all the way into the Plains, while
the better consensus favored something more back towards the West
Coast. For this reason, limited ECMWF was used for days 6 and
especially 7. See the previous discussion below for additional
details.

Previous Discussion below issued at 0658 UTC...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The majority of guidance suggests that an amplified mean trough
aloft over the far eastern Pacific will be the dominant feature
during the period, bringing multiple days of precipitation to
parts of the West Coast states with lesser amounts farther inland.
 To the east a southern stream shortwave tracking eastward from
the southern Plains Monday onward will support a western Gulf into
eastern Atlantic system spreading rain across the Gulf Coast and
Southeast.  Expect mostly light precipitation with one or more
northern tier waves/fronts carried along by the progressive mean
flow.  The large scale pattern will likely favor well above normal
temperatures over parts of the central/southern Plains but below
normal temperatures over the extreme northern Plains.

For about the first half of the period a composite of 12Z/18Z
operational models represented the most common ideas of guidance,
though lingering uncertainties exist in multiple places.  Latest
solutions have adjusted a bit faster than previous forecast for
the southern tier system while the models are still in the process
of resolving specifics of a couple shortwaves within the southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. stream.  There is decent agreement in
principle for the upper low off the West Coast, with latest trends
adjusting the feature a little more offshore corresponding with
the upper ridge over the Northwest/Interior West being stronger.

Around midweek a strong bundle of energy diving south from Alaska
begins to add to the forecast complexity, with recent individual
model runs and ensemble members showing considerable spread for
what happens.  Possibilities include this energy merging with the
initial upper low, forming a new upper low while ejecting energy
from the initial low eastward, or itself becoming a mere
progressive shortwave while the first upper low remains offshore
(12Z and new 00Z ECMWF).  Latest ensemble means have been
providing a good middle ground among these various options,
keeping an upper trough axis close to the West Coast into day 7
Friday--a reasonable idea based on teleconnections relative to the
upstream ridge's positive height anomaly.  Thus the forecast
transitioned toward about half ensemble means (18Z GEFS/12Z ECens)
while splitting the lingering GFS input between its 12Z/18Z runs
and eventually switching ECMWF input to the 00Z/16 run that was
slower with the West Coast trough (and keeping a little 12Z CMC).

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The upper low initially offshore the West Coast and then digging
trough energy from Alaska should provide favorable ingredients for
periods of moderate to heavy precipitation over portions of the
West Coast states with lesser amounts extending inland through the
Great Basin and Rockies.  Currently northern and central
California have the best potential for seeing the highest five-day
totals, aided by slow motion of the initial offshore system, a
developing moisture plume, and favored southern/western facing
terrain enhancement.  Some guidance shows sufficiently heavy
rainfall at lower elevations that there could be some local
runoff/flooding issues while snow would be heavy over Sierra
Nevada/Shasta areas.  Confidence in the details of coverage and
intensity of precipitation after midweek decreases though.

Elsewhere, low pressure tracking from the western Gulf of Mexico
through Florida and into the Atlantic will spread rain across
portions of the South/Southeast.  Some locations over the
Southeast/Florida could see moderate to locally heavy rainfall but
there is still a fair amount of uncertainty for intensity at any
particular location as well as the northward extent of moisture.
One or more northern tier waves/fronts may spread mostly light
snow from the extreme northern Plains through the Great Lakes and
New England.

Upper ridging over the west-central U.S. will support persistently
warm temperatures over the southern two-thirds of the Plains next
week.  Expect the coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs to
expand during the first half of the week and remain broad through
Friday.  A few locations may see highs even greater than 20F above
normal.  On the other hand the extreme northern Plains should see
below normal temperatures.  Monday should be the coldest day with
highs 10-15F or so below normal over parts of Montana and North
Dakota.

1830 UTC Update...

No major changes were needed for todays update to the WPC medium
range progs. The 00z/06z suite of models remained fairly
consistent to their previous runs and so only minor changes were
made to frontal structures and placements from the overnight
shift. The forecast was good enough for an operational model blend
through about day 5, quickly increasing incorporation of the means
thereafter to account for forecast variability and instability,
particularly regarding details and evolution of Western U.S.
trough energies. The 00z ECMWF was still considerably faster on
day 7, with a trough making it all the way into the Plains, while
the better consensus favored something more back towards the West
Coast. For this reason, limited ECMWF was used for days 6 and
especially 7. See the previous discussion below for additional
details.

Previous Discussion below issued at 0658 UTC...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The majority of guidance suggests that an amplified mean trough
aloft over the far eastern Pacific will be the dominant feature
during the period, bringing multiple days of precipitation to
parts of the West Coast states with lesser amounts farther inland.
 To the east a southern stream shortwave tracking eastward from
the southern Plains Monday onward will support a western Gulf into
eastern Atlantic system spreading rain across the Gulf Coast and
Southeast.  Expect mostly light precipitation with one or more
northern tier waves/fronts carried along by the progressive mean
flow.  The large scale pattern will likely favor well above normal
temperatures over parts of the central/southern Plains but below
normal temperatures over the extreme northern Plains.

For about the first half of the period a composite of 12Z/18Z
operational models represented the most common ideas of guidance,
though lingering uncertainties exist in multiple places.  Latest
solutions have adjusted a bit faster than previous forecast for
the southern tier system while the models are still in the process
of resolving specifics of a couple shortwaves within the southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. stream.  There is decent agreement in
principle for the upper low off the West Coast, with latest trends
adjusting the feature a little more offshore corresponding with
the upper ridge over the Northwest/Interior West being stronger.

Around midweek a strong bundle of energy diving south from Alaska
begins to add to the forecast complexity, with recent individual
model runs and ensemble members showing considerable spread for
what happens.  Possibilities include this energy merging with the
initial upper low, forming a new upper low while ejecting energy
from the initial low eastward, or itself becoming a mere
progressive shortwave while the first upper low remains offshore
(12Z and new 00Z ECMWF).  Latest ensemble means have been
providing a good middle ground among these various options,
keeping an upper trough axis close to the West Coast into day 7
Friday--a reasonable idea based on teleconnections relative to the
upstream ridge's positive height anomaly.  Thus the forecast
transitioned toward about half ensemble means (18Z GEFS/12Z ECens)
while splitting the lingering GFS input between its 12Z/18Z runs
and eventually switching ECMWF input to the 00Z/16 run that was
slower with the West Coast trough (and keeping a little 12Z CMC).

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The upper low initially offshore the West Coast and then digging
trough energy from Alaska should provide favorable ingredients for
periods of moderate to heavy precipitation over portions of the
West Coast states with lesser amounts extending inland through the
Great Basin and Rockies.  Currently northern and central
California have the best potential for seeing the highest five-day

there is still a fair amount of uncertainty for intensity at any
particular location as well as the northward extent of moisture.
One or more northern tier waves/fronts may spread mostly light
snow from the extreme northern Plains through the Great Lakes and
New England.

warm temperatures over the southern two-thirds of the Plains next
week.  Expect the coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs to
expand during the first half of the week and remain broad through
Friday.  A few locations may see highs even greater than 20F above
normal.  On the other hand the extreme northern Plains should see
below normal temperatures.  Monday should be the coldest day with
highs 10-15F or so below normal over parts of Montana and North
Dakota.

..Weinman.. 12/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CST Fri Dec 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will continue moving eastward across the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes Region on Saturday.  At the
surface, a low-pressure system will move northeastward from the Ohio
Valley toward the Northeast.  An associated cold front will push
eastward toward the Appalachians and southward through the southern
Plains by the evening.

In the wake of the cold-frontal passage across the southern Plains,
conditions will be cold, dry, and breezy.  Even with high
temperatures only in the 40s, RH values will still fall below 20%
from southwestern Kansas into northwestern Texas.  The best overlap
of low RH and sustained north-northeasterly surface winds over 15
mph is currently forecast to occur south of driest fuels, so no
fire-weather highlights are included at this time.

...Flash flooding likely and severe thunderstorms possible near a

Valley...

...Moderate to heavy snow expected across northern New England
beginning on Saturday with pockets of freezing rain located over
the Interior Northeast and southern New England...

...Heavy snow to impact the Cascades and far Northern Rockies this
weekend...

The majority of the active weather this evening and into early
Saturday will be found along a quasi-stationary boundary extending
from the Mid-Atlantic to the Southern Plains. Showers and
thunderstorms are expected to focus along this front and ahead of
a developing wave of low pressure. Repeating rounds of
moderate-to-heavy rain is likely across parts of eastern Oklahoma,
northern Arkansas, and southern Missouri. Multiple inches of rain
in a short period of time could result in areas of flash flooding.
WPC has issued a Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of Excessive Rainfall
for tonight that extends from northeast Oklahoma to north-central
Arkansas, with a larger Slight Risk (level 2/4) extending from
northeast Texas to southwest Indiana. Flash Flood Watches have
also been issued for parts of this region. Otherwise, a few severe
thunderstorms are also a possibility this evening from far
northeast Texas to southeast Oklahoma. As the aforementioned wave
of low pressure pushes northeast on Saturday and into the Ohio
Valley, the attached cold front is forecast to push into the Deep
South and shift the marginal heavy rain/severe thunderstorm threat
into the Gulf Coast States.

By this weekend, cold air located across New England and southeast
Canada is expected to interact with approaching precipitation,
resulting in an area of sleet, freezing rain, and snow throughout
the Interior Northeast and New England. Light freezing rain may
lead to a glaze of ice from northern Pennsylvania to western
Connecticut and Massachusetts. Even light amounts of freezing rain
can lead to treacherous travel; therefore, residents are advised
to check road conditions before venturing out. Farther north,
heavy snow (greater than 5 inches) is possible from the
Adirondacks of New York to eastern Maine between Saturday
afternoon and Sunday morning. Winter Weather Advisories and Winter
Storm Watches have been issued.

Elsewhere, after a quiet day today, a surge of moisture is
forecast to enter the Pacific Northwest tonight and extend into
Saturday. A few inches of coastal/lower elevation rain is
expected, with heavy snow found in the Cascades. Snowfall amounts
may add up to over 2 feet in the highest peaks of the northern
Cascades. Winter Storm Watches have been issued here. Snow is also
expected to enter parts of northern Montana and Idaho this
weekend, where widespread snowfall amounts over 10 inches are
possible.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri December 17 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 23 - 27 2021

Today's dynamical models have good agreement regarding the amplified 500-hP=
a
geopotential height patterns across the forecast domain. A very high amplit=
ude
ridge and associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over th=
e
North Pacific extending northward into the Bering Sea. Ensemble model
solutions
from the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian depict a high amplitude trough extending
from western Canada and eastern Alaska into the eastern Pacific Ocean near =
the
west coast of the CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights over most of the
western CONUS eastward to part of the Northern Plains. Ridging and positive
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast from parts of the southwestern CONUS
across the Southern Plains and and parts of the Southeast. Troughing and
negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over much of the Northeast =
and
parts of the Mid-Atlantic.

Above normal temperatures are favored over the western Aleutians under the
predicted ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
temperatures are favored for Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle under
forecast anomalous mid-level northerly flow and easterly low-level flow fro=
m
western Canada. Near to below normal temperatures are favored for most of t=
he
western coast eastward across parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern
Plains, under negative 500-hPa height anomalies associated with the predict=
ed
trough. Near to below normal temperatures are favored for parts of the
Northeast under forecast below normal heights. Near to above normal
temperatures are favored for the rest of the CONUS, with the highest
probability (exceeding 80%) over the Southern Plains under a predicted ridg=
e
and also consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Onshore flow favors above normal precipitation for northern Mainland Alaska=
,
although precipitation anomalies are predicted to be small. Below normal
precipitation is favored for the south coast of Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle
under anomalous northerly mid-level flow ahead of the ridge. Above normal
precipitation is favored for much of the western third of the CONUS, as wel=
l
as
for parts of the Northern Plains and Midwest, ahead of an amplified trough.
Near to below normal precipitation is favored for the rest of the CONUS
underneath forecast above normal 500-hPa heights and also supported by the
precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on the circulation forecast over North America, and go=
od
agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools, offset by some
disagreement among the forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 25 - 31 2021

A similar 500-hPa flow pattern to the 6-10 day period forecast is predicted=
 to
continue into week 2 with some de-amplification of the predicted circulatio=
n
patterns and a slight eastward progression over the forecast domain.

Below normal temperatures are favored for Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle under anomalous northerly flow and easterly low-level flow from
western Canada. Under the amplifying trough and below normal 500-hPa height
anomalies, below normal temperature probabilities are enhanced over parts o=
f
the western CONUS and across the northern tier into parts of the western Gr=
eat
Lakes. Above normal temperatures are likely for most of the remaining areas=
 of
the CONUS, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies, with probabilities
exceeding 80% over parts of the Southern Great Plains, while near to below
normal temperatures are favored for parts of the Northeast under negative
500-hPa height anomalies.

Above normal precipitation continues to be slightly favored for parts of th=
e
northern Alaska Mainland in week 2. Below normal precipitation is favored f=
or
southern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, under anomalous northerl=
y
mid-level flow. Above normal precipitation is favored for the western third=
 of
the CONUS eastward across parts of the Northern Plains and the Great Lakes,=
 as
the trough is predicted to amplify. Near to below normal precipitation is
favored for the rest of the CONUS, underneath forecast positive 500-hPa hei=
ght
anomalies and also supported by the precipitation consolidation forecast to=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=

among the temperature and precipitation tools over most of the forecast
domain.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

300 PM EST December 17 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is increased uncertainty among today's ensemble model guida=
nce
regarding the evolution of the jet stream pattern during week-2. Despite th=
is
uncertainty, forecast mid-level low pressure over the western and north-
central
contiguous U.S. is anticipated to bring increased chances for much below
normal
temperatures across northern parts of the Pacific Northwest, extending
eastward
across the Upper Missouri and Mississippi Valleys during the period. Enhanc=
ed
onshore flow associated with the mid-level low pressure over the West Coast
increases the potential for heavy precipitation and high elevation snowfall
across the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and the northern Rockies in the first h=
alf
of the period. For Alaska, prevailing northerly flow is expected to bring
increased chances for below normal temperatures across the southeastern
Mainland and the Panhandle. For the remainder of the lower 48, prevailing
mid-level high pressure is favored to bring more tranquil conditions during
week-2; however, the pattern is favored to become more progressive toward t=
he
end of week-2, indicating a potential pattern shift.

FOR SATURDAY DECEMBER 25 - FRIDAY DECEMBER 31: There is good agreement amon=
g
the dynamical models featuring highly amplified ridging over the northern
Pacific, with downstream negative mid-level height departures over the
northeastern Pacific and into the western and north-central CONUS. Both the
GEFS and ECMWF ensemble model guidance favors a deamplification of the over=
all
pattern during week-2. However, the ECMWF ensemble maintains a more amplifi=
ed
pattern for a longer duration, increasing uncertainty in the evolution of t=
he
pattern leading to disparities in the timing of events and the precipitatio=
n
chances across the south-central and southeastern CONUS. Despite this
uncertainty, ensemble guidance favors the persistence of a broad area of
surface high pressure over western Canada, extending into eastern Alaska,
which
is expected to advect anomalous cold air into the northwestern and
north-central CONUS and southeastern Alaska during the period. Ensemble
guidance also favors troughing over the Northeast Pacific, which is likely =
to
bring anomalous precipitation to parts of the West Coast.



The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict a broad region from the Pacific
Northwest to the Upper Mississippi Valley of at least a 20% chance of minim=
um
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below 0 degrees F, thus =
a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures is issued for the entirety of
week-2 for the region. Higher probabilities (>40%) for minimum temperatures
falling below the 15th percentile and below 0 degrees F are indicated
extending
from Montana to North Dakota during much of the first half of the period,
supporting the continuation of moderate risk of much below normal temperatu=
res
from Dec 26 to 31 for the region. The start and duration of the moderate ri=
sk
is delayed and increased, respectively, compared to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook.
There
is good support for these adjustments among the model guidance. However, it
should be noted that the GEFS favors an increased potential for a release o=
f
the cold air pool over Canada into the Central Plains and Middle Mississipp=
i
Valleys toward the latter portion of week-2, which has implications in the
temperature and precipitation outlooks across the eastern CONUS. Given the
increased chance for cold air intrusion in the GEFS, the slight and moderat=
e
risks for much below normal minimum temperatures were modestly expanded a b=
it
farther southeastward also, relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs outlook. However, the
increased subtropical ridging in the ECMWF ensemble guidance across the
Southern Tier of the CONUS, relative to the GEFS, prevents any further
southward expansion of this moderate below normal minimum temperature risk =
at
this time.



Over Alaska, the forecast ridge/trough pattern over the North Pacific is
expected to bring anomalously cold temperatures, with an increased likeliho=
od
for much below normal temperatures over the southeastern Mainland and
Panhandle. Reforecast tools indicate at least a 60% chance of minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile across the Alaska Panhandle,
thus a corresponding high risk area of much below normal temperatures is
posted
for Dec 25 to 28. A moderate risk of much below normal temperatures remains
posted across the entire Panhandle and extends into extreme southeastern
Mainland Alaska Dec 25 to 29, and a broader slight risk area remains issued
and
extends from the Kenai Peninsula, northeastward to the Yukon Flats, and
through
the Panhandle throughout week-2. It should be noted that the model cold
signals
are expanded in coverage over southeastern Alaska, relative to yesterday=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
outlook, but dissipate during the period; thus the depicted risks represent
the
extents of the signals at the start of the period. The high risk will retra=
ct
to the central Alaska Panhandle before timing off on Dec 28, the moderate r=
isk
will retract to the central and southern Panhandle and time off on Dec 29, =
and
the slight risk for much below normal minimum temperatures will retract to =
the
central and southern Alaska Panhandle by the end of week-2.



Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model runs depict a continuation of the a=
mplified ridge/trough
pattern
over the North Pacific in the mean mid-level height fields. Additionally,
these
ensemble runs also favor anomalous mid-level ridging over the Southern Tier=
 of
the CONUS. Despite the aforementioned uncertainty in the evolution of the
long-wave pattern across western North America, increased chances for onsho=
re
flow across much of the West Coast continues for the first half of the peri=
od.
A moderate risk of heavy precipitation remains issued for the Central Valle=
y
of
California and surrounding mountain ranges Dec 25 to 26. The slight risk ar=
ea
remains posted Dec 25 to 28 extending from southern California into the
Pacific
Northwest.



As supported by the latest deterministic and ensemble mean solutions, there=
 is
also an increased potential for high elevation snowfall across parts of the
western U.S. A moderate risk of heavy snow is posted for the Sierra Nevada
Mountains and Klamath Basin in northern and central California Dec 25 to 26=
,
while a broader slight risk area is posted extending northward into the
Cascades of the Pacific Northwest Dec 25 to 28. A slight risk of heavy snow=
 is
also issued across northern Idaho and the Bitterroot Mountains of the north=
ern
Rockies for the first three days (Dec 25-27), where there is increased supp=
ort
in the model guidance for snowfall totals reaching hazardous thresholds for
the
week as a whole, which may complicate holiday travel, particularly in the
passes. The overall increase in available moisture across the West during
week-2 is expected to help the ongoing drought recovery (much of the West i=
s
still experiencing extreme to exceptional drought conditions). However,
enhanced precipitation may trigger localized flooding in the lower elevatio=
n
areas and may exacerbate travel difficulties during the upcoming holidays.



Strong surface pressure gradients featured in the ensembles as well as
elevated
chances for sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile in the ECMWF and
GEFS
reforecast tools throughout much of the West supports a slight risk of high
winds Dec 25 to 28. This area was expanded to include more of the Southern
Plains today, with an increased potential for high winds associated with
lee-side cyclogenesis east of the Rockies in the first half of the period.
Above normal temperatures and high winds have exacerbated drought condition=
s
throughout these areas in recent months, further warranting the expansion o=
f
the slight risk area. An increased risk for high winds also elevates dust
storm
fire weather potential.



Across the south-central and southeastern CONUS, the ECMWF ensemble guidanc=
e
favors continued ridging, but de-amplified compared to guidance earlier thi=
s
week, whereas the GEFS favors even greater de-amplification of this feature=
.
As
such, there is increased uncertainty regarding the location of the storm tr=
ack
and the potential for cold air intrusion into the central and eastern CONUS
toward the end of the period, with the ECMWF favoring a warmer, drier patte=
rn
than the GEFS over the south-central and southeastern CONUS. Persistent
mid-level ridging is favored in this outlook, given increased forecast skil=
l
in
the ECMWF ensemble guidance for these areas. Despite the uncertainty in the
eastern half of the CONUS, a more progressive pattern is likely to develop =
by
the end of week-2.

Valid 12Z Mon Dec 20 2021 - 12Z Fri Dec 24 2021


1830 UTC Update...

No major changes were needed for todays update to the WPC medium
range progs. The 00z/06z suite of models remained fairly
consistent to their previous runs and so only minor changes were
made to frontal structures and placements from the overnight
shift. The forecast was good enough for an operational model blend
through about day 5, quickly increasing incorporation of the means
thereafter to account for forecast variability and instability,
particularly regarding details and evolution of Western U.S.
trough energies. The 00z ECMWF was still considerably faster on
day 7, with a trough making it all the way into the Plains, while
the better consensus favored something more back towards the West
Coast. For this reason, limited ECMWF was used for days 6 and
especially 7. See the previous discussion below for additional
details.

Santorelli


Previous Discussion below issued at 0658 UTC...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The majority of guidance suggests that an amplified mean trough
aloft over the far eastern Pacific will be the dominant feature
during the period, bringing multiple days of precipitation to
parts of the West Coast states with lesser amounts farther inland.
 To the east a southern stream shortwave tracking eastward from
the southern Plains Monday onward will support a western Gulf into
eastern Atlantic system spreading rain across the Gulf Coast and
Southeast.  Expect mostly light precipitation with one or more
northern tier waves/fronts carried along by the progressive mean
flow.  The large scale pattern will likely favor well above normal
temperatures over parts of the central/southern Plains but below
normal temperatures over the extreme northern Plains.

For about the first half of the period a composite of 12Z/18Z
operational models represented the most common ideas of guidance,
though lingering uncertainties exist in multiple places.  Latest
solutions have adjusted a bit faster than previous forecast for
the southern tier system while the models are still in the process
of resolving specifics of a couple shortwaves within the southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. stream.  There is decent agreement in
principle for the upper low off the West Coast, with latest trends
adjusting the feature a little more offshore corresponding with
the upper ridge over the Northwest/Interior West being stronger.

Around midweek a strong bundle of energy diving south from Alaska
begins to add to the forecast complexity, with recent individual
model runs and ensemble members showing considerable spread for
what happens.  Possibilities include this energy merging with the
initial upper low, forming a new upper low while ejecting energy
from the initial low eastward, or itself becoming a mere
progressive shortwave while the first upper low remains offshore
(12Z and new 00Z ECMWF).  Latest ensemble means have been
providing a good middle ground among these various options,
keeping an upper trough axis close to the West Coast into day 7
Friday--a reasonable idea based on teleconnections relative to the
upstream ridge's positive height anomaly.  Thus the forecast
transitioned toward about half ensemble means (18Z GEFS/12Z ECens)
while splitting the lingering GFS input between its 12Z/18Z runs
and eventually switching ECMWF input to the 00Z/16 run that was
slower with the West Coast trough (and keeping a little 12Z CMC).

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The upper low initially offshore the West Coast and then digging
trough energy from Alaska should provide favorable ingredients for
periods of moderate to heavy precipitation over portions of the
West Coast states with lesser amounts extending inland through the
Great Basin and Rockies.  Currently northern and central
California have the best potential for seeing the highest five-day
totals, aided by slow motion of the initial offshore system, a
developing moisture plume, and favored southern/western facing
terrain enhancement.  Some guidance shows sufficiently heavy
rainfall at lower elevations that there could be some local
runoff/flooding issues while snow would be heavy over Sierra
Nevada/Shasta areas.  Confidence in the details of coverage and
intensity of precipitation after midweek decreases though.

Elsewhere, low pressure tracking from the western Gulf of Mexico
through Florida and into the Atlantic will spread rain across
portions of the South/Southeast.  Some locations over the
Southeast/Florida could see moderate to locally heavy rainfall but
there is still a fair amount of uncertainty for intensity at any
particular location as well as the northward extent of moisture.
One or more northern tier waves/fronts may spread mostly light
snow from the extreme northern Plains through the Great Lakes and
New England.

Upper ridging over the west-central U.S. will support persistently
warm temperatures over the southern two-thirds of the Plains next
week.  Expect the coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs to
expand during the first half of the week and remain broad through
Friday.  A few locations may see highs even greater than 20F above
normal.  On the other hand the extreme northern Plains should see
below normal temperatures.  Monday should be the coldest day with
highs 10-15F or so below normal over parts of Montana and North
Dakota.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

From Tuesday into Christmas Day/Saturday, most guidance continues
to show that impulses rounding an impressively strong central
Pacific upper ridge should provide periodic reinforcement of a
deep upper trough aligned just off the West Coast.  This trough
will likely contain one or more upper lows, and a persistent flow
of moisture ahead of the trough axis will likely produce a
multi-day period of significant precipitation over parts of the
West Coast (northern/central California in particular) with
meaningful amounts also extending across the West into the
Rockies.  Southern Canada/northern tier U.S. flow will carry along
a couple waves with modest precipitation before lower 48 flow
becomes more dominated by what energy may eject from the eastern
Pacific trough.  Farther south, a southern stream system tracking
from northern Florida or vicinity into the Atlantic may bring some
rain to the Southeast early in the forecast period.  Expect a
broadening area of above normal temperatures over the southern
two-thirds of the central U.S. while the extreme northern Plains
will tend to see below normal temperatures.

For the eastern Pacific upper trough the 12Z/18Z models and means
have improved their relative clustering thanks to the 12Z ECMWF
finally adjusting to a more compatible solution versus the
previous couple runs that were questionably progressive with Gulf
of Alaska energy that digs southward Tuesday-Wednesday.  The
current consensus for the mean trough aloft, as well as the best
precipitation focus over northern/central California, compare well
to teleconnections relative to the upstream ridge's positive
height anomaly center.  However for specific day-to-day details
there is still a fair amount of ensemble spread and complexity
over interaction among features and their exact position.  This
includes not only the initial offshore upper low and the
aforementioned Gulf of Alaska energy but yet another strong bundle
of energy that may drop into the mean trough late in the week.  In
the new 00Z model runs the CMC has strayed significantly for some
details but the GFS/UKMET remain fairly close to consensus.  The
ECMWF has gone back to a faster scenario.

The progressive nature of flow to the east of the Rockies may
continue to cause some trouble for resolving specifics of
individual waves/fronts.  Recently there has been improved
definition of a northern Plains wave that tracks across the upper
Great Lakes and southeastern Canada Tuesday onward but
continuity/clustering have been lacking for trailing features
whose dynamic support are increasingly likely to come from energy
that ejects from the eastern Pacific upper trough.  Meanwhile
agreement and to some degree continuity continue to be poor for
the precise structure, timing, and track of the southern stream
system expected to be over or near northern Florida as of early
Tuesday and continue into the Atlantic thereafter.  New 00Z model
clustering has generally gravitated to the slower side of the
prior envelope, closest to recent GFS runs.

A blend of 12Z/18Z models from Tuesday into early Wednesday
eliminated the UKMET after the latter time due to straying fast
with the western Atlantic system and gradually trended toward a
late-period solution of 40 percent total 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means
with remaining input coming from the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF/CMC.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Expect the western U.S. to see a broadening area of rain and
mountain snow downstream from the persistent upper trough just
offshore the West Coast, with some of this activity likely to be
moderate to heavy.  There are still question marks for some of the
details due to uncertainty over individual systems and their
interaction, but guidance signals and teleconnections for the mean
pattern are consistent in showing northern and central California
as having the highest precipitation potential through the
period--including heavy snow over Sierra Nevada/Shasta areas.
This region should see the most consistent moisture flow and
experience southern/western facing terrain enhancement.  It may
take into the shorter-range time frame to asses the location and
intensity of lower elevation rainfall with respect to local
runoff/flooding issues.  Effects from the multi-day accumulation
of precipitation will also require monitoring even if it is not
intense on any particular day.  Some moisture may extend as far
south as southern California and Arizona by mid-late week, while
the Interior West and Rockies should see meaningful precipitation
as well.

Low pressure tracking from over or near northern Florida into the
Atlantic will spread rain across portions of the Southeast on
Tuesday and possibly into Wednesday.  Some locations over the
Southeast/Florida could see moderate to locally heavy rainfall.
Some uncertainty persists for the intensity and northward extent
of rainfall though latest trends are increasing the potential for
meaningful totals over parts of the extreme Southeast.  A leading
northern tier system should spread mostly light snow from the
extreme northern Plains eastward through the Great Lakes and New
England during Tuesday-Wednesday.  The system's accompanying front
should be relatively dry.  Any trailing features could produce
some precipitation but again likely with fairly light amounts.


Above normal temperatures focused over the central/south-central
High Plains on Tuesday will steadily expand eastward across the
southern two-thirds of the central U.S. with time and gradually
become more anomalous.  Through midweek highs in this region will
tend to be 10-20F or slightly more above normal.  Toward the end
of the week there should be more locations with highs 20-30F above
normal and some record highs could be challenged over the southern
Plains by Christmas Day/Saturday.  On the other extreme, the far
northern Plains should see below normal temperatures except for
perhaps being near normal Wednesday.  A stronger push of cold air
may reach Montana and the Dakotas next weekend.  The unsettled
pattern over the West should lead to near or above normal lows and
near to below normal highs.

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorm threat this morning from the
southern Plains to Ohio Valley...

...Moderate to heavy snow expected across northern New England
this evening into Sunday; freezing rain from upstate New York to
central New England...

...Heavy snow to impact the Cascades and far Northern Rockies
today, lingering into Monday...

A low pressure wave developing over the Mid-Mississippi Valley is
forecast to intensify as it tracks toward the New England coast
tonight.  Areas of strong to severe thunderstorms near a
meandering front will keep rounds of moderate to heavy rain this
morning from eastern Oklahoma through the Ohio Valley where up to
a moderate risk of flash flooding is forecast.  As the low
pressure wave moves quickly through the Ohio Valley today, the
front will likewise advance eastward more quickly, diminishing the
heavy rain threat over the Mid-Mississippi Valley by later today.
The trailing portion of the front will move more slowly across the
western Gulf Coast where a threat of heavy rain is forecast for
this evening.

In the mean time, with cold air in place across New England, the
intensifying low pressure wave will bring a round of snow and some
mixed precipitation across the lower Great Lakes today.  By
tonight, moderate to heavy snow is forecast to overspread northern
New England from west to east as the low pressure wave intensifies
and tracks near the southern New England coast.  Areas from
upstate New York to central New England should see sleet, freezing
rain, and/or snow tonight before the low quickly exits out to sea
on Sunday.  Much of the wintry precipitation should come to an end
later in the afternoon on Sunday.  Farther south showers and
thunderstorms are expected to more steadily through the East Coast
and the Southeast during the weekend.

Elsewhere, a surge of moisture is entering the Pacific Northwest
and will extend into Sunday. A few inches of coastal/lower
elevation rain is expected, with heavy snow found in the Cascades.
Snowfall amounts may add up to over 2 feet in the highest peaks of
the northern Cascades. Winter Storm Watches have been issued here.
Snow is also expected to enter parts of northern Montana and Idaho
this weekend, where widespread snowfall amounts over 10 inches are
possible.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level long-wave trough will continue to move across the
eastern United States on Saturday, leaving behind a
shorter-wavelength trough across north-central Mexico. At the
surface, a low pressure will move rapidly eastward from the Ohio
Valley to off the southeast coast of Cape Cod by Sunday morning. A
cold front trailing southwest from this low will push south and east
through Saturday, ending up stretching from south of Brownsville,
TX, northeast to the coastal waters south of Cape Cod.

In the wake of the cold front, a dry continental airmass will spread
south across the central United States. This dry airmass will
support relative humidity percentages falling into the teens to low
twenties across portions of northwest and west Texas, despite
surface temperatures struggling to broach 50 F. These dry conditions
will combine with gusty northerly winds around 20 mph to result in
elevated meteorological fire conditions. However, these conditions
should occur mostly south of the drier fuels across the Texas
Panhandle, and no fire weather highlights are currently needed.

...Synopsis...
As the mid-level long-wave trough moves quickly off the East Coast
on Sunday, a broad mid-level ridge from coast-to-coast will take
hold across the southern United States. At the same time, a
short-wave trough embedded within this broader ridge, will move from
north-central Mexico and into central Texas, and a potent short-wave
trough will move across south-central Canada. At the surface, lee
troughing will develop across much of the High Plains as mid-level
winds turn westerly and strengthen in response to the strong
mid-level short-wave trough moving across southern Canada.

... Southern High Plains ...

Surface winds will turn southerly and increase on Sunday in response
to the strengthening surface-pressure gradient between the lee
trough to the west and the antecedent surface high pressure farther
east across the central Plains. This dry return-flow pattern will
result in elevated fire-weather meteorological conditions on Sunday
across portions of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles and surrounding
areas. Here, the downslope component to the surface flow will allow
temperatures to warm into the 50s with minimum relative humidity
percentages falling into the mid-to-upper teens. With very dry fuels
in place, this dry airmass will combine with surface winds ranging
between 15 and 20 mph (with locally higher gusts in excess of 25 mph
possible) to result in elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions.

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorm threat this morning from the
southern Plains to Ohio Valley...

...Moderate to heavy snow expected across northern New England
this evening into Sunday; freezing rain from upstate New York to
central New England...

...Heavy snow to impact the Cascades and far Northern Rockies
today, lingering into Monday...

A low pressure wave developing over the Mid-Mississippi Valley is
forecast to intensify as it tracks toward the New England coast
tonight.  Areas of strong to severe thunderstorms near a
meandering front will keep rounds of moderate to heavy rain this
morning from eastern Oklahoma through the Ohio Valley where up to
a moderate risk of flash flooding is forecast.  As the low
pressure wave moves quickly through the Ohio Valley today, the
front will be guided eastward more quickly, thereby diminishing
the heavy rain threat over the Mid-Mississippi Valley by later
today.  The trailing portion of the front will move more slowly
across the western Gulf Coast where a threat of heavy rain is
forecast for this evening.

In the mean time, with cold air in place across New England, the
intensifying low pressure wave will bring a round of snow and some
mixed precipitation across the lower Great Lakes today.  By
tonight, moderate to heavy snow is forecast to overspread northern
New England from west to east as the low pressure wave intensifies
and tracks near the southern New England coast.  Areas from
upstate New York to central New England should see sleet, freezing
rain, and/or snow tonight before the low quickly exits out to sea
on Sunday.  Much of the wintry precipitation should come to an end
later in the afternoon on Sunday.  Farther south showers and
thunderstorms are expected to move steadily through the East Coast
and the Southeast during the weekend.

Another surge of moisture is entering the Pacific Northwest ahead
of a Pacific low pressure system.  A few inches of coastal/lower
elevation rain is expected, with heavy snow found in the Cascades.
 Snowfall amounts may add up to over 2 feet in the highest peaks
of the northern Cascades.  The system will settle a bit southward
into Oregon on Sunday and then will start to push back northward
Sunday night into Monday as a cyclone is forecast to expand and
push northward off the West Coast.  Some of the heavier
precipitation will then spread northward from Oregon into
Washington by Monday.  Meanwhile, snow is also expected to spread
further east into parts of northern Montana and Idaho this
weekend, where widespread snowfall amounts over 10 inches are
possible.  Colder air will enter the northern Plains Sunday night
into Monday behind an Alberta clipper.  Snow associated with the
cold front is forecast to be light.

Elsewhere, rain chances are expected to increase across southern
Texas later this weekend as a low pressure system is forecast to
develop along a meandering front in the western Gulf of Mexico.

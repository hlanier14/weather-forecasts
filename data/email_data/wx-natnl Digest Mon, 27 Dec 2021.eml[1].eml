...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Satellite and objective mesoscale analysis data show enhanced
mid-level flow -- located near the base of an elongated trough that
is anchored over the Pacific Northwest -- beginning to overspread
portions of the central/southern High Plains. Meanwhile, an
associated lee cyclone is strengthening across the central Plains,
which will promote a broad corridor of strong surface winds by
early/mid afternoon as the lee cyclone shifts eastward.

Overall, today's fire weather forecast remains mostly on track, with
only minor adjustments needed based on the latest model and fuel
guidance. The primary adjustment was to extend the Critical fire
weather area a bit farther westward across southern portions of the
Texas Panhandle. While RH values are forecast to be a bit greater
here than farther east, stronger wind speeds (25+ mph) should help
compensate (especially considering the critically dry fuels).

The greatest potential for higher-end critical fire weather
conditions remains across portions of southeast Colorado, western
Kansas, and the Oklahoma and far northern Texas Panhandle. This area
is forecast to have the best overlap of wind/rh/fuels, as it will be
closer to the enhanced mid-level flow, is forecast to have much less
cloud cover (if any in some locations), and has exceptionally dry
fuels. By afternoon, sustained wind speeds exceeding 25-30 mph
(stronger gusts) are likely amidst near critical RH values (e.g., 15
- 20%), which will likely foster higher-end critical conditions.

Despite somewhat cooler air behind the cold front, a very dry air
mass (with poor RH recoveries) and lingering breeziness may promote
elevated to locally critical fire through the overnight across
portions of western/central Kansas, the Oklahoma and northern Texas
Panhandles, and portions of northwest Oklahoma.

Please see the discussion below for more information on today's fire
weather forecast.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0116 AM CST Sun Dec 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level disturbance is noted in early-morning water-vapor
imagery moving onto the southern CA coast. This feature will begin
to propagate east/northeast through the course of the morning within
the mean southwesterly flow regime, reaching the Plains by
mid-afternoon. Latest surface observations show weak pressure falls
along the lee of the northern to central Rockies, which will
intensify with the approach of the upper-level wave. A consolidated
lee cyclone will likely become established over the central Plains
by late afternoon, supporting a broad swath of strong winds along
the central and southern High Plains. Given this synoptic regime and
antecedent fuel conditions, the potential for elevated to critical
fire weather conditions remains high.

...Central High Plains to the Texas Panhandle...
Confidence in critical fire weather conditions is highest across the
eastern Plains of CO, western KS, and into the northern TX
Panhandle. Close proximity to the deepening surface low, combined
with a strong low/mid-level jet axis overhead, should support
sustained winds between 25-30 mph with frequent gusts up to 50 mph
across this region. The strong downslope flow will likely support RH
reductions into the 15-20% range, and latest ensemble guidance has
trended towards more scattered cloud cover, which will aid in
diurnal warming. Additionally, fuels across this region remain
critically dry (ERC values are well above seasonal record highs for
some locations), which will help support a robust fire-weather
threat.

...West Texas into Southwest Oklahoma...
The Critical risk area has been expanded southward into the Rolling
Plains of northwest TX. Recent ensemble guidance has trended towards
higher probabilities of RH values falling to near/below 20% across
parts of west TX into southwest OK. This is likely due to better
model consensus regarding the axis of the low-level thermal ridge,
which is already overspreading parts of west TX per recent RAP
mesoanalysis. Ensemble temperature forecasts also show the potential
for record high temperatures through this corridor despite the
potential for mid/high-level cloud cover. Confidence in the
temperature/RH forecast remains somewhat modest given observed cloud
trends in IR imagery. However, the warmer/drier trend in most
deterministic/ensemble guidance, coupled with critically dry fuels
and high probability for 20-25 mph winds, warrants the expansion.

...Bitterly cold temperatures to continue through much of the
period across portions of the Northern Plains...


...Overview...

An amplified ridge/upper high should remain anchored over the
northern Pacific through much of the week, eventually getting
suppressed next weekend by potent upper-level energy dropping
south from high latitudes. Downstream, this pattern will result in
general troughing (and chilly weather) across the western U.S.,
including a southern stream likely closed low that drops down the
California coast later this week. Northern stream shortwaves
through the Western trough and rounding the base of a large vortex
across central Canada will allow for a series of low pressure
systems to track across the central and eastern CONUS. The mean
trough and a cold front ahead of it are forecast to finally press
eastward into the central U.S. next weekend as the pattern changes
in the wake of the northern Pacific high weakening.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest models and ensembles continue to show good agreement
with the large scale pattern described above through much of the
period, but with some typical uncertainties in the smaller scale
details. Relatively minor model variations were seen with a series
of shortwaves and the associated surface lows tracking across the
central U.S. to Northeast Wednesday-Friday. For the most part,
00/06Z model guidance continues to indicate fairly good consensus
for the shortwave dropping southward near the West Coast Wednesday
and developing into a closed/cutoff low at least for some period
of time Thursday-Friday (though timing of the cutoff differs
somewhat from model to model). The greater concerns are for the
track and timing of the low--the 00Z UKMET remained a fast outlier
with the eastward turn of the upper low and its absorption back
into the main flow compared to consensus, with the 00Z GFS
slightly slow. Preferred a blend of the more agreeable 06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF and CMC with this feature. By the weekend, guidance all
has the trough axis pushing into the central U.S. as ridging
finally builds into the West, though with some timing and
amplitude differences that are well within normal spread for a
days 6-7 forecast.

The WPC forecast for the early part of the medium range period was
based on a blend of the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC guidance,
quickly phasing out the UKMET for the reasons above. Since
deterministic guidance was in fairly good agreement through the
forecast period, was able to keep the blend for the 500 mb
heights/surface pressures about 70% deterministic models through
the period, with the other 30% GEFS and EC ensemble means. Favored
the GEFS mean slightly more given it showed more indication of the
potential for a closed low offshore of California late this week.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A couple of generally progressive cold fronts will move through
the central and eastern U.S., allowing for periods of widespread
rain and thunderstorms across the Tennessee Valley and
Appalachians into the Southeast. The first round on Wednesday into
Thursday may bring a threat for locally heavy to excessive
rainfall for the Tennessee Valley and Southern Appalachians and
potential severe weather across the Deep South, but with lingering
uncertainty regarding placement and rainfall amounts.
Precipitation chances increase again in roughly the same region by
the weekend as the next cold front makes its way eastward. This
second system may bring wintry weather across northern areas from
the Midwest/Great Lakes into the Northeast over the weekend.

After a break from heavy precipitation across much of the West on
Wednesday (with the exception of southern California), another
round of heavy mountain snows is possible for portions of the
Pacific Northwest/northern Rockies ahead of the shortwave dropping
down the West Coast. As this feature develops into the likely
closed low, it will direct increased moisture into parts of
southern California and into the Four Corners region through
Friday or Saturday, with snow likely in the higher terrain.

Bitterly cold temperatures should continue through at least
Saturday particularly for the northern Plains with daytime highs
(and a lesser extent overnight lows) 20 to 35 degrees below
average. Some areas of northern North Dakota and Montana may stay
below 0F even into next weekend, despite temperatures moderating
slightly as the week progresses. The addition of gusty winds could
result in dangerously cold wind chills, especially for northern
parts of the High Plains where wind chill values could dip well
below 0F for many. Temperatures are also expected to be below
normal by about 5-15 degrees across the rest of the western U.S.,
with record cool highs still possible Wednesday. Temperatures
could cool further over the Intermountain West by Saturday as a
high pressure system builds. Meanwhile, mild to warm weather is
expected across the south-central U.S. and northeastward through
next week, where many places from the southern half of the Plains
to the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic could be 15-25 degrees above
normal on Wednesday through Saturday. Daily record high minimum
and maximum temperatures are likely. A potential pattern shift may
finally bring values back closer to normal, possibly below average
in the south-central U.S., by Sunday.

...Bitterly cold temperatures to continue through much of the
period across portions of the Northern Plains...


...Overview...

An amplified ridge/upper high should remain anchored over the
northern Pacific through much of the week, eventually getting
suppressed next weekend by potent upper-level energy dropping
south from high latitudes. Downstream, this pattern will result in
general troughing (and chilly weather) across the western U.S.,
including a southern stream likely closed low that drops down the
California coast later this week. Northern stream shortwaves
through the Western trough and rounding the base of a large vortex
across central Canada will allow for a series of low pressure
systems to track across the central and eastern CONUS. The mean
trough and a cold front ahead of it are forecast to finally press
eastward into the central U.S. next weekend as the pattern changes
in the wake of the northern Pacific high weakening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 PM CST Sun Dec 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

Gusty and dry low-level return flow atop critically dry fuels will
promote elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions across
the central/southern High Plains tomorrow. The primary adjustment
with this forecast update was to expand the Elevated fire weather
area farther east into the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle and western
Kansas to account for guidance within the more aggressive side of
the fire weather forecast envelope (e.g., HRRR, FV3, RAP), as they
tend to perform best in return flow patterns. While locally critical
conditions are possible within the Elevated area (especially where
fuels are exceptionally dry across southeast Colorado and southwest
Kansas), uncertainty regarding cloud cover and subsequent RH
reductions decreases confidence in the coverage and duration of
critical conditions.

Somewhat poor overnight RH recoveries amidst breezy
northwesterly/westerly surface winds may allow brief/spotty elevated
fire weather conditions to develop from midmorning into midday
tomorrow across portions of Oklahoma. While a few hours of near
elevated fire weather conditions are possible, winds are forecast to
weaken by midday as the surface pressure gradient refocuses farther
to the west.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 12/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0207 AM CST Sun Dec 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow over the central/southern Rockies will persist well into
Monday ahead of a second upper-level wave. While winds aloft will
weaken considerably compared to Sunday, sufficient flow will be in
place to support weak lee troughing near a surface high over KS/MO.
As a result, south to southwesterly surface winds will increase
through the afternoon over a region with antecedent dry fuels,
supporting another day of fire weather concerns.

...Central High Plains...
Dry and windy conditions on Sunday will prime the environment for
Monday's fire weather potential. Poor moisture return into the
region will help maintain a dry air mass, and critically dry fuels
will see little improvement due to somewhat poor overnight RH
recoveries Sunday night into Monday. Although cloud cover will
increase through the day, ensemble guidance shows reasonably high
probability for 15-25% RH along the I-25 corridor by Monday
afternoon. Combined with sustained winds between 15-25 mph, elevated
conditions are probable.

...Western Oklahoma...
Elevated fire weather conditions may evolve during the late
morning/early afternoon hours across western OK. A dry air mass in
place may see RH values fall to near 20% via diurnal warming prior
to the arrival of clouds in the afternoon. Northeast to easterly
winds around 15 mph may support areas of elevated conditions before
gradually weakening later in the afternoon. Although fuels across
western OK are receptive, uncertainties regarding cloud cover and
wind potential yield low confidence in the overall threat at this
time.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun December 26 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Valid 00Z Mon Dec 27 2021 - 00Z Wed Dec 29 2021

...Significant snowfall to continue for portions of West Coast
mountain ranges and the Intermountain West; record cold for parts
of the West Coast...

...Record warm temperatures are expected for broad areas of the
South through the early part of the week while bitterly cold air
expands across the Northern Plains...

...Heavy snow expected in the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest
tonight with some light snow and ice accumulations possible in the
northern Mid-Atlantic and interior Northeast Monday morning...

A stagnant upper-level jet stream pattern across the country will
continue to result in a very broad and rather deep trough of low
pressure across the West with a ridge of high pressure focused
across much of the South and portions of the East as we head into
the final week of 2021. The most impactful weather remains out
West as a steady fetch of Pacific moisture and anomalously cold
temperatures through the atmospheric column will support heavy
snowfall rates that will continue to blanket the mountain ranges
of the West, with an emphasis on areas from the Sierra Nevada to
the central Rockies. The Sierra Nevada which has already picked up
locally several feet of snow over the last few days is expected to
see an additional 2 to 5 feet of snow going through Tuesday.
Meanwhile, other ranges such as the Shasta, the Oregon Cascades,
the Wasatch, Tetons, and Colorado Rockies can expect anywhere from
1 to 2 feet of additional snow. Hazardous travel conditions are
expected across these ranges, prompting the issuance of Winter
Storm Warnings that extend as far south as the Transverse Range of
Southern California. Measurable and disruptive snowfall
accumulations are also on tap again in the Pacific Northwest,
including in both the Portland and Seattle metro areas. This
stretch of wintry weather is able to occur thanks to frigid
temperatures, some of which may tie or break record cold highs and
lows going through Tuesday.

On the flip side, remarkably warm temperatures remain anchored
over the southern U.S. and will continue into the first half of
the upcoming week. The mixing of unusually warm temperatures, low
humidity levels, and windy conditions has prompted the Storm
Prediction Center to issue a Critical Risk of fire weather across
portions of the central and southern High Plains, including the
Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles. Temperature departures for Monday
and Tuesday will be greatest stretching from the southern Plains
to the Mid-South where temperatures reaching well into the 70s and
80s will equate to departures of 25 to 35 degrees above normal. A
passing cold front will cool down part of the Mid-Atlantic on
Monday, but the very warm temperature off the southwest will begin
to encroach on parts of the Ohio Valley and the Mid-Atlantic again
by the middle of the week.

The one exception to the anomalous warmth (aside from the cooler,
stormy set-up along the West Coast) is the Northern Plains where
bitterly cold Canadian air will be filtering southeast behind a
strong cold front. Morning lows are forecast to be sub-zero over
the northern Plains of Montana and North Dakota with daytime highs
struggling to get above zero and through the single digits to
start the new week. In fact, low temperatures Monday morning and
Tuesday morning are locally forecast to be as much 20 to 30
degrees below zero.

Elsewhere, the first in a series of storm systems to exit the
Intermountain West is set to produce heavy snow in the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest through tonight and early Monday morning.
This snow will advance across the northern Great Lakes on Monday
before tapering off Monday evening. Snow totals through Monday
night are likely to range between 6 to 12 inches with locally
higher totals possible, especially in the Minnesota Arrowhead.
This same storm will usher in light snow and freezing rain
accumulations to the northern Mid-Atlantic and interior Northeast
Monday morning. While totals look to be light, slick travel
conditions and delays are possible in these areas on Monday.

...Bitterly cold temperatures to continue Thursday-Saturday across
portions of the Northern Plains...


...Overview...

A blocky and amplified ridge/upper high anchored over the northern
Pacific should finally begin to break down and weaken next
weekend. Before that though, renewed troughing (and chilly
weather) will continue across the Western U.S., including a
southern stream closed low near southern California
Thursday-Friday. An initial northern stream shortwave will send
one system across the Great Lakes/Northeast late this week, but by
the weekend a stronger system (and northern Pacific ridge
weakening) should finally allow for a pattern shift as amplified
troughing shifts into the central U.S. and the East.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest models and ensembles continue to show good agreement
with the large scale pattern through much of the period, but with
lingering uncertainties in the smaller scale details. The 12/18z
guidance continues to indicate good consensus for closed low
development off the California coast, with just some mainly minor
questions remaining in terms of timing and how quickly the energy
ejects into the Southwest and merges with a stronger shortwave
from the north. After this, again, some timing and strength
variability with the amplified trough as it slides into the
Central and eventually Eastern U.S., and then bigger differences
on surface low placement across the Northeast next Sunday and
Monday. Given the day 6-7 time frame though, these differences are
still well within the normal spread.

WPC relied on the deterministic models for days 3-4, eliminating
the UKMET by day 5 as its still a bit faster with the closed low
and shortwave into the Southwest mid period. Given growing
uncertainties late period, favored some incorporation of the
ensemble means, but still able to maintain at least 50% of the
deterministic GFS and ECMWF even at day 7. This also maintained
good consistency with yesterdays WPC forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A cold front into the East on Thursday will allow for some
lingering showers across mainly the Southeast. Precipitation
chances increase again in roughly the same region by the weekend
as the next cold front makes its way eastward. Another well
defined cold front diving south and east this weekend should
result in another round of widespread moderate to locally heavy
rainfall for the Tennessee Valley/Southern Appalachians, and into
the lower Ohio Valley on Saturday. Expect rainfall with this
system to gradually press East on Sunday, with the best chance for
organized rains along and south of the front across parts of the
Southeast. Expect some wintry weather in the north side of the
precipitation shield from the Midwest to the Great Lakes and the
Northeast as well.

Another round of heavy mountain snows is possible for portions of
the Pacific Northwest/northern Rockies on Thursday ahead of a
shortwave into the Northwest. Farther South, the likely closed low
will direct increased moisture into parts of southern California
and into the Four Corners region through Friday or Saturday, with
snow likely in the higher terrain, especially the Colorado Rockies
as the northern stream and southern stream systems merge. The next
frontal system towards the West should bring yet another round of
heavy mountain snows to the Pacific Northwest by this weekend.

Bitterly cold temperatures should continue through at least
Saturday particularly for the northern Plains with daytime highs
(and a lesser extent overnight lows) 20 to 35 degrees below
average. Some areas of northern North Dakota and Montana may stay
below 0F even into next weekend, despite temperatures moderating
slightly as the week progresses. The addition of gusty winds could
result in dangerously cold wind chills, especially for northern
parts of the High Plains where wind chill values could dip well
below 0F for many. Temperatures are also expected to be below
normal by about 5-15 degrees across the rest of the western U.S.
through Sunday. Meanwhile, mild to warm weather is expected across
the south-central U.S. and northeastward through next week, where
many places from the southern half of the Plains to the Ohio
Valley/Mid-Atlantic could be 15-25 degrees above normal through
Saturday. More daily record high minimum and maximum temperatures
are likely. A potential pattern shift may finally bring values
back closer to normal, possibly below average in the south-central
U.S. by Sunday and the East by next Monday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0106 AM CST Mon Dec 27 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
Early-morning surface observations across the High Plains/Southern
Plains show poor overnight RH recovery (with RH values in the teens
to 30s) after strong downslope winds Sunday afternoon. Further
north, surface pressure rises are noted across the Plains in the
wake of a departing surface low, indicating building high pressure
that will keep the dry air mass in place for today. Aloft,
southwesterly flow is expected to gradually weaken, but will
maintain a strong enough zonal component for modest lee troughing
this afternoon. The resultant pressure gradient will induce breezy
winds along the High Plains on the western periphery of the dry air
mass, yielding fire weather concerns for a region with antecedent
dry fuels.

...Central High Plains...
Guidance continues to show reasonably high agreement in southerly
winds increasing to 15-25 mph from eastern CO/western KS into the NE
Panhandle. While most ensemble members suggest RH reductions to 20%
are probable, drier conditions with RH values in the teens are more
likely to the east across central KS/southern NE where winds will be
somewhat weaker. This slight displacement of the lowest RH and
strongest winds, in conjunction with modest boundary-layer flow and
increasing afternoon clouds, yields low confidence in the potential
for widespread critical conditions (though localized/transient
critical conditions will likely evolve within this region).

...Eastern New Mexico...
Across eastern NM, downslope winds combined with warm temperatures
under the low-level thermal ridge will likely result in a few hours
of elevated wind/RH conditions. Although afternoon cloud cover casts
some uncertainty into the forecast, strong model consensus and
receptive fuels warrant the southward expansion.

...Western Oklahoma...
Winds are forecast to increase during the morning hours as the
pressure gradient temporarily tightens across the southern Plains.
This may result in areas of 20-25% RH with 15 mph winds by around 18
UTC. However, the regional pressure gradient is expected to weaken
through the afternoon during peak diurnal warming, which will limit
the duration of the fire weather threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CST Mon Dec 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave, currently noted in water-vapor imagery off
the West Coast, is forecast to propagate through the southwesterly
mean flow over the Rockies early Tuesday morning. As this occurs, a
surface low is expected to deepen over the central Plains and
tighten the regional pressure gradient. The net result will be
increasing west/southwesterly winds between 15-20 mph across the
central/southern High Plains into the southern Plains Tuesday.
Antecedent dry fuels and minimal moisture return will support
another day of elevated, to potentially critical, fire weather
concerns.

...Southern/Central High Plains...
Guidance over the past 24 hours has trended towards an earlier
passage of the main synoptic disturbance and places the strongest
boundary-layer flow over the MS River Valley by the afternoon hours.
Despite this displacement of the strongest flow, mostly clear to
partly cloudy skies should yield sufficient mixing to support
frequent gusts between 25-35 mph. With RH values in the 15-25%
range, elevated conditions appear likely. Critical conditions are
possible, but will most likely occur under any axes of stronger
850-700 mb flow. While confidence in the placement of such axes is
low, deterministic solutions, backed by some ensemble guidance,
suggest the most likely corridor for critical conditions lies along
and north of the I-20 corridor across west TX. A Critical risk area
may be introduce in subsequent outlooks if confidence in this
corridor increases.

...Kansas...
A southward-moving cold front is expected to push across KS through
the day Tuesday. Elevated fire weather conditions are likely ahead
of this front, but the duration of the threat will be determined by
the timing of the frontal passage. Uncertainty in the longevity of
fire weather conditions increases with northward extent, and
refinement of the current risk area is possible. Regardless, the
northerly wind shift, coupled with dry post-frontal air, may impact
any ongoing fire suppression efforts.

...Significant snowfall to continue for portions of West Coast
mountain ranges and the Intermountain West; record cold for parts
of the West Coast...

...A pair of storm systems to bring snow and an icy wintry mix to
the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast; Marginal Risk for
Excessive Rainfall from the mid-Mississippi Valley to the Ohio
Valley on Tuesday...

...Record warm temperatures expected for broad areas of the South;
dangerously cold wind chills in the northern High Plains, Elevated
Risk for fire weather in the High Plains...

The unrelenting troughing pattern over the West Coast finally
makes its way a little farther east to kick off the final week of
2021. This results in an increasingly active storm track in the
East as storm systems originating out West track through the
eastern half of the Lower 48 this week. The first storm is
unfolding in the Upper Midwest this morning with its associated
shield of precipitation stretching from northern Minnesota to the
northern Mid-Atlantic. Periods of snow in parts of the Upper
Midwest and northern Great Lakes will generally lead to light
accumulations, but totals over 6 inches are possible in the
Minnesota Arrowhead. Farther east, warmer air aloft will support
the potential for an icy wintry mix in the central Great Lakes and
northern Mid-Atlantic. Travel delays due to icy conditions are
possible in these regions, both on the ground and in the air. As
this storm system weakens Monday evening, the next storm system
already causing heavy mountain snow along the West Coast on Monday
will track across the Intermountain West Monday night and into
Tuesday morning. The Sierra Nevada are expected to receive another
1 to 2 feet of snow with totals up to 3 feet possible in the
highest elevations. From the Wasatch to the Colorado Rockies,
mountain snow totals appear to be on the order of 8 to 12 inches
with localized amounts up to 2 feet. This next western U.S. storm
system then heads into the Plains by Tuesday where a strengthening
low pressure system is primed to bring another round of wintry
weather to the Upper Midwest with anywhere from a coating to 6
inches possible. Light but still potentially travel disruptive ice
accumulations, from a glaze to a tenth of an inch, may ensue from
Iowa and the central Great Lakes Tuesday morning, to the interior
northern Mid-Atlantic by Tuesday evening. Look for periods of rain
and even some thunderstorms to breakout across the Ohio Valley and
into the Mid-South. Excessive Rainfall could lead to localized
flash flooding, prompting the issuance of a Marginal Risk from
southern Missouri to the Ohio Valley on Tuesday.

Temperature-wise, the slight eastward push of the upper trough in
the West allows for more Canadian air to spill in behind it
throughout the western third of the country. The coldest
temperatures for the period will be focused in the northern High
Plains where daytime highs in Montana and North Dakota will
struggle to get above zero. Blustery conditions will also lead to
dangerously cold wind chills ranging as low cold as -30 to -50
degrees, leading to the issuance of Wind Chill Warnings and
Advisories. Some record cold lows and cold max temps are possible
up and down the West Coast today, including the Pacific Northwest
where metro areas such as Seattle and Portland may not get above
freezing today. Meanwhile, the southern and eastern U.S. continue
to be under the influence of upper level ridging over the
Southeast, causing very warm southerly flow to keep much above
normal temps in the forecast through mid-week. Parts of the South
Central U.S. will soar into the 70s and 80s once again this
afternoon, with temperatures becoming warmer across much of the
Deep South by Tuesday. Numerous record warm highs and lows are on
tap Tuesday and should continue into Wednesday. The abnormally
warm conditions, mixed with dry conditions and gusty winds keeps
Elevated Risks for fire weather in the fold across portions of the
central and southern High Plains today and Tuesday.

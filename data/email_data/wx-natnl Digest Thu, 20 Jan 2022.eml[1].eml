NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions
made. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 01/19/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0105 AM CST Wed Jan 19 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low through the day Thursday for
most of the CONUS. Cool temperatures behind Wednesday's cold front
will overspread the central and southern Plains where fuels have
been dry. Latest guidance has trended towards sunnier, drier
conditions across central KS/OK and into northern TX with RH
reductions into the low 20s possible. However, winds are expected to
diminish through the day as a surface high builds over the region.
This will limit the temporal overlap of stronger winds in the
morning with drier conditions in the afternoon. Ensemble guidance
suggests the highest probability for a few hours of elevated
conditions resides across central TX, but this potential appears too
limited to warrant delineation at this time.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
128 PM EST Wed Jan 19 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Jan 22 2022 - 12Z Wed Jan 26 2022

18Z Update:  The overall trend in the 12Z model guidance suite is
for a faster and slightly more suppressed surface low that tracks
out to sea by Saturday morning, with any lingering precipitation
coming to an end across the coastal Mid-Atlantic by mid-day
Saturday.  There is no indication that this storm will have any
significant impacts for the Northeast U.S. at this time.  For the
closed low that ejects from the Southwest to the Gulf Coast
region, the CMC is on the fast side of the model guidance with the
arrival of the trough to the northern Gulf early next week, and
there has been a gradual increase in the QPF expected from the
associated low that develops along the front across the central
and western Gulf Coast region.  By the end of the forecast period,
this storm system will likely head east across Florida and then
out to sea.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily
derived from a multi-deterministic blend through early Monday, and
then incorporated some of the NAEFS/ECENS for days 6 and 7.  The
rest of the forecast remains on track and the previous forecast
discussion is appended below for reference.  /Hamrick
______________________________

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance remains in good agreement with the mean flow over the
lower 48 highlighted by an amplified upper ridge off/along the
West Coast and an amplified and unsettling upper trough over the
central to eastern U.S. that coincides with several short and
medium range Arctic blasts with periods of much below normal
temperatures. The models have been less than stellar with the run
to run continuity of embedded shortwaves rotating through the mean
upper trough position and surface system reflection, but seem to
be slowly improving. Given lingering model variance issues
however, the earlier released WPC medium range product suite was
primarily derived from the 12 UTC GEFS mean and especially the
ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models. The 00 UTC models seem to be converging on better
clustered solutions that have overall trended favorably toward the
WPC composite solution, bolstering forecast confidence.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

00 UTC forecast guidance is better clustered with an important
shortwave trough exiting the Mid-Atlantic Saturday that offers
potential for coastal storm development. The 00 UTC models better
agree with development of an organized low off the Mid-Atlantic
and New England. The WPC Winter Weather Outlook holds a lingering
chance for coastal snows into Day 4/Saturday with the exiting low
given the threat of a few more robust ensemble members.

Upstream, models generally agree to carve out a Southwest
U.S/northern Mexico closed low by Saturday that offers terrain
enhanced snow potential from the Mogollon Rim to the southern
Rockies/High Plains. The system remains slated to be ejected
eastward across the U.S. southern tier early next week. Lead
moisture return from the Gulf of Mexico will overrun a
trailing/wavy front to fuel a decent swath of precipitation within
a cooled airmass from Texas eastward across the Gulf Coast.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
128 PM EST Wed Jan 19 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Jan 22 2022 - 12Z Wed Jan 26 2022

18Z Update:  The overall trend in the 12Z model guidance suite is
for a faster and slightly more suppressed surface low that tracks
out to sea by Saturday morning, with any lingering precipitation
coming to an end across the coastal Mid-Atlantic by mid-day
Saturday.  There is no indication that this storm will have any
significant impacts for the Northeast U.S. at this time.  For the
closed low that ejects from the Southwest to the Gulf Coast
region, the CMC is on the fast side of the model guidance with the
arrival of the trough to the northern Gulf early next week, and
there has been a gradual increase in the QPF expected from the
associated low that develops along the front across the central
and western Gulf Coast region.  By the end of the forecast period,
this storm system will likely head east across Florida and then
out to sea.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily
derived from a multi-deterministic blend through early Monday, and
then incorporated some of the NAEFS/ECENS for days 6 and 7.  The
rest of the forecast remains on track and the previous forecast
discussion is appended below for reference.  /Hamrick
______________________________

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance remains in good agreement with the mean flow over the
lower 48 highlighted by an amplified upper ridge off/along the
West Coast and an amplified and unsettling upper trough over the
central to eastern U.S. that coincides with several short and
medium range Arctic blasts with periods of much below normal
temperatures. The models have been less than stellar with the run
to run continuity of embedded shortwaves rotating through the mean
upper trough position and surface system reflection, but seem to
be slowly improving. Given lingering model variance issues
however, the earlier released WPC medium range product suite was
primarily derived from the 12 UTC GEFS mean and especially the
ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models. The 00 UTC models seem to be converging on better
clustered solutions that have overall trended favorably toward the
WPC composite solution, bolstering forecast confidence.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

00 UTC forecast guidance is better clustered with an important
shortwave trough exiting the Mid-Atlantic Saturday that offers
potential for coastal storm development. The 00 UTC models better
agree with development of an organized low off the Mid-Atlantic
and New England. The WPC Winter Weather Outlook holds a lingering
chance for coastal snows into Day 4/Saturday with the exiting low
given the threat of a few more robust ensemble members.

Upstream, models generally agree to carve out a Southwest
U.S/northern Mexico closed low by Saturday that offers terrain
enhanced snow potential from the Mogollon Rim to the southern
Rockies/High Plains. The system remains slated to be ejected
eastward across the U.S. southern tier early next week. Lead
moisture return from the Gulf of Mexico will overrun a
trailing/wavy front to fuel a decent swath of precipitation within
a cooled airmass from Texas eastward across the Gulf Coast.

across the eastern U.S., with increasing chances for relatively colder
temperatures over parts of the western U.S. by the start of February.

FOR THURSDAY JANUARY 27 - WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 02: The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensembles depict an amplified 500-hPa geopotential height pattern
across North America early in week-2, with troughing in the East and upstre=
am
ridging over the western CONUS and eastern Pacific. By the end of January, =
the
Pacific-North American Pattern (PNA) is favored to trend toward a negative
phase, suggestive of a pattern change over the U.S. This is evidenced in th=
e
daily 500-hPa progression in the models, which depicts anomalous ridging
building over the Eastern Pacific, and the initial troughing becoming more
focused along the East Coast by the middle of the period, and lifting out
completely by the end of week-2. The highest probabilities for anomalous co=
ld
are over the eastern U.S. early in week-2, with a high risk for much below
normal temperatures designated across portions of the eastern Ohio Valley,
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast from Jan 27-28. The ECMWF reforec=
ast
tool depicts probabilities of at least 60 percent for temperatures falling
below the 15th climatological percentile over the high risk area,
corresponding
with minimum temperatures in the single digits and teens (deg F) based on
uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF guidance.



A moderate risk for much below normal temperatures is posted over parts of =
the
Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley on day-8 (Jan 27) only, and continues
through day-10 (Jan 29) for portions of the Great Lakes, Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys, Appachachians, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast. A quick
moderation of temperatures is possible across the Midwest, and the ECMWF
reforecast tool no longer depicts probabilities greater than 20 percent for
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile after Jan 27. Positi=
ve
temperature anomalies are indicated across parts of the Great Plains early =
in
week-2, with the ECMWF ensemble spreading some of this anomalous warmth int=
o
the Mississippi Valley. However, the GEFS persists anomalous cold across th=
e
region longer, and both models depict a cooling trend later in week-2 as th=
e
pattern transitions to more troughing across western North America. Despite
these differences, a slight risk for much below normal temperatures extends
through Jan 31, covering much of the eastern half of the U.S.



Mid-level heights are forecast to decrease across the western CONUS during
week-2 due to the retrogression of the ridge, with weakly amplified troughi=
ng
being depicted in the dynamical models over the West later in the period. T=
his
is consistent with the trend toward a negative PNA as well as the continuin=
g
La
Nina conditions. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts probabilities of at leas=
t
20
percent indicating minimum temperatures dropping below the 15th climatologi=
cal
percentile along the west coast of the CONUS, and across parts of the North=
ern
Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Northern Plains late in week-2 as this
troughing becomes more established. This justifies a slight risk for much
below
normal temperatures for these areas from Jan 31-Feb 2.



During week-2, increasing ridging is forecast to build across the eastern
North-Pacific, including Alaska. Despite this, dynamical models indicate an
area of surface low pressure over the Gulf of Alaska, which would lead to
increased precipitation and winds across parts of the southeastern coastal
Mainland and the Panhandle, especially early in week-2. However, hazards
thresholds are unlikely to be reached, with near to below normal precipitat=
ion
forecast for the period as a whole across these areas. By the end of week-2=
,
the area of surface low pressure is forecast to weaken and shift
southeastward,
with the surface flow across southeastern Alaska becoming more easterly. Th=

there is not enough confidence to issue related temperature or precipitatio=

...Widespread wintry precipitation and rain expected from the East
Coast to to southern Texas...

...Potentially significant freezing rain for the Carolinas and
snow for the southern Mid-Atlantic begins Friday...

...Frigid cold expands across most of the central and eastern
U.S....

...Lower elevation rain and higher terrain snow forecast from the
Pacific Northwest to the Northern Plains...

Widespread wintry precipitation and frigid temperatures will
impact many regions across the country during the short-term
forecast period (Wednesday evening through Friday evening). Snow,
sleet, and freezing rain are forecast from New England to south
Texas behind a powerful cold front moving east across the country.
Starting in the north, light snow showers will continue for
portions of the Great Lakes east to northern New England overnight
Wednesday. Potentially more significant snowfall will occur
starting overnight Wednesday for the Ohio Valley and spreading
east to the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England Thursday
morning. While snowfall totals are forecast to remain between 1-2
inches for most locations, the snow will likely fall quickly and
overlap the Thursday morning commute, particularly for the major
cities of the Northeast. Further South, rain and thunderstorms
will continue along the cold front across the Southeast and the
Gulf Coast. Some locally heavy rain of 1-2 inches is possible, but
low rainnrates and quick moving storms will keep the threat of
flooding low. Of greater significance will be the potential for
icing from the Tennessee Valley south to the Gulf Coast as colder
air moves in behind the front. While totals should remain light,
with only a glaze expected for most areas, the icing may lead to
slick roads, particularly bridges. Winter Storm Watches and Winter
Weather Advisories have been issued for portions of Southern
Texas.

The most concerning portion of the forecast comes Friday as a wave
of low pressure along the cold front deepens off the coast when
the front moves into the Atlantic, encouraging potentially
significant freezing rain across the Carolinas and snow for the
southern Mid-Atlantic. While impacts from this storm will continue
beyond the current forecast period, the freezing rain may start as
early as Thursday evening for the Carolinas. Winter Storm Watches
have been issued for portions of northeastern South Carolina and
eastern North Carolina for the potential of 0.2 - 0.4 inches of
freezing rain through Saturday morning. Areas west and north of
the immediate coast from Myrtle Beach north to Wilmington have the
greatest chance of seeing higher end totals. Freezing rain of this
magnitude has the potential to cause widespread tree damage and
power outages. In addition, snow will begin further north from the
Tidewater of southeastern Virginia to the southern DelMarVa
peninsula Friday and continue into Saturday. Snow totals of 4"+
are forecast.

Meanwhile, behind the front, frigid cold will continue to expand
across most of the central and eastern U.S.. Highs on Thursday
will range from the single digits across the Upper Midwest, the
teens and 20s from the Northeast to the Central Plains, and the
30s and 40s from the Carolinas to the western Gulf Coast.
Temperatures will drop even colder on Friday for the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic with highs in the teens and 20s common, while highs
in the 40s expand across most portions of the Gulf Coast outside
the Florida Peninsula. Wind Chill Advisories remain in effect from
the Northern High Plains to the Upper Mississippi Valley for
Thursday morning with lows forecast in the negative teens and 20s
and gusty winds expected. A Freeze Watch is also out for portions
of South Texas for Friday morning, as lows will dip into the upper
20s and low 30s for most areas outside of the lower Rio Grande
Valley.

A storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest will move inland
by Thursday morning, continuing chances for lower elevation rain
and mountain snow for portions Washington and Oregon overnight
Wednesday and into the day Thursday. The snow will expand into the
Northern Rockies throughout the day on Thursday and into the
Central Rockies and Northern Plains on Friday as another system
organizes over Canada and progresses to the southeast across the
Northern Plains. Snow accumulations should generally remain light,
with totals of more than a couple of inches confined to higher
elevation mountain locations.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Wed January 19 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 25 - 29 2022

A high amplitude pattern is likely to persist into late January with a 500-=
hPa
ridge (trough) over the northeast Pacific (eastern North America). The
ensemble
means continue to depict the amplified ridge just offshore of the West Coas=
t
retrograding westward closer to the Aleutians by the end of January. This
transition to the location of anomalous ridging near the Aleutians would be
more consistent with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa but it is expected to take ti=
me for a downstream
trough to develop over western North America.

The amplified 500-hPa trough over eastern North America favors a continuati=
on
of the anomalously cold temperatures from the Mississippi Valley to the Eas=
t
Coast, along with the southern Great Plains. Model solutions feature strong
surface high pressure shifting southeastward over the east-central CONUS fr=
om
days 6 to 8 (Jan 25-27). Negative temperature anomalies of -10 to -20 degre=
es
F
are forecast to accompany this surface high. A 500-hPa ridge with associate=
d
above normal heights extending east to include much of the western CONUS
favors
near to above normal temperatures for this region. The two most likely area=
s
for above normal temperatures include the desert Southwest and Northern Hig=
h
Plains, due to good model agreement. Also, the Northern High Plains remain
snow-free, which is unusual for this time of year. With the absence of cold
air
advection forecast during this 5-day period, the sparse snow coverage is
expected to contribute to warming surface temperatures. A small area with
enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures forecast across parts o=
f
the Great Basin is related to predicted low-level inversions.

Forecast confidence in the precipitation outlook across the eastern CONUS
remains low due to high uncertainty in the interaction between shortwave
troughs in the northern and southern streams. Also, the longitudinal positi=
on
of the longwave trough axis will be a critical factor in determining how mu=
ch
storminess and precipitation occurs across the eastern CONUS during the nex=
t
two weeks. Given the progressive mid-level flow, probabilities for below
normal
precipitation are slightly elevated for the interior Northeast and Ohio to
Tennessee Valleys. Near normal precipitation is more probable closer to the
East Coast and near to above normal precipitation is favored across the Gul=
f
Coast and Florida as waves of low pressure are predicted to track along a m=
ean
frontal boundary. A two-category change in the precipitation outlook (wet t=
o
dry) was necessary across the Northern High Plains due to prevalent downslo=
pe
flow. The most likely area for above normal precipitation across the High
Plains has shifted southward today based on precipitation tools and predict=
ed
surface pattern. Below normal precipitation remains likely across much of t=
he
western CONUS due to mean 500-hPa ridging upstream over the North Pacific.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored for Alaska due to modest onsh=
ore
flow and a west-to-east storm track. This predicted surface pattern also
increases probabilities for above normal temperatures across the eastern
two-thirds of Mainland Alaska. Negative sea surface temperature anomalies
slightly favor below normal temperatures along coastal western Alaska, the
Aleutians, and Alaska Peninsula.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the temperature tools offset by low confidence in the
precipitation outlook across the eastern CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 27 - FEB 02, 2022

Ensemble means depict a retrogression of the longwave ridge axis from the
Northeast Pacific to near the Aleutians during week-2, while the amplified
500-hPa trough over eastern North America gradually weakens. A transition t=
o a
longwave pattern, more typical of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa, is expected to =
occur by the
beginning of February. Following a negative phase of the Pacific North
American
(PNA) pattern persisting from December into the beginning of January, a
positive PNA has prevailed during mid-January. The GFS ensemble members
indicate that the PNA index becomes more neutral or even negative later in
week-2. Since ensemble means are in excellent agreement with a large positi=
ve
500-hPa height anomaly center (+200 meters) over the Aleutians,
teleconnections
derived upon this anomaly were used in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs te=
mperature and precipitation
outlooks.

The likely anomalous cold, especially early in week-2, favors below normal
temperatures for the eastern CONUS. If the 500-hPa trough weakens as predic=
ted
by the ensemble means, temperatures are expected to moderate toward the
beginning of February. Near normal temperatures are favored for the norther=
n
and central Great Plains as ensemble means depict a transition from above t=
o
below normal temperatures during week-2. As 500-hPa heights decrease with
time,
probabilities for below normal temperatures become slightly elevated for pa=
rts
of the Pacific Northwest. The most likely area for above normal temperature=
s
over the CONUS is much of the Southwest, due to good agreement among the
temperature tools and consistent daily signals for above normal temperature=
s.

As was the case in the 6-10 day precipitation outlook, low forecast confide=
nce
exists and expands to include all of the CONUS with the predicted longwave
pattern change. Since a 500-hPa through is forecast to develop over the
western
CONUS later in week-2, a wetter pattern is forecast for this region from th=
e
6-10 to 8-14 day period. However, below normal precipitation remains slight=
ly
favored along the West Coast with the lack of onshore flow, and also across
parts of the Southwest, based on good model agreement. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored for the eastern third of the CONUS, given the
location
of the 500-hPa trough axis and progressive flow downstream over the norther=
n
Atlantic. An expected increase in return flow from the Gulf of Mexico coupl=
ed
with shortwave troughs within the southern stream slightly elevate
probabilities for above normal precipitation across parts of Texas and the
western Gulf Coast.

A transition to a drier pattern is likely for Alaska heading through the
week-2
period as the high amplitude ridge becomes established from the Aleutians
northward to the Bering Strait. Also, this longwave pattern would eventuall=
y
result in the return of anomalous cold. However, near normal temperatures a=
re
favored for parts of Mainland Alaska as residual above normal temperatures
linger into the beginning of week-2.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted longwave pattern transition.

...Widespread wintry precipitation and rain expected from the East
Coast to to southern Texas...

...Potentially significant freezing rain for the Carolinas and
snow for the southern Mid-Atlantic begins Friday...

...Frigid cold expands across most of the central and eastern
U.S....

...Lower elevation rain and higher terrain snow forecast from the
Pacific Northwest to the Northern Plains...

Widespread wintry precipitation and frigid temperatures will
impact many regions across the country during the short-term
forecast period (Wednesday evening through Friday evening). Snow,
sleet, and freezing rain are forecast from New England to south
Texas behind a powerful cold front moving east across the country.
Starting in the north, light snow showers will continue for
portions of the Great Lakes east to northern New England overnight
Wednesday. Potentially more significant snowfall will occur
starting overnight Wednesday for the Ohio Valley and spreading
east to the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England Thursday
morning. While snowfall totals are forecast to remain between 1-2
inches for most locations, the snow will likely fall quickly and
overlap the Thursday morning commute, particularly for the major
cities along the I-95 corridor. Further South, rain and
thunderstorms will continue along the cold front across the
Southeast and the Gulf Coast. Some locally heavy rain of 1-2
inches is possible, but low rain rates and quick moving storms
will keep the threat of flooding low. Of greater significance will
be the potential for icing from the Tennessee Valley south to the
Gulf Coast and southern Texas as colder air moves in behind the
front Thursday evening. While totals should remain light, with
only a glaze expected for most areas, the icing may lead to slick
roads, particularly bridges. Winter Storm Watches and Winter
Weather Advisories have been issued for portions of southern
Texas.

The most concerning portion of the forecast comes Friday as a wave
of low pressure along the cold front deepens off the coast when
the front moves into the Atlantic, encouraging potentially
significant freezing rain across the Carolinas and snow for the
southern Mid-Atlantic. While impacts from this storm will continue
beyond the current forecast period, the freezing rain may start as
early as Thursday evening for the Carolinas. Winter Storm Watches
have been issued for portions of northeastern South Carolina and
eastern North Carolina for the potential of 0.2" - 0.4" of
freezing rain through Saturday morning. Areas west and north of
the immediate coast from Myrtle Beach north to Wilmington have the
greatest chance of seeing the higher end totals. Freezing rain of
this magnitude has the potential to cause widespread tree damage
and power outages. In addition, snow will begin further north from
the Tidewater of southeastern Virginia to the southern DelMarVa
peninsula Friday and continue into Saturday. Snow totals of 4"+
are forecast.

Meanwhile, behind the front, frigid cold will continue to expand
across most of the central and eastern U.S. Highs on Thursday will
range from the single digits across the Upper Midwest, the teens
and 20s from the Northeast to the Central Plains, and the 30s and
40s from the Carolinas to the western Gulf Coast. Temperatures
will drop even colder on Friday for the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
with highs in the teens and 20s common, while highs in the 40s
expand east along the Gulf Coast outside the Florida Peninsula.
Wind Chill Advisories remain in effect from the Northern High
Plains east to the Upper Mississippi Valley for Thursday morning
with lows forecast in the negative teens and 20s and gusty winds
expected. A Freeze Watch is also out for portions of South Texas
for Friday morning as lows will dip into the upper 20s and low 30s
for most areas outside of the lower Rio Grande Valley.

A storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest will move inland
by Thursday morning, continuing chances for lower elevation rain
and mountain snow for portions Washington and Oregon overnight
Wednesday and into the day Thursday. The snow will expand into the
Northern Rockies throughout the day on Thursday and into the
Central Rockies and Northern Plains on Friday as another system
organizes over Canada and progresses to the southeast across the
Northern Plains. Snow accumulations should generally remain light,
with totals of more than a couple of inches confined to higher
elevation in the mountains.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
330 PM EST Wed Jan 19 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Jan 22 2022 - 12Z Wed Jan 26 2022

18Z Update:  The overall trend in the 12Z model guidance suite is
for a faster and slightly more suppressed surface low that tracks
out to sea by Saturday morning, with any lingering precipitation
coming to an end across the coastal Mid-Atlantic by mid-day
Saturday.  There is no indication that this storm will have any
significant impacts for the Northeast U.S. at this time.  For the
closed low that ejects from the Southwest to the Gulf Coast
region, the CMC is on the fast side of the model guidance with the
arrival of the trough to the northern Gulf early next week, and
there has been a gradual increase in the QPF expected from the
associated low that develops along the front across the central
and western Gulf Coast region.  By the end of the forecast period,
this storm system will likely head east across Florida and then
out to sea.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily
derived from a multi-deterministic blend through early Monday, and
then incorporated some of the NAEFS/ECENS for days 6 and 7.  The
rest of the forecast remains on track and the previous forecast
discussion is appended below for reference.  /Hamrick
______________________________

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance remains in good agreement with the mean flow over the
lower 48 highlighted by an amplified upper ridge off/along the
West Coast and an amplified and unsettling upper trough over the
central to eastern U.S. that coincides with several short and
medium range Arctic blasts with periods of much below normal
temperatures. The models have been less than stellar with the run
to run continuity of embedded shortwaves rotating through the mean
upper trough position and surface system reflection, but seem to
be slowly improving. Given lingering model variance issues
however, the earlier released WPC medium range product suite was
primarily derived from the 12 UTC GEFS mean and especially the
ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models. The 00 UTC models seem to be converging on better
clustered solutions that have overall trended favorably toward the
WPC composite solution, bolstering forecast confidence.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

00 UTC forecast guidance is better clustered with an important
shortwave trough exiting the Mid-Atlantic Saturday that offers
potential for coastal storm development. The 00 UTC models better
agree with development of an organized low off the Mid-Atlantic
and New England. The WPC Winter Weather Outlook holds a lingering
chance for coastal snows into Day 4/Saturday with the exiting low
given the threat of a few more robust ensemble members.

Upstream, models generally agree to carve out a Southwest
U.S/northern Mexico closed low by Saturday that offers terrain
enhanced snow potential from the Mogollon Rim to the southern
Rockies/High Plains. The system remains slated to be ejected
eastward across the U.S. southern tier early next week. Lead
moisture return from the Gulf of Mexico will overrun a
trailing/wavy front to fuel a decent swath of precipitation within
a cooled airmass from Texas eastward across the Gulf Coast.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1200 AM CST Thu Jan 20 2022

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low for today as an arctic air
mass remains over the central CONUS. Latest fuel analyses maintain
the driest fuels across the southern Plains/southern High Plains
where little precipitation has fallen over the past week. Although
early-morning surface observations show widespread 15-25 mph
post-frontal winds across OK/TX, winds will steadily abate through
the morning hours as the regional pressure gradient weakens. Strong
cold advection across the region is also ushering unseasonably dry
air (dewpoint values in OK are currently near or below the 10th
percentile for mid-January). This dry air will support RH reductions
into the 20-35% range by the late afternoon hours as winds weaken to
10-15 mph. The poor temporal overlap of stronger winds with drier RH
will limit the overall fire weather threat and precludes introducing
any risk areas. However, 1-2 hours of elevated conditions may occur
across central to northern TX around mid-day as falling RH coincides
with breezy winds.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles are in good agreement with the amplified mean
flow over the lower 48 highlighted by an upper ridge off/along the
West Coast and an upper trough over the central to eastern U.S..
Guidance now offers more characteristic run to run continuity
issues with embedded systems within the larger scale flow over
time in a pattern with seemingly near normal forecast
predictability.

Accordingly, the earlier issued WPC medium range product suite was
mainly derived from a composite of the the reasonably well
clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models for days 3/4 (Sunday/Monday). Transitioned to a composite
of the compatible 18 UTC GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble means
along with the NBM for days 5-7 (Tuesday-next Thursday). This
along with some applied manual adjustments consistent with
uncertainty maintains decent WPC product continuity that also
remains generally in line with a similar composite plan from newer
00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A weekend southern stream Southwest U.S/northern Mexico closed low
offers some snow potential for the Southern Rockies/High Plains.
The system will eject eastward across the U.S. southern tier early
next week and wave genesis on a lingering trailing front over the
Gulf of Mexico will induce lead moisture return from the Gulf of
Mexico to fuel a moderate swath of precipitation within a cooled
airmass from Texas eastward across the Gulf Coast/Southeast. This
may include some snow/ice on the northern periphery of
precipitation.

The next in a series of Arctic Blasts will again spread far south
over the central and eastern U.S. Monday-next Thursday as another
mean flow reinforcing upper trough digs southeastward from Canada.
Transitory frontal enhanced upslope snows will dig through the
cooling Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Northern stream upper
system passage and frontal low genesis on the leading edge of
Arctic air starting Monday should support a windy snow swath from
the Dakotas through the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes. Low development
through the Great Lakes/Northeast Tuesday into Wednesday and
trailing cold frontal passage across the East favors lingering
lake effect along with some threat of plowable snows from the
Appalachians through the Northeast. System evolution becomes
complex offshore and into the Canadian Maritime by midweek as the
aforementioned southern stream system phases/lifts on the lead
periphery of the amplified northern stream upper trough.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0114 AM CST Thu Jan 20 2022

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The potential for widespread or robust fire weather concerns appears
low for Friday, though a few regional, low-end fire weather concerns
may evolve across the southern Plains and coastal southern
California.

...Southern Plains...
An unseasonably dry air mass currently moving into OK and north TX
will linger into Friday with dewpoint values in the single digits.
While temperatures will remain cool, mostly clear skies should allow
for enough diurnal warming for RH values to fall into the 20-30%
range within the dry air mass. To the west, increasing zonal winds
aloft over the Rockies will support modest lee troughing across
eastern CO and northeast NM. In response, surface winds will
increase to 10-20 mph across the Panhandles and western OK. While
the windiest conditions will generally be displaced from the drier
air, patchy elevated conditions may develop across northwest TX into
western OK where an overlap of dry/windy conditions and dry fuels is
possible. Confidence in the coverage and duration of such conditions
is too low to warrant highlights.

...Coast Southern California...
Building surface high pressure behind a deepening upper-level trough
will bolster the offshore pressure gradient across southern CA over
the next 24-48 hours. Santa Ana winds are expected to increase to
20-35 mph by late Friday afternoon and into early Saturday morning,
and wind gusts up to 50-60 mph are possible within the higher
terrain of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. While a shallow marine
boundary layer is currently in place along the southern CA coast,
downslope warming/drying through Friday night will support RH
reductions into the low 20s and perhaps upper teens. Elevated to
locally critical wind/RH combinations appear likely during the
Friday evening to early Saturday morning time frame, but ERC values
along the CA coast are well below seasonal average due to
anomalously high precipitation totals over the past month. This will
mitigate the fire weather threat, though trends in fuel status will
be monitored.

...There is a Risk of rain/freezing rain over parts of southern
Texas and North Carolina on Thursday...

...Light snow from parts of the Mid-Atlantic to Southern New
England; Light to moderate snow over parts of the Northern/Central
Rockies on Thursday...

...Snow and a Risk of significant rain/freezing rain over parts of
the southern Mid-Atlantic on Friday...

... Light to moderate snow over parts of the Upper Midwest and
Central Rockies on Friday...

A front extending from Southern New England southwestward to the
Central Gulf Coast moves off most of the East and Gulf Coast by
Thursday evening. A wave of low pressure along the boundary will
linger over parts of the Southeast through Friday, and the rest of
the front moving off the Southeast Coast by Saturday morning.

Rain changing over to snow develops along the boundary from
southern New England to the Central/Southern Appalachians on
Thursday. Along the rain/snow line, areas of light rain/freezing
rain will develop over parts of eastern North Carolina on Thursday
evening. Furthermore, rain will also develop along the boundary
from parts of the Central Gulf Coast to the Southeast on Thursday.
Incidentally, lake effect snow will develop downwind from the
Great Lakes during Thursday. Additionally, scattered rain/freezing
rain will develop over southern Texas late on Thursday night.

Light snow will linger over parts of the southern Mid-Atlantic on
Friday, while significant rain/freezing rain over the
Northern/Southern Carolina Coast. The snow and rain/freezing rain
will end by Saturday morning. However, as the wave of low pressure
slowly moves off the Southeast Coast, rain will develop over the
Southeast and parts of the Gulf Coast from Friday into Saturday
morning. The combination of snow and ice may cause hazardous road
conditions.

Meanwhile, Wind Chill Warnings and Wind Chill Advisories are up
over the Upper Midwest through noon local time. In addition,
upper-level energy moving across the Northwest will move southward
to the Southwest by Saturday. On Thursday, the energy will produce
rain and higher elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest and snow
into the Northern Rockies. Overnight Thursday, snow will move into
parts of the Central Rockies and Great Basin, while snow moves
into the Central/Southern Rockies from Friday into Saturday.
Concurrently, a front moving southward out of Western Canada will
move into the Upper Midwest, Friday, moving into the Upper Great
Lakes by Saturday. Snow will develop over parts of the Northern
Plains on Friday morning. Overnight Friday, Light to moderate snow
will develop over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper
Great Lakes. The snow will result in reduced visibility and
hazardous driving conditions.

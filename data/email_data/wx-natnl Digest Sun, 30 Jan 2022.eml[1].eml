Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1014 AM CST Sat Jan 29 2022

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

The overall forecast remains on track with limited changes.
Widespread elevated fire weather conditions will be possible across
portions of the central Plains into NE. Localized fire weather
conditions may also develop across parts of southern OK and northern
TX, as well as across parts of the southeast and southern FL.
However, wind fields should remain weak with only local gusts of
greater than 15 mph expected. Please see the previous discussion for
more details.

..Lyons.. 01/29/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0117 AM CST Sat Jan 29 2022/

...Synopsis...
Predominantly northwesterly mid-level flow will persist across the
central U.S as an upper trough ejects into the Atlantic today. A 500
mb impulse embedded in the broader northwesterly mid-level flow will
overspread the central Plains during the afternoon hours. As a
result, a large enough span of overlapping 15 mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds and 15-20 percent RH will develop by
afternoon peak heating, warranting the maintenance of Elevated
highlights despite cooler surface temperatures. Farther south across
western Texas into central Oklahoma, 15-20 percent RH is expected
due to broad lee troughing supporting the eastward push of dry air
from the southern High Plains. Nonetheless, surface winds are
expected to remain below 15 mph on a widespread basis per latest
guidance consensus, precluding the introduction of Elevated
highlights this outlook. Should any increase in surface winds become
evident in later guidance, Elevated highlights may need to be added
in the 17Z update.

Dry and breezy northwesterly surface flow is expected across the
Florida Peninsula, behind the surface cold front. However, fuels
across the area remain poorly receptive to fire spread, hence the
withholding of fire weather highlights.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
206 PM EST Sat Jan 29 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Feb 01 2022 - 12Z Sat Feb 05 2022

...Next week to bring heavy precipitation to the central and
eastern U.S., including winter weather from the Central Plains to
Great Lakes and interior Northeast around midweek...


...Overview...

During the medium range period Tuesday to Saturday, an upper level
trough initially digging across the West will push eastward and
expand from additional digging shortwave energy through the week
in between eastern Pacific and western Atlantic ridging. Ahead of
the trough axis, a potent cold front and widespread precipitation
will track across the central and eastern U.S., with heavy rain in
the warm sector and increasing potential for wintry weather on the
backside of the system.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent guidance remains in fairly good agreement with the overall
large scale pattern, but with some detail differences remaining,
particularly later in the period. The 00Z/06Z model cycle
continues to show a compact southern stream mid-upper low moving
into the Gulf by early Tuesday and shearing out quickly after
that. Northern stream shortwaves over the north-central U.S. and
the western Atlantic also appear agreeable at the beginning of the
period. Thus a multi-model deterministic blend of the 00Z
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and 06Z GFS was utilized for the early part of the
WPC forecast.

The trough deepening in the West on Tuesday-Wednesday shows a good
consensus for axis and amplitude even as multiple shortwaves
combine to create it. There are some slight timing differences
with the eastern side of the trough as it shifts eastward by
around Thursday, which causes some slight timing differences with
the associated potent cold front an placement of waves of low
pressure along it. Generally the 00Z ECMWF and its ensemble mean
were a bit east compared to the 00Z/06Z GFS suite. Most guidance
continues to show combined northern/southern stream troughing
through early Thursday, with the exception of the UKMET with more
separation. Meanwhile on the western side of the trough,
additional shortwave energy will likely dive through around
Thursday and then could create some northern/southern stream
separation in the overall troughing by around Friday, by holding
back southern stream energy in the Southwest. The 00Z GFS was
strongest with this feature among the deterministic guidance and
most ensemble members during the 00/06Z cycle and comparing to the
new 12Z cycle as well. Meanwhile the 00Z CMC keeps the streams a
little more joined and ends up faster especially by Saturday,
while the 00Z ECMWF seemed to be the best middle ground position.
The latter part of the forecast was based on a blend favoring the
00Z ECMWF for this reason, with lesser inclusion of the 06Z GFS
(which was not quite as held back as the 00Z), as well as some
ensemble mean incorporation, especially the 00Z GEFS mean as it
displayed hints of the stream separation that is becoming the
consensus late in the period.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The deepening trough in the West will initially help cause light
to moderate precipitation in the Intermountain West on Tuesday
into Wednesday, particularly mountain snow in the Rockies. But as
the trough and the cold front pushing ahead of it shift eastward,
ample Gulf moisture will be drawn northward and cause widespread
precipitation across much of the central and eastern U.S.
beginning Tuesday and lasting through the workweek as it slowly
tracks eastward. The best chance for heavy rainfall extends from
the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley into parts of the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the Appalachians and the East. Flash
flooding is possible in this pattern, but may be limited by lack
of instability, and the location of heavy rainfall causing any
flooding/flash flooding is also uncertain. Meanwhile in the cooler
air on the backside of the system, wintry weather is likely, with
potential for notable snow from central/south-central parts of the
Plains and Mississippi Valley northeastward through the Great
Lakes and the interior Northeast. Sleet and freezing rain are also
possible in the transition zone between rain and snow, but at this
point the details of the wintry precipitation remain in flux
depending on lower-confidence details of ejecting shortwave energy
and frontal waves.

Above average temperatures by around 10-15F for highs will spread
eastward Tuesday-Thursday across the eastern third of the country
with daytime highs generally 15-20 degrees above normal along the
East Coast on Thursday. At the same time, arctic high pressure
dives into the central U.S. behind the cold front midweek,
bringing chilly and much below normal temperatures all the way
from the northern Rockies/High Plains southward into Texas.
Widespread daytime highs (and slightly less extreme overnight
lows) as much as 10-25 degrees below average are likely. These
temperatures may moderate slightly as they shift east into the
Ohio Valley/Gulf Coast states next Friday and the East on
Saturday, though Texas remains below average through the end of
the week. The West Coast states should be near normal through much
of next week owing to amplified ridging across the East Pacific.

206 PM EST Sat Jan 29 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Feb 01 2022 - 12Z Sat Feb 05 2022

...Next week to bring heavy precipitation to the central and
eastern U.S., including winter weather from the Central Plains to
Great Lakes and interior Northeast around midweek...


...Overview...

During the medium range period Tuesday to Saturday, an upper level
trough initially digging across the West will push eastward and
expand from additional digging shortwave energy through the week
in between eastern Pacific and western Atlantic ridging. Ahead of
the trough axis, a potent cold front and widespread precipitation
will track across the central and eastern U.S., with heavy rain in
the warm sector and increasing potential for wintry weather on the
backside of the system.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent guidance remains in fairly good agreement with the overall
large scale pattern, but with some detail differences remaining,
particularly later in the period. The 00Z/06Z model cycle
continues to show a compact southern stream mid-upper low moving
into the Gulf by early Tuesday and shearing out quickly after
that. Northern stream shortwaves over the north-central U.S. and
the western Atlantic also appear agreeable at the beginning of the
period. Thus a multi-model deterministic blend of the 00Z
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and 06Z GFS was utilized for the early part of the
WPC forecast.

The trough deepening in the West on Tuesday-Wednesday shows a good
consensus for axis and amplitude even as multiple shortwaves
combine to create it. There are some slight timing differences
with the eastern side of the trough as it shifts eastward by
around Thursday, which causes some slight timing differences with
the associated potent cold front an placement of waves of low
pressure along it. Generally the 00Z ECMWF and its ensemble mean
were a bit east compared to the 00Z/06Z GFS suite. Most guidance
continues to show combined northern/southern stream troughing
through early Thursday, with the exception of the UKMET with more
separation. Meanwhile on the western side of the trough,
additional shortwave energy will likely dive through around
Thursday and then could create some northern/southern stream
separation in the overall troughing by around Friday, by holding
back southern stream energy in the Southwest. The 00Z GFS was
strongest with this feature among the deterministic guidance and
most ensemble members during the 00/06Z cycle and comparing to the
new 12Z cycle as well. Meanwhile the 00Z CMC keeps the streams a
little more joined and ends up faster especially by Saturday,
while the 00Z ECMWF seemed to be the best middle ground position.
The latter part of the forecast was based on a blend favoring the
00Z ECMWF for this reason, with lesser inclusion of the 06Z GFS
(which was not quite as held back as the 00Z), as well as some
ensemble mean incorporation, especially the 00Z GEFS mean as it
displayed hints of the stream separation that is becoming the
consensus late in the period.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The deepening trough in the West will initially help cause light
to moderate precipitation in the Intermountain West on Tuesday
into Wednesday, particularly mountain snow in the Rockies. But as
the trough and the cold front pushing ahead of it shift eastward,
ample Gulf moisture will be drawn northward and cause widespread
precipitation across much of the central and eastern U.S.
beginning Tuesday and lasting through the workweek as it slowly
tracks eastward. The best chance for heavy rainfall extends from
the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley into parts of the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the Appalachians and the East. Flash
flooding is possible in this pattern, but may be limited by lack
of instability, and the location of heavy rainfall causing any
flooding/flash flooding is also uncertain. Meanwhile in the cooler
air on the backside of the system, wintry weather is likely, with
potential for notable snow from central/south-central parts of the
Plains and Mississippi Valley northeastward through the Great
Lakes and the interior Northeast. Sleet and freezing rain are also
possible in the transition zone between rain and snow, but at this
point the details of the wintry precipitation remain in flux
depending on lower-confidence details of ejecting shortwave energy
and frontal waves.

Above average temperatures by around 10-15F for highs will spread
eastward Tuesday-Thursday across the eastern third of the country
with daytime highs generally 15-20 degrees above normal along the
East Coast on Thursday. At the same time, arctic high pressure
dives into the central U.S. behind the cold front midweek,
bringing chilly and much below normal temperatures all the way
from the northern Rockies/High Plains southward into Texas.
Widespread daytime highs (and slightly less extreme overnight
lows) as much as 10-25 degrees below average are likely. These
temperatures may moderate slightly as they shift east into the
Ohio Valley/Gulf Coast states next Friday and the East on
Saturday, though Texas remains below average through the end of

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes will be made to the current forecast. Despite dry
conditions across much of the central and southern Plains, overlap
with favorably gusty winds should remain minimal through Sunday.
Only brief and local elevated fire weather conditions appear
possible closer to the higher terrain across western NE and eastern
WY, into NM and west TX. See below for additional information.

..Lyons.. 01/29/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CST Sat Jan 29 2022/

...Synopsis...
Broad northwesterly flow aloft will prevail across the CONUS as
multiple embedded mid-level troughs progress eastward from the
Interior West to the East Coast tomorrow/Sunday. A 500 mb open wave
will begin to close while traversing Texas. Given the progressive
upper pattern, sustained but weak surface lee troughing is expected
across the Plains states, with dry surface air (15-25 percent RH)
expected to meander around the central and southern High Plains
during the afternoon. However, guidance consensus suggests that
widespread 15+ mph sustained wind speeds will be lacking, with
Elevated conditions expected to remain localized, precluding fire
weather highlights this outlook.

...Heavy snow and blizzard conditions to continue throughout
eastern New England tonight...

...Record breaking cold and a deep freeze forecast across
Florida...

...A storm system entering the Pacific Northwest will bring
potentially heavy snow to parts of the northern Cascades/Rockies
on Sunday, while a separate system sparks locally heavy rain
throughout central and southeast Texas on Monday...

A powerful Nor'easter continues to pummel eastern New England this
afternoon with heavy snow, gusty winds, and rough surf. The center
of the storm is currently located several miles east of Cape Cod
and forecast to continue moving in a north-northeast direction.
Blizzard conditions are expected to remain possible into early
Sunday morning from eastern Massachusetts to eastern Maine, with
wind gusts potentially leading to scattered power outages.
Additional snowfall amounts (after 7 pm ET tonight) could add up
to as much as a foot for parts of Maine. Travel conditions will
remain difficult to impossible at times as the storm slowly exits.
Behind the storm, gusty winds and cold temperatures will create
dangerous wind chills Sunday morning throughout much of the
Northeast. For many locations, wind chills are expected to dip
below zero. The weather is forecast to drastically improve by
Sunday afternoon as high pressure builds into the Northeast.

Bitter cold has also surged as far south as Florida today, with
the coldest temperatures expected across the Sunshine State Sunday
morning. In fact, daily record lows are forecast throughout
central and southern Florida early Sunday, with temperatures
dropping into the 20s and 30s. As a result, Hard Freeze and Freeze
Warnings have been issued for much of Florida, southern Georgia,
and southeast Alabama. Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories have
also been issued here.

Elsewhere, after a stretch of quiet weather, the next storm system
to impact the Pacific Northwest is forecast to enter the region on
Sunday. Light to moderate rain is anticipated along coastal and
lower elevation regions, with heavy snow possible in the northern
Cascades. Moisture ahead of a cold front will surge into the
northern Rockies on Sunday night, where high elevation sections of
northern Idaho and northwest Montana could see over 6 inches of
snow as well. Farther south, a separate system associated with a
closed upper-level low is forecast to exit the Southwest and enter
the Southern Plains by Monday morning. This may spark numerous
showers and thunderstorms over parts of central and southeast
Texas on the final day of January, with a few of these storms
potentially producing locally heavy rainfall.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat January 29 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Heavy precipitation likely to impact the central and eastern
U.S. later this week, including a winter storm from the Central
Plains to Great Lakes and interior Northeast...


...Overview...

Mean troughing should dominate much of the CONUS east of the
Rockies as strong upper ridging builds over both the western
Atlantic and East Pacific. A shortwave initially over the
Southwest on Wednesday will drive a potent cold front eastward
through Friday bringing widespread heavy rain to the South and a
potentially significant winter storm from the mid-Mississippi
Valley to the interior Northeast. Additional waves of shortwave
energy dropping down the east side of the ridge in the West,
should help reinforce mean troughing across the central U.S.
through next weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance has come into overall good agreement regarding an
amplified shortwave initially across the Southwest on Wednesday
and into the Southern Plains/Mid-South Thursday-Friday. There
remain some minor differences in the shortwave timing (ECMWF has
been consistently slightly faster than the GFS), which ultimately
affects frontal timing, especially into the East. Albeit
differences in timing and placement, guidance shows this energy
may ultimately combine with a northern stream shortwave through
the Great Lakes/Northeast late this week to help induce a
deepening surface low well off the Northeast Coast. Given the
overall agreement, a general model compromise between the latest
runs of the deterministic models seemed a good starting point for
now through day 5 for this system which also maintained good
continuity with the .

Next energy drops into the mean trough out of the West by Friday
and the models continue to struggle both with strength and timing
of the shortwave. Recent model runs have been back and forth
between a weaker/faster shortwave and a stronger/slower possible
closed low lingering over the Southwest for a day or two. At least
through the latest 12z/18z (yesterday) guidance, the ECMWF and CMC
are weaker and faster while the 18z GFS is notably more
amplified/slower. The bulk of the ensemble guidance would support
something more towards the quicker ECMWF/CMC so that's the way the
WPC forecast leaned tonight.

Yet another shortwave rounding the top of the ridge drops into the
Northern Rockies by Saturday. Much of the guidance shows the
shortwave progress rather harmlessly south and eastward into the
northern/central Plains on Sunday, but the last few runs of the
GFS have been quite aggressive with deepening this energy and a
closed low forming over the Southwest. Ensemble plots suggest the
GFS is likely much too deep with this, and the actual solution may
be somewhere in the middle of a significantly weaker/faster ECMWF
and the GFS (similar to the 12z CMC). The best course of action
for the WPC forecast for next weekend was to stay close to the
ensemble means, with lesser influence from the CMC and ECMWF just
for some added system definition across the board.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The deepening trough in the West will initially bring light to
moderate precipitation across the central/southern Rockies and the
Four Corners region on Wednesday. Ahead of this, ample Gulf
moisture will be drawn northward ahead of the trough and
associated surface cold front. This should result in widespread
moderate to heavy precipitation from the southern Plains into the
Northeast Wednesday and Thursday. The best chance for heavy
rainfall extends from the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley into parts of the lower Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the
Appalachians and the East. The overall pattern would certainly
support at least local spots excessive rainfall/flash flooding,
but the exact locations remain quite uncertain and dependent on
smaller scale detail differences, and impeded by an overall lack
of instability.

Possibly the bigger threat however is the increasing potential for
a significant winter storm on the backside of this system from the
central Plains into the Midwest/Lower Great Lakes and eventually
the interior Northeast. Heavy accumulating snow is likely, while
possible impactful sleet and freezing rain just to the south
within the transition zone between the rain to the south and snow
to the north. Exact amounts of any wintry precipitation remain in
flux at this point and highly dependent on the lower-confidence
details of ejecting shortwave energy, frontal waves, and timing of
colder temperatures.

Above average temperatures (generally +10-15F) will spread across
the East Wednesday-Thursday. Meanwhile, as arctic high pressure
dives into the central U.S. behind the cold front midweek,
downright chilly and much below normal temperatures will spread
from the northern Rockies/High Plains all the way as far south as
Texas. Widespread daytime highs (and slightly less extreme
overnight lows) as much as 10-25 degrees below average are likely
with some locally higher spots especially Thursday across parts of
Oklahoma and north/central Texas. These temperatures may moderate
slightly as they shift east into the Ohio Valley/Gulf Coast states
next Friday and the East on Saturday, though Texas remains below
average through the end of the week. The West Coast states should
be near normal through much of next week owing to amplified
ridging across the East Pacific.

0112 AM CST Sun Jan 30 2022

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper air pattern will exist across the CONUS today,
with embedded mid-level troughs traversing the East Coast,
Intermountain West, and Texas. Corresponding weak surface lee
troughing is expected across the High Plains, with a surface low
poised to move across the southern Appalachians. Across the central
and southern High Plains, 15-25 percent surface RH will develop by
afternoon peak heating. While the surface wind field in Nebraska
(closer to the upper support) will likely be a bit stronger than the
southern High Plains, surface winds across much of the Plains states
are expected to be too weak on a widespread basis to support
significant wildfire-spread potential. Nonetheless, at least
localized wildfire growth may occur in terrain-favoring areas with
higher wind speeds, given the low RH and dry fuels in place.

Across portions of southern Georgia into central and southern South
Carolina, the surface low will encourage 10-15 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds amid 25-35 percent RH. The lower-end
meteorological surface conditions to support fire spread, and the
lack of more receptive fuels, precludes Elevated highlights this
outlook.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWESTERN
NEBRASKA...

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude but progressive mid-level shortwave trough will
quickly cross the northern Rockies and overspread the northern
Plains tomorrow/Monday, with a belt of 60-80 kt 500 mb winds
overspreading a dry, mixed boundary layer. Surface lee troughing
will become established across the Plains states, with a surface low
also developing across the southern High Plains, encouraging the
development of dry and breezy flow.

...Western into central Nebraska...
The combination of downward momentum transport of the stronger flow
aloft, and gradient winds induced by surface lee troughing, will
support widespread 20+ mph sustained west-northwesterly winds across
much of northwestern into central Nebraska during the afternoon. By
afternoon peak heating, at least a couple hours of 15-20 percent RH
overlapping the stronger winds appears likely. Critical highlights
have been introduced, since fuels are at least modestly dry across
portions of the central High Plains that have experienced snow melt
and are experiencing a moderate to severe drought.

...Southern High Plains...
The development of a surface low across the southern High Plains
will encourage 15 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds across
extreme southwest Kansas into extreme northeast New Mexico and the
northern Texas into Oklahoma Panhandles. Dry air will usher in from
the southwest, promoting 15 percent RH amid the modest surface
winds. Given the very dry fuels across the area, Elevated highlights
have been introduced.

Elsewhere, after a stretch of quiet weather, the next storm system
to impact the Pacific Northwest is forecast to enter the region
today. Light to moderate rain is anticipated along coastal and
lower elevation regions, with heavy snow possible in the Cascades.
Moisture ahead of a cold front will surge into the Northern
Rockies on Sunday night, where high elevation sections of northern
Idaho and northwest Montana could see over 6 inches of snow as
well. Farther south, a separate system associated with a closed
upper-level low is forecast to exit the Southwest and enter the

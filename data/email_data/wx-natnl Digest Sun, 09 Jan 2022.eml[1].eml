Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1013 AM CST Sat Jan 08 2022

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

Current surface observations depict a few locations across the
southern High Plains experiencing 15-20 mph sustained westerly winds
and RH dropping below 40 percent amid clear skies, which will
encourage further boundary-layer heating/mixing. Latest guidance
consensus suggests that the current forecast remains on track, with
more widespread 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds and RH
dropping below 20 percent expected by afternoon peak heating/mixing.
Very minor changes were made to the Elevated highlights to reflect
the latest high-resolution guidance consensus.

..Squitieri.. 01/08/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CST Sat Jan 08 2022/

...Synopsis...
A broad midlevel trough and accompanying southwesterly speed maximum
will overspread the southern Rockies and adjacent High Plains, while
a lee surface low evolves southeastward across the TX and OK
Panhandles. A dryline extending south of the surface low will
advance slowly eastward across the southern High Plains, eventually
being overtaken by a cold front during the evening and overnight
hours.

...Southern High Plains...
A few hours of elevated fire-weather conditions are expected across
portions of the southern High Plains during the afternoon hours
today. As the boundary layer diurnally deepens behind the dryline
and south of the surface low, RH values will fall into the 15-20
percent range -- aided by downslope warming and drying. At the same
time, a tightening pressure gradient along the southern periphery of
the surface low will support 15-25 mph west-southwesterly surface
winds with locally higher gusts. The lack of a tighter surface
pressure gradient and stronger boundary-layer winds should limit the
overall fire-weather threat to an extent, though dry fuels (ERCs in
the 70th-80th percentile) will support at least elevated conditions.
By the evening time frame, low-level winds will shift to a northerly
direction behind the cold front, remaining breezy into the overnight
hours.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sat Jan 08 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Jan 11 2022 - 12Z Sat Jan 15 2022

...Overview...

Model guidance indicates that general ridging will prevail over
the western U.S. as broad troughing tends to eject disturbances
eastward across the northern tiers as well as the Deep South under
a split flow pattern.  Meanwhile, a closed upper low lingering
just off the Southwest will likely play a role in bringing Gulf
moisture into the South late next week.  Heavy precipitation will
edge closer toward the Pacific Northwest Tue/Wed but with the
heaviest activities likely over Vancouver Island.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Overall, models show reasonably good agreement in predicting the
pattern evolution across the U.S. for the medium-range period,
with expected large spread toward the end of next week.  The main
issues are with regard to how the lingering upper low off the
Southwest should be handled, as well as the speed and amplitude of
the next Pacific trough/upper low should approach the West Coast
during the latter half of next week.  Farther east, there is
uncertainty with regard to the speed of the northern stream
disturbances as well as how much they phase with the southern
stream energy.  It appears that the latest ensemble means favor
more phasing of the two streams with a couple of low pressure
system tracking through the northern tier states and the Deep
South by next weekend.

A multi-model/ensemble blend was used to compose this morning's
WPC medium-range forecasts.  The 06Z GFS was noted to dive too
much shortwave energy across the Midwest toward the Southeast next
Thu-Fri.  It was also too slow bringing in the upper low across
the Southwest late next week compared with the rest of the
guidance.  The 00Z and 12Z GFS were more agreeable in this regard.
 The 00Z CMC was too aggressive in tracking a frontal wave
near/north of the Great Lakes by Day 5 in contradiction with its
ensemble means.  The ECMWF remains quite reasonable with its
ensemble means through Day 7.  Therefore, little to none of the
06Z GFS and 00Z CMC were included in the blend beyond Day 5, with
the remaining portion from the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z
GEFS, and the 00Z CMC mean.

...Weather Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest should see heavy precipitation edging closer
ahead of a warm front Tue/Wed, with higher totals over typical
upslope areas of the Olympics and Cascades but the heaviest
activities likely over Vancouver Island.  In contrast, dry
conditions will a continued warming trend will likely engulf much
of the central and northern Plains.  A large surface high will
also maintain dry conditions over the Intermountain West.
Meanwhile, a closed upper low lingering just off the Southwest
will likely move inland and play a role in bringing Gulf moisture
into the South late next week.

Cold air will be in place over the Upper Midwest and spreading
into the Northeast on Tuesday, with high temperatures 10-30F below
average for one of the coldest days of the season thus far. Then
the central U.S. will see a pronounced warming trend next week
with expanding coverage of max/min temperatures 10-20F above
normal Tuesday onward. Some locations in the northern two-thirds

200 PM EST Sat Jan 08 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Jan 11 2022 - 12Z Sat Jan 15 2022

...Overview...

Model guidance indicates that general ridging will prevail over
the western U.S. as broad troughing tends to eject disturbances
eastward across the northern tiers as well as the Deep South under
a split flow pattern.  Meanwhile, a closed upper low lingering
just off the Southwest will likely play a role in bringing Gulf
moisture into the South late next week.  Heavy precipitation will
edge closer toward the Pacific Northwest Tue/Wed but with the
heaviest activities likely over Vancouver Island.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Overall, models show reasonably good agreement in predicting the
pattern evolution across the U.S. for the medium-range period,
with expected large spread toward the end of next week.  The main
issues are with regard to how the lingering upper low off the
Southwest should be handled, as well as the speed and amplitude of
the next Pacific trough/upper low should approach the West Coast
during the latter half of next week.  Farther east, there is
uncertainty with regard to the speed of the northern stream
disturbances as well as how much they phase with the southern
stream energy.  It appears that the latest ensemble means favor
more phasing of the two streams with a couple of low pressure
system tracking through the northern tier states and the Deep
South by next weekend.

A multi-model/ensemble blend was used to compose this morning's
WPC medium-range forecasts.  The 06Z GFS was noted to dive too
much shortwave energy across the Midwest toward the Southeast next
Thu-Fri.  It was also too slow bringing in the upper low across
the Southwest late next week compared with the rest of the
guidance.  The 00Z and 12Z GFS were more agreeable in this regard.
 The 00Z CMC was too aggressive in tracking a frontal wave
near/north of the Great Lakes by Day 5 in contradiction with its
ensemble means.  The ECMWF remains quite reasonable with its
ensemble means through Day 7.  Therefore, little to none of the
06Z GFS and 00Z CMC were included in the blend beyond Day 5, with
the remaining portion from the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z
GEFS, and the 00Z CMC mean.

...Weather Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest should see heavy precipitation edging closer
ahead of a warm front Tue/Wed, with higher totals over typical
upslope areas of the Olympics and Cascades but the heaviest
activities likely over Vancouver Island.  In contrast, dry
conditions will a continued warming trend will likely engulf much
of the central and northern Plains.  A large surface high will
also maintain dry conditions over the Intermountain West.
Meanwhile, a closed upper low lingering just off the Southwest
will likely move inland and play a role in bringing Gulf moisture
into the South late next week.

Cold air will be in place over the Upper Midwest and spreading
into the Northeast on Tuesday, with high temperatures 10-30F below
average for one of the coldest days of the season thus far. Then
the central U.S. will see a pronounced warming trend next week
with expanding coverage of max/min temperatures 10-20F above
normal Tuesday onward. Some locations in the northern two-thirds
of the Plains may see even warmer readings mid-late week. Across
the West expect to see daytime highs within 10F on either side of
normal through the period, while above normal lows should become
more prevalent with time. By the end of the week temperatures are
currently forecast to moderate close to normal.

The Pacific Northwest should see heavy precipitation edging closer

over the Intermountain West.  Meanwhile, a closed upper low
lingering just off the Southwest will likely move inland and play
a role in bringing Gulf moisture into the South late next week.
It appears that a swath of wintry precipitation will track across
the Great Lakes toward New England by the weekend in association
with the northern stream system.  Meanwhile, the rain in the South
should then spread toward the eastern U.S. where the split flow
tends to phase next weekend.

the western U.S. as broad troughing tends to eject disturbances
eastward across the northern tiers as well as the Deep South under
a split flow pattern.  Meanwhile, a closed upper low lingering
just off the Southwest will likely play a role in bringing Gulf
moisture into the South late next week.  Heavy precipitation will
edge closer toward the Pacific Northwest Tue/Wed but with the
heaviest activities likely over Vancouver Island.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Overall, models show reasonably good agreement in predicting the
pattern evolution across the U.S. for the medium-range period,
with expected larger spread toward the end of the period.  The
main issues are with regard to how the lingering upper low off the
Southwest should be handled, as well as the speed and amplitude of
the next Pacific trough/upper low should approach the West Coast
during the latter half of next week.  Farther east, there is
uncertainty with regard to the speed of the northern stream
disturbances as well as how much they phase with the southern
stream energy.  It appears that the latest ensemble means favor
more phasing of the two streams with a couple of low pressure
system tracking through the northern tier states and the Deep
South by next weekend.

A multi-model/ensemble blend was used to compose this morning's
WPC medium-range forecasts.  The 06Z GFS was noted to dive too
much shortwave energy across the Midwest toward the Southeast next
Thu-Fri.  It was also too slow bringing in the upper low across
the Southwest late next week compared with the rest of the
guidance.  The 00Z and 12Z GFS were more agreeable in this regard.
 The 00Z CMC was too aggressive in tracking a frontal wave
near/north of the Great Lakes by Day 5 in contradiction with its
ensemble mean.  The ECMWF remains quite reasonable with its
ensemble means through Day 7.  Therefore, little to none of the
06Z GFS and 00Z CMC were included in the blend beyond Day 5, with
the remaining portion from the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z
GEFS, and the 00Z CMC mean.

...Weather Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest should see heavy precipitation edging closer
ahead of a warm front Tue/Wed.  Higher totals are expected over
typical upslope areas of the Olympics and Cascades but the
heaviest activities will likely be north of the border over
Vancouver Island.  In contrast, dry conditions with a continued
warming trend will likely engulf much of the central and northern
Plains.  A large surface high will also maintain dry conditions
over the Intermountain West.  Meanwhile, a closed upper low
lingering just off the Southwest will likely move inland and play
a role in bringing Gulf moisture into the South late next week.
It appears that a swath of wintry precipitation will track across
the Great Lakes toward New England by the weekend in association
with the northern stream system.  Meanwhile, the rain in the South
should then spread toward the eastern U.S. where the split flow
tends to phase next weekend.

Cold air will be in place over the Upper Midwest and into the
Northeast on Tuesday, with high temperatures 10-30F below average
for one of the coldest days of the season thus far. Then the
central U.S. will see a pronounced warming trend next week with
expanding coverage of max/min temperatures 10-20F above normal
Tuesday onward. Some locations in the northern two-thirds of the
Plains may see even warmer readings mid-late week. Across the West
expect to see daytime highs within 10F on either side of normal
through the period, while above normal lows should become more
prevalent with time.  By the end of the week temperatures are
currently forecast to moderate close to normal.

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains valid. Locally dry and breezy
conditions may occur tomorrow afternoon along the Texas
Panhandle/Oklahoma border. However, RH is expected to remain well
above Critical thresholds, and given the expected cool temperatures,
widespread significant wildfire-spread potential is expected to
remain too limited for Elevated highlights.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CST Sat Jan 08 2022/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level ridge will amplify over the Great Basin, with cold
surface ridging encompassing a large portion of the western and
central United States. The cool boundary-layer conditions and
generally light surface winds will limit the overall fire-weather
threat across the CONUS.

Valid 00Z Sun Jan 09 2022 - 00Z Tue Jan 11 2022

...Rain/freezing rain for parts of the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes and
the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic...

...Heavy lake effect snow for areas downwind from Lake Ontario
from Monday evening to Tuesday...

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southern Ohio
Valley...

A front extending from the Upper Great Lakes to the Central Plain
will move off the East Coast and the Gulf Coast by Monday.  A
plume of moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will stream
northward to the Great Lakes. The system will produce light snow
over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes that
will move into the Northeast by Sunday afternoon before ending on
Monday morning. Along the rain/snow line, areas of rain/freezing
rain will develop over parts of Ohio Valley/Great Lakes overnight
Saturday. On Sunday morning, the rain/freezing rain will move to
the northern Mid-Atlantic/Northeast ending on Sunday evening.
Residents in the regions mentioned above are urged to double-check
road conditions and the current forecast before traveling, as
ice-covered roads require longer stopping distances.

Meanwhile, south of the rain/snow line, rain and thunderstorms
will develop along and ahead of the cold front over parts of the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley, moving into parts of the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and the Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic on
Sunday. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee
Valley, and Southern Ohio Valley through Sunday morning. The
associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain. The Marginal excessive rainfall threat moves into the
Tennessee Valley, Southeast, and parts of the Southern
Appalachians on Monday into Tuesday. In the wake of the cold
front, cold air will move over the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and
the Northeast. The cold air moving over Lakes Superior and Huron
then over Lake Ontario will produce heavy lake effect snow for
areas downwind from Lake Ontario from Monday evening to Tuesday.

Lastly, as a warm front approaches the Northwest, light rain will
develop over the Pacific Northwest Coast on Monday afternoon into
Tuesday morning.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat January 08 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

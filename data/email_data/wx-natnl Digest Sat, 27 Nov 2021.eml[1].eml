...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Multiple shortwaves will track across the CONUS during the
extended period; which will reinforce the mean trough over the
eastern U.S. Over the West, an amplified ridge will begin to
weaken as a couple of shortwaves move through and into the central
U.S., which may also help to flatten the overall upper pattern
some by mid to later next week.

Generally speaking, the global guidance and the ensemble means
have a fair handle on the evolution of this pattern albeit with
uncertainty in the specific details. The impulses moving across
the northern U.S. and Great Lakes regions pose timing and
magnitude differences that essentially would affect a surface low
deepening off the Northeast coast. The guidance is favoring an
eastern shift as the surface low skirts near the New England
coast. Once again the UKMET is positioned notably south of the
rest of the clustered guidance and was also as much as 10 mb
deeper with the low tracking across the Canadian Prairies/Northern
tier U.S. Therefore was considered an outlier for this issuance.
As noted in the previous forecast, the CMC which showed a strong
shortwave moving into the West diving south to meet up with energy
over northern Mexico to create a closed low differently than
consensus. The CMC was usable in the initial periods.

The WPC blend utilized a combination of the 12/18Z GFS, ECWMF and
CMC as a starting point then gradually ceasing use of the CMC
while increasing the inclusion of the GEFS and ECWMF means. This
approach helped maintain a degree of continuity as well as
minimizing individual model differences.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Remnant moisture from the weakening atmospheric river will keep
lingering moderate to locally heavy rainfall possible for the
Olympic Peninsula, far northern Cascades and the surrounding
areas. Relatively light precipitation is likely to continue for
this region through Monday before another increase in moisture
brings another round of moderate to locally heavy precipitation to
western Washington around Tuesday-Wednesday, which may be mostly
rain but with some uncertainty in snow levels at this point.
Portions of the Northern Rockies is also expected to have light
precipitation with this flow.

Periodic lake effect snow/enhanced snowfall is expected for the
Great Lakes regions through the extended period as northwesterly
flow passes across the open lakes. A favored locations downwind of
Lake Erie will likely observe enhancements through Monday while
areas downwind of Lake Ontario are anticipated later in the week.
In addition to the lake effect snows, parts of the Midwest and the
Northeast will have light precipitation as energy passes aloft.
Models have been trending down for the QPF amounts over New
England that past few runs. Although there are differences in the
location of the Atlantic Low, the possibility of flow wrapping
into the low onshore could yield light rain or snowfall. Other
than the two highlighted regions, a majority of the country will
be generally dry other than some early week showers for Florida
and increasing moisture for Texas midweek onward.

Temperatures will generally be slightly below normal across the
Eastern U.S. as the mean trough becomes reinforced, with some
moderation back towards normal Wednesday and Thursday. Much of the
West and central states will maintain warmth through the extended
forecast thanks to the ridging over the region. A few locations
may reach or exceed daily maximum and minimum temperature records,
where some places could register 20 to 30 degrees above seasonal
average. As the flow flattens during the late period, above normal
temperatures should also begin expanding into the Midwest and
South.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1051 AM CST Fri Nov 26 2021

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST WYOMING AND
THE NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...

Current observational trends suggest relative humidity may fall
lower than previously expected (into the low teens) this afternoon
across southeast Wyoming. This lower than expected relative humidity
will support critical fire weather conditions for a few hours this
afternoon. As such have introduced a critical area for this region
and expanded the elevated area farther to the northwest.

Elsewhere, another day of elevated to critical fire conditions are
on tap for portions of southern California today. However, winds
should decrease through the day as compared to yesterday.

Otherwise, no changes have been made to the ongoing forecast.

..Marsh.. 11/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1235 AM CST Fri Nov 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
A cutoff mid-level low over portions of the Baja Peninsula will lift
northeast throughout the day and begin merging with a broad
upper-level trough positioned over the central CONUS. At the
surface, high pressure over the Great Basin region will continue a
weakening trend.

...Southern California...
Elevated to critical fire-weather conditions will be ongoing this
morning and should persist into the afternoon. Despite weakening
high pressure over the Great Basin, the regional pressure gradient
should still favor offshore surface winds sustained near 20 mph,
with locally higher gusts in terrain-favored locations. Wind speeds
during the afternoon may continue support elevated to critical
conditions with at least modestly enhanced northeasterly flow aloft
(along the western periphery of the cutoff low) remaining over the
region. Very dry conditions will prevail, with RH values starting in
the teens and dropping into the single digits by early afternoon.
Likewise, fuels remain largely receptive to large-fire spread. The
fire-weather threat should begin to decrease somewhat by late
evening as winds relax, however, very dry conditions will remain
present and likely support at least elevated conditions through the
end of the period.

...Southeastern Wyoming and the Southwestern Nebraska Panhandle...
Elevated fire-weather conditions will be possible during the
afternoon, as modestly enhanced mid-level flow is mixed toward the
surface coupled with downsloping/compressional heating effects.
These processes should yield sustained winds near 20-25 mph and RH
values into the upper teens amid receptive fuels.

...Portions of the Southeast...
Dry post-frontal northwesterly flow will overspread the region
today, resulting in the potential for locally elevated fire-weather
conditions. Despite RH values falling to near 30% during the
afternoon, sustained winds should remain relatively light, perhaps
near 10-15 mph, and fuels appear marginally receptive to large-fire
spread. Thus, no highlights have been introduced for the region at
this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0107 PM CST Fri Nov 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

Confidence is increasing in elevated fire weather conditions
developing across portions of central and northeast New Mexico on
Saturday in the wake of an early day, dry frontal passage. Northeast
winds of 10-20 mph with higher gusts are expected during the late
morning into afternoon. These winds will combine with relative
humidity in the upper teens to low 20s and increasingly dry fuels to
support elevated fire concerns for at least a few hours.

Elsewhere, elevated fire weather conditions will persist across
southern California on Saturday and no changes were made to the
previous forecast.

..Marsh.. 11/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1239 AM CST Fri Nov 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
A cutoff mid-level low over portions of the Southwest will continue
lifting northeast and merge with a large-scale upper-level trough
over the central/eastern CONUS. Meanwhile, an upper-level ridge will
build into the West. At the surface, weak high pressure should
remain present over the Great Basin region.

...Portions of Southern California...
Elevated fire-weather conditions will likely be ongoing at the start
of the period and persist for at least a few hours during the
morning. Thereafter, winds are forecast to relax substantially as
the offshore pressure gradient weakens, although dry conditions
(e.g., RH values into the single digits) will persist for much of
the day. Given the early day threat, an elevated area has been added
for the region.

...Portions of the Southern High Plains...
Dry/breezy post-frontal winds may yield potential for locally
elevated conditions across parts of the region during the afternoon.
Timing, and thus position, of the frontal boundary remains a bit
uncertain, but presently the most likely area for such conditions to
develop appears to be in northeast New Mexico and the OK/TX
Panhandles. Should the forecast position of the frontal boundary
improve, an elevated delineation may be needed for the region in
forthcoming outlooks.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
208 PM EST Fri Nov 26 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Nov 29 2021 - 12Z Fri Dec 03 2021

...Overview...

The initial upper-level pattern as the medium range period begins
Monday will consist of troughing across the East and ridging over
the West, and shortwaves moving through the broader flow may serve
to deamplify the pattern somewhat as next week progresses. A
surface low off the Northeast coast could spread some
precipitation to the region Monday, while rounds of light
precipitation are possible for the Great Lakes region and interior
Northeast through the week. Meanwhile, persistent moist inflow
into the Pacific Northwest should cause additional precipitation
there, with the heaviest likely Tuesday into Wednesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model agreement for the 00Z/06Z cycle was fairly good regarding
the large scale pattern early in the period on Monday, though
uncertainties in energy coming into the trough in the East will
affect positioning and depth of a surface low off the Northeast
coast. The general trend for this low has been somewhat weaker
compared to yesterday, but ensemble guidance continues to show
spread with the central pressure as well as its position. The 00Z
UKMET continued to be a slow outlier compared to consensus and was
not favored. Other models are more difficult to rule out, but the
00Z and especially the new 12Z CMC show a track somewhat slower
and closer to land than what we wanted to favor at this time. The
WPC forecast attempted to follow a middle ground solution of the
GFS and ECMWF deterministic and ensemble mean positions for the
low. But uncertainty is still fairly high with this feature for a
day 3 forecast especially as relatively small wobbles in the low
track closer or farther from land could cause impactful
precipitation differences, and new 12Z guidance is shifting a bit
westward. After that, there is fairly good agreement for potent
shortwave energy to move across the Great Lakes Tuesday-Wednesday,
but with more variability in its exit northeastward as well as
potentially additional energy approaching that region by Thursday.

Farther upstream, initially model guidance is clustered fairly
well in the West, but differences increase by around Wednesday
with more ridging shown in the Northwest in GFS and GEFS members
compared to the deterministic ECMWF and EC ensemble members and
the mean. This affects amounts of precipitation reaching western
Washington from British Columbia as well as precipitation type
(the ridgier GFS suite has less precipitation farther south and
staying all rain, with the EC/CMC wetter and lower snow levels).
Even greater differences arise in the large scale pattern by
Thursday-Friday in the western and central U.S. as shortwaves
either dig or pass through the broader flow to varying degrees.
The EC mean and to a less extent the GEFS means end up showing a
mean trough across the central U.S. on Friday, which the 00Z
deterministic ECMWF and CMC were closer to compared to the 00Z and
06Z GFS runs that kept low amplitude troughing over the Northwest
and Northeast instead. Uncertainty is rather high by that point
given the small magnitude of the impactful shortwaves and the
energy arising from high latitudes and over the Pacific.

The WPC forecast was based on based on a blend of the
deterministic 00Z ECMWF and CMC and 00Z and 06Z GFS early in the
period. As the period progressed, weighted the GEFS and EC means
more to minimize individual model differences, as well as
lessening GFS influence as GFS runs were not aligned with the
means by later in the week.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest, namely the Olympic peninsula and the far
northern Cascades, should see relatively light precipitation
continuing through Monday before another increase in moisture
brings another round of moderate to locally heavy precipitation to
western Washington around Tuesday-Wednesday, with some uncertainty
in snow levels at this point. Portions of the Northern Rockies are
also expected to have light precipitation with this flow.

Periodic shortwave energy across the north-central to northeastern
U.S. will cause rounds of light precipitation chances through
those areas. Favored lake enhancement areas will see the best
chance for snowfall becoming moderate, especially downwind of Lake
Ontario, as northwesterly flow passes across the open lakes.
Additionally, the low offshore of the Northeast could cause light
wraparound rain or snowfall through Monday, with amounts depending
on the low track. Other than these two highlighted regions, a
majority of the country will be generally dry other than
increasing moisture for Texas midweek onward and spreading into
the Mid-South by Thursday/Friday.

Temperatures will generally be slightly below normal across the
Eastern U.S. Monday as the mean trough becomes reinforced, with
moderation back towards normal Wednesday and Thursday. Much of the
western and central states will maintain mild temperatures through
the extended forecast thanks to the ridging over the region. A few
locations may reach or exceed daily maximum and minimum
temperature records, where some places could register 20 to 30
degrees above seasonal average. As the flow flattens during the
late period, above normal temperatures should also begin expanding
into the Midwest and South.

210 PM EST Fri Nov 26 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Nov 29 2021 - 12Z Fri Dec 03 2021

...Overview...

The initial upper-level pattern as the medium range period begins
Monday will consist of troughing across the East and ridging over
the West, and shortwaves moving through the broader flow may serve
to deamplify the pattern somewhat as next week progresses. A
surface low off the Northeast coast could spread some
precipitation to the region Monday, while rounds of light
precipitation are possible for the Great Lakes region and interior
Northeast through the week. Meanwhile, persistent moist inflow
into the Pacific Northwest should cause additional precipitation
there, with the heaviest likely Tuesday into Wednesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model agreement for the 00Z/06Z cycle was fairly good regarding
the large scale pattern early in the period on Monday, though
uncertainties in energy coming into the trough in the East will
affect positioning and depth of a surface low off the Northeast
coast. The general trend for this low has been somewhat weaker
compared to yesterday, but ensemble guidance continues to show
spread with the central pressure as well as its position. The 00Z
UKMET continued to be a slow outlier compared to consensus and was
not favored. Other models are more difficult to rule out, but the
00Z and especially the new 12Z CMC show a track somewhat slower
and closer to land than what we wanted to favor at this time. The
WPC forecast attempted to follow a middle ground solution of the
GFS and ECMWF deterministic and ensemble mean positions for the
low. But uncertainty is still fairly high with this feature for a
day 3 forecast especially as relatively small wobbles in the low
track closer or farther from land could cause impactful
precipitation differences, and new 12Z guidance is shifting a bit
westward. After that, there is fairly good agreement for potent
shortwave energy to move across the Great Lakes Tuesday-Wednesday,
but with more variability in its exit northeastward as well as
potentially additional energy approaching that region by Thursday.

Farther upstream, initially model guidance is clustered fairly
well in the West, but differences increase by around Wednesday
with more ridging shown in the Northwest in GFS and GEFS members
compared to the deterministic ECMWF and EC ensemble members and
the mean. This affects amounts of precipitation reaching western
Washington from British Columbia as well as precipitation type
(the ridgier GFS suite has less precipitation farther south and
staying all rain, with the EC/CMC wetter and lower snow levels).
Even greater differences arise in the large scale pattern by
Thursday-Friday in the western and central U.S. as shortwaves
either dig or pass through the broader flow to varying degrees.
The EC mean and to a less extent the GEFS means end up showing a
mean trough across the central U.S. on Friday, which the 00Z
deterministic ECMWF and CMC were closer to compared to the 00Z and
06Z GFS runs that kept low amplitude troughing over the Northwest
and Northeast instead. Uncertainty is rather high by that point
given the small magnitude of the impactful shortwaves and the
energy arising from high latitudes and over the Pacific.

The WPC forecast was based on based on a blend of the
deterministic 00Z ECMWF and CMC and 00Z and 06Z GFS early in the
period. As the period progressed, weighted the GEFS and EC means
more to minimize individual model differences, as well as
lessening GFS influence as GFS runs were not aligned with the
means by later in the week.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest, namely the Olympic peninsula and the far
northern Cascades, should see relatively light precipitation
continuing through Monday before another increase in moisture
brings another round of moderate to locally heavy precipitation to
western Washington around Tuesday-Wednesday, with some uncertainty
in snow levels at this point. Portions of the Northern Rockies are
also expected to have light precipitation with this flow.

Periodic shortwave energy across the north-central to northeastern
U.S. will cause rounds of light precipitation chances through
those areas. Favored lake enhancement areas will see the best
chance for snowfall becoming moderate, especially downwind of Lake
Ontario, as northwesterly flow passes across the open lakes.
Additionally, the low offshore of the Northeast could cause light
wraparound rain or snowfall through Monday, with amounts depending
on the low track. Other than these two highlighted regions, a
majority of the country will be generally dry other than
increasing moisture for Texas midweek onward and spreading into
the Mid-South by Thursday/Friday.

Temperatures will generally be slightly below normal across the
Eastern U.S. Monday as the mean trough becomes reinforced, with
moderation back towards normal Wednesday and Thursday. Much of the
western and central states will maintain mild temperatures through
the extended forecast thanks to the ridging over the region. A few
locations may reach or exceed daily maximum and minimum
temperature records, where some places could register 20 to 30
degrees above seasonal average. As the flow flattens during the
late period, above normal temperatures should also begin expanding
into the Midwest and South.

...Strengthening storm system to produce heavy snow and gusty
winds across portions of the Interior Northeast and northern New
England through Saturday...

...Atmospheric River to generate moderate-to-heavy rainfall in the
Pacific Northwest beginning Saturday afternoon...

...Critical fire weather located across Southern California and
parts of the central High Plains through this evening...

The first true taste of winter this season is set to impact the
Interior Northeast and northern New England tonight as a low
pressure system rapidly intensifies over the Gulf of Maine. More
than 8 inches of snow is likely to fall across the Adirondacks,
Green, and White Mountains, as well as parts of northern Maine.
Localized amounts over 1 foot are possible here. Meanwhile, lower
elevations from Upstate New York to Interior Downeast Maine may
also see a few inches of snow. Gusty winds will also accompany the
winter weather and lead to low visibility and difficult travel
conditions. Light snow is forecast to gradually come to an end
Saturday night. Winter Weather Advisories and Winter Storm
Warnings have been issued. With cold air locked in place across
the Northeast, a separate area of low pressure entering the Great
Lakes on Saturday and eventually the northern Mid-Atlantic on
Sunday could spread a swath of light snow from Michigan to
northern Pennsylvania. Additionally, temperatures are expected to
remain below average across the entire East Coast this weekend.
For the Southeast, Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories are in
effect tonight along the Gulf Coast and inland from southern
Mississippi to Georgia.

On the opposite side of the Nation, yet another Atmospheric River
event has taken aim at the Pacific Northwest. Heavy rain and a
warm subtropical airmass will lead to very high snow levels across
the Olympics and Northern Cascades between late Saturday afternoon
and Sunday. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with locally higher
amounts, are forecast and will have the potential to cause rapid
runoff and flooding concerns. Much of this region has experienced
above average precipitation over the last month, leaving terrain
more susceptible to flooding. Flood Watches and a Slight Risk
(level 2/4) of Excessive Rainfall has been issued for Saturday
across northwest Washington.

Elsewhere, continued strong offshore wind and low relative
humidity has led to another day of critical fire weather
conditions across Southern California. Critical fire weather and
Red Flag Warnings have also been issued across parts of the
Central High Plains. Upper level ridging over the western U.S.
responsible for the aforementioned fire weather conditions will
also lead to above normal temperatures and downsloping wind
throughout the Plains. The only exceptions will be across Texas,
where an upper level low entering from northern Mexico will help
produce showers over much of the Lone Star Sate on Saturday.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 02 - 06 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
strong ridging near the western Aleutians is forecast, leading to anticipat=
ed
troughing downstream across Alaska. Anomalous ridging is likely farther to =
the
south across the western and central CONUS. Mean troughing is predicted alo=
ng
the Eastern Seaboard with below normal 500-hPa heights over the eastern CON=
US.

Troughing forecast over Alaska leads to increased chances of below normal
temperatures across most of the state. Ridging over the western and central
CONUS in the period favors above normal temperatures from the West Coast to
the
Mississippi Valley. Conversely, troughing over the Eastern Seaboard leads t=
o
increased chances of below normal temperatures for Florida Peninsula while
above normal temperatures are favored over the Northeast ahead of the
troughing.

The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of above-normal
precipitation for parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains. Ridgin=
g
and surface high pressure are expected in the period across much of the
western
and central CONUS, favoring below normal precipitation. Above normal
precipitation is favored over the northeastern CONUS ahead of the forecast
troughing. Above normal precipitation is likely for southeastern Alaska
related
to a mean surface low pressure predicted over the Gulf of Alaska. Offshore
flow
to the northwest of this low leads to increased chances of below normal
precipitation across western Alaska.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a

agreement on a predicted amplified 500-hPa flow pattern early in the period=

offset by substantially increased uncertainty later in the period associate=
d
with a potential pattern change.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 04 - 10 2021

In the week-2 period, agreement is fairly good among the models with trough=
s
predicted across Alaska and the eastern CONUS, and ridging forecast from th=
e
western CONUS to the Great Plains. Models are in agreement on a general
de-amplification of the overall pattern by the end of the period. Upstream,
troughing over Alaska is expected to weaken and push northeastward by the e=
nd
of week-2.

Increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast to persist into
week-2 for most of Alaska. Ridging and a general low-amplitude pattern
thereafter lead to increased chances of above-normal temperatures across th=
e
western and central CONUS. Below normal temperatures are favored for the
southeastern CONUS, as a trough predicted over the Eastern Seaboard early i=
n
the period pushes offshore, while above normal temperatures are favored ove=
r
parts of the Northeast ahead of the troughing.

Enhanced Pacific Flow is increasingly likely across much of the Northwest
Coast
as the overall pattern transitions to a more zonal orientation. Additionall=
y,
teleconnections from an upstream ridge predicted near the western Aleutians
present a very strong wet signal across much of the Northwest Coast. Due to
these factors, above normal precipitation is favored across the Northwest
Coast
eastward to parts of the Northern Rockies. Below normal precipitation is
favored in parts of  the Central and Southern Rockies, Great Plains and
Mississippi Valley due primarily to the ridging forecast. Above normal
precipitation is favored over the Northeast ahead of the troughing. Below
normal precipitation is favored for western Alaska behind the departing
trough.
A wet area is likely for parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alas=
ka
Panhandle in association with the troughing over the Gulf of Alaska.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST November 26 2021

SYNOPSIS: Models remain in reasonable agreement today regarding the mean
500-hPa height anomalies from the north-central Pacific Ocean to the
north-central Atlantic Ocean, but there are run-to-run and model-to-model
inconsistencies regarding the timing, strength, and evolution of individual
features moving through North America. Cold weather should be waning across
southwestern Alaska early in week-2. But a few days later, a high pressure
system dropping out of south-central Canada is expected to bring cold weath=
er
to the eastern CONUS. The cold spell will be short-lived, but much below
normal
temperatures will briefly extend anomalously far south. Sub-zero temperatur=
es
are expected across interior New England, and sub-freezing temperatures are
expected along the central Gulf Coast and northern Florida. When the colder
air
starts pushing in from Canada, a mid-level low pressure system will bring
moderate to heavy snow into the upper Great Lakes, enhanced by lake-effect
snows as the cold air traverses the relatively warm Great Lakes. Farther we=
st,
a flattening mid-level ridge will set up an unusually strong flow of moist
Pacific air and stormy weather into central and northern portions of the Fa=
r
West. Heavier precipitation should begin to move into California around the
middle of week-2, then expand northward to the Canadian border by the end o=
f
the period. Unusually strong surface winds may accompany the stormy weather
along the immediate coast from northern California northward.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY NOVEMBER 29 - FRIDAY DECEMBER 03:

FOR SATURDAY DECEMBER 04 - FRIDAY DECEMBER 10: Models are in reasonable
agreement on the mean pattern for the week-2 period as a whole, but there i=
s
run-to-run and model-to-model inconsistency in the timing and placement of
specific transient features. Almost all models approximately agree on a
pattern
featuring a weakening mid-level ridge from the western CONUS into the Plain=
s
while near or slightly below-normal 500-hPa cover the East. Beyond the CONU=
S,
models concur that a positive phase of the NAO will be in place for most or
all
of week-2, which will leave moderate negative 500-hPa height anomalies acro=
ss
Canada, eastern Alaska, and the Davis Strait while strong 500-hPa ridging
persists in the northern Atlantic, south of the subnormal height anomalies
closer to the poles. This is a classic feature of the positive phase of the
NAO, and models are in nearly unanimous depicting this feature. A moderate =
to
strong mean ridge and significant positive 500-hPa height anomalies will al=
so
set up over the northern Pacific Ocean, with a mean position southwest of t=
he
Aleutians.



This pattern should keep surface and mid-level features fairly progressive
across the CONUS and Alaska.  Unusually mild temperatures are expected for =
the
western two-thirds of the CONUS, but periods of mild weather interspersed w=
ith
brief cold air outbreaks are expected farther east, leading to highly varia=
ble
temperatures through week-2. As a high pressure center from Canada drops in=
to
the eastern CONUS, a short-lived period of well-below-normal temperatures w=
ill
cover the region. Sub-zero readings are expected in New England, and freezi=
ng
temperatures will reach the central Gulf Coast, But the surface high pressu=
re
will then slide eastward into the Atlantic, developing southerly winds acro=
ss
the East that will quickly scour out the cold air. The western sections of
Alaska will also be affected by a brief cold spell early week-2 before
dissipating and giving way to a mild end to week-2 there.



A weakening ridge in the West will bring a strong Pacific jet southward int=
o
the Far West which will bring periods of stormy weather to the region durin=
g
the last half of week-2. Like other parts of North America, models are not
consistent regarding the day-to-day evolution, but there is fair model
agreement that unusually wet weather will begin affecting northern Californ=
ia
and adjacent areas around the middle of week-2, extending northward to the
Canadian border by the end of the period. Several rounds of heavy
precipitation
should move through the region through much of the week-2 period, but
storminess will not be relentless for multiple days on end. However, the
elevated risk covers much of week-2 because of timing uncertainties, not a
relentless period of heavy precipitation and strong coastal winds through m=
ost
of week-2.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1256 AM CST Sat Nov 27 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
A cutoff mid-level low is forecast to become absorbed by a
large-scale trough as it moves from near the Texas/New Mexico and
Mexico border this morning into the southern/southeastern United
States through tonight. As this occurs, broad mid-level ridging is
forecast to build across much of the western United States.
Meanwhile, a relatively weak area of surface high pressure is
forecast to remain over the Great Basin.

...Southern California...
Poor (to very poor) overnight RH recoveries coupled with lingering
breeziness will likely promote at least pockets of elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions through this morning and
into this afternoon over the interior mountains/valleys of Southern
California. The most likely area for locally critical fire weather
conditions is from portions of the Ventura Valley into the San
Gabriel Mountains. Fire weather conditions are forecast to generally
improve by mid/late afternoon as the pressure gradient weakens
further and winds speeds relax (though single digit RH values will
remain).

Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions may redevelop
later tonight into Day 2/Sunday as modest strengthening of the
surface pressure gradient promotes breezy surface winds amidst poor
overnight RH recoveries.

...Southern Plains...
Breezy and dry post-frontal northeast surface winds are forecast
from late this morning through late this afternoon as a cold front
sags southward across the Southern Plains. At least a few hours of
elevated fire weather conditions are likely as sustained surface
winds of 15-20 mph overlap minimum RH values near 20% and at least
modestly receptive fuels (ERCs generally exceeding the 80th
percentile). The Elevated area was expanded farther eastward into
the Texas Panhandle and portions of far western Oklahoma to match
the most aggressive guidance (e.g., HRRR, FV3, GFS) as they tend to
perform best in post-frontal regimes. Any fire weather concerns will
diminish rapidly by this evening as wind speeds decrease and RH
values improve.

...Southeast...
A dry and relatively cool continental air mass is forecast to remain
across much of the Southeast United States through today. While
near-critical RH values are likely from midday into the evening,
surface wind speeds should generally remain light enough to preclude
large-scale fire weather concerns. One exception could be across the
higher terrain of the Appalachians where topographic enhancement may
promote pockets of locally elevated fire weather conditions for a
few hours.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 AM EST Sat Nov 27 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Nov 30 2021 - 12Z Sat Dec 04 2021

...Overview...

Persistent moist inflow into the Pacific Northwest should cause
additional precipitation there, with the heaviest likely Tuesday
into Wednesday.

Multiple shortwaves will pivot through the mean trough that will
be in place over the central and eastern portions of the CONUS
during the extended periods; which will help deamplify the pattern
somewhat as next week progresses. Rounds of light precipitation
are possible for the Great Lakes region and interior Northeast
through the week. Persistent moist inflow into the Pacific
Northwest should cause additional precipitation there, with the
heaviest likely on Wednesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 12Z/18Z guidance has a fairly decent handle on the large scale
pattern evolution with the troughiness over the East and ridging
over the West. However, uncertainties remain with energy coming
into the trough in the East that will affect positioning and depth
of a surface low off the Northeast coast. Ensemble guidance
continues to show spread with the central pressure as well as its
position. The 18Z run of the GFS has trended somewhat slower and
less amplified than the 12Z run with the shortwaves traversing
central and eastern Canada/United States. By Thursday evening, it
reverses and the pattern becomes more progressive across the
Northeast U.S. There is fairly good agreement for potent shortwave
energy to move across the Great Lakes through Wednesday; however
with potentially more shortwave energy passes through the flow
over the Great Lakes region by Thursday, the spread in possible
tracks increase as it tracks northeastward. The WPC once again
attempted to take a middle ground solution of the GFS and ECMWF
deterministic and ensemble mean positions for the low.

For the West, at least initially, model guidance is clustered
fairly well with the ridging but this changes beyond Wednesday.
These differences may impact the forecast not only in regards to
how much moisture is drawn onshore but also the amounts of
precipitation reaching western Washington from British Columbia as
well as precipitation type (the ridgier GFS suite has less
precipitation farther south and staying all rain, with the EC/CMC
wetter and lower snow levels). The model spread increases further
by the mid-to-late periods which decreases the predictability and
forecast confidence. The EC mean and the GEFS means end up showing
a mean trough across the central U.S. on Friday, which the 00Z
deterministic ECMWF and CMC were closer to compared to the 00Z and
06Z GFS runs that kept low amplitude troughing over the Northwest
and Northeast instead. Uncertainty is rather high by that point
given the small magnitude of the impactful shortwaves and the
energy arising from high latitudes and over the Pacific.

The WPC forecast was based on a combination of the deterministic
00Z ECMWF, OOZ CMC,00Z and 06Z GFS initially.  As the period
progressed, weighted the GEFS and ECWMF means more to minimize
individual model differences, as well as lessening GFS influence
as GFS runs were not aligned with the means by later in the week.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Portions of the northern Cascades and the Olympic Peninsula will
begin to have precipitation ramping back up becoming moderate to
heavy through Wednesday for the western portions of Washington.
Some of this will likely fall as snow near the highest terrain but
there is uncertainty in snow levels. Portions of the Northern
Rockies are also expected to have light precipitation with this
flow. Periodic shortwave energy across the north-central to
northeastern U.S. will cause rounds of light precipitation chances
through those areas. Favored lake enhancement areas will see the
best chance for snowfall becoming moderate, especially downwind of
Lake Ontario, as northwesterly flow passes across the open lakes.
Additionally, the low offshore of the Northeast could cause light
wraparound rain or snowfall through Monday, with amounts depending
on the low track. Other than these two highlighted regions, a
majority of the country will be generally dry other than
increasing moisture for Texas midweek onward and spreading into
the Mid-South by Thursday/Friday.

Temperatures are expected to mostly be slightly below normal
across the Eastern U.S. Monday as the mean trough becomes
reinforced, with moderation back towards normal Wednesday and
Thursday. Much of the western and central states will maintain
mild temperatures through the extended forecast thanks to the
ridging over the region. A few locations may reach or exceed daily
maximum and minimum temperature records, where some places could
register 20 to 30 degrees above seasonal average. As the flow
flattens during the late period, above normal temperatures should
also begin expanding into the Midwest and South.

flattens during the late period, above normal temperatures should
also begin expanding into the Midwest and South.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1259 AM CST Sat Nov 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level ridge over the western United States is forecast
to gradually recede southward through Day 2/Sunday as a mid-level
shortwave trough approaches the eastern Pacific coast. Meanwhile, a
relatively weak area of surface high pressure if forecast to remain
over the Great Basin.

...Southern California...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are forecast
much of Day 2/Sunday as a persistent dry airmass (single digit
minimum RH values and poor overnight recoveries) overlaps lingering
breeziness (sustained winds of 15-20 mph) and critically-receptive
fuels (ERC values exceeding the 90th percentile). In general, the
lack of appreciable upper-level support will preclude a more robust
fire weather threat.

...Clipper system to produce light to moderate snow across Great
Lakes and interior Northeast through Sunday...

...Atmospheric River to generate moderate-to-heavy rainfall in the
Pacific Northwest through Sunday...

...Elevated fire weather across Southern California and part of
the Southern Plains through Sunday...

Winter Weather Advisories and Winter Storm Warnings remain in
effect across parts of northern New England on the backside of a
departing potent winter storm responsible for producing several
inches of snow and gusty winds across much of the interior
Northeast on Friday. Blowing snow caused by windy conditions are
likely to remain a hazard for the interior Northeast today. An
Alberta clipper system will drop into the Midwest today, bringing
with it the chance for wintry weather across the Great Lakes. This
system will blanket portions of the Great Lakes and interior
Northeast in 1-3 inches of snow with isolated higher amounts,
particularly downwind of lake Eerie where they may get between 4-8
inches by Sunday morning.  A cutoff-low over northern Mexico will
be the trigger for showers and thunderstorms across the Texas and
the Texas/Louisiana Gulf coasts today. Thunderstorms are not
expected to be severe. The cutoff-low is then expected to phase
with the northern stream allowing for the extension of the surface
cold front from the Midwest down through the Mississippi Valley.

An atmospheric river event is forecast to produce several inches
of rain across the Pacific Northwest through Sunday. Most of the
heavy precipitation associated with this system is likely to occur
today though, with tomorrows rainfall being more confined to the
Olympic and northern Cascade mountain ranges. A ridging pattern
across the West and Central U.S. will generate anomalous warmth
across portions of the Northern and Central Plains on Sunday and
Monday. High temperatures are likely to be in the low 60s across
northeastern Montana on Sunday which would constitute a 25-30
degree departure from normal for them for this time of year. The
warm air will expand into the Northern/Central Plains on Monday
where highs may reach between 15-20 degrees above average. Dry and
breezy conditions will contribute to an elevated fire weather risk
across southern California today and Sunday. Locally critical fire
risk may also develop, according to the Storm Prediction Center,
due to an exacerbation of the aforementioned surface conditions.
Winds will pick up on the backside of a surface front passing
through the Southern Plains today. Paired with already dry
conditions, this region may experience an elevated fire weather
threat today.

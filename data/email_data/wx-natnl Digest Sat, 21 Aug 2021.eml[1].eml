.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1253 AM CDT Fri Aug 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified mid-level short-wave trough positioned over the
northern/central Rockies will shift northeast throughout the day,
reaching portions of the northern Great Plains by the end of the
forecast period. Meanwhile, another mid-level short-wave trough will
enter portions of the Pacific Northwest throughout the day. Despite
modestly enhanced mid-level flow that will accompany these features,
enhanced surface flow should remain confined to cool/post-frontal
airmasses, where the combination of relatively high RH values and
marginally receptive fuels should result in low wind/RH fire-weather
concerns.

Potential exists for some isolated dry thunderstorm development in
the lee of the Cascades during the overnight period with the
approaching mid-level trough. However, storm coverage appears too
localized to warrant the inclusion of any highlights at this time.

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 201802
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 20 2021

SYNOPSIS: The dynamical models have come into better agreement compared to the
last few days regarding the mid-level height pattern evolution over North
America during week-2. A trend toward a more amplified pattern is indicated
over the contiguous U.S., with mid-level low pressure expanding over the East
Pacific and West Coast, and mid-level high pressure forecast across the
interior western and central U.S. Lingering excessive heat remains possible
early in the period across portions of California and the Desert Southwest
before mid-level low pressure becomes more dominant. The remainder of the U.S.
looks quiet in terms of hazards, with the only concern being increased chances
for heavy rain along parts of the Gulf of Mexico Coast, related to the
potential for increased tropical moisture flow.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of the Central Valley of California
and Desert Southwest, Sat, Aug 28.

Slight risk of heavy rain across parts of the western and central Gulf of
Mexico Coast, Sat-Fri, Aug 28-Sep 3.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY AUGUST 23 - FRIDAY AUGUST 27:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!poWOOeNPAdpvY7uw8E0aeYeu4NQUe1s2DnRpMnSgu0dqLAmhzvr2wzW6s3mg6QysynOnvoRA$

FOR SATURDAY AUGUST 28 - FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 03: The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensembles all indicate near to slightly above normal 500-hPa heights across
most of the CONUS during week-2 with the mid-level flow forecast to become
more
amplified by the middle of the period. A slight risk of excessive heat is
maintained for parts of the Central Valley of California and Desert Southwest
on Aug 28, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20%
chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th climatological percentile.
Although the best chances for excessive heat have now shifted into the late
week-1 period, uncalibrated guidance from the ECMWF and GEFS ensembles
continue
to indicate maximum temperatures exceeding 100 deg F over the Central Valley
of
California, and approaching 110 deg F across parts of the Sonoran Desert on
Aug
28, justifying the continuation of the slight risk. Above normal temperatures
may persist longer into week-2, but the magnitude of the positive anomalies is
forecast to decrease as troughing builds across the West Coast. By the middle
of week-2, increased ridging is forecast across interior portions of the
western CONUS and extending into the central CONUS. Although above normal
temperatures are likely across parts of the Rockies, Great Plains, and
Midwest,
maximum temperatures are forecast to remain below hazards thresholds. Farther
south across portions of eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley,
increased humidity may push index values into the triple digits, but
widespread
coverage of heat indices exceeding 110 deg F appears unlikely. Additionally,
increased cloud cover and rainfall is likely to result in reduced surface
temperatures, further precluding a related excessive heat hazard over the
region.



The 0z ECMWF ensemble now agrees with the mean solutions of the GEFS and
Canadian ensembles, depicting increased moisture flow from the Gulf of Mexico
resulting in heavy rainfall across portions of the western and central Gulf
Coast. Deterministic solutions from the GEFS ECMWF, and Canadian models also
indicate the potential for a tropical cyclone to develop across the southern
Gulf of Mexico early in week-2, with high uncertainty in its eventual track.
As
a result of this improved model agreement, the slight risk of heavy
precipitation is continued over parts of southeastern Texas and the Lower
Mississippi Valley for the entire period and is extended further inland
compared to yesterday. The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools depict parts of the
highlighted region having at least a 20% chance for 3-day rainfall totals
exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 1 inch, with higher amounts
indicated in the deterministic guidance, especially if an organized tropical
cyclone reaches the coast.



The ridge placement further south across the Four Corners region during week-2
favors a suppressed North American monsoon circulation. Tropical cyclone
activity in the East Pacific has the potential to result in Gulf Surge events
across the Desert Southwest, but with little model consistency regarding the
exact timing and tracks of any potential systems. Both of the reforecast tools
do not show a favorable wet signal for the Four Corners, thus no related
precipitation or flooding hazards are highlighted. However, any thunderstorms
that do develop may lead to localized flash flooding.



Weak mid-level troughing forecast over the Gulf of Alaska at the start of the
period favors ongoing elevated chances of heavy precipitation across portions
of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle. However, precipitation
chances are forecast to diminish as the trough axis shifts further to the
east.
Precipitation amounts are forecast to remain below pre-defined hazards
criteria, precluding a related hazard. Near to below normal temperatures are
predicted over most of the state during week-2 as a result of the increased
northerly mid-level flow, although increased influence from ridging upstream
over the Bering Sea favors above normal temperatures over the Aleutians and
the
southwestern Mainland.

...Dangerous Henri to affect New England into early next week...


...Overview...

Tropical Storm Henri is forecast to move into Southern New England
late Sunday into Monday to start the medium range period. Though
it will weaken over land before pushing into Atlantic Canada on
Tuesday, it will bring a heavy rainfall and flooding threat along
with strong winds and waves to the region. Refer to the latest NHC
products for further information on Henri. Meanwhile the large
scale pattern will be fairly typical for late summer with southern
Canada/northern U.S. flow aloft pushing along rainfall-focusing
waves/fronts across the northern half of the lower 48 while mean
ridging aloft prevails farther south and likely expands westward
with time. Western Atlantic ridging, partially responsible for
Henri's rather unusual northward track, will meander in place
between Nova Scotia and Bermuda as the remnants of Henri skirt
around its northern periphery.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The main complexity in Henri's forecast lies in the short range as
the system interacts with an eastern U.S. shortwave/upper low.
There still remains some west-east uncertainty which will affect
the likely asymmetric rainfall distribution which may interact
with the terrain back to eastern New York and across New England.
Please see the latest National Hurricane Center for the latest
information. A GFS/ECMWF/Canadian blend was close to the earlier
forecast position when the forecast was made.

Guidance has varied with the specifics of features within southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. flow. The primary uncertainties lie with
what becomes of an upper low that ejects from southwestern Canada
Monday onward and then Pacific flow that may reach the Northwest
after midweek, with neither one particularly stable and/or
agreeable in the models over the past couple days. Most solutions
now indicate the southwestern Canada upper low should open up with
time and with moderate troughing to the south, in contrast to some
earlier runs that held onto a more persistent upper low and more
amplified trough. These differences continue to temper confidence
in frontal position over the lower 48, but a blended solution
comprising of a plurality ECMWF and minority GFS/Canadian
weighting offered a reasonable starting point amid the wavering of
solutions. Increased ensemble mean weighting for the last days of
the period where the recent GFS runs were either questionably
strong or weak (and displaced) over the East/southeastern Canada.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Extending into early next week Henri will bring a threat for high
winds/waves along with some bands of heavy rainfall over and near
New England. The system should become extratropical around Tuesday
as it continues slowly northeastward. Rainfall could be locally
heavy and enhanced by the terrain. Surface waves/fronts crossing
the northern U.S. and southern Canada will interact with leading
moisture and instability to produce episodes of showers and
thunderstorms that could be locally heavy. Currently the best
potential for highest five-day totals is over and near the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Midwest in the vicinity of a wavy frontal
boundary. Central and southern parts of the East may see areas of
diurnally-favored convection within a humid and warm to hot
airmass.

Monday-Wednesday should feature a broad area of above normal
temperatures from the central-southern Plains into the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, especially in the wake of Henri. Scattered
plus 10-15F anomalies will be possible mainly over the
Mid-Mississippi Valley into Lower Great Lakes and more for morning
lows versus daytime highs. Even away from the areas with highest
anomalies, some daily record warm lows may be challenged. Highs
should moderate later in the week but warm lows will likely
persist over the eastern half of the country. Expect the highest
heat index values to be over the Mid/Lower Mississippi Valley and
along the Gulf Coast early-mid week where values may rise to over
110F. Westward expansion of upper ridging will promote increasing
coverage of highs 5-10F above normal over southern parts of the
West and across much of California later in the week. The Northern
Plains region will be the main area of cool temperatures with some
highs up to 10-15F below normal, mainly Tuesday-Thursday. Parts of
the Northwest will also be on the cool side early in the week in
the wake of a Pacific front under somewhat persistent upper
troughing.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri August 20 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 26 - 30 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a mean trough over
Mainland Alaska. A mean ridge is predicted over the northeastern Pacific in
most model solutions, with associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies over
parts of the western CONUS. Slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies extend
across most of the CONUS, while the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means predict
greater positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the northeastern CONUS. A weak
trough is predicted over the northwestern or north-central CONUS in most model
solutions, with associated near to slightly below normal heights. The ECMWF
ensemble mean predicts a slightly more amplified northeastern Pacific ridge
and
downstream trough relative to the GEFS ensemble mean. A subtropical ridge is
predicted over most of the southern tier of the CONUS from the Southwest to
the
Lower Mississippi Valley in the GEFS, ECMWF and Canadian ensemble mean 500-hPa
height forecasts, along with a break in the subtropical ridge over the
Southeast.

Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated across most of Mainland
Alaska, except for the south coast, under the predicted mean trough. Above
normal temperatures are likely for the western Aleutians, under predicted
positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Above normal temperatures are favored
across
much of the CONUS, due to predicted 500-hPa ridging and slightly above normal
heights forecast over most areas. Troughing and near normal heights favor
enhanced probabilities of near to below normal temperatures over the Pacific
Northwest, Northern Rockies, and parts of the Northern Plains. Short term bias
corrections indicate below normal temperatures are likely along the Gulf
Coast,
while bias-corrected model temperature forecasts based on multi-decadal
reforecasts predict likely above normal temperatures for the region. Near
normal temperatures are favored in this region, due to uncertainty and
increased cloud cover.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over northern Mainland
Alaska due to increased potential for storm system development under a
predicted trough. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over
southern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, ahead of a forecast ridge. Below
normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over most of the western
CONUS,
due to forecasted above normal 500-hPa heights east of the ridge over the
northeastern Pacific, and consistent with the precipitation consolidation
forecast tool. Troughing over the Midwest and Northeast in model forecasts, as
well as the precipitation consolidation tool, support increased probabilities
of above normal precipitation from the Western and Central Gulf Coast
northeastward to parts of the Tennessee Valley along a predicted active storm
track and for parts of the Northern Plains, supported by the precipitation
consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, offset
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 28 - SEP 03, 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally similar
to the 6-10 day period but de-amplifies overall with increasing uncertainty. A
predicted mean trough is forecast over parts of western Canada and the Pacific
Northwest, with slightly negative 500-hPa height anomalies slightly west of
mean troughing in the 6-10 day period. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
forecast over the Midwest and Great Lakes region in the week-2 manual blend of
500-hPa height forecasts. Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast
over most of the CONUS and Alaska, with slightly near to below normal heights
along the North Slope of Alaska and near average heights along the Gulf Coast
and Southeast Atlantic coast.

Mid-level troughing forecast over Alaska favors below normal temperatures for
northern Mainland Alaska. Forecast above normal 500-hPa heights increase
chances for above normal temperatures over parts of southwestern Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians. Near to above normal temperatures are favored across
much of the western CONUS, across the Central and Northern Plains, and
eastward
into the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic, under slightly positive 500-hPa anomalies
and supported by the temperature consolidation tool. Enhanced probabilities of
below normal temperatures are favored over South Texas, with potential
increased cloudiness and near average heights. Below normal temperatures are
also favored in parts of the Pacific Northwest, associated with a weak
mid-level trough over the region.

Troughing over Mainland Alaska increases the chances of above normal
precipitation over northern Mainland Alaska. Below normal precipitation is
favored for southern Alaska, including the Alaska Panhandle, under increasing
positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal precipitation is likely for
much of the northwestern CONUS, the Central Rockies, parts of the Northern and
Central Plains, and eastern areas of the Southwest monsoon region, consistent
with the precipitation consolidation tool. A mean frontal boundary and
potential tropical moisture lead to enhanced probabilities of above normal
precipitation across parts of the Central and Western Gulf Coast. Near normal
precipitation is indicated over much of the eastern CONUS, due to increasing
uncertainty and spread among model forecasts.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered
on
Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on a changing large-scale circulation pattern,
offset by increasing differences among the temperature and precipitation
forecast tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CDT Fri Aug 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level short-wave trough will translate from portions of the
Pacific Northwest into the northern Great Basin and northern
Rockies. A belt of enhanced mid-level flow (45-55 kt) will translate
along the southern periphery of this feature across the
northern/central Great Basin and intensify throughout the day.

...Portions of the Northern Great Basin...
Elevated fire-weather conditions will be possible as vertical mixing
during the afternoon allows for sustained westerly surface winds of
10-15 mph to develop. The residual low-level airmass over the region
remains quite dry, which should result in RH values falling into the
upper teens, while fuels across the region remain quite dry and
receptive to large-fire spread.

In addition, isolated dry thunderstorms will be possible across the
region. Modest mid-level moisture and steep low-level lapse rates,
combined with mid-level ascent from the passing trough should allow
for convective development by mid afternoon. Given the enhanced flow
aloft, relatively fast storm motions can be expected amid PWAT
values generally below 0.75 inches and receptive fuels.

...Dangerous Henri to affect New England into early next week...


...Overview...

Tropical Storm Henri is forecast to move into Southern New England
late Sunday into Monday to start the medium range period. Though
it will weaken over land before pushing into Atlantic Canada on
Tuesday, it will bring a heavy rainfall and flooding threat along
with strong winds and waves to the region. Refer to the latest NHC
products for further information on Henri. Meanwhile the large
scale pattern will be fairly typical for late summer with southern
Canada/northern U.S. flow aloft pushing along rainfall-focusing
waves/fronts across the northern half of the lower 48 while mean
ridging aloft prevails farther south and likely expands westward
with time. Western Atlantic ridging, partially responsible for
Henri's rather unusual northward track, will meander in place
between Nova Scotia and Bermuda as the remnants of Henri skirt
around its northern periphery.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The main complexity in Henri's forecast lies in the short range as
the system interacts with an eastern U.S. shortwave/upper low.
There still remains some west-east uncertainty which will affect
the likely asymmetric rainfall distribution which may interact
with the terrain back to eastern New York and across New England.
Please see the latest National Hurricane Center for the latest
information. A GFS/ECMWF/Canadian blend was close to the earlier
forecast position when the forecast was made.

Guidance has varied with the specifics of features within southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. flow. The primary uncertainties lie with
what becomes of an upper low that ejects from southwestern Canada
Monday onward and then Pacific flow that may reach the Northwest
after midweek, with neither one particularly stable and/or
agreeable in the models over the past couple days. Most solutions
now indicate the southwestern Canada upper low should open up with
time and with moderate troughing to the south, in contrast to some
earlier runs that held onto a more persistent upper low and more
amplified trough. These differences continue to temper confidence
in frontal position over the lower 48, but a blended solution
comprising of a plurality ECMWF and minority GFS/Canadian
weighting offered a reasonable starting point amid the wavering of
solutions. Increased ensemble mean weighting for the last days of
the period where the recent GFS runs were either questionably
strong or weak (and displaced) over the East/southeastern Canada.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Extending into early next week Henri will bring a threat for high
winds/waves along with some bands of heavy rainfall over and near
New England. The system should become extratropical around Tuesday
as it continues slowly northeastward. Rainfall could be locally
heavy and enhanced by the terrain. Surface waves/fronts crossing
the northern U.S. and southern Canada will interact with leading
moisture and instability to produce episodes of showers and
thunderstorms that could be locally heavy. Currently the best
potential for highest five-day totals is over and near the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Midwest in the vicinity of a wavy frontal
boundary. Central and southern parts of the East may see areas of
diurnally-favored convection within a humid and warm to hot
airmass.

Monday-Wednesday should feature a broad area of above normal
temperatures from the central-southern Plains into the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, especially in the wake of Henri. Scattered
plus 10-15F anomalies will be possible mainly over the
Mid-Mississippi Valley into Lower Great Lakes and more for morning
lows versus daytime highs. Even away from the areas with highest
anomalies, some daily record warm lows may be challenged. Highs
should moderate later in the week but warm lows will likely
persist over the eastern half of the country. Expect the highest
heat index values to be over the Mid/Lower Mississippi Valley and
along the Gulf Coast early-mid week where values may rise to over
110F. Westward expansion of upper ridging will promote increasing
coverage of highs 5-10F above normal over southern parts of the
West and across much of California later in the week. The Northern
Plains region will be the main area of cool temperatures with some
highs up to 10-15F below normal, mainly Tuesday-Thursday. Parts of
the Northwest will also be on the cool side early in the week in
the wake of a Pacific front under somewhat persistent upper
troughing.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic, Tennessee/Lower Mississippi Valleys, and Upper
Midwest through Saturday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Northern/Central Plains and the Upper/Middle Mississippi
Valley through Saturday morning...

...Tropical Storm Henri is forecast to become a hurricane and move
toward Southern New England with a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall starting as early as Saturday night...

Tropical Storm Henri is forecast to become a hurricane on Saturday
morning as the storm heads northeastward towards Southern New
England; forecast to make landfall on Sunday.  Overnight Saturday,
Henri starts producing rain over Southern New England, and the
rain will become heavier as the storm moves onshore.  Therefore,
the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall with
rain. The associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of
flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers through Sunday into Monday morning.

Elsewhere, a front extending from Upper Midwest to the Southern
High Plains and Southern Rockies will move eastward to the Lower
Great Lakes to the Middle Mississippi Valley by Sunday evening.
Moisture streaming northward from the Western Gulf Coast will aid
in producing showers and thunderstorms along and ahead of the
boundary through Saturday night.  The showers and thunderstorms
will produce heavy rain over parts of the Upper Midwest through
Saturday morning.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.

The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of
flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the
most vulnerable through Saturday morning.  Additionally, the SPC
has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Northern/Central Plains and the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley
through Saturday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  The severe thunderstorm and the
excessive rainfall threat diminish on Saturday.

Meanwhile, tropical moisture, an old boundary, and upper-level
energy will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms over the
Tennessee/Lower Mississippi Valleys through Sunday morning.  The
showers and thunderstorms will produce heavy rain over the area.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable through Saturday morning.
The excessive rainfall threat will continue over the region on
Saturday into Sunday morning.

Furthermore, tropical moisture and a weak upper-level low over the
Mid-Atlantic will produce showers and thunderstorms through Sunday
morning. The showers and thunderstorms will produce heavy rain
over parts of the Mid-Atlantic through Saturday morning.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable through Saturday morning.
The excessive rainfall threat decreases slightly on Saturday into
Sunday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0103 AM CDT Sat Aug 21 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level short-wave trough located over portions of the Pacific
Northwest will translate eastward throughout the day, entering
portions of the northern Rockies by the end of the forecast period.
Enhanced mid-level flow will accompany the southern periphery of
this feature and intensify throughout the day.

...Portions of the Northern Great Basin...
The approaching trough and diffluent flow aloft will allow for at
least modest ascent to overspread the region. With somewhat modest
low- and mid-level moisture in place amid a well-mixed boundary
layer, isolated dry thunderstorms should develop by mid afternoon.
Given the enhanced flow aloft, relatively quick storm motions are
anticipated and should offset any wetting rain potential.
Additionally, strong low-level lapse rates will support the
potential for gusty outflow winds with the stronger cells.

In addition, a cold front should push through the region throughout
the day. Dry/breezy post-frontal conditions should occur during the
afternoon, resulting in elevated fire-weather conditions. Fuels
across the region remain at least marginally receptive to large-fire
spread, supporting both the elevated and isolated dry thunderstorm
designations.

A mid-level short-wave trough located over portions of the northern
Rockies will lift northeast into south-central Canada. In its wake,
a broad region of modestly enhanced mid-level flow will overspread
much of the northern Rockies and northern High Plains for the
remainder of the forecast period. At the surface, a cold front will
sweep across the lee of the Rockies in the northern High Plains.

Vertical mixing and downslope/compression in the post-frontal
airmass may allow for brief/isolated elevated conditions to develop,
mainly across east-central Wyoming into southwest South Dakota and
the Nebraska Panhandle. Sustained surface winds of 20-25 mph should
occur, however, RH values appear to remain generally above 20% in
most areas.

...Dangerous Henri to affect New England into early next week...


...Overview...

The 03Z National Hurricane Center advisory for Henri shows the
system strengthening to hurricane status in the coming hours as it
tracks toward New England and arrives on Sunday--bringing heavy
rainfall and flooding threats along with strong winds and waves.
By the time the medium range period starts early Tuesday, Henri is
likely to be much weaker and in post-tropical form as it begins to
track away from New England.  Refer to the latest NHC products for
further information on Henri.  Meanwhile guidance continues to
depict a typical late-summer pattern as southern Canada/northern
U.S. flow aloft pushes along rainfall-focusing waves/fronts across
the northern half of the lower 48 and mean ridging aloft prevails
farther south, likely expanding westward into the Southwest with
time.  Strong western Atlantic ridging that is partially
responsible for Henri's rather unusual northward track will
meander in place between Nova Scotia and Bermuda as the remnants
of Henri continue around its northern periphery.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Latest guidance agrees upon the upper system associated with Henri
opening up by early Tuesday and lifting northeastward thereafter.
Latest GFS runs stray a bit to the faster side of the spread
though, even compared to the GEFS mean.  Varying degrees of
uncertainty continue for features carried along by Northeast
Pacific through southern Canada/northern CONUS flow.  Over the
past day solutions have displayed some improved clustering for the
evolution of the upper system tracking north of Montana/North
Dakota on Tuesday and reaching north of the Great Lakes by
Thursday.  However by day 7 Saturday GFS runs become
fast/amplified with the trough that reaches the Canadian Maritimes
so that model may be quick with its high pressure that builds into
New England.  Farther west the models and individual ensemble
members still suggest a fair amount of uncertainty with shortwave
details from the Pacific into western North America.  Over the
past day or so there has been a moderately faster trend for the
overall trough that crosses the Northwest during the latter half
of the week and brings height falls into the northern Plains.  In
the 12Z cycle the CMC became somewhat amplified with the upper
trough late in the period though its surface pattern compared
reasonably to consensus.  The ECMWF became rather slow and sharp,
and while the new 00Z run adjusted a bit faster it is still on the
slow/sharp side.  The new 00Z CMC looks more like the means.  The
00Z GFS continues recent tendencies to be a little fast with
leading height falls but recent trends allow for that scenario to
be possible.

A composite of 12Z/18Z model runs represented the most common
themes of guidance for significant features during the first half
of the period.  The increasing divergence of operational model
details beyond early Thursday continues to favor a rapid increase
of 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF mean input later in the period, reaching 70
percent total by day 7 Saturday.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Expect Henri's threats for high winds/waves along with some bands
of heavy rainfall over and near New England (with some terrain
enhancement possible) to be mainly in the short range period from
this weekend into Monday.  Henri will likely be weaker and in
post-tropical form as the system progresses east-northeastward
away from New England Tuesday onward.  Surface waves/fronts
crossing the northern U.S. and southern Canada will interact with
leading moisture and instability to produce episodes of showers
and thunderstorms that could be locally heavy.  Over the past day
the guidance has been fairly consistent in highlighting the best
potential for highest five-day totals over and near the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Midwest.  This region will see an early
frontal passage, followed by the front stalling to the south
(Mid-Mississippi Valley) and then lifting back north as a warm
front ahead of another system emerging into the Plains.  Central
and southern parts of the East may see areas of diurnally-favored
convection within a humid and warm to hot airmass.  Upper level
energy from a combination of the tail end of the initial East
Coast trough and what tracks underneath the western Atlantic ridge
may enhance convection over parts of the Southeast and southern
Mid-Atlantic.  Specific details of this energy have low
predictability though.

Through midweek very warm to hot temperatures will prevail from
the central-southern Plains through much of the East.  The axis of
warmest anomalies should be from the central Plains/Midwest into
the Northeast with some readings 10-15F above normal, and more
coverage of such anomalies for morning lows versus daytime highs.
Some daily records for warm lows may be challenged even away from
the areas with highest anomalies.  Expect highs to moderate after
midweek but very warm lows are likely to persist over many areas
through the end of the week.  A cold front should bring cooler
weather to the Northeast by the start of the weekend.  The highest
heat index values during the period should be through midweek over
the Mid/Lower Mississippi Valley and along the Gulf Coast where
max values may locally exceed 110F.  Westward expansion of upper
ridging will promote increasing coverage of highs 5-10F above
normal over southern parts of the West and then across much of
California later in the week.  Some of this heat may reach western
Oregon by next Saturday.  The Northern Plains region will be
consistently cool during the period with some highs up to 10-15F
below normal, mainly during Tuesday-Thursday.

...Tropical Storm Henri to threaten portions of the Northeast and
southern New England with dangerous storm surge, damaging winds,
and heavy rain beginning as early as tonight...

...Scattered flash flooding possible across parts of the Tennessee
Valley and Southeast today...

...Severe thunderstorms to potentially impact the northern/central
Great Plains on Sunday...

The main weather story this weekend is found across the Northeast
and southern New England, as Tropical Storm Henri bears down on
the region. Henri is currently churning over the western Atlantic
Ocean and is forecast to accelerate northward today while also
potentially strengthening into a hurricane. As it swings near the
East Coast, rip currents and rough surf could lead to
life-threatening conditions along beaches and coastal regions from
the Southeast to Cape Cod. By tonight, outer rain bands and gusty
winds will approach areas between coastal New Jersey and southeast
Massachusetts. On Sunday morning, a nearby upper-level low
spinning over the Mid-Atlantic States is forecast to interact with
Henri and lead to a slight left turn toward Long Island. As a
result, dangerous storm surge and damaging winds are anticipated
between far northern New Jersey and southern New England on
Sunday. The threat of downed trees and power lines may also extend
farther inland through Monday across parts of the Hudson Valley,
Connecticut, and central/western Massachusetts. Heavy rain is
another dangerous hazard associated with Henri as it is expected
to slow down after landfall and linger over the region on Monday.
Upwards of 10 inches of rain could fall over portions of Long
Island, southeast New York, northern New Jersey, and southern New
England. This amount of rain may lead to considerable flash,
urban, and small stream flooding. A Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of
excessive rainfall has been issued for the aforementioned
locations.

Slow-moving thunderstorms are also expected to impact sections of
the Tennessee Valley and Southeast today as rich atmospheric
moisture remains prevalent throughout this part of the country. A
few inches of rain could quickly fall in localized spots,
resulting in scattered instances of flash flooding. A Slight Risk
(level 2/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued from southern
Illinois to central Alabama. A few intense downpours can't be
ruled out across the Northern Rockies today as well, thanks to a
potent upper-level trough swinging through the region. This piece
of energy is forecast to eject into the Northern Plains by Sunday
and spark scattered thunderstorms over the Northern and Central
Plains. A few of these storms may turn severe, with damaging wind
gusts, isolated tornadoes, and large hail possible.

Elsewhere, Red Flag Warnings and a critical fire weather risk
remains across parts of the central Great Basin to start the
weekend. Air Quality Alerts are also in effect throughout central
California and central/eastern Oregon due to thick wildfire smoke.
Below average temperatures are forecast for much of the western
and north-central U.S., while muggy heat and humidity remains over
the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley. Scattered Heat
Advisories and have been issued from eastern Oklahoma to southern
Louisiana, where heat indices could approach 110F. Meanwhile,
Excessive Heat Warnings in effect for parts of Louisiana and
coastal Mississippi, including New Orleans, LA.

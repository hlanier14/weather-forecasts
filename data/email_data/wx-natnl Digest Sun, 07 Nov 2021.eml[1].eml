Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Sat Nov 06 2021

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...Northeast New Mexico to far southwest Kansas...
The latest high-resolution ensemble guidance suggests minimum RH
values of 10-15% will occur in conjunction with sustained
southwesterly surface winds near 15 mph for at least a few hours
this afternoon/evening. An Elevated fire weather area was introduced
where the most favorable overlap of wind/rh and receptive fuels
(especially fine fuels) is forecast. While locally elevated fire
weather conditions may extend into western portions of the Texas
Panhandle, fuels are currently less receptive to large-scale fire
spread in this region.

...Central Colorado into Northwest Kansas...
The forecast remains mostly on track across this area, with only
minor adjustments made based on the latest model and fuel guidance.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
today's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 11/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1219 AM CDT Sat Nov 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level wave currently in place over the northeastern
Pacific will undergo slight deepening along the Pacific Northwest
coast today, maintaining southwesterly flow over the northern
Rockies. The resulting lee troughing along the northern to central
High Plains will induce a modest wind response over antecedent dry
areas. Morning ensemble guidance suggests sustained winds around 15
mph (gusting to 20-30 mph) will be common from northeast NM
northward into MT and the western Dakotas. Dry conditions are
already in place across the central High Plains after downslope
warming/drying on Friday, and minimal moisture return into the
region today will support areas of low RH down to 15-25%. A few
hours of elevated conditions are probable across much of the central
High Plains this afternoon, but the fire weather threat will mainly
be confined to eastern CO where local reports indicate fine fuels
are dry enough to support a more substantial fire weather risk.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
229 PM EDT Sat Nov 06 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Nov 09 2021 - 12Z Sat Nov 13 2021

...Pattern Overview...

A trio of positive height anomaly centers over far northern Canada
and just off the Southwest and Southeast U.S. will favor increased
troughing over the middle of the Lower 48 toward the end of next
week. This favors a deepening cyclone over the central states that
will lift north-northeastward through the Great Lakes into
southeastern Canada. Milder air over much of the Lower 48 midweek
will trend cooler with time as the front progresses eastward.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest suite of guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably
similar larger scale pattern evolution, but with continued
uncertainty in timing, track, and strength of the embedded
systems. Right off the bat, the 00Z/06Z GFS remained different
(much slower) with the exiting Southeastern U.S. trough, showing
more defined northern/southern stream separation and a
stronger/more south surface low off the FL/GA coast. Models and
ensembles showed much larger and pertinent spread as upper
troughing digs east of the Rockies. This resulted in rather large
differences between the ensemble systems' trough axes and
resultant temperature trends/averages especially into the Front
Range of the Rockies and western Plains. Favored the more steady
ECMWF ensemble guidance which was generally milder than the GEFS
guidance but with tempered confidence due to uncertainty in the
mid-latitude flow progression from the North Pacific into western
North America. Multi-day trend favored a bit quicker progression
of the upper trough overall.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of the 00Z ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET and
00Z ECMWF ensemble mean guidance to start, though the GFS/GEFS
were reasonable over the western portion of the CONUS. Once the
Atlantic system (slow GFS) exited well away from the coast, the
GFS was brought back into the mix at the expense of the UKMET and
Canadian, which added detail to the ECMWF ensemble mean (and some
GEFS mean influence to adjust timing). Favored a milder pattern
than the 13Z NBM over the Plains (quicker to raise heights) and
wetter overall as the increasingly meridional flow should tap at
least a modest amount of Gulf moisture along and ahead of the
front.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A series of Pacific systems will work inland across the West, with
main upper troughing set to work through the region by midweek.
This will favor terrain-enhanced rainfall from the Pacific
Northwest to northern California and a heavy snow threat from the
Cascades and northern Sierra inland across favored terrain for the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies early in the period, with rising
snow levels toward the end of next week as heights recover.
Subsequent amplified upper troughing carving out over the central
U.S. is slated to be sandwiched between upper ridges over the West

frontogenesis will act to favor an emerging lead organized
rainfall/convective pattern over the east-central U.S. Thursday as

enhance rainfall along the front from the southern Appalachians
northward. Backside cold air flow by next Friday also suggests
potential for some snow over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest as moisture

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
229 PM EDT Sat Nov 06 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Nov 09 2021 - 12Z Sat Nov 13 2021

...Pattern Overview...

A trio of positive height anomaly centers over far northern Canada
and just off the Southwest and Southeast U.S. will favor increased
troughing over the middle of the Lower 48 toward the end of next
week. This favors a deepening cyclone over the central states that
will lift north-northeastward through the Great Lakes into
southeastern Canada. Milder air over much of the Lower 48 midweek
will trend cooler with time as the front progresses eastward.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest suite of guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably
similar larger scale pattern evolution, but with continued
uncertainty in timing, track, and strength of the embedded
systems. Right off the bat, the 00Z/06Z GFS remained different
(much slower) with the exiting Southeastern U.S. trough, showing
more defined northern/southern stream separation and a
stronger/more south surface low off the FL/GA coast. Models and
ensembles showed much larger and pertinent spread as upper
troughing digs east of the Rockies. This resulted in rather large
differences between the ensemble systems' trough axes and
resultant temperature trends/averages especially into the Front
Range of the Rockies and western Plains. Favored the more steady
ECMWF ensemble guidance which was generally milder than the GEFS
guidance but with tempered confidence due to uncertainty in the
mid-latitude flow progression from the North Pacific into western
North America. Multi-day trend favored a bit quicker progression
of the upper trough overall.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of the 00Z ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET and
00Z ECMWF ensemble mean guidance to start, though the GFS/GEFS
were reasonable over the western portion of the CONUS. Once the
Atlantic system (slow GFS) exited well away from the coast, the
GFS was brought back into the mix at the expense of the UKMET and
Canadian, which added detail to the ECMWF ensemble mean (and some
GEFS mean influence to adjust timing). Favored a milder pattern
than the 13Z NBM over the Plains (quicker to raise heights) and
wetter overall as the increasingly meridional flow should tap at
least a modest amount of Gulf moisture along and ahead of the
front.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A series of Pacific systems will work inland across the West, with
main upper troughing set to work through the region by midweek.
This will favor terrain-enhanced rainfall from the Pacific
Northwest to northern California and a heavy snow threat from the
Cascades and northern Sierra inland across favored terrain for the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies early in the period, with rising
snow levels toward the end of next week as heights recover.
Subsequent amplified upper troughing carving out over the central
U.S. is slated to be sandwiched between upper ridges over the West
Coast and East Coast amid the pattern transition. Cyclogenesis and
frontogenesis will act to favor an emerging lead organized
rainfall/convective pattern over the east-central U.S. Thursday as
theta-e advection increases. Surface wave development could act to
enhance rainfall along the front from the southern Appalachians
northward. Backside cold air flow by next Friday also suggests
potential for some snow over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest as moisture
feeds back around the developing/exiting main low. Temperatures
will be near to above normal early in the week, with possible
record highs ahead of the front, trending cooler by week's end

...Coastal low to produce locally heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and
coastal flooding along the Southeast Coast tonight and into Sunday
morning...

...Rain and heavy mountain snow over parts of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies...

...Much above normal temperatures in the Heartland, coolest
conditions in the Northwest, temperatures returning to more
seasonal levels in the Northeast...

The most unsettled weather will be positioned along the Southeast
coast and in the Pacific Northwest. Starting in the Southeast, a
potent cyclone off the coast of northern Florida is responsible
for causing gusty winds, wind-driven rainfall, and considerably
cooler temperatures from the Carolina coast and southeast Georgia
to northern Florida. Significant coastal impacts are also
occurring as brisk onshore winds send large swells towards the
Southeast coast. Coastal Flood Warnings and Advisories are in
effect through the day Sunday from the Virginia Tidewater all the
way south to Cape Canaveral. This storm gradually moves east on
Sunday, forcing the heaviest rainfall to move off the coast but
gusty winds, scattered showers, and coastal flooding should stick
around for one more day along the Carolina Coast. By Monday, the
storm will have tracked far enough off shore and weaken to the
point where weather conditions along the Southeast coast improves,
although some lingering high surf is possible.

Meanwhile, a frontal system tracking into the Pacific Northwest
today is ushering in Pacific moisture that is resulting in
numerous showers and areas of mountain snowfall. Even in wake of
this system as it tracks inland, persistent onshore flow will
continue to direct Pacific moisture towards the region on Sunday,
meaning more rounds of coastal/valley showers and mountain snow is
anticipated. In total, snowfall accumulations through Monday
evening are forecast to be heaviest in the Cascades and Olympic
Ranges where 1 to 2 feet of snow is expected (heaviest totals in
the highest of elevations). Some measurable snowfall is also
possible in the Tetons, Absoroka, and Wind River Ranges as a wave
of low pressure along a slow moving frontal boundary generates
periods of snow on Sunday.

Outside of the Southeast coast and the Pacific Northwest, the rest
of the Lower 48 can expect generally tranquil weather conditions
to close out the weekend and to kickoff the upcoming week. The
coolest temperatures are set to transpire in the Northwest and
into northern California. Another cool day is on tap in the
Southeast but moderating temperatures return to the Northeast on
Sunday where temperatures bounce back to more seasonal levels.
Chilly lows stick around for one more day in the Mid-South where
some Frost Advisories are in place for Sunday morning. The warmest
conditions on Sunday will be found in the Heartland where high
temps look to soar into the 70s (some 80s too) in the central High
Plains. By Monday, 80+ degree highs are possible in the Texas
Panhandle while 60s return to portions of the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat November 06 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 PM CDT Sat Nov 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

The latest fuel guidance suggests relatively rapid fuel drying has
occurred over the past day across central into south/southeast
Colorado and vicinity, with ERC values generally exceeding the 80th
percentile (90th+ percentile over the Central Mountains and portions
of the San Luis Valley). Continued fuel drying through tomorrow
coupled with sustained surface winds of around 15-20 mph and
critical minimum RH values should promote at least a few hours of
elevated fire weather conditions. Locally critical conditions are
most likely across portions of the high valleys and higher foothills
in Colorado, where the most favorable overlap of wind/rh and fuels
is expected. While elevated (to locally critical) meteorological
fire weather conditions are also expected farther south across
eastern New Mexico and the western Texas Panhandle, fuels across
this region remain less favorable to large-scale fire concerns.

..Elliott.. 11/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1243 AM CDT Sat Nov 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level troughing over the West Coast will begin to slowly shift
eastward through the day Sunday. A leading impulse within the mean
trough is forecast to propagate across the central/northern Rockies,
which will help deepen and consolidate a surface low over the
central High Plains by the afternoon. Pressure-gradient winds are
forecast to increase to around 15-20 mph from northeast NM through
eastern KS. Despite strengthening winds, low-level moisture return
will help mitigate RH reductions across much of OK and KS. A modest
downslope component off the southern/central Rockies coupled with an
antecedent dry air mass may support a few hours of elevated
conditions across northeast NM into adjacent areas of southeast CO
and the OK/TX Panhandles. Forecast guidance has shown reasonable
consistency with this solution, but seasonal ERC values suggest only
marginal fire weather potential. Highlights may be introduced in
subsequent outlooks if fuels become sufficiently dry over the next
48 hours.

1225 AM CDT Sun Nov 07 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
A broad region of enhanced southwesterly mid-level flow will
overspread much of the central/northern Rockies, in association with
a large-scale upper-level trough positioned over the West. At least
marginally enhanced mid-level flow should extend into portions of
the central/southern High Plains as well.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Surface dew point temperatures should remain in the low 20s F and
teens across the region, while temperatures warm into the upper 70s
F during the afternoon. This should result in RH values falling into
the teens amid a deeply mixed boundary layer. With the
aforementioned marginally enhanced mid-level flow aloft, surface
winds may approach 10-15 mph, with localized/terrain-enhanced winds.
Likewise, a few days of persistent dry conditions have allowed fuels
to cure (e.g., ERC values exceeding the 80th percentile). Thus, a
few hours of elevated conditions are possible across the highlighted
region.

Dry and somewhat breezy conditions should also occur farther south
across portions of northeast New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle.
However, a lack of fuel receptivity exists in this region, thus no
highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1227 AM CDT Sun Nov 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad southwesterly mid-level flow over much of the western CONUS to
start the period will gradually orient to more of a zonal pattern as
a short-wave trough lifts into the northern Great Plains and is
replaced by a short-wave ridge. Consequently, flow in the mid levels
is forecast to remain quite marginal (30-35 kt) over portions of the
central/southern High Plains. Despite persistent dry conditions at
the surface, characterized by RH values into the teens during the
afternoon, surface winds are forecast to remain well below critical
thresholds. Thus, no fire-weather highlights have been introduced in
this outlook, although localized elevated fire-weather conditions
are possible across portions of the central/southern High Plains,
particularly in terrain-favored regions where fuels have recently
become receptive to large-fire spread.

...Deep Midwest/Great Lakes Low mid-later week...
...Moisture Plume to focus into Pacific Northwest later week...


...Pattern Overview...

Positive height anomalies over northern Canada and off the
Southwest and Southeast U.S. will favor increased troughing over
the central-eastern U.S. in an amplifying pattern. This favors a
deepening central states cyclone that will lift northeastward
through the Midwest/Great Lakes into Canada. Milder air over much
of the Lower 48 will trend cooler with time as the trailing cold
front sweeps eastward bringing a widespread swath of enhanced but
overall progressive rains across the broad region along with some
wrap-back snows across the Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and
Northern Appalachians.

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing a long fetch
plume of Pacific moisture into the Pacific Northwest, especially
later this week. Favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably similar larger scale
pattern evolution, but with continued uncertainty in timing,
track, and strength of the embedded systems including run to run
continuity issues. Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite
was primarily derived from a composite blend of the latest
GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and the National Blend of Models that
seem reasonably compatible.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Amplified upper troughing carving out over the central U.S. is
slated to be sandwiched between upper ridges over the West Coast
and East Coast amid the pattern transition. Cyclogenesis and
frontogenesis will act to favor an emerging lead organized
rainfall/convective pattern over the east-central U.S. Thursday as
theta-e advection increases. Surface wave development could act to
enhance rainfall along the front from the southern Appalachians
northward. Backside cold air flow by next Friday also suggests
potential for some snow over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes/northern Appalachians as moisture feeds back around the
developing/exiting main low. Temperatures will be near to above
normal early in the week, with possible record highs ahead of the
front, trending cooler by week's end especially into the
Southeast. Please see WPC links below for all the details in
graphical format.

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing a long fetch

...Rain and higher elevation snow are expected over parts of the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies...

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Northern California on Monday into Tuesday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 30 degrees above average over the
Northern/Central High Plains into the Upper Midwest...

Weak onshore flow and upper-level troughing will aid in producing
rain and higher elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest/Northern
California into the Northern Rockies through Tuesday. Moisture
will surge onshore ahead of the next system which will be moving
across the Eastern Pacific overnight Monday. An associated
atmospheric river will be directed toward Northern/Central
California bringing periods of heavy rain and higher elevation
snow to the region Monday afternoon through Tuesday. As a result,
the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall Monday
into Tuesday morning over parts of Northern California.

A front draped from the Upper Midwest to the Great Basin will move
eastward extending from the Great Lakes into the Southern Plains
by Tuesday.  Today, ahead of the front, temperatures will surge 10
to 30 degrees above average over the Northern/Central High Plains
into the Upper Midwest.

Meanwhile, low pressure off the Southeast Coast will continue to
move eastward out over the Atlantic. As a result, rain and gusty
winds will diminish through the day.

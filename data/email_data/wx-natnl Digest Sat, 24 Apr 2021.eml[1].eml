1153 AM CDT Fri Apr 23 2021

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO INTO
WESTERN TEXAS...

Much of the previous forecast appears to be on track. Mostly clear
skies (evident via visible satellite imagery) and a deepening
surface cyclone across western Texas are contributing to a 15-25 mph
sustained west-southwesterly surface wind field already in progress
across portions of central New Mexico into western Texas. Continued
diurnal heating is expected to result in widespread 10-15% RH in the
post-dryline environment across much western Texas, extending
westward across New Mexico into northern Arizona per latest guidance
consensus. Critical conditions are still expected for several hours
across portions of eastern New Mexico into western Texas, extending
as far east as the Texas Rolling Plains to the Stockton Plateau.
Consideration was given to extending the Critical farther east into
the Concho Valley and the Edwards Plateau area, but more persistent
cloud cover and fuels relatively less receptive to fire spread
remain limiting factors for a Critical expansion. Elsewhere across
the Elevated area, at least locally Critical conditions are
expected, especially across northern Arizona by afternoon peak
heating.

Deep boundary-layer mixing and localized upslope flow along the
steeper terrain across western into central New Mexico is expected
to support the development of relatively fast moving storm cells
during the afternoon hours. While some of the latest forecast
guidance shows precipitable water values under 0.50 inches,
deep-layer steep lapse rates and 500 mb temperatures less than -20C
will foster up to 200 J/kg MUCAPE within the -20 to -30C layer. As
such, isolated lightning flashes may accompany any of the taller
updrafts that can become established. With 20+ kt storm motions and
ample rainfall evaporation through a dry sfc-500 mb sub-cloud layer,
an isolated dry thunderstorm area has been maintained where storms
are most likely to develop over dry fuels.

Lastly, locally Elevated conditions are possible this afternoon
along the immediate lee of the southern Cascades into the Harney
Basin in southeast Oregon. However, the brief, localized nature of
these conditions precludes fire weather highlights at this time.

..Squitieri.. 04/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0119 AM CDT Fri Apr 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals an upper-level trough
translating eastward across northern Mexico towards the southern
High Plains. A lee trough currently in place along the High Plains
will consolidate through the day as the wave moves into the southern
Plains region. Strong westerly flow off the southern Rockies will
help mix a dryline eastward into west TX and introduce a broad swath
of dry and windy conditions across a region with dry fuels.
Additionally, lift and mid-level moisture associated with the main
upper-level trough will support the potential for a few dry
thunderstorms over portions of New Mexico.

...Southern High Plains and Four Corners...
Recent guidance continues to show a high probability for widespread
winds between 20-25 mph and relative humidity values in the single
digits to low teens in a post-dryline air mass across east NM and
west/southwest TX this afternoon. Mid-level winds will likely be
strongest over the Trans-Pecos region of southwest TX on the
southern/southwestern periphery of the main upper-level wave. Deep
boundary-layer mixing above 700 mb and a uni-directional wind
profile should facilitate efficient downward transport of 30-40 mph
winds by late afternoon.

Further to the northwest into central NM and northeast AZ, transient
and more localized critical conditions are possible. However,
scattered overnight precipitation (mainly across northeast AZ), as
well as lower confidence in mid-level wind support, have lowered
confidence in the potential for widespread/persistent critical
conditions.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Evening soundings across the Southwest show sufficient mid-level
moisture in place to support a few thunderstorms across central AZ
within the main upper-level trough. This moisture, along with cooler
temperatures aloft, are forecast to shift eastward into NM over the
next 24 hours. Despite very dry boundary-layer conditions, forecast
soundings suggest enough instability, along with weak synoptic lift
and localized orographic ascent, will be in place to support
isolated dry thunderstorms this afternoon over a region with dry
fuels.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 23 2021

SYNOPSIS: At the outset of the period, mid-level high (low) pressure is
anticipated to promote above (below) normal temperatures over portions of t=
he
Desert Southwest (eastern U.S.). Surface low pressure development over cent=
ral
contiguous U.S. favors potentially heavy precipitation over parts of the
Plains
and Mississippi Valley during the middle of the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures across portions of the Desert
Southwest, Sat-Sun, May 1-2.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY APRIL 26 - FRIDAY APRIL 30:

GVQklppUoNb$

FOR SATURDAY MAY 01 - FRIDAY MAY 07: There are key differences between the
GEFS
and ECMWF ensemble mean 500-hPa height anomalies during the middle of week-=
2.
While there is fair agreement between the GEFS and the ECMWF featuring
anomalous ridging (troughing) throughout the western (eastern) CONUS at the
start of the period, the 0z and 6z GEFS favor a more progressive pattern th=
an
the ECMWF around days 9 and 10 (May 2 and 3), rapidly breaking down this
ridging across the western CONUS with the development of deep troughing
extending into northern Mexico and downstream positive height departures
overspreading the East. This mid-level pattern flip is much less pronounced=
 in
the ECMWF, which favors a slower deamplification of anomalous ridging acros=
s
the western CONUS while maintaining low amplitude troughing across the
southeastern CONUS by day 10. As a result of these disparities relative the
timing of these transitioning mid-level features in the dynamical models,
there
is added uncertainty in regards to hazard potential throughout the course o=
f
week-2.



Following the passage of a large frontal system across the Eastern Seaboard=
 at
the end of April, much of the chances for heavy precipitation appear to be
timed off in week-2. However, an anomalous cold air mass looks to settle in
the
wake of the front as reforecast guidance indicates elevated chances for
minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile throughout the eastern CONUS
early in the period. There is at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures
falling below 40 degrees F over parts of the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, wh=
ich
may lead to frost over sensitive vegetation in the region. Across the
southwestern CONUS, the predicted temperature pattern looks to be quite the
opposite associated with an amplified ridge aloft early in the period.
Compared
to yesterday, today's reforecast guidance features higher probabilities for
much above-normal temperatures, with the ECMWF reforecast tool depicting at
least a 60% (20%) chance for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th (95th)
percentile over parts of the Desert Southwest. Although the GEFS reforecast
tool is not as robust in percentile space, elevated chances exist for dayti=
me
temperatures exceeding 100 degrees F over the Sonoran Desert region of
California and Arizona, and above 95 degrees F over southern Nevada. Given
these increased signals, a slight risk for much above normal temperatures i=
s
posted for May 1 to May 2. Temperatures are expected to moderate towards th=
e
end of next weekend as the mid-level ridge weakens in the ensemble guidance=
.



Tied to the mid-level troughing favored by the 0z and 6z GEFS on day 10 (Ma=
y
3), a broad area of mean surface low pressure is featured over the Southern
High Plains with southerly flow ahead over the Mississippi Valley to help
advect Gulf moisture into the southern CONUS.  Similar to yesterday, this
predicted flow pattern remains favorable for potentially heavy precipitatio=
n
in
the region where the GEFS reforecast tool shows at least a 20% chance that
3-day accumulations exceed the 85th percentile and 1 inch over parts of the
Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley. However, this heavy precipitation
potential continues to remain weak in the ECMWF reforecast tool, where the =
0z
ECMWF ensemble also maintains low probabilities for daily precipitation
amounts
exceeding an inch over the region during the middle of the period. Due to t=
he
continued disagreement between models in regards to the predicted mid-level
pattern and in the reforecast guidance, there is insufficient confidence to
add
a slight risk area for heavy precipitation in the outlook. Though, it is
important to note that any above-normal precipitation that occurs over the
Lower Mississippi Valley during week-2 is likely to worsen anomalously wet
antecedent conditions and may trigger localized flooding in the region.



Over Alaska, a weak mid-level flow pattern predicted by the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles leads to slightly elevated chances for above(below)-normal
precipitation over portions of the Southeast (western Mainland). Disagreeme=
nts
exist between the models with respect to temperatures, as the ECMWF favors
predominately below-normal conditions throughout much of the state, where t=
he
GEFS continues to maintain increased chances for above-normal temperatures
over
parts of the central and southern Mainland. If the latter is realized, such
temperatures are likely to accelerate ice and snow melt during river ice br=
eak
up season in early May.

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 26 2021 - 12Z Fri Apr 30 2021

...Heavy rain threat from the South-Central Plains into the
Midwest next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Latest guidance continues to show an amplified upper pattern over
the eastern Pacific and lower 48, with an upper trough continuing
to spread rain/mountain snow over the West early in the week and
then likely generating a threat for heavy rainfall and in some
cases severe weather over portions of the Plains/east-central U.S.
as it pushes eastward. The leading wavy surface front will
separate well above normal temperatures that will extend from the
southern three-fourths of the Plains into the East next week from
below normal readings crossing the West early in the period.
Western temperatures will likely surge to well above normal levels
by late week as a strong upper ridge builds over the region.

Recent trends have continued into the 00Z/06Z model cycles, with a
slower/stronger ridge building into the West ahead of a slower and
more amplified upstream Pacific trough--leading to less
precipitation reaching the Northwest and slower progression of the
initial western trough that moves into the central U.S. Most
guidance has displayed these trends but over recent days the
ECMWF/ECMWF mean have generally been somewhat ahead of the
GFS/GEFS mean in reflecting them. Thus prefer to continue
weighting the forecast more in the ECMWF/ECMWF mean direction
overall. The 06Z GFS/GEFS mean did adjust back from their 00Z runs
enough to allow for minority blend inclusion. UKMET/CMC runs are
also consistent among themselves in advertising a slower and
southward upper low track near the Mexico border. Their upstream
pattern clusters fairly well with the ECMWF/ECMWF mean in
principle, so it remains to be seen if the western trough/upper
low ends up being quite as slow/separated as forecast by the
UKMET/CMC. The new 12Z ECMWF adjusted a little slower for a time
but then remains faster/more open than the UKMET/CMC by early
Thursday. Toward the end of the week there is added uncertainty
over how trough energy may evolve over the eastern U.S. with
sporadic operational model runs hinting at the possibility of
another upper low closing off.

For low pressure expected to track into the Canadian Maritimes
early in the week, 00Z/06Z GFS runs were the only remaining
solutions to pull the system southeast of Nova Scotia after early
Tuesday instead of continuing to the north. The 12Z GFS adjusted a
bit north of previous runs but is still south of consensus.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system crossing the West early in the week will provide the
best lower elevation rain/mountain snow focus over favored terrain
in the Great Basin and Arizona through north-central/central
Rockies from Monday into Tuesday. Some leading precipitation may
also stream across the extreme northern tier into the Upper Great
Lakes. By midweek the system should reach far enough east for the
leading wavy front to begin interacting with Gulf of Mexico
moisture to produce increasing coverage/intensity of rain and
thunderstorms over central/southern parts of the Plains. Moderate
to heavy rainfall should extend eastward with time into the
Mississippi Valley and east-central U.S. See Storm Prediction
Center outlooks for the latest details on severe weather threats
with this event. At this time the best signal for highest rainfall
totals extends from parts of Texas and Oklahoma into the Middle
Mississippi Valley/Lower Ohio Valley and vicinity. Guidance is
still in the process of resolving important details of this system
so the expected focus for heaviest rainfall may continue to show
some variation in coming days.

Elsewhere, flow around the upper ridge building into the West may
bring some moisture into the Pacific Northwest and possibly
extreme northern Rockies. Heaviest precipitation should remain
over Vancouver Island with light to moderate totals extending into
western Washington, but confidence in specifics is not great due
to guidance spread and variability over recent days. Low pressure
tracking into the Canadian Maritimes by Monday may produce breezy
conditions over the Northeast early in the week but recent trends
have been a little weaker for wind speeds and more scattered for
any wrap-around precipitation.

The amplified upper pattern will support a succession of anomalous
temperature areas. Warmth ahead of the system initially crossing
the western U.S. will spread from the central/southern portions of
the Plains into the East, with max/min readings most likely to be
10-20F above normal from the southern three-fourths of the Plains
into the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast. In
the cooler airmass behind this system expect highs of at least
10-15F below normal to progress across the southern half or
two-thirds of the West during the first half of the week. This air
will modify as it reaches the Plains/Mississippi Valley mid-late
week with highs more modestly below normal. Meanwhile temperatures
over the West will rebound strongly as an upper ridge builds over
the region after midweek. Expect highs to reach 10-20F above
normal over much of California/Oregon/Nevada and possibly some
surrounding areas by Thursday-Friday. The Southwest could even see
highs approach daily record values.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 29 - MAY 03, 2021

Todays model solutions are in fair agreement on the overall 500-hPa flow
pattern across the forecast domain. Cyclonic flow is forecast across most o=
f
the CONUS punctuated by a mean trough expected across the Mississippi Valle=
y.
Ridging and above normal heights are predicted on either side of this troug=
h
across the western and northeastern CONUS, respectively. A complex pattern =
is
forecast for Alaska as a pair of troughs are predicted across northwestern
mainland Alaska and south of the Aleutians. Weak ridging is forecast
downstream
over parts of northeastern mainland Alaska. A strong Western Pacific MJO ev=
ent
(Phase 7 in the Wheeler-Hendon classification) is currently ongoing, which =
is
likely to influence the overall pattern during the outlook period. Composit=
es
from past strong (defined in this case as a MJO index amplitude greater tha=
n
1.0) Phase 7 MJO events this time of year were utilized in the production o=
f
todays outlooks. The manual height blend consists primarily of ensemble mea=
n
solutions from the NCEP, ECMWF, and Canadian centers and was based on
considerations of recent skill.

Ridging forecast across the western and northeastern CONUS favors above nor=
mal
temperatures across these regions. Below normal temperature probabilities a=
re
increased across the Mississippi Valley underneath predicted mean troughing=
.
Near to below normal temperatures are favored for most of Alaska based on
dynamical guidance from the ECMWF ensembles, analogs based on the manual
blend,
and MJO composites. Above normal temperatures are favored across the Alaska
Peninsula and the Aleutians, underneath predicted above normal mid-level
heights.

Above normal precipitation is likely across much of the eastern CONUS ahead=
 of
a mean trough forecast over the Mississippi Valley. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored behind this trough across most of the central and
southwestern CONUS underneath predicted ridging and associated near to abov=
e
normal heights. Enhanced Pacific flow is possible for parts of the
northwestern
CONUS and the Alaska Panhandle, where above normal precipitation is slightl=
y
favored. Drier than normal conditions are likely across most of the remaind=
er
of Alaska, as a trough predicted to the south of the Aleutians is expected =
to
steer the mean storm track mostly to the south of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 0z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
only fair model agreement, with some significant disagreements among the
temperature and precipitation tools across parts of the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 01 - 07 2021

During the week-2 period, weak cyclonic 500-hPa flow is expected across mos=
t
of
the CONUS. The location of the associated trough axis is generally forecast=
 to
shift westward relative to the 6-10 day period. Ridging and associated abov=
e
normal heights are forecast to persist across the Northeastern CONUS. Ridgi=
ng
predicted over the West Coast during the 6-10 day period is generally forec=
ast
to weaken and retrograde off the coast during week-2, with increased trough=
ing
predicted later in the period. Enhanced westerlies are expected to remain
mostly to the south of Alaska. As a result, weak 500-hPa flow is expected
across most of the state.

Above normal temperatures are likely across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic,=
 as
above normal heights are generally forecast to persist across the region.
Above
normal temperature probabilities are forecast to weaken across most of the
western CONUS relative to the 6-10 day period as ridging is expected to
subside
and retrograde off the coast. The retrogression of this ridge may result in=
 a
more northerly component of the mid-level flow over parts of the northweste=
rn
CONUS, slightly favoring below normal temperatures there. Enhanced below
normal
temperature probabilities also extend northward to the Alaska Panhandle, du=
e
to
strong support from ECMWF dynamical model guidance. Near to below normal
temperatures are favored for much of the Mainland, due to support from ECMW=
F
dynamical model guidance and MJO composites. Above normal temperatures are
likely for the Aleutians, underneath predicted above normal heights.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored across much of the CONUS,
underneath predicted mean cyclonic 500-hPa flow. However, below normal
precipitation is slightly favored for the Northeast, close to a predicted m=
ean
ridge axis. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for the southwest=
ern
CONUS and the Rio Grande Valley as the mean storm track is expected to rema=
in
to the north of these areas, and much of this region is climatologically dr=
y
this time of year. Dry conditions are likely to persist across western
Mainland
Alaska, as enhanced westerlies are expected to remain to the south of the
region. However, enhanced Pacific flow may affect the Panhandle and parts o=
f
southeastern Mainland Alaska, resulting in a slight tilt toward above norma=
l
precipitation across these regions.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 10% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 45% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and
25%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Much below average, 1 out of 5=

due to conflicting dynamical model guidance across large portions of the
forecast domain.

FORECASTER: Scott H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Fri Apr 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

Much of the previous forecast remains on track, with mainly minor
adjustments made to the Elevated delineation over the Southwest to
account for the latest guidance consensus. Much of the guidance
shows at least locally Critical fire weather conditions across
portions of northeast Arizona into southeast Utah. However, the
localized overlap of favorable surface winds/RH over dry fuel beds
precludes Critical fire weather highlights at this time. Please see
the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 04/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Fri Apr 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level wave is forecast to strengthen off the CA/OR coast
early this weekend. An associated upper-level jet will begin to nose
into the Great Basin by Saturday afternoon, which should support a
broad region of modest surface pressure falls across the
inter-mountain West. As a result, increasing pressure-gradient winds
across a region with dry fuels will lead to heightened fire weather
concerns.

...Great Basin and Southwest...
Surface winds are forecast to increase to 15-25 mph across a broad
swath from the southern Great Basin into portions of eastern NM.
Limited moisture return in the wake of Friday's system will help
relative humidity values remain in the 10-15% range across much of
the region. Enhanced mid-level flow associated with the approaching
wave will generally remain on the southern periphery of the Great
Basin from southern NV into northern AZ/southern UT. Forecast
soundings suggest boundary-layer mixing may be sufficient to allow
for wind gusts up to 35 mph across this region, though cloud cover
could limit mixing potential and the coverage of stronger winds.
Ensemble guidance supports this idea to some degree with pockets of
higher probabilities for sustained 20+ mph winds within this
corridor. This suggests that while areas of critical conditions are
possible, widespread elevated conditions appear more likely at this
time. Further to the east across NM, modest lee troughing and poor
mid/upper-level wind support should yield only elevated conditions.

...Heavy rain threat from the South-Central Plains into the
Midwest next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Latest guidance continues to show an amplified upper pattern over
the eastern Pacific and lower 48, with an upper trough continuing
to spread rain/mountain snow over the West early in the week and
then likely generating a threat for heavy rainfall and in some
cases severe weather over portions of the Plains/east-central U.S.
as it pushes eastward. The leading wavy surface front will
separate well above normal temperatures that will extend from the
southern three-fourths of the Plains into the East next week from
below normal readings crossing the West early in the period.
Western temperatures will likely surge to well above normal levels
by late week as a strong upper ridge builds over the region.

Recent trends have continued into the 00Z/06Z model cycles, with a
slower/stronger ridge building into the West ahead of a slower and
more amplified upstream Pacific trough--leading to less
precipitation reaching the Northwest and slower progression of the
initial western trough that moves into the central U.S. Most
guidance has displayed these trends but over recent days the
ECMWF/ECMWF mean have generally been somewhat ahead of the
GFS/GEFS mean in reflecting them. Thus prefer to continue
weighting the forecast more in the ECMWF/ECMWF mean direction
overall. The 06Z GFS/GEFS mean did adjust back from their 00Z runs
enough to allow for minority blend inclusion. UKMET/CMC runs are
also consistent among themselves in advertising a slower and
southward upper low track near the Mexico border. Their upstream
pattern clusters fairly well with the ECMWF/ECMWF mean in
principle, so it remains to be seen if the western trough/upper
low ends up being quite as slow/separated as forecast by the
UKMET/CMC. The new 12Z ECMWF adjusted a little slower for a time
but then remains faster/more open than the UKMET/CMC by early
Thursday. Toward the end of the week there is added uncertainty
over how trough energy may evolve over the eastern U.S. with
sporadic operational model runs hinting at the possibility of
another upper low closing off.

For low pressure expected to track into the Canadian Maritimes
early in the week, 00Z/06Z GFS runs were the only remaining
solutions to pull the system southeast of Nova Scotia after early
Tuesday instead of continuing to the north. The 12Z GFS adjusted a
bit north of previous runs but is still south of consensus.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system crossing the West early in the week will provide the
best lower elevation rain/mountain snow focus over favored terrain
in the Great Basin and Arizona through north-central/central
Rockies from Monday into Tuesday. Some leading precipitation may
also stream across the extreme northern tier into the Upper Great
Lakes. By midweek the system should reach far enough east for the
leading wavy front to begin interacting with Gulf of Mexico
moisture to produce increasing coverage/intensity of rain and
thunderstorms over central/southern parts of the Plains. Moderate
to heavy rainfall should extend eastward with time into the
Mississippi Valley and east-central U.S. See Storm Prediction
Center outlooks for the latest details on severe weather threats
with this event. At this time the best signal for highest rainfall
totals extends from parts of Texas and Oklahoma into the Middle
Mississippi Valley/Lower Ohio Valley and vicinity. Guidance is
still in the process of resolving important details of this system
so the expected focus for heaviest rainfall may continue to show
some variation in coming days.

Elsewhere, flow around the upper ridge building into the West may
bring some moisture into the Pacific Northwest and possibly
extreme northern Rockies. Heaviest precipitation should remain
over Vancouver Island with light to moderate totals extending into
western Washington, but confidence in specifics is not great due
to guidance spread and variability over recent days. Low pressure
tracking into the Canadian Maritimes by Monday may produce breezy
conditions over the Northeast early in the week but recent trends
have been a little weaker for wind speeds and more scattered for
any wrap-around precipitation.

The amplified upper pattern will support a succession of anomalous
temperature areas. Warmth ahead of the system initially crossing
the western U.S. will spread from the central/southern portions of
the Plains into the East, with max/min readings most likely to be
10-20F above normal from the southern three-fourths of the Plains
into the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast. In
the cooler airmass behind this system expect highs of at least
10-15F below normal to progress across the southern half or
two-thirds of the West during the first half of the week. This air
will modify as it reaches the Plains/Mississippi Valley mid-late
week with highs more modestly below normal. Meanwhile temperatures
over the West will rebound strongly as an upper ridge builds over
the region after midweek. Expect highs to reach 10-20F above
normal over much of California/Oregon/Nevada and possibly some
surrounding areas by Thursday-Friday. The Southwest could even see
highs approach daily record values.

...Flash flooding and severe weather potential will spread from
the south-central U.S. this evening and tonight into the Southeast
on Saturday...

...Rain and snow increasing across the West this weekend...

...Ongoing fire weather danger is expected for the Four Corners
states to the Southern High Plains...

A surface low pressure system and its associated fronts are
forecast to move from the Southern Plains eastward into the
Southeast on Saturday. Moisture flowing in from the Gulf of Mexico
combined with these features will continue to produce rain and
thunderstorms across those regions. Through tonight, a Moderate
Risk of excessive rainfall is in place for central Louisiana and
southwestern Mississippi as multiple inches of rain training over
that area could lead to numerous flash floods, some of which could
be locally significant. Marginal to Slight Risks of flash flooding
as well as Enhanced Risks of severe weather are also in place for
portions of the Southern Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley, and the
Southeast through tonight. The Southern Plains in particular could
see damaging hail of greater than 2" in diameter with these
storms. Then on Saturday, thunderstorm chances shift to the
Southeast. Slight to Enhanced Risks of severe weather are
delineated for the Southeast into the Carolinas for tornado, high
wind, and hail threats, with flash flooding possible as well. By
Saturday night and Sunday, the low pressure system is forecast to
deepen over the Atlantic and move northeastward, leading to rain
showers across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.

Across the western U.S., a couple of rounds of upper-level energy
and troughing will push frontal systems into the region and help
cause precipitation there, beginning in the Pacific Northwest
tonight and expanding south and eastward into the Northern
Rockies, Great Basin, and California through the weekend.
Precipitation will generally be in the form of snow in higher
elevations and rain in lower elevations. The Sierra Nevada is
likely to see the heaviest snow through Sunday, with over a foot
expected, and Winter Storm Warnings are in place there.

Elsewhere, the north-central U.S. could see light precipitation
tonight into Saturday as a front passes through, with light mixed
precipitation or snow possible in parts of the Northern Plains,
Upper Midwest, and Upper Great Lakes. Rain is likely farther south
in the Ohio Valley between the two frontal systems. Then another
round of snow could occur across the north-central region again by
Sunday with cooler than normal temperatures north of a warm front.

Meanwhile, conditions in the southwestern U.S. look to remain dry
over the next couple of days. Dry conditions with low relative
humidities and dry ground, as well as enhanced gusty winds from
the approaching upper-level troughing, will lead to ongoing fire
danger for the Four Corners states into western Texas. A Critical
Risk of fire weather is in place today for the Southern High
Plains, with Elevated Risks stretching back into the Four Corners
today and Saturday. Another round of dangerous fire weather
conditions can also be expected early next week.

...Heavy rain threat from the South-Central Plains into the
Midwest next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The medium range period (Tues-Sat) continues to show a rather
amplified upper level pattern over the Eastern Pacific and lower
48. The main feature of interest will be an upper level trough
initially over the Western U.S. which should steadily progress
eastward with time, reaching the East by the start of next
weekend. In its wake, a strong upper ridge will build centered
over the Southwest/Four Corners region through the week, with
another shortwave possibly impacting the Northwest Coast by
Saturday.

The latest guidance continues to trend slower with the main upper
trough, with the 18z/Apr 23 GFS still on the fast side of the
solutions (although slower than it's previous 12z run). The
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and the ensemble means would support something a
little slower than the GFS. Late in the period, uncertainties
begin to arise in the evolution of the trough and whether it
remains an open amplified trough, or sporadic model runs (both the
GFS and ECMWF) have hinted at the possibility of an upper low
closing off over the Southeast or Mid-Atlantic states. The WPC
forecast favored a blend (leaning heavily towards the ECMWF) of
deterministic solutions for days 3-5, trending quickly towards a
50/50 blend of ensembles and deterministic (ECMWF/CMC) by day 7.
This approach helps mitigate late period details which have yet to
be resolved and also maintains good continuity with the previous
shift.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system crossing the West early in the week will initially
bring some lower elevation rain/mountain snow with the best focus
over favored terrain in Arizona through the north-central Rockies
on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the leading cold front should reach far
enough east to begin interacting with Gulf of Mexico moisture to
produce increasing coverage/intensity of rain and thunderstorms
over the central/southern parts of the Plains. Moderate to heavy
rainfall should extend east and northeast with time into the
Mississippi Valley and the east-central U.S.. At this time, the
best signal for highest rainfall totals extends from parts of
Texas/Oklahoma into the Mid-Mississippi Valley and western Ohio
Valley. Confidence is high in heavy rainfall potential with this
system, although the guidance is still in the process of resolving
important details so the expected focus for heaviest rainfall may
continue to show some variation in the coming days. Severe weather
may also be a threat with this system, especially for parts of the
southern/central Plains on Tuesday (see Storm Prediction Center
outlooks for latest information). By Friday into Saturday,
moisture should shift into the East/Southeast with moderate to
locally heavy rainfall possible.

Elsewhere, flow around the upper ridge building into the West and
ahead of the next shortwave may bring some moisture into the
Pacific Northwest and possibly extreme northern Rockies. Heaviest
precipitation should remain over western British
Columbia/Vancouver island, with light to moderate totals extending
into western Washington by the end of the week.

Warmth ahead of the system initially crossing the western U.S.
will spread above normal temperatures (anomalies on the order of
+10-20F) from the parts of the central Plains into the Ohio
Valley/Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast through midweek. In
the cooler airmass behind this system expect highs of at least
10-15F below normal to progress across the southern half of the
West during the first half of the week, with moderation as it
reaches the Plains and points east. Meanwhile temperatures over
the West will rebound strongly as an upper ridge builds over the
region after midweek. Expect highs to reach 10-20F above normal
over much of California/Oregon/Nevada and possibly some
surrounding areas by Thursday-Friday. The Southwest could even see
highs approach daily record values.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST UTAH AND FAR WESTERN
COLORADO...

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals an upper-level jet,
associated with a leading impulse ahead of a larger upper-level
trough, beginning to nose into the northern California coast.
Stronger mid and upper-level flow associated with this feature is
forecast to continue edging eastward into the southern Great Basin
by this afternoon. This will result in modest surface pressure falls
across the inter-mountain West, as well as position 30-40 mph
boundary-layer flow from southern NV to the UT/CO border, where
ongoing drought and antecedent dry conditions have resulted in
receptive fuels. Regionally critical to more widespread elevated
fire weather conditions are expected this afternoon as a result from
the Great Basin into the Southwest/Southern High Plains.

...Great Basin...
Recent guidance has come into better agreement regarding the
placement of the stronger mid-level flow over the southern
NV/northern Four-Corners region. Although high-level cloud cover is
expected to overspread the region, 30-40 mph winds just above the
surface will not require substantially deep boundary-layer mixing to
transport the stronger flow to the surface. While stronger gusts
will be likely through this broad corridor, the closer proximity of
the UT/CO border region to the stronger surface pressure falls to
the north will favor this region for sustained 20+ mph winds and
persistent critical fire weather conditions (though transient
critical conditions are probable across southern NV). Dewpoints in
the single digits from northern AZ into eastern UT will support
diurnal RH minimums in the single digits to low teens this
afternoon. Slightly higher humidity is likely for locations
west/southwest, but should generally remain between 10-20% and
support elevated to locally critical conditions.

...Southwest/Southern High Plains...
The passage of a weak overnight cold front across TX will limit any
moisture return into the southern High Plains today and maintain RH
values in the teens across the region. Nearly zonal flow over the
central and northern Rockies should allow for at least modest lee
troughing along the central High Plains this afternoon.
South/southwesterly winds across NM should increase to 15-20 mph and
support elevated fire weather conditions. Weaker mid-level winds
will generally limit the potential for 20+ mph winds, but a few
locations may see an hour or two of critical conditions.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE FOUR-CORNERS REGION...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough, currently noted across the eastern Pacific in
water-vapor imagery, is forecast to deepen along the West Coast
through the day Sunday as it gradually shifts onshore. As a result,
a belt of stronger mid and upper-level flow will likely reside over
the Great Basin with a deepening surface low positioned across the
northern Rockies. This synoptic pattern will favor increasing winds
across much of the southern Great Basin and greater Four Corners
region. Given ongoing drought conditions, heightened ERC values, and
antecedent dry conditions across this region, heightened fire
weather concerns are likely.

...Southern Great Basin/Four Corners...
Short and medium-range ensemble guidance shows reasonable agreement
in the deepening of a surface low over the MT/ID/WY region through
the day Sunday. Strengthening pressure-gradient winds up to 20-25
mph appear likely from southern NV eastward into NM. Similar to
Saturday, the axis of stronger mid-level flow should reside from
southern NV into eastern UT, which will help support wind gusts
between 30-40 mph, though gusts up to 35 mph will be possible
further east towards the Four Corners. Critical wind speeds appear
most likely across northern NM into the Four-Corners region, but may
extend as far west as northwest AZ where the stronger mid-level flow
will be located. However, cloud cover may limit diurnal heating and
mixing across this region. Minimal rain chances or moisture return
prior to Sunday afternoon supports high probabilities for relative
humidity values below 15%, and dry antecedent conditions will
continue to cure fuels.

...Southern High Plains...
Zonal flow over the northern/central Rockies will support persistent
lee troughing through the day Sunday. In response, southerly flow is
forecast to increase to 15-25 mph across the southern High Plains of
east NM and far west TX. A low-level jet over the region is forecast
to strengthen through the day, and diurnal boundary-layer mixing
should allow for 30-40 mph wind gusts within the low-level jet
corridor. Recent ensemble guidance suggests this will most likely
occur across northeast NM into the western TX/OK Panhandles.
Elevated fire weather conditions may extend further east into far
western OK, but fuel quality/receptiveness decreases with eastward
extent.

...There is an Enhanced risk of Severe Thunderstorms and a Slight
risk of Excessive Rainfall over parts of the Southeast and the
Central Gulf Coast through Sunday morning...

...Rain and snow across parts of the West through Monday...

...There is an Elevated to Critical risk of Fire Weather from the
Southwest to the Southern High Plains...

Low pressure and associated fronts will move from the Southern
Plains/Central Gulf Coast to off the Mid-Atlantic Coast by Sunday.
The system will produce showers and thunderstorms with heavy rain
from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the Southeast through Sunday
morning.  The SPC has issued an enhanced risk of severe
thunderstorms over Southeast and parts of the Central Gulf Coast
through Sunday morning.  The hazards associated with the severe
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail with a 10% or great probability of two-inch or greater
over parts of the Central Gulf Coast, and tornadoes.  There is a
10% probability of EF2 to EF5 tornadoes over parts of the Central
Gulf Coast to the Southeast.

Additionally, the WPC has issued a slight risk of excessive
rainfall over the same area over the Central Gulf Coast to parts
of the Southeast, likewise through to Sunday morning. By Sunday
morning, the showers and thunderstorms will move off the Southeast
Coast.  Furthermore, the rain will move into parts of the Ohio
Valley and the Mid-Atlantic on Saturday into Sunday morning.

Meanwhile, a second front over Upper Mississippi Valley will move
eastward to the Lower Great Lakes by Sunday morning and off the
Northeast Coast by Monday.  The storm will bring rain and light
snow to parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes on
Saturday, with rain moving into the Lower Great Lakes by Sunday
morning.  The rain will expand into the Northeast/northern
Mid-Atlantic by Sunday afternoon ending over the Mid-Atlantic by
Sunday evening and the Northeast on Monday morning.

The western U.S. will have a deep area of upper-level energy
moving across the region that will produce rain and higher
elevation snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest/Northern
California into the Northern Rockies on Saturday.   The rain and
snow will expand into parts of Central California and the Great
Basin on Sunday, showing signs of weakening by Monday morning.
Overnight Saturday, a wave of low pressure will move eastward out
of the Northern Rockies to the Northern/Central Plains by Sunday
evening, deepening by Monday morning.  The system will produce
rain and light snow over parts of the Northern Plains/Upper
Mississippi Valley by Sunday morning. The rain and light snow will
continue over the Upper Midwest into Monday morning.

Meanwhile, the southwestern U.S. looks to remain dry through
Monday. Low relative humidity and gusty winds from the approaching
upper-level troughing will lead to ongoing fire danger for the
Four Corners states into western Texas. A Critical Risk of fire
weather is in place on Saturday for southeastern Utah, with
Elevated Risks stretching into the Southern Rockies and
southeastern Nevada.  On Sunday, the Critical Risk will expand
into northwestern Texas, with an Elevated Risk extending a little
farther east into Texas.

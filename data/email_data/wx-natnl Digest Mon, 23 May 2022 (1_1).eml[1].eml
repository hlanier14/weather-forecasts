Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 AM CDT Sun May 22 2022

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA TO WESTERN NEW
MEXICO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN UTAH INTO FAR WESTERN
COLORADO...

An expansion was made to the critical area over parts of southern
Utah, extending it eastward into far western Colorado. In addition,
the peripheral elevated area was expanded to cover more areas of
northern/central Utah and western Colorado. Farther south, a minor
expansion was made to the elevated area across parts of
north-central Arizona. These changes were made based on the forecast
of wind/RH conditions exceeding elevated/critical thresholds with
limited rainfall, as depicted in the latest high-resolution
deterministic and ensemble guidance and corroborated with morning
surface observations.

Otherwise, the balance of the previous forecast remains on track.
See the discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 05/22/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CDT Sun May 22 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected today across portions of the
Southwest and Four Corners region. Early-morning water-vapor imagery
reveals a weak upper-level disturbance approaching Baja California.
This feature will meander east through the day, resulting in modest
surface pressure falls across the greater Four Corner region. The
tightening pressure gradient at the surface will result in
strengthening winds over a region with low relative humidity and dry
fuels.

...Eastern Arizona to New Mexico...
Latest guidance continues to show reasonably high probability of
sustained 20-25 mph winds across parts of eastern AZ into western NM
this afternoon. This region has seen slight drying over the past 24
hours with dewpoints largely in the low to mid 20s. Little to no
moisture recovery into the region will support another day of
widespread sub-15% RH. Recent fuel analyses as well as fire activity
over the past 24 hours indicate fuels are very receptive.
Consequently, elevated to critical fire weather conditions are
expected across much of eastern AZ and western NM. Within the
Critical risk area, brief and localized high-end critical conditions
are possible as RH falls into the single digits with occasional wind
gusts between 25-30 mph.

...Southern Nevada to eastern Utah...
Southern NV will largely be on the periphery of the stronger
low-level mass response; however, ensemble guidance has shown
reasonably good agreement in sustained 15-20 mph winds this
afternoon with RH values falling to 10-15%. Ensemble guidance also
hints at an increasing probability for sustained 20 mph winds across
southern to southeastern UT. Fuels through this region are receptive
based on latest ERC analyses, warranting the introduction of a small
Critical risk area where confidence in the overlap of dry fuels, 20+
mph winds and sub-15% RH is highest.

...Southern to central High Plains...
A dry return flow regime is expected across the OK/TX Panhandles
into eastern CO/western KS this afternoon. The recent frontal
intrusion will limit any moisture return into the region this
afternoon as surface winds increase to 15-20 mph. However, cooler
temperatures will generally limit RH reductions with only a few
warmer/drier solutions hinting at critical RH. Additionally, recent
precipitation across eastern CO will limit the spatial extent of the
concern. While localized elevated conditions are possible, these
factors preclude highlights at this time.

...Sacramento Valley...
Northerly down-valley flow is expected this afternoon, which will
help adiabatically dry and warm conditions through the Sacramento
Valley with RH values falling to near 15% by mid afternoon. However,
winds are expected to generally be weak with ensemble consensus
suggesting 10-15 mph winds are likely. A few locations may observe
periodic elevated conditions, but the overall threat remains too
limited for highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 PM CDT Sun May 22 2022

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

The major change with this outlook cycle is the addition of an area
highlighting the potential for isolated dry thunderstorms across
portions of central New Mexico and far West Texas into south-central
Colorado. The latest convection-allowing guidance suggests storms
should develop during the afternoon/evening hours and remain
isolated, while PWAT values are generally expected to remain below
0.75 inches amid receptive fuels in this region.

Otherwise, only minor refinements were made to the ongoing elevated
area across the Southwest. See the discussion below for more
details.

..Karstens.. 05/22/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Sun May 22 2022/

...Synopsis...
The surface low that is forecast to develop over the Four Corners
region on Sunday will shift into the southern/central High Plains by
Monday afternoon. This will strengthen westerly winds across the
Southwest, resulting in another day of fire weather concerns for a
region with receptive fuels. A few dry thunderstorms are possible
across southeast Colorado/eastern New Mexico Monday afternoon, but
overall confidence in the propensity for dry lightning strikes is
low.

...Southwest...
Fire activity in recent days verifies the critically dry fuels
depicted in fuel guidance across eastern AZ into NM. Dry conditions
already in place across this region will linger given little to no
moisture recovery over the next 48 hours. As the pressure gradient
tightens through the day Monday, sustained winds should increase to
15-20 mph, as suggested by ensemble guidance. While elevated
conditions appear likely, a few solutions hint that winds up to
20-25 mph (with gusts up to 35 mph) are possible across portions of
southwest to central NM. However, such conditions will most likely
occur in mainly desert terrain where fuel loading is low, and this
scenario is depicted by mainly warmer/drier members. Trends in
guidance and observations will be monitored, and a Critical risk
area may be needed for portions of southern NM if confidence in
widespread critical conditions increases.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Thunderstorm initiation is likely late Monday afternoon along the
southern Rockies from southeast CO into eastern NM within an upslope
flow regime. Forecast soundings suggest that early convective
activity may occur on the fringe of deeper boundary-layer moisture
where precipitable-water values are forecast to be near 0.5 to 0.75
inches. This suggests that initial thunderstorms may pose a threat
for a few dry lightning strikes. However, storm motions to the east
at around 30 knots should promote quick intensification within the
richer moisture, yielding increasing rainfall rates. This may limit
the duration and coverage of the dry-lightning threat, and precludes
any dry-lightning highlights at this time.

...Heavy/Excessive Rainfall and Strong/Severe Weather Threat to
Spread from Eastern Texas to the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio
Valleys then Appalachians Wednesday into Thursday...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A large scale upper trough will be exiting the Rockies and
emerging over the Plains by Wednesday, and this will sustain a
surface cold front with multiple waves of low pressure that will
slowly track eastward and should reach the East Coast by early
Friday.  Multiple rounds of heavy to excessive rainfall and strong
to severe thunderstorms are likely across the south-central U.S.
ahead of the cold frontal passage.  Another trough enters the
northwestern U.S. by the end of the week with an upper ridge
building in ahead of it across the Intermountain West, and this
trough will likely spur surface cyclogenesis across the High
Plains by next weekend.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The 00/06/12 UTC guidance bundle continues to offer good synoptic
scale agreement across the continental U.S. for the majority of
the forecast period, with the normal levels of differences in
mesoscale features. The GFS/ECMWF/Canadian are close to their
respective ensemble means for a major lead trough over the
east-central U.S. mid-later this week and model differences have
improved for a second system reaching the western U.S. late week.
The basis for the WPC forecast was derived from a blend of the
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with WPC continuity and the
National Blend of Models (NBM) Wednesday-Friday. The NBM and the
GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means along with best clustered model guidance
from the ECMWF and the GFS/Canadian was highlighted for next
weekend.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Periods of heavy rainfall will continue to make weather headlines
going into Wednesday across the south-central U.S., particularly
around the ArkLaTex region and extending eastward to Mississippi,
where local 2 to 4+ inches of additional rainfall is expected.
Portions of this region are forecast to get heavy rainfall early
in the week as well, thus the ground will likely be saturated and
increases the potential for flooding. Multiple clusters of
convection are likely and these may also produce episodes of
severe weather as per SPC. The experimental medium range Excessive
Rainfall Outlook (ERO) also depicts a "Slight" Risk area for
Wednesday into early Thursday from eastern Texas to western
Tennessee, with additional potential downstream across the South
and up through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley. Beyond this time, the
magnitude of the heavy rainfall threat abates some as the front
becomes more progressive across the Appalachians and then the East
Coast region, although some instances of repeating convection may
also lead to some flooding concerns on a more localized level.
Late week into next weekend, the front moving inland across the
northwestern U.S. and eventually the central/northern Plains is
expected to bring some showers and thunderstorms (and some late
May mountain snows) from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern
Rockies. Storms should emerge over the Plains/Upper Midwest next
weekend with system progression.

In terms of temperatures, pleasantly cool conditions can be
expected across much of the Plains and Midwest in the wake of the
cold front for the middle of the week, followed by a warm-up to
close out the week with above normal highs returning by the
weekend with 90s likely as far north as southern Nebraska, and
even some low 100s for portions of western Texas.  Hot weather is
also expected for the interior valleys of California and the lower
elevations of the Desert Southwest for Wednesday through Friday as
an upper level ridge is expected to be in place, and then
returning closer normal for next weekend.  Elsewhere, expect highs
to generally be within 5 degrees of climatological averages across
most of the eastern U.S., although overnight lows could end up
being milder than usual owing to more cloud cover and humidity.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 22 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...There is a Slight Risk of severe storms from the Northeast to
the Mid-Atlantic through Monday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Central Gulf Coast, Tennessee Valley, and the Southeast...

...Snow over portions of the Northern/Central Rockies...

On Sunday night, a front extending from the Northeast to the
Central/Western Gulf Coast will move eastward off the Northeast
and Mid-Atlantic Coast by Monday. Showers and thunderstorms will
develop along and ahead of the boundary through Monday. In
addition, the front and moisture pooling along the boundary will
destabilize the atmosphere. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Northeast to the
Mid-Atlantic through Monday morning. The hazards associated with
these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

In addition, heavy rain develops along the boundary from the
Northeast to the Central Gulf Coast. Therefore, the WPC has issued
a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms
from the Northeast to the Central Gulf Coast through Monday
morning. The associated heavy rain will create localized areas of
flash flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with
heavy rain. However, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall over portions of the Central Gulf Coast through Monday
morning. The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized
areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small
streams the most vulnerable.

On Monday, the front lingers over the southern Mid-Atlantic,
extending westward to the Central Gulf Coast and Southern Rockies.
Showers and thunderstorms will continue over the Mid-Atlantic to
the Southeast/Central Gulf Coast. There will also be a Marginal
Risk of severe thunderstorms over the southern Mid-Atlantic and
the Southeast on Monday into Tuesday morning. Furthermore,
upper-level energy moving across the Southeast will trigger heavy
rain on Monday. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over Central Gulf
Coast, Southeast, and Southern Appalachians on Monday into Tuesday
morning.

Additionally, moisture will surge northward over the Southern
Plains into the Central Plains as upper-level impulses will move
across the region on Monday to trigger showers and thunderstorms.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains from Monday
through Tuesday morning. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Moreover, the energy will also produce areas of heavy rain on
Monday. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall with these thunderstorms over south-central Texas and a
second area over central Kansas into Oklahoma and parts of the
Texas Panhandle on Monday into Tuesday morning. The associated
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.

On Tuesday, a wave of low pressure over the western end of the
front will move from the Southern Rockies into the Southern
Plains. The system will produce showers and thunderstorms over
parts of the Southern Plains. Therefore, the SPC issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains on
Tuesday. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes. The storms will also produce heavy rain over the
region. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Southern/Central Plains and the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley on Tuesday. The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy will aid in developing rain with
embedded thunderstorms and higher elevation snow over parts of the
Northern/Central Rockies on Sunday evening into Monday morning.
Additionally, Monday, rain will develop over parts of the
Northern/Central Plains. Overnight Monday, rain and higher
elevation snow will return to parts of the Northern/Central
Rockies, with rain continuing over the Northern/Central Plains.
The rain will expand into parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley
on Tuesday.

Furthermore, on Monday, a front will move onshore over the Pacific
Northwest, moving inland to the Northern High Plains/Northern
Rockies by Tuesday. Light rain will develop over parts of the
Pacific Northwest, with pockets of snow developing over the
highest elevations overnight Monday. The rain ends over the
Pacific Northwest by Tuesday morning. Rain will continue over
parts of the Northern Intermountain Region on Tuesday.

Elsewhere, there are two areas of Critical Fire Weather Risk over
parts of the Southwest, Southern Rockies, and the Great Basin on
Sunday into Monday morning. The fire weather threat lessens on
Monday with an Elevated Risk over parts of the Southwest and
Southern Rockies.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1248 AM CDT Mon May 23 2022

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will increase this afternoon across parts of
the Southwest and southern High Plains, driven by both dry/windy
conditions and the potential for isolated dry thunderstorms.
Early-morning satellite imagery shows evidence of broad-scale ascent
over the High Plains ahead of an approaching upper-level disturbance
(currently over northern Mexico). The overall upper-level pattern is
forecast amplify over the next 24 hours, which will support the
development of a surface cyclone over the southern High Plains and
increase thunderstorm chances east of the Rockies.

...Southwest...
Modest pressure falls are noted at several surface stations across
NM and adjacent areas of TX, CO, and OK. This trend will continue
through the day as a surface low deepens over the southern High
Plains, augmenting pressure-gradient winds in the process. Ensemble
guidance maintains reasonably high probability for 15-20 mph winds
with RH values falling into the 10-15% range by mid afternoon. As
such, widespread elevated conditions are expected from northern and
eastern AZ into central NM. Areas of critical conditions are
possible, especially along the I-25 corridor in southern NM where
the potential for sustained 20+ mph winds is highest based on
drier/windier solutions. However, spread in deterministic guidance
and poor fuel loading across the desert terrain limit confidence in
sustaining widespread critical conditions. Confidence in the
coverage and duration of the wind-driven fire weather threat is also
limited across northern NM due to the potential for widespread
clouds and scattered showers.

...Southern High Plains/Dry Thunderstorms...
00 UTC soundings across NM and TX reveal the onset of low to
mid-level moisture return into the region. This trend will continue
for the next 24 hours with PWAT values between 0.5 to 1.0 expected
across central NM to west TX by this afternoon. Thunderstorms
developing off the terrain of the southern Rockies will likely
mature within this moisture gradient and over a region with
receptive fuels. Dry sub-cloud layers and fast (25-30 knot) storm
motions will support a dry-lightning threat with initial
thunderstorm activity. Rainfall rates will intensify as storms move
to the east into the better moisture, so the spatial extent of the
dry lightning potential may be limited to a narrow strip across
eastern NM into far southeast CO.

...Heavy rain and flash flooding possible over portions of the
Southeast and Southern Plains today...

...Increasingly warm/hot with fire conditions for the Sacramento
Valley early this week...

A slowing cold front over the Southeast will become stationary
during the day today as an area of low pressure rides along it
through Alabama and Georgia. With plenty of moisture out of the
eastern Gulf of Mexico, showers and some embedded thunderstorms
will produce areas of heavy rain that could lead to runoff and/or
flash flooding concerns, especially over urban areas. Rainfall
will spread northeastward through the southern Appalachians and
into the Carolinas into a cooler air mass north of the boundary.
There, temperatures will be below normal in a stark change to the
past few days where many record highs were observed. Highs will
only be in the 60s and 70s from the Upper Midwest through the
Great Lakes and into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast today which is
about 5-10 degrees below normal. Farther west, even cooler
temperatures are expected over the Central Plains where highs may
only reach into the low to mid 50s with periods of rain. Over
Texas and Oklahoma, increasing moisture into an unstable air mass
will favor showers and thunderstorms, some of which may be severe
and also could produce locally heavy rainfall.

On Tuesday, the stationary boundary over the southern Rockies/Four
Corners will finally move eastward as an area of low pressure
organizes over the Texas Panhandle. Severe weather is again a
possibility over Texas, but shifted eastward toward the
Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Rainfall will expand eastward as
well, with a heavy rain/flash flooding threat extending from
eastern Texas northward to the southern Missouri River Valley.
Temperatures will again be well below normal over the Central
Plains, remaining in the 50s. With high pressure slipping eastward
through the Northeast, areas of the Mid-Atlantic may see a cool
day with showers on northeasterly winds off the still cold
Atlantic Ocean. Over California, temperatures will start to warm
in earnest on Tuesday, rising to around 100F in the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. With dry air in place over the region,
relative humidity values will be quite low. Modest to strong winds
will increase fire conditions for the region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
255 AM EDT Mon May 23 2022

Valid 12Z Thu May 26 2022 - 12Z Mon May 30 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A large scale upper trough will be crossing the east-central U.S.
through the end of the work week, and this will sustain a surface
cold front that will track eastward and should exit the East Coast
by Friday afternoon, with a weak surface high following for the
weekend.  Another trough enters the northwestern U.S. by the end
of the week with an upper ridge briefly building in ahead of it
across the Intermountain West and Rockies, and this trough will
spur surface cyclogenesis across the High Plains by next weekend,
although probably weaker than the one that will be in place for
the beginning to middle of this week.  By next Monday, an upper
ridge builds back in across the eastern U.S. along with warmer
temperatures.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite is initially in good synoptic scale
agreement on Thursday across the majority of the nation.  However,
noteworthy differences in the guidance appear as early as Thursday
night and into Friday with the eventual evolution of the trough
reaching the East Coast.  The 18Z GFS differed considerably from
its earlier 12Z run with a much slower solution with a closed low
developing, whereas the 12Z model consensus was more progressive
and generally did not close off the low.  At the time of the
fronts/pressures preparation, the 12Z GFS was substituted for the
18Z since the earlier run had more ensemble support.  Going
forward to the 00Z cycle, the UKMET and CMC trended more amplified
and slower across the Ohio Valley, and the large model changes
from earlier cycles lowers forecast confidence Friday and into the
weekend for the eastern states.  The 00Z ECMWF trended only
slightly stronger, but overall more of an open wave and close to
its ensemble mean.  The WPC forecast initially started with a
multi-deterministic model blend through Friday, and then more of
the ensemble means while still maintaining some of the operational
GFS and ECMWF with a little less of the CMC.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Periods of heavy rainfall will continue to make weather headlines
going into Thursday across portions of the Southeast, with a
couple inches of rain likely for parts of the southern
Appalachians.  This region is forecast to get heavy rainfall
through the middle of this week as well, thus the ground will
likely be saturated and increases the potential for flooding.  A
Slight Risk area in the Day 4 experimental excessive rainfall
outlook is now in effect from far northern Georgia to southwestern
North Carolina where the best orographic forcing will be present
in a moist environment.  Late week into next weekend, the front
moving inland across the northwestern U.S. and eventually the
central/northern Plains is expected to bring some showers and
thunderstorms (and perhaps some late May mountain snows) from the
Pacific Northwest to the Northern Rockies.  Storms should emerge
over the central/northern Plains to the Upper Midwest next weekend
as the low progresses eastward.

In terms of temperatures, pleasantly cool conditions can be
expected across much of the Midwest and Great Lakes region in the
wake of the cold front for the end of the week, followed by a
warm-up with above normal highs returning by the weekend across
much of the Plains, with 90s likely as far north as central
Nebraska, and even some low 100s for portions of western Texas.
Hot weather is also expected for the lower elevations of the
Desert Southwest for Thursday through the weekend as an upper
level ridge is expected to be in place, although a cooling trend
will commence for the inland valleys of central California.
Elsewhere, expect highs to generally be within 5 degrees of
climatological averages across most of the eastern U.S. through
Saturday, although overnight lows could end up being milder than
usual owing to more cloud cover and humidity.  Heat returns to
much of the Northeast U.S. and Ohio Valley by early next week as
the upper ridge builds back in.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
255 AM EDT Mon May 23 2022

Valid 12Z Thu May 26 2022 - 12Z Mon May 30 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A large scale upper trough will be crossing the east-central U.S.
through the end of the work week, and this will sustain a surface
cold front that will track eastward and should exit the East Coast
by Friday afternoon, with a weak surface high following for the
weekend.  Another trough enters the northwestern U.S. by the end
of the week with an upper ridge briefly building in ahead of it
across the Intermountain West and Rockies, and this trough will
spur surface cyclogenesis across the High Plains by next weekend,
although probably weaker than the one that will be in place for
the beginning to middle of this week.  By next Monday, an upper
ridge builds back in across the eastern U.S. along with warmer
temperatures.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite is initially in good synoptic scale
agreement on Thursday across the majority of the nation.  However,
noteworthy differences in the guidance appear as early as Thursday
night and into Friday with the eventual evolution of the trough
reaching the East Coast.  The 18Z GFS differed considerably from
its earlier 12Z run with a much slower solution with a closed low
developing, whereas the 12Z model consensus was more progressive
and generally did not close off the low.  At the time of the
fronts/pressures preparation, the 12Z GFS was substituted for the
18Z since the earlier run had more ensemble support.  Going
forward to the 00Z cycle, the UKMET and CMC trended more amplified
and slower across the Ohio Valley, and the large model changes
from earlier cycles lowers forecast confidence Friday and into the
weekend for the eastern states.  The 00Z ECMWF trended only
slightly stronger, but overall more of an open wave and close to
its ensemble mean.  The WPC forecast initially started with a
multi-deterministic model blend through Friday, and then more of
the ensemble means while still maintaining some of the operational
GFS and ECMWF with a little less of the CMC.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Periods of heavy rainfall will continue to make weather headlines
going into Thursday across portions of the Southeast, with a
couple inches of rain likely for parts of the southern
Appalachians.  This region is forecast to get heavy rainfall
through the middle of this week as well, thus the ground will
likely be saturated and increases the potential for flooding.  A
Slight Risk area in the Day 4 experimental excessive rainfall
outlook is now in effect from far northern Georgia to southwestern
North Carolina where the best orographic forcing will be present
in a moist environment.  Late week into next weekend, the front
moving inland across the northwestern U.S. and eventually the
central/northern Plains is expected to bring some showers and
thunderstorms (and perhaps some late May mountain snows) from the
Pacific Northwest to the Northern Rockies.  Storms should emerge
over the central/northern Plains to the Upper Midwest next weekend
as the low progresses eastward.

In terms of temperatures, pleasantly cool conditions can be
expected across much of the Midwest and Great Lakes region in the
wake of the cold front for the end of the week, followed by a
warm-up with above normal highs returning by the weekend across
much of the Plains, with 90s likely as far north as central
Nebraska, and even some low 100s for portions of western Texas.
Hot weather is also expected for the lower elevations of the
Desert Southwest for Thursday through the weekend as an upper
level ridge is expected to be in place, although a cooling trend
will commence for the inland valleys of central California.
Elsewhere, expect highs to generally be within 5 degrees of
climatological averages across most of the eastern U.S. through
Saturday, although overnight lows could end up being milder than
usual owing to more cloud cover and humidity.  Heat returns to
much of the Northeast U.S. and Ohio Valley by early next week as
the upper ridge builds back in.

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA INTO CENTRAL NEW
MEXICO AND FAR SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
Strengthening winds across the southwestern CONUS will result in
increasing fire weather concerns from the Four Corners into the
southern High Plains Tuesday afternoon. An overall amplification of
the current upper-level flow regime is expected heading into the
middle of the work week, as a strong northwesterly jet begins to
dive into the southern U.S. The approach of the upper jet will act
to deepen a surface low across the southern High Plains, which will
not only augment the regional pressure gradient, but also support a
southward surge of a modest cold front across the OK/TX Panhandles
and northeast NM. The resultant surface pattern will see strong
northwesterly flow across much of the Four Corners and Southwest,
but also an upslope flow regime across northeast NM/southern CO that
will support thunderstorm development late in the afternoon.

...Four Corners/Southwest...
The deepening surface low across southeast NM/southwest TX will
support sustained winds between 15-25 mph across a broad stretch of
the Four Corners/Southwest region. Flow within the 850-700 mb layer
will be stronger compared to previous days, which will support a
higher potential for sustained critical conditions across a broad
area. Short- and medium-range ensemble guidance reflects this idea
with fairly high probabilities for 20+ mph winds and 5-15% RH across
far eastern AZ into central NM Tuesday afternoon. A few locations
may experience brief periods of extremely critical conditions as
winds gust to 30-35 mph with RH values below 10% during peak daytime
heating. The fire weather across the Trans Pecos and Big Bend region
of southwest TX is somewhat conditional due to the potential for
wetting rainfall early Tuesday morning. Elevated conditions are
likely for these regions Tuesday afternoon, and an expansion may be
warranted depending on precipitation totals by Tuesday morning.

...Sacramento Valley...
The north to northwesterly flow regime over northern CA will support
adiabatic drying and warming through the Sacramento Valley Tuesday
afternoon. Ensemble guidance suggests wind speeds will generally be
stronger than previous days due to the better flow aloft. Afternoon
minimum RH values are forecast to fall into the low to mid teens
once again, supporting at least elevated fire weather conditions.

...Northeast New Mexico/Dry Thunderstorms...
Despite some degree of convective overturning during the prior 24
hours, mid-level lapse rates along the eastern Rockies are forecast
to remain somewhat steep (near 7 C/km). Residual boundary-layer
moisture is forecast to remain in place and support upwards of
500-1000 J/kg MUCAPE across the High Plains by Tuesday afternoon.
Thunderstorms initiating within the post-frontal upslope-flow regime
will likely reside on the periphery of the richer boundary-layer
moisture with PWAT values near 0.5 inches. While the dry sub-cloud
layer will be somewhat shallow, the limited moisture available for
initial thunderstorms and 20-30 knot storm motions will support a
dry-lightning potential. Fuels across northeast NM and far southern
CO are currently critically dry, and should remain so barring
wetting rainfall late Monday into early Tuesday.

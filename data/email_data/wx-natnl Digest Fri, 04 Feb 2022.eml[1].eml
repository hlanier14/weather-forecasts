.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1235 AM CST Thu Feb 03 2022/

...Synopsis...
Cold and wintry conditions will persist across the central and
southern CONUS as a longwave mid-level trough continues to meander
across the central U.S. today. Persistent surface high pressure
across the Interior West will continue to support a pressure
gradient and associated offshore flow across California. However,
fuels across this region remain moist, so significant
wildfire-spread conditions are not anticipated.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
130 PM EST Thu Feb 03 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Feb 06 2022 - 12Z Thu Feb 10 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period starts out Sunday with broad troughing
across much of the CONUS, sandwiched between a building east
Pacific ridge and a retreating ridge into the west-central
Atlantic. Within the mean flow, several northern and southern
stream shortwaves will act to reinforce the trough, allowing it to
persist across the eastern two-thirds of the nation well into next
week as the eastern Pacific upper ridge strengthens over the West.
This pattern should keep the majority of the U.S. mostly dry and
very quiet during the period, with no significant weather related
impacts expected.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest guidance continues to show enough agreement during the
day 3-5 (Sunday-Tuesday) time period for a general deterministic
model blend. During this time, an elongated mean trough from the
Upper Midwest to Southwest will split into a northern stream
shortwave through the Northeast, and a southern stream shortwave
into the Southern Plains, with a third shortwave rounding the top
of the east Pacific ridge and dropping into the northern Rockies.
After this, some significant run to run variability in details and
timing of individual systems begins to creep in, including the
southern stream shortwave moving through the Southeast and modest
cyclogenesis off the East Coast. The most notable difference at
this time involves the evolution of shortwave activity that slides
down the western U.S. ridge toward the end of the forecast period,
so went with an ensemble blend for days 6-7 (Wednesday-Thursday).
12z guidance was fairly similar to overnight runs, although do
note the 12z GFS came in slightly faster progressing southern
stream shortwaves compared to previous runs. In general however,
the forecast retains good overall continuity from the overnight
medium range forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Much of the CONUS should be uneventful and mostly dry through
early next week at least in terms of any notable weather threats.
Periodic shower activity is possible across the Southeast as
eastward propagating shortwave trough activity spins up a few
modest offshore frontal waves, with some return flow out of the
Gulf of Mexico able to support light showers along the western and
central Gulf coast by the middle of next week. Elsewhere, northern
tier systems may bring periods of light and scattered snow from
the upper Midwest to Great Lakes while mostly light rain/mountain
snow should accompany a couple of systems brushing the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies.

Much below normal temperatures, with daytime highs 10-15 degrees
below normal, will moderate but continue into early next week from
parts of Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest.
Lows in the teens over parts of the Southern Plains could
challenge a record or two on Sunday. On the contrary, much of the
West into the northern/central Plains should trend warmer during
the medium range, under the influence of the eastern Pacific ridge
building well inland. The warmest anomalies are expected over the
northern/central Plains on Monday and Tuesday, where daytime highs
near 20 degrees above average will be welcome relief after a very
cold short range period.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
130 PM EST Thu Feb 03 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Feb 06 2022 - 12Z Thu Feb 10 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period starts out Sunday with broad troughing
across much of the CONUS, sandwiched between a building east
Pacific ridge and a retreating ridge into the west-central
Atlantic. Within the mean flow, several northern and southern
stream shortwaves will act to reinforce the trough, allowing it to
persist across the eastern two-thirds of the nation well into next
week as the eastern Pacific upper ridge strengthens over the West.
This pattern should keep the majority of the U.S. mostly dry and
very quiet during the period, with no significant weather related
impacts expected.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest guidance continues to show enough agreement during the
day 3-5 (Sunday-Tuesday) time period for a general deterministic
model blend. During this time, an elongated mean trough from the
Upper Midwest to Southwest will split into a northern stream
shortwave through the Northeast, and a southern stream shortwave
into the Southern Plains, with a third shortwave rounding the top
of the east Pacific ridge and dropping into the northern Rockies.
After this, some significant run to run variability in details and
timing of individual systems begins to creep in, including the
southern stream shortwave moving through the Southeast and modest
cyclogenesis off the East Coast. The most notable difference at
this time involves the evolution of shortwave activity that slides
down the western U.S. ridge toward the end of the forecast period,
so went with an ensemble blend for days 6-7 (Wednesday-Thursday).
12z guidance was fairly similar to overnight runs, although do
note the 12z GFS came in slightly faster progressing southern
stream shortwaves compared to previous runs. In general however,
the forecast retains good overall continuity from the overnight
medium range forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Much of the CONUS should be uneventful and mostly dry through
early next week at least in terms of any notable weather threats.
Periodic shower activity is possible across the Southeast as
eastward propagating shortwave trough activity spins up a few
modest offshore frontal waves, with some return flow out of the
Gulf of Mexico able to support light showers along the western and
central Gulf coast by the middle of next week. Elsewhere, northern
tier systems may bring periods of light and scattered snow from
the upper Midwest to Great Lakes while mostly light rain/mountain
snow should accompany a couple of systems brushing the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies.

Much below normal temperatures, with daytime highs 10-15 degrees
below normal, will moderate but continue into early next week from
parts of Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest.
Lows in the teens over parts of the Southern Plains could
challenge a record or two on Sunday. On the contrary, much of the
West into the northern/central Plains should trend warmer during
the medium range, under the influence of the eastern Pacific ridge
building well inland. The warmest anomalies are expected over the
northern/central Plains on Monday and Tuesday, where daytime highs
near 20 degrees above average will be welcome relief after a very
cold short range period.

Large-scale mid-level cyclonic flow will continue to dominate the
CONUS through tomorrow/Friday, with surface high pressure and
associated cold conditions persisting across the Interior West into
the central and eastern CONUS. Significant wildfire-spread potential
will remain negligible across the CONUS. While dry offshore flow is
expected to continue across southern California, relatively moist
fuels should inhibit significant wildfire growth.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu February 03 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 09 - 13 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting a moderately
amplified 500-hPa flow pattern across the forecast domain. Cyclonic flow is
generally forecast to dominate most of North America with two distinct trou=
ghs
featured within the broader flow. The first is a broad northern stream trou=
gh
predicted across east-central North America, extending from north of Hudson
Bay
southward to the Gulf Coast with forecast below normal heights over the
central
and eastern CONUS, except for the Northeast where above normal heights are
forecast. The second trough is a shortwave located over the southwestern
CONUS,
associated with a very strong ridge predicted upstream just off the Pacific
Northwest Coast. Upstream mean troughing is forecast to persist over the
western Aleutians and much of the Bering Sea, leading to predicted below
normal
heights for much of Alaska excluding the Panhandle and southeastern Mainlan=
d.

Below normal temperatures are favored for much of western Alaska associated
with a trough forecast over the Bering Strait in the period. Above normal
temperatures are likely for parts of southeastern Alaska, as well as the
western CONUS due to the predicted ridge over the eastern North Pacific.
Toughing forecast over the southwestern and south-central CONUS favors
increased chances of below normal temperatures for the Central and Southern
Rockies and parts of the Southern Plains. Above normal temperature
probabilities are enhanced for the Northern and Central Plains, due to the
potential for downslope flow. Near to above normal temperatures are favored
for
the Northeast, consistent with a moderating trend associated with positive =
500
hPa height anomalies. Conversely, near and below normal temperatures are
favored from the Great Lakes to the remainder of the eastern CONUS.

The combination of the trough predicted over the Bering Strait and the ridg=
e
forecast over the eastern North Pacific favors enhanced southwesterly flow =
and
an active pattern across much of Alaska. Therefore, enhanced odds of above
normal precipitation are indicated across most of the state. A drier than
normal pattern is favored across much of the western CONUS, downstream of t=
he
Pacific ridge. Below normal precipitation is most likely from the Central a=
nd
Southern Plains eastward to much of the eastern CONUS, associated with mean
surface high pressure. Conversely, weak disturbances may affect parts of th=
e
Northern Plains and western Great Lakes, leading to slightly elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 11 - 17 2022

During the week-2 period, the overall 500-hPa flow pattern across western
North
America is likely to be dominated by very strong ridging predicted over the
eastern North Pacific. This ridge is forecast to continue strengthening and=
 to
retrograde, leading to height rises for much of southern Alaska. Farther to
the
east, mid-level low pressure is forecast near the Davis Strait, with a broa=
d
area of predicted below normal heights stretching across much of the easter=
n
CONUS.

Above normal temperatures are likely for eastern Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, near the predicted ridge over the eastern North Pacific.
Conversely,
below normal temperatures are favored for western Alaska, associated with a
trough forecast over the Bering Strait during the period. Near to above nor=
mal
temperatures are favored for the western CONUS, consistent with above norma=
l
500 hPa height anomalies. Above normal temperature probabilities are slight=
ly
enhanced for parts of the Northern and Central Plains due to the potential =
for
downslope flow.  As a mean trough is forecast across the central and easter=
n
CONUS, below normal temperatures are favored for parts of the Central and
Southern Plains, Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and the eastern CONUS.

An active pattern is likely to continue into week-2 across much of Alaska
underneath enhanced southwesterly mid-level flow, leading to elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation for most of the state. Below
normal
precipitation is most likely across the western CONUS, associated with stro=
ng
ridging forecast off the West Coast. As a shortwave trough is forecast acro=
ss
the Southwest and Southern Plains, above normal precipitation is favored ov=
er
the Northern Rockies and parts of the Northern and Central Plains. Converse=
ly,
below normal precipitation is favored from parts of the Central and Souther=
n
Plains, eastward across the Gulf Coast and Lower Mississippi Valley to the
Mid-Atlantic States. Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for the
Great Lakes and parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley associated with a me=
an
trough forecast over east-central North America.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern, off=
set
by some disagreement among the temperature tools.


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 17.

...An ongoing significant winter storm is expected to impact much
of the central and northeastern U.S. through Friday night...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Central Gulf Coast, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast through Friday
morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Gulf Coast, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast through
Friday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees below average west of the
Great Lakes and Mississippi River; Temperatures will be 10 to 25
degrees above average along parts of the East Coast...

A strong cold front extending from the Northeast to the Central
Gulf Coast will move eastward off most of the East Coast by
Saturday morning. The front producing a broad prolonged
significant winter storm will shift into the Northeast Thursday
night with heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain. The freezing rain
over the Mid-South will progress northeastward into the Northeast
Thursday evening, where significant ice accumulation is possible
from central Pennsylvania eastward into the Catskills in New York.
The snow/rain/freezing rain could make for difficult travel
conditions along with some power outages and tree damage. Heavy
snow totals are expected from the Lower Great Lakes through much
of interior New York state eastward into central and northern New
England, where snowfall rates could exceed 1-2 inches per hour
overnight into early Friday. Locations impacted by snow and/or ice
from this storm will experience below-freezing temperatures into
the weekend.

Furthermore, showers and thunderstorms will develop along and
ahead of the front over parts of the Central Gulf Coast, Tennessee
Valley, and Southeast. As a result, the SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over the region through Friday
morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes. The severe thunderstorm risk will reduce to
Marginal Risk over parts of the Southeast Coast on Friday.

Moreover, heavy rain will develop along the boundary. Therefore,
the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with the
rain over parts of the Central Gulf Coast, Tennessee Valley, and
Southeast through Friday morning. The associated heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams the most impacted. On Friday, the threat
of excessive rainfall is over.

However, a frigid air mass will be over the Plains in the front's
wake. As a result, high temperatures for many places across the
Plains and Mississippi Valley will be between 10 to 25 degrees
below average west of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River.
Therefore, the public is encouraged to plan for prolonged
hazardous winter weather conditions and disrupted travel. In
contrast, temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average
along the East Coast into Friday morning ahead of the front.

Furthermore, upper-level energy and weak onshore flow will aid in
producing coastal rain and higher elevation snow over the Pacific
Northwest and light snow over the Northern Intermountain Region
into the Northern/Central Rockies through Saturday morning. A
fast-moving front over the Northern High Plains will move eastward
to the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes on Friday and
dissipate overnight Friday. The system will produce light snow
over parts of the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley
Thursday evening into the Upper Great Lakes through Friday evening.

In addition, a second stronger low will develop along the front
over the Northern Plains on Saturday and move into the Upper
Mississippi Valley by Saturday evening. The system will produce
additional light snow over parts of the Northern Plains into the
Upper Great Lakes by Saturday evening.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 03 2022

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast to strengthen and expand
northwest from the CONUS West Coast to Alaska during mid-February. This wou=
ld
lead to a drier-than-normal pattern for western North America, with an
expected
lack of significant storms in the remainder of the CONUS until late in week=
-2.
Below-normal temperatures initially in parts of Alaska will also slowly
moderate and lift out as the mid-level high pressure expands westward into =
the
state. This pattern would also bring anomalous cold into parts of the centr=
al
and eastern CONUS that slowly drifts eastward and moderates later in the
period.



HAZARDS

Slight risk of high winds for the Northern Great Plains, Fri, Feb 11.

Slight risk of high winds for southern California, Fri, Feb 11.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for western Alaska, Fri-Mon, =
Feb
11-14.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for the Midwest and Ohio Vall=
ey,
Fri-Tue, Feb 11-15.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY FEBRUARY 06 - THURSDAY FEBRUARY 10:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!t1mK_CVCFxndQparG7IPLq_ivgh-73aI_ixxR-8dx4ahbUZj4Da17AgaCWjNR=

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 11 - THURSDAY FEBRUARY 17: The GFS and ECMWF ensemble
means
have converged on the mean longwave pattern during week-2, with that a flat=
,
broad ridge initially along the West Coast transitioning to a sharper, more
amplified ridge over the northeast Pacific and Alaska. Downstream over cent=
ral
and eastern North America, a 500-hPa trough is expected to amplify in conce=
rt,
and extend southward into the eastern half of the CONUS. This longwave patt=
ern
results in a relatively dry pattern for much of the lower 48 with an
increasing
chance that anomalous cold returns to the central and/or eastern CONUS duri=
ng
mid-February.



But considering the agreement in the mean longwave pattern over North Ameri=
ca,
the GEFS and European ensembles have significant differences in the locatio=
n,
timing, and magnitude of potential hazards during week-2. The GEFS brings
colder air into the eastern half of the country more quickly than yesterday=
,
and shows much greater chances for much below normal temperatures, especial=
ly
early week-2. The European ensembles bring below normal temperatures into t=
he
eastern CONUS more slowly, and with lower chances for extreme values. On da=
ys
8
and 9, The GEFS depicts 40 to 60 percent chances for much below normal
temperatures over the Great Lakes region and adjacent parts of the upper
Midwest and the Northeast. Meanwhile, the European ensembles show no enhanc=
ed
chances for significantly colder than normal conditions. As week-2 progress=
es,
the GEFS and European ensembles come into better agreement, with the GEFS
showing enhanced chances for much below normal temperatures shifting eastwa=
rd
and decreasing in likelihood while the European ensembles bring modestly
enhanced chances for much below normal temperatures into the same region at
that time. Both model suites show moderating temperatures into the eastern
CONUS toward the end of week-2.



Farther north, the GEFS and European ensembles also show inconsistent chanc=
es
for much below normal temperatures in Alaska. Here, the European ensembles =
are
pointing toward better chances of more extreme temperatures than the GEFS.
Both
have enhanced chances for much below normal temperatures along the western
tier
of the state to start week-2, but the European ensembles show much greater
chances for extreme temperatures, and extend those chances eastward across =
the
Alaskan interior to the Canadian border. At the same time, GEFS shows more
moderately enhanced chances for extreme temperatures, and restricts them to
the
western tier of the state. The Week-2 Hazards map restricts the enhanced
chances for much below normal temperatures to western Alaska where both mod=
el
suites show some increase in the likelihood for unusually cold weather,
expanding the area slightly eastward from where the GEFS highlights chances
for
unusually cold weather. As in the eastern CONUS, both model suites reduce
chances for much below normal temperatures toward the end of week-2.



A northern stream shortwave trough with associated downsloping surface flow
supports a slight risk of high winds (gusts above 40mph) for the Northern a=
nd
Central Great Plains on Feb 11, with both the GEFS and European ensembles
showing mildly enhanced chances for strong winds.  Good model agreement and
continuity continues among the ensemble means early week-2 with surface hig=
h
pressure centered over the Great Basin. This surface pattern elevates the
chances of a Santa Ana wind event across southern California where a slight
risk of high winds is posted on Feb 11. Following a wet December, little to=
 no
precipitation was observed throughout southern California during January wh=
ich
may have led to a recent drying of fuels.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
333 PM EST Thu Feb 03 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Feb 06 2022 - 12Z Thu Feb 10 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period starts out Sunday with broad troughing
across much of the CONUS, sandwiched between a building east
Pacific ridge and a retreating ridge into the west-central
Atlantic. Within the mean flow, several northern and southern
stream shortwaves will act to reinforce the trough, allowing it to
persist across the eastern two-thirds of the nation well into next
week as the eastern Pacific upper ridge strengthens over the West.
This pattern should keep the majority of the U.S. mostly dry and
very quiet during the period, with no significant weather related
impacts expected.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest guidance continues to show enough agreement during the
day 3-5 (Sunday-Tuesday) time period for a general deterministic
model blend. During this time, an elongated mean trough from the
Upper Midwest to Southwest will split into a northern stream
shortwave through the Northeast, and a southern stream shortwave
into the Southern Plains, with a third shortwave rounding the top
of the east Pacific ridge and dropping into the northern Rockies.
After this, some significant run to run variability in details and
timing of individual systems begins to creep in, including the
southern stream shortwave moving through the Southeast and modest
cyclogenesis off the East Coast. The most notable difference at
this time involves the evolution of shortwave activity that slides
down the western U.S. ridge toward the end of the forecast period,
so went with an ensemble blend for days 6-7 (Wednesday-Thursday).
12z guidance was fairly similar to overnight runs, although do
note the 12z GFS came in slightly faster progressing southern
stream shortwaves compared to previous runs. In general however,
the forecast retains good overall continuity from the overnight
medium range forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Much of the CONUS should be uneventful and mostly dry through
early next week at least in terms of any notable weather threats.
Periodic shower activity is possible across the Southeast as
eastward propagating shortwave trough activity spins up a few
modest offshore frontal waves, with some return flow out of the
Gulf of Mexico able to support light showers along the western and
central Gulf coast by the middle of next week. Elsewhere, northern
tier systems may bring periods of light and scattered snow from
the upper Midwest to Great Lakes while mostly light rain/mountain
snow should accompany a couple of systems brushing the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies.

Much below normal temperatures, with daytime highs 10-15 degrees
below normal, will moderate but continue into early next week from
parts of Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest.
Lows in the teens over parts of the Southern Plains could
challenge a record or two on Sunday. On the contrary, much of the
West into the northern/central Plains should trend warmer during
the medium range, under the influence of the eastern Pacific ridge
building well inland. The warmest anomalies are expected over the
northern/central Plains on Monday and Tuesday, where daytime highs
near 20 degrees above average will be welcome relief after a very
cold short range period.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
153 AM EST Fri Feb 4 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 7 2022 - 12Z Fri Feb 11 2022

...Overview...

The overall theme for this forecast period will be a West Coast
ridge and broad cyclonic flow aloft over the eastern half of the
nation, with multiple northern stream shortwaves/clipper systems
reinforcing the trough for much of next week, and a surface low
developing off the East Coast through Tuesday.  An anomalous
closed upper high evolves just off the West Coast for the second
half of next week as part of a +PNA pattern, and this favors a
broad trough east of the Rockies with mainly dry conditions for
most locations.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest deterministic model guidance and ensemble means are
generally in above average agreement through the first half of the
week, with some minor timing differences noted with the individual
shortwaves east of the Rockies.  The 00Z GFS trended more
amplified with a shortwave approaching the East Coast along with a
secondary wave of low pressure that is not well supported by the
other guidance, whereas the 18Z GFS was more in line with the
latest ECMWF and CMC.  By the end of the week, the latest GFS is
quite strong with a closed low over the Great Lakes region and
does not have as much ensemble support as the 18Z GFS does.  The
ECMWF is also a bit farther east with the ridge axis across the
western U.S. by the end of the forecast period compared to the
CMC/GFS, but otherwise in line with the ensemble means across the
central/eastern U.S.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily derived from a
multi-deterministic (including 18Z GFS) through Tuesday night,
before incorporating more of the ensemble means for the second
half of the week.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A developing low pressure system off the North Carolina coast
early in the week is likely to be close enough to produce a cold
rain across eastern portions of the Mid-Atlantic region and the
Carolinas through early Tuesday, with the potential for a
rain/snow mix on the northwestern edge of this precipitation.
This may also clip eastern New England depending on the eventual
track of the surface low, so this event will continued to be
monitored for future trends, and this forecast cycle has trended
slightly upward with QPF compared to yesterday.  Elsewhere across
the nation, mainly dry conditions are expected for most areas,
with the exception of some rain/mountain snow for western
Washington early in the week, and patchy areas of light rain/snow
across portions of the north-central U.S. and the Great Lakes
region in association with the clipper systems.

Temperatures are expected to generally be slightly below normal
across much of the south-central U.S. for the beginning of the
week, albeit on a moderating trend compared to the well below
average readings expected this weekend.  Readings across the
central and northern Plains are likely to be 10-20 degrees above
average, and near average for most of the East Coast region
through the middle of the week.  Above average temperatures can be
expected for the entire week for the West Coast region owing to
the large upper ridge in place across the eastern Pacific.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
153 AM EST Fri Feb 4 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 7 2022 - 12Z Fri Feb 11 2022

...Overview...

The overall theme for this forecast period will be a West Coast
ridge and broad cyclonic flow aloft over the eastern half of the
nation, with multiple northern stream shortwaves/clipper systems
reinforcing the trough for much of next week, and a surface low
developing off the East Coast through Tuesday.  An anomalous
closed upper high evolves just off the West Coast for the second
half of next week as part of a +PNA pattern, and this favors a
broad trough east of the Rockies with mainly dry conditions for
most locations.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest deterministic model guidance and ensemble means are
generally in above average agreement through the first half of the
week, with some minor timing differences noted with the individual
shortwaves east of the Rockies.  The 00Z GFS trended more
amplified with a shortwave approaching the East Coast along with a
secondary wave of low pressure that is not well supported by the
other guidance, whereas the 18Z GFS was more in line with the
latest ECMWF and CMC.  By the end of the week, the latest GFS is
quite strong with a closed low over the Great Lakes region and
does not have as much ensemble support as the 18Z GFS does.  The
ECMWF is also a bit farther east with the ridge axis across the
western U.S. by the end of the forecast period compared to the
CMC/GFS, but otherwise in line with the ensemble means across the
central/eastern U.S.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily derived from a
multi-deterministic (including 18Z GFS) through Tuesday night,
before incorporating more of the ensemble means for the second
half of the week.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A developing low pressure system off the North Carolina coast
early in the week is likely to be close enough to produce a cold
rain across eastern portions of the Mid-Atlantic region and the
Carolinas through early Tuesday, with the potential for a
rain/snow mix on the northwestern edge of this precipitation.
This may also clip eastern New England depending on the eventual
track of the surface low, so this event will continued to be
monitored for future trends, and this forecast cycle has trended
slightly upward with QPF compared to yesterday.  Elsewhere across
the nation, mainly dry conditions are expected for most areas,
with the exception of some rain/mountain snow for western
Washington early in the week, and patchy areas of light rain/snow
across portions of the north-central U.S. and the Great Lakes
region in association with the clipper systems.

Temperatures are expected to generally be slightly below normal
across much of the south-central U.S. for the beginning of the
week, albeit on a moderating trend compared to the well below
average readings expected this weekend.  Readings across the
central and northern Plains are likely to be 10-20 degrees above
average, and near average for most of the East Coast region
through the middle of the week.  Above average temperatures can be
expected for the entire week for the West Coast region owing to
the large upper ridge in place across the eastern Pacific.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 AM CST Fri Feb 04 2022

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential will be low across the eastern two-thirds of
the CONUS today as an arctic air mass remains entrenched.
Early-morning surface pressure analysis reveals a broad region of
high pressure from the inter-mountain West into the Plains in the
wake of a departing upper-level trough. While this will limit winds
across much of the central U.S., it will support strong offshore
flow for southern CA and breezy winds across southwest AZ.

...Southwest AZ...
A compact shortwave trough is noted in water-vapor imagery moving
southward along the West Coast, which will induce surface pressure
falls off the southern CA shore. Juxtaposed with the surface high to
the north/northeast, gradient winds will increase over the next
12-24 hours. Ensemble guidance shows relatively high probability for
15-20 mph winds, and RH values are expected to fall into the low to
mid teens. While ERC values are somewhat marginal, 10-hour fuel
moisture has fallen to 3-4% across the region after minimal rainfall
over the past week. This should support a low-end fire weather
threat for this afternoon.

...Coastal Southern CA...
The pressure gradient across southern CA is forecast to strengthen
through tonight as the aforementioned shortwave trough approaches
the region. Surface observations already show winds increasing to
30-40 mph, which should increase to 40-50 mph within the coastal
terrain by late morning. Downslope warming/drying will support RH
reductions into the low teens. While elevated to critical wind/RH
combinations appear likely, fuels remain largely unreceptive per
latest fuel guidance.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0129 AM CST Fri Feb 04 2022

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential remains low for Saturday due to cold
temperatures across the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS and
generally high fuel moisture. An upper-level trough, currently over
the northeast Pacific, is forecast to shift into the north-central
CONUS by late Saturday. This will help deepen a low over the
northern Plains that will induce breezy and warm conditions across
the central Plains. Elevated wind/RH conditions are possible across
parts of SD and NE, but low confidence in the RH forecast and
marginal fuel status mitigate a more robust threat.

Across southern California, offshore winds will continue into
Saturday, but may be weaker and more localized compared to Friday as
the regional pressure gradient slackens. Gusty winds up to 30-40 mph
will likely persist within the lee of higher terrain features with
pockets of RH values in the low teens. Localized elevated conditions
are likely, but fuels will likely remain too moist to support a more
robust threat.

...Major winter storm to produce heavy snow and treacherous ice
accumulations in the Northeast today; scattered showers and
thunderstorms possible in the Southeast...

...Bitterly cold temperatures ranging between 15 to 30 degrees
below average from the Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley, very
cold weekend in the Northeast...

...High winds expected in parts of the northern Rockies & Plains,
light snow accumulations possible in the Upper Midwest and
northern Great Lakes on Saturday...

The expansive major winter storm that has produced a myriad of
hazards over the last couple days, including but not limited to
heavy snow, crippling ice accumulations, flash flooding, and
severe weather will enter its third and final day before exiting
stage right into the Atlantic Ocean this weekend. More heavy snow
is forecast across northern New England today with the heaviest
accumulations in eastern Maine where over 6 inches of snowfall is
expected. A little farther south, where surface temperatures are
plummeting below freezing but milder temperatures at mid-levels of
the atmosphere are also present, an icy wintry mix is expected to
cause slick travel conditions for the morning commute from the
interior northern Mid-Atlantic to the more urbanized I-95 corridor
from Boston to New York City. Parts of central Massachusetts could
receive as much as a quarter inch of ice by the time the storm
exits off the coast this afternoon, while even parts of the
northern Mid-Atlantic could receive as much as a tenth of an inch
of ice accumulation. Light snow accumulations remain possible in
parts of the upper Ohio Valley this morning with bitterly cold
temperatures continuing to filter into the region throughout the
day. Farther south, scattered showers and thunderstorms are
possible from southeast Virginia to northern Florida with some
thunderstorms potentially becoming severe.

In wake of this week's massive winter storm, frigid temperatures
courtesy of a large dome of Arctic high pressure is becoming
firmly entrenched from the Rockies and throughout the Heartland
today. Morning lows ranging between the single digits and below
zero are anticipated up and down the Great Plains with the coldest
temperature anomalies located "Deep in the Heart of Texas".
Blustery winds combined with the abnormally cold temperatures have
prompted the issuance of Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories across
much of the Southern Plains. In fact, temperatures are so cold
that Winter Storm Warnings remain in place for parts of the Deep
South where lingering icy roads are still a concern for the Friday
morning commute. Scattered snow showers tracking through the
Mid-South may also lead to hazardous travel conditions this
morning. By Saturday morning, the troublesome winter storm finally
exits off the East Coast, but bitterly cold temperatures look to
stick around with some temperatures challenging record lows in the
South Central U.S.. Milder temperatures return to parts of the
North Central U.S. Saturday and Sunday, but the Arctic high then
slides over the eastern U.S. making for a frosty first weekend of
February in the northeast quarter of the Lower 48.

Elsewhere, the weekend weather pattern becomes more tranquil
thanks to a pair of large high pressure systems setting up shop
over the eastern third of the U.S. and along the West Coast.
Sandwiched in the middle is an upper level disturbance and an
associated low pressure system traversing the Northwest this
afternoon and reaching the Northern Plains by Saturday. Mountain
snow and valley/coastal rain are on tap for the Pacific Northwest
as well as strong winds in parts of Montana, leading to the
issuance of High Wind Warnings and Watches for parts of "Big Sky
Country" late Friday into early Saturday. Periods of snow are
expected from North Dakota and northern Minnesota Saturday morning
to the Upper Great Lakes Saturday night into Sunday morning. The
heaviest snow totals (exceeding 6 inches) are most likely in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Aside from some areas of mountain snow
in the northern Rockies and scattered showers in Florida, Saturday
appears mostly dry for the remainder of the country.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1128 AM CDT Tue Jun 15 2021

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHWEST MONTANA INTO
SOUTH-CENTRAL MONTANA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL NEVADA INTO
SOUTHWEST WYOMING AND SOUTHEAST IDAHO...

Morning guidance shows stronger winds across a broader area in the
Great Basin. Therefore, have expanded the critical area southwest to
the California border and northeast into southeast Idaho and
southwest Wyoming. In addition, made some minor modifications to the
elevated area on the northwestern edge based on the morning frontal
position.

..Bentley.. 06/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Tue Jun 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
A partial upper-level ridge breakdown is forecast to begin over the
next 24 hours across the central Rockies. Early morning water-vapor
imagery shows a high-amplitude ridge extending from the Four Corners
into southwest Canada with an approaching shortwave trough beginning
to move onshore across northern California. The progression of this
trough to the northeast will consolidate and deepen a surface low
over the northern Rockies by this afternoon with a trailing trough
extending southward into the Great Basin. The combination of
increasing surface pressure-gradient winds and the placement of a
belt of stronger mid-level flow over the region will introduce
robust fire weather threats to parts of the Great Basin and northern
Rockies. This synoptic pattern will also introduce regional concerns
to parts of California and the Arizona/New Mexico region.

...Northern Rockies and Great Basin...
Dry conditions persist across the region with early-morning RH
values only recovering into the teens and low 20s. Very hot
conditions are expected again today with widespread temperatures in
the 90s to low 100s, making single digit RH values near or below 5%
likely. Sustained winds are forecast to increase to 15-25 mph across
a broad swath of the Great Basin and northern Rockies. Portions of
eastern NV/western UT and southern to south-central MT appear to
have the highest probability for sustained critical conditions as
30-40 mph mid-level flow coincides with peak daytime heating and
maximum boundary-layer mixing over these regions. However, periodic
critical conditions will be possible within the broader elevated
risk area. A dry Pacific front is forecast to sweep eastward across
northern MT mid to late afternoon, bringing slight temperature
reductions a breezy west to northwesterly wind shift.

...California...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are expected
across Santa Barbara county in southern California as well as within
the San Joaquin basin in California's Central Valley. Sundowner
winds are already noted early this morning with 40-50 mph wind gusts
reported along the coastal hills of southern Santa Barbara county.
These are being driven by a 4-5 mb pressure gradient across the
county, which is forecast to remain in place through the day and
into tonight as high pressure builds to the north. Downslope effects
have reduced RH along the coast to 30-50% with additional reductions
expected this afternoon amid hot temperatures. Given dry fuels in
the region, elevated conditions appear likely with periods of
critical conditions possible as RH values fall this afternoon.

Further north, northerly winds through the Central Valley are
forecast to increase to near 15 mph by this afternoon.
Boundary-layer mixing and warm temperatures will aid in RH
reductions to 10-20%. ERC values across the Valley are seasonally
high, indicating that fuels should support fire spread. As such,
elevated fire weather conditions appear likely - especially within
the San Joaquin Basin where the probability for sustained 15 mph
winds is highest.

...Arizona/New Mexico...
Convection across southwest NM and southeast AZ over the past 24
hours has resulted in numerous lightning strikes with only pockets
of wetting rainfall. 00Z soundings still show thermodynamic profiles
conducive for dry thunderstorms as mid-level moisture remains in
place across the region. Strong daytime heating and upslope flow
along the terrain of the Southern Rockies will likely support
another day of scattered convection, and PWAT values between 0.5 to
0.8 inches suggest isolated dry lightning is possible.

Additionally, increasing southeasterly winds across southeast
AZ/southwest NM will support elevated to transient critical
conditions this afternoon as RH values fall into the single digits
and low teens. Ongoing fire activity in the area indicates fuels
remain receptive despite a marginal increase in low-level moisture
over the past 48 hours. Furthermore, this area saw several dry
lightning strikes Monday afternoon, which may become active in the
dry/windy conditions later today.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 15 2021

SYNOPSIS: An amplified pattern is predicted across the North Pacific during
week-2, with a more zonal pattern forecast over the contiguous U.S. Mid-level
high pressure off the west coast of the contiguous U.S. favors a continuation
of anomalously warm temperatures across much of the West, although weak
mid-level low pressure forecast near the California coast is likely to provide
some relief from the heat across California and the Southwest early in the
period. The combination of this feature weakening and broad mid-level high
pressure expanding across the southern tier of the contiguous U.S. ultimately
favors increased chances of hazardous heat expanding through these areas by
the
second half of the period. Impacts from a potential tropical disturbance
forecast to track over parts of the east-central U.S. are expected to occur
prior to the onset of week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the western CONUS, and the
central and southern High Plains, Wed-Tue, Jun 23-29.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of California and the Southwest,
Sat-Tue, Jun 26-29.

Flooding possible for portions of eastern Texas, southeastern Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY JUNE 18 - TUESDAY JUNE 22:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!t_lQ9i2jEPgXlQ5GEON_PPVjVATVgl59Lf7RLqVqzSSnEEow95XbWT2G_vFTyjH11nEqxzxM$

FOR WEDNESDAY JUNE 23 - TUESDAY JUNE 29: An amplified 500-hPa height pattern
is
forecast across the North Pacific during week-2, with troughing across the
Bering Sea and ridging downstream over the Northeast Pacific. A more zonal
pattern is forecast across the CONUS, but todays models depict less of a
weakness with indications of broad ridging expanding across the southern tier
by the second half of the period. This evolution supports a slight risk for
excessive heat across a large area of the western CONUS, and extending into
the
Central and Southern High Plains for all of week-2. Portions of the Northwest
are still favored to be underneath the influence of the Northeast Pacific
ridge, and the broad ridging forecast to expand across the south-central
states
favors an increased risk for hazardous temperatures across the Central and
Southern Rockies and High Plains. Both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools
indicate at least a 20% chance that maximum temperatures exceed the 85th
percentile across these areas for all of week-2, supporting a slight risk for
excessive heat for the entire period. The primary concern is for maximum
temperatures exceeding 90 deg F in the valleys of the Rockies and Great Basin,
and over 100 deg F over the central and southern High Plains. Increased
humidity levels forecast across the High Plains would also result in elevated
heat index values.



Early in week-2, weak troughing is predicted off the coast of California with
slightly negative height anomalies depicted in both the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF
ensembles on day-8. This favors a brief relief from the heat across California
and the Southwest. However, this is likely to be only temporary as this trough
is forecast to further weaken, allowing for more influence from ridging by the
second half of the period with a gradual expansion of the 591-dam height
contour forecast across the Southwest. As a result, the slight risk of
excessive heat is expanded across portions of California and the Southwest
during the second half of the period (6/26-6/29), aligning with the increase
in
coverage of 20% or greater probabilities for temperatures reaching the 85th
percentile in the reforecast tools. This would translate into a return of
triple digit heat across the California Central Valley, with temperatures
possibly exceeding 110 deg F over the Desert Southwest.



The National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring a tropical disturbance,
currently over the Bay of Campeche, which is forecast to move northward toward
the central Gulf Coast states. Currently, this system has a 80% chance to
develop into a tropical cyclone in the next 5 days. Regardless of its
development, heavy rain is likely across the Gulf Coast in week-1, with the
Weather Prediction Center indicating 5-10 inches of rain over southeastern
Louisiana and southern Mississippi and Alabama through the end of week-1. The
remnants of this system may also enhance rainfall across inland portions of
the
eastern and central CONUS as it interacts with a frontal system, but impacts
are most likely to occur prior to the start of week-2. Therefore, the slight
risk of heavy rain hazard depicted in yesterdays outlook across the East is
removed. River flooding remains a concern across the Gulf of Mexico coastal
region where antecedent heavy rainfall, combined with high soil moistures,
supports the continuation of flooding possible hazard highlighted over
portions
of eastern Texas, southeastern Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and
the western Florida Panhandle.



Alaska is forecast to experience anomalous 500-hPa ridging, resulting in a
tilt
toward near to above-normal temperatures being favored statewide. Early in the
period, a tight pressure gradient is favored along the southern coast of the
Mainland and the Alaska Peninsula with surface low pressure forecast over the
Bering Sea resulting in enhanced precipitation chances along with increased
wind speeds. However, hazards thresholds are not expected to be reached. Drier
conditions are forecast later in the period as surface high pressure becomes
more established over the Gulf of Alaska, although any convection that
develops
could be a concern given the associated lightning potential and the forecast
period coinciding with the climatological peak of fire season.

Valid 12Z Fri Jun 18 2021 - 12Z Tue Jun 22 2021

...Record to dangerous heat continues this week across much of the
Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California through the end of
the week...

...Tropical system likely to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to
Central Gulf Coast Friday and this weekend...

...Overview...
Dangerous, record-breaking heat wave over the Southwest and
Interior West is expected to persist through the period with
daytime highs still reaching 10F to as much as 20F above normal
for some locations. Meanwhile, downstream of the anomalously
strong ridge, troughing will be favored over the Great Lakes and
Northeast U.S. which should provide some drier/cooler days later
this week. Then its interaction with another low pressure system
and moisture drawn northward from the Gulf is likely to produce
widespread showers and thunderstorms late in the weekend and early
next week. Attention is also focused on the likely development of
a tropical disturbance currently in the Bay of Campeche. This
feature is expected to organize and strengthen as it approaches
the Gulf Coast. There is increasing potential for heavy rainfall
and flooding along the Gulf Coast by late Friday through this
weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Compared to the last model cycle, there's been a slight westward
drift in the forecast track of the potential tropical system as
seen by most of the 12Z deterministic runs (ECMWF/CMC/GFS/UKMET).
These model solutions suggest a low center along the Texas coast
by 12Z Saturday. The timing remains more elusive and there
continues to be two scenarios - the ECWMF/GFS are closer together
showing a slightly faster solution (12Z Sat low offshore the upper
TX coast) while the CMC/UKMET remains the slower models (off the
southern TX coast valid 12Z Saturday). A time trend analysis over
the last several runs does suggest a slight slower trend is
favored, at least through Saturday. Then as the system moves
inland late in the weekend and early next week, it will likely be
drawn north/northeast with the approaching trough. But given the
ongoing spread and varying trends over the past few days, the
updated forecast made only modest changes from continuity for
strength and track (slightly west, slightly slower).

Aside from the tropical system, the latest model guidance shows
fairly good agreement in the synoptic pattern. The Four Corners
ridge weakens/shunts to the south as mean troughing asserts itself
over the central U.S., carved out by a shortwave trough that first
comes through the Pacific Northwest on Friday. This area of low
pressure is expected to deepens/strengthen as it ejects out in the
Plains and Great Lakes and should bring with it a seasonably
strong cold front across the central U.S. to Ohio Valley. There
remains some model differences with its interaction on what will
be a stationary/wavy boundary in place ahead of it but a general
model blend was sufficient at this time.

All in all, the WPC forecast for the medium range period used
mostly the GFS/ECMWF with some inclusion of the CMC outside of the
tropical areas. By day 5-7, heavier components of the GEFS/ECENS
means were used to account for uncertainty with the various
systems affecting the CONUS including the mid-latitude frontal
passages as well as the potential tropical system.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Another record breaking and dangerous heat day is expected for
Friday across much of the Southwest and Interior West where highs
well into the 100s and 110s are expected for the Southwest into
the California Central Valley. Further north, 90s to low 100s are
forecast as far north as eastern Washington. These readings are
10F to 20F above normal. The combination of extreme temperatures
and duration will make this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive
groups. Excessive heat warnings/watches are in place for many
areas of the Southwest and the California Central Valley. While
some moderation is expected this weekend and early next week, the
Great Basin and portions of the Northwest will still be 10F to 15F
above normal. For the central and eastern U.S., the combination of
frontal passages, potential for scattered to numerous daily
thunderstorms, and a looming tropical system will likely keep
temperatures at or slightly below the mid/late June normals.

The National Hurricane Center continues to advertise a high
likelihood of organization and development with a tropical
disturbance currently located in the Bay of Campeche. As it drifts
northward, it will pull anomalously high moisture and likely lead
to an area of heavy rainfall. While there still remains
uncertainty in the exact location of the heaviest rainfall, the
potential exists for some impactful flooding, particularly given
the continued wetness and high soil moisture in place from the wet
spring.

Several frontal passages across the Great Lakes to Ohio Valley
could bring a focused area of heavy rainfall this weekend and
again early next week. The first frontal system is forecast to
settle across the lower Ohio Valley Saturday/Sunday and its
interaction with another approaching front Monday/Tuesday could
lead to a few repeating rounds of thunderstorms. Some of this
could be locally heavy.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue June 15 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 21 - 25 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a broad trough over
the North Pacific, centered south of the western Aleutians, and ridging with
positive 500-hPa height anomalies is predicted over the Gulf of Alaska,
extending over parts of the Pacific Northwest coast. A trough is forecast over
the east-central CONUS. Weak positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted
over the southern CONUS and eastern coast.

The predicted troughing over the western Aleutians and associated southerly to
southwesterly flow favor relatively warm conditions for much of Mainland
Alaska
and the eastern Aleutians as well as the Alaska Panhandle. A predicted trough
over the east-central CONUS favors enhanced probabilities of near to below
normal temperatures across most of the central and eastern CONUS, except for
the east coast where near to above normal temperatures are indicated due
predicted weak positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Above normal temperatures
are
also likely over the western CONUS, parts of the Southern Plains and
Louisiana,
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered over the western Aleutians favors above-normal
precipitation over the Aleutians and western Mainland Alaska. Anomalous
ridging
and northerly flow increase chances of below-normal precipitation across much
of the western CONUS. Predicted troughing over the east-central CONUS favors
near to above normal precipitation across most of the eastern CONUS except for
southern Florida , where below normal precipitation is indicated, consistent
with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 23 - 29 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, becoming more zonal
over much of the CONUS but remaining amplified over the Pacific Ocean, while
ensemble spread and uncertainty increases. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend
weights the ECMWF ensemble mean greater than the NCEP GEFS and Canadian
ensemble means, due to recent model skill.

The temperature pattern forecast over the CONUS for the week 2 period is
similar to the 6-10 day outlook period. Above-normal temperatures are favored
for much of Mainland Alaska and the eastern Aleutians as well as the Alaska
Panhandle, associated with mean southerly flow ahead of a mean trough over the
western Aleutians and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Near to above-normal
temperatures are likely over most of the east coast, western CONUS and parts
of
the Southern Plains, under near to above normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal
temperatures are most favored over the north-central CONUS, as a trough and
storm systems are predicted to traverse the region.

The week-2 precipitation probability forecast is also similar to the 6-10 day
forecast. Forecast troughing over the western Aleutians favors mean southerly
flow and above normal precipitation over the Aleutians and western Mainland
Alaska. Below-normal precipitation odds are increased for southeastern
Mainland
Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle and the western CONUS as well as the southern
Plains , associated with mean ridging over the Gulf of Alaska and anomalous
northerly flow. Near to above normal precipitation is favored across the
central and eastern CONUS, consistent with the ERF consolidation and
operational autoblend forecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Dangerous heat to continue across portions of the West and
Northern/Central Plains, with record-breaking temperatures and
fire danger in some areas...

...Rain and thunderstorms are forecast across Florida over the
next couple of days and could produce isolated flash flooding...

A strong upper-level ridge centered across the Four Corners region
will help sustain a substantial heat wave for the majority of the
western U.S. over the next several days, with the northern and
central U.S. also seeing periods of hot weather. Temperatures well
into the 110s to lower 120s are forecast for the Desert Southwest.
Meanwhile over Montana, high temperatures well into the 100s will
be as much as 30 degrees above average this afternoon and evening.
Dozens (possibly hundreds) of daily record high maximum and
minimum temperatures are likely to be set over the next few days
in California, the Intermountain West, Desert Southwest, Rockies,
and central/northern Plains. High temperatures across the lower
elevations of the Central Rockies region could even challenge
all-time records this afternoon and Wednesday at some locations.
By Thursday, the summer heat will push southward into the Central
Plains, as well as expanding west into the central valleys of
California. Widespread Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories
have been issued throughout eight states in the western U.S., from
southern California to northeast Montana. Residents enduring the
ongoing dangerous stretch of heat are advised to stay indoors and
seek air-conditioned buildings, stay hydrated, and take frequent
breaks if engaging in outdoor activities. Given the heat, dry
conditions, and gusty winds, fire danger is also a concern
throughout much of the West, with Critical Risks of fire weather
in place this evening across portions of the central Great Basin
and Northern Rockies.

The exception to the western heat will be the Pacific Northwest,
which can expect cooler than average temperatures as well as rain
chances tonight behind a cold front. Precipitation should decrease
in the Northwest on Wednesday, but winds are likely to strengthen
as a low pressure system intensifies in western Canada. The cold
front should drop temperatures closer to normal in Montana on
Wednesday, while also helping trigger some thunderstorms in the
Dakotas and Midwest before reaching the Great Lakes by Thursday.
Isolated storms could be strong to severe in these locations.

Scattered thunderstorms are likely across the Gulf Coast region
over the next couple of days. There is a Slight Risk for severe
weather (with gusty winds and hail the main threats) across the
coastal Carolinas into tonight. The Florida Peninsula in
particular should see good coverage of thunderstorms, with heavy
downpours potentially leading to isolated flash flooding.
Meanwhile, some showers and thunderstorms are possible in the
Northeast this evening as a couple of fronts move through the
region, which will also cause below normal and pleasant
temperatures through Thursday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Tue Jun 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

Forecast guidance suggests drier conditions and deeper mixing across
portions of eastern Idaho, southwest Montana, and western Wyoming.
Given the moderate mid-level flow across this region, deeper mixing
should lead to stronger surface winds. Therefore, have expanded the
elevated area into this region. In addition, expanded the elevated
area westward to the California border as some downslope flow is
expected to bring 15 to 20 mph winds amid single digit RH.

In addition, added an elevated area for portions of Santa Barbara
and San Luis Obispo counties where high resolution guidance
indicates stronger offshore flow for at least the first half of the
day Wednesday.

..Bentley.. 06/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Tue Jun 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough, currently noted moving onshore across
northern California, is forecast to translate across the
international border through the day Wednesday. This will place a
belt of stronger mid-level flow over the northern Rockies and
northern High Plains, which will introduce some fire weather
concerns. Building high pressure across the West Coast will
generally weaken winds compared to previous days, though areas of
stronger flow will support some fire weather threat.

...Northern Rockies/High Plains...
Westerly winds will start breezy at 20-25 mph behind a Pacific cold
front but gradually decrease by the afternoon as the front/trough
shift into the Plains through the day. An influx of cooler air will
limit RH reductions to 20-30%, but the temporal overlap of breezy
conditions and low RH may be limited. However, the proximity of the
upper-level trough will support 25-35 mph mid-level flow over the
region, which should mix down to the surface as frequent wind gusts
by mid to late afternoon as boundary-layer mixing deepens. This will
allow for elevated, to perhaps locally critical fire weather
conditions from north-central MT into western ND.

...Great Basin...
Mostly clear skies over the greater Four Corners region will allow
for strong diurnal heating across the Great Basin and into the
Southwest. This will help deepen a thermal low over the Four Corners
and augment the regional pressure gradient. As a result, 15-20 mph
winds are possible across parts of the Great Basin where conditions
have been hot and dry. Elevated conditions appear likely, but the
lack of stronger flow aloft may limit the duration and coverage of
any critical wind speeds.

...Four Corners...
Mid-level moisture is expected to linger from southern AZ/NM into
central CO within a weak, but persistent easterly flow regime.
Combined with hot boundary-layer temperatures, 0.3-0.6 inch PWAT
values will contribute to enough instability to support convection.
Orographic lift along the terrain of the central and southern
Rockies will act as forcing for ascent, resulting in isolated to
scattered thunderstorms by mid to late afternoon. With dry fuels
noted across much of the region, dry-lightning starts are possible.

...Southern California...
The building surface high over the West Coast should help maintain a
north-south pressure gradient across southern California through
early Wednesday morning. Elevated fire weather conditions may be
ongoing early Wednesday as Sundowner winds drive downslope
warming/drying across southern Santa Barbara county. Forecast
guidance depicts a weakening of this pressure gradient through the
day, and an influx of marine moisture may also reduce the fire
weather concern by the afternoon, though trends will be monitored.

...Record to dangerous heat continues this week across much of the
Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California through the end of
the week...

...Tropical system likely to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to
Central Gulf Coast Friday and this weekend...

...Overview...
Dangerous, record-breaking heat wave over the Southwest and
Interior West is expected to persist through the period with
daytime highs still reaching 10F to as much as 20F above normal
for some locations. Meanwhile, downstream of the anomalously
strong ridge, troughing will be favored over the Great Lakes and
Northeast U.S. which should provide some drier/cooler days later
this week. Then its interaction with another low pressure system
and moisture drawn northward from the Gulf is likely to produce
widespread showers and thunderstorms late in the weekend and early
next week. Attention is also focused on the likely development of
a tropical disturbance currently in the Bay of Campeche. This
feature is expected to organize and strengthen as it approaches
the Gulf Coast. There is increasing potential for heavy rainfall
and flooding along the Gulf Coast by late Friday through this
weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Compared to the last model cycle, there's been a slight westward
drift in the forecast track of the potential tropical system as
seen by most of the 12Z deterministic runs (ECMWF/CMC/GFS/UKMET).
These model solutions suggest a low center along the Texas coast
by 12Z Saturday. The timing remains more elusive and there
continues to be two scenarios - the ECWMF/GFS are closer together
showing a slightly faster solution (12Z Sat low offshore the upper
TX coast) while the CMC/UKMET remains the slower models (off the
southern TX coast valid 12Z Saturday). A time trend analysis over
the last several runs does suggest a slight slower trend is
favored, at least through Saturday. Then as the system moves
inland late in the weekend and early next week, it will likely be
drawn north/northeast with the approaching trough. But given the
ongoing spread and varying trends over the past few days, the
updated forecast made only modest changes from continuity for
strength and track (slightly west, slightly slower).

Aside from the tropical system, the latest model guidance shows
fairly good agreement in the synoptic pattern. The Four Corners
ridge weakens/shunts to the south as mean troughing asserts itself
over the central U.S., carved out by a shortwave trough that first
comes through the Pacific Northwest on Friday. This area of low
pressure is expected to deepens/strengthen as it ejects out in the
Plains and Great Lakes and should bring with it a seasonably
strong cold front across the central U.S. to Ohio Valley. There
remains some model differences with its interaction on what will
be a stationary/wavy boundary in place ahead of it but a general
model blend was sufficient at this time.

All in all, the WPC forecast for the medium range period used
mostly the GFS/ECMWF with some inclusion of the CMC outside of the
tropical areas. By day 5-7, heavier components of the GEFS/ECENS
means were used to account for uncertainty with the various
systems affecting the CONUS including the mid-latitude frontal
passages as well as the potential tropical system.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Another record breaking and dangerous heat day is expected for
Friday across much of the Southwest and Interior West where highs
well into the 100s and 110s are expected for the Southwest into
the California Central Valley. Further north, 90s to low 100s are
forecast as far north as eastern Washington. These readings are
10F to 20F above normal. The combination of extreme temperatures
and duration will make this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive
groups. Excessive heat warnings/watches are in place for many
areas of the Southwest and the California Central Valley. While
some moderation is expected this weekend and early next week, the
Great Basin and portions of the Northwest will still be 10F to 15F
above normal. For the central and eastern U.S., the combination of
frontal passages, potential for scattered to numerous daily
thunderstorms, and a looming tropical system will likely keep
temperatures at or slightly below the mid/late June normals.

The National Hurricane Center continues to advertise a high
likelihood of organization and development with a tropical
disturbance currently located in the Bay of Campeche. As it drifts
northward, it will pull anomalously high moisture and likely lead
to an area of heavy rainfall. While there still remains
uncertainty in the exact location of the heaviest rainfall, the
potential exists for some impactful flooding, particularly given
the continued wetness and high soil moisture in place from the wet
spring.

Several frontal passages across the Great Lakes to Ohio Valley
could bring a focused area of heavy rainfall this weekend and
again early next week. The first frontal system is forecast to
settle across the lower Ohio Valley Saturday/Sunday and its
interaction with another approaching front Monday/Tuesday could
lead to a few repeating rounds of thunderstorms. Some of this
could be locally heavy.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1257 AM CDT Wed Jun 16 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
Partial upper-level ridge breakdown will continue for today as an
upper-level trough, currently moving east over the northern Rockies,
continues to translate into the northern Plains. An attendant
surface low and trailing cold front/trough will likewise continue to
the east through the day. The displacement of stronger upper-level
flow and tighter surface pressure gradients from the drier air mass
and favorable fuels to the west will limit the potential for a
robust fire weather threat. But the diurnal deepening of a thermal
low over the lower Colorado River Valley and building high pressure
along the West Coast will support several areas of elevated fire
weather concerns.

...Great Basin into the northern Rockies...
Areas of elevated fire weather conditions appear likely this
afternoon for much of the Great Basin and parts of the northern
Rockies as RH values fall into the single digits and low teens area
wide. Downslope winds in the lee of the Sierra Nevada will drive
15-20 mph winds along the CA/NV border, and similar sustained winds
are expected further east/northeast across the Great Basin and
northern Rockies as the regional pressure gradient tightens. Areas
of east-central NV, northeast UT, and southwest WY may see frequent
gusts upwards of 25-30 mph in terrain-favored locations by early
afternoon. This may support periods of critical wind/RH conditions,
but the potential for widespread critical conditions is low given
weak flow aloft.

...Northern Montana...
Post-frontal winds are forecast to be sustained at 15-25 mph across
northern and northeast MT early this morning, but are forecast to
gradually abate through the day as the surface low shifts east into
the Plains. Diurnal warming will drive RH reductions into the 20-30%
range by mid/late afternoon, but winds by this time will most likely
be near 15 mph across the region. This temporal displacement of
stronger winds and low RH suggest low potential for sustained
critical conditions, but elevated wind/RH combinations seem likely
with localized critical combinations possible.

...Southern California...
The thermal low across the southern CO River Valley is forecast to
extend along the CA coast as temperatures climb into the upper 90s
and low 100s. Building high pressure across CA's Central Valley will
support an offshore wind gradient with 15-25 mph winds likely. RH
values falling into the 15-20% range and dry fuels will support
elevated fire weather conditions.

...Four Corners...
Mid-level moisture lingers over the southeastern quadrants of the
Four Corners region as sampled by 00Z regional soundings and recent
GOES PWAT imagery thanks to modest moisture advection within a mean
easterly flow regime. This moisture, combined with deep
boundary-layer mixing from strong diurnal heating, will support
thermodynamic profiles favorable for convection again this
afternoon. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will be driven
primarily by orographic ascent. With dry lightning observed in
recent days under similar conditions, another day of dry lightning
strikes seems likely.

To the south along the AZ/NM border, southeasterly winds will
increase in response to the deepening thermal low to the west. Winds
will likely increase to near 15 mph by early afternoon and support
elevated fire weather conditions given single digit to low teen RH
values.

...Dangerous heat continues across portions of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California into the weekend
followed by a cooler trend...

...Tropical system likely to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to
Central Gulf Coast Friday and this weekend...

...Overview...

The most extreme heat initially over the Southwest U.S. and
California as of Saturday will steadily moderate thereafter as the
upper ridge over the region drifts eastward and a trough with
likely embedded upper low takes shape offshore California. However
there will be enough upper ridging that extends over the Great
Basin and Northwest to bring multiple days of highs 10-20F above
normal to those regions. Within mean troughing aligned over the
east-central U.S., a leading shortwave will bring a front through
the Great Lakes/Northeast during the weekend. A trailing stronger
upper trough will support Plains-Great Lakes-Canada low pressure
whose trailing front should ultimately extend farther south over
the central/eastern U.S. than the first front. These systems will
support multiple areas of showers and thunderstorms. Guidance
continues to suggest likely development of a tropical disturbance
currently in the Bay of Campeche. This feature should organize and
strengthen as it approaches the west-central Gulf Coast. There is
increasing potential for heavy rainfall and flooding along the
Gulf Coast by late Friday through this weekend.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Over recent days an average of GFS/ECMWF runs has tended to
provide the most stable solution for the system expected to emerge
from the Bay of Campeche and track toward the west-central Gulf
Coast, with CMC runs initially on the fast side and then slow and
the UKMET consistently slow/southwest. That said, even the
GFS/ECMWF have varied some--including latest GFS runs tracking
somewhat farther westward versus 24 hours ago. The new 00Z
CMC/UKMET runs dramatically improve guidance clustering as of
early Saturday with a position over the northwestern Gulf, poised
to reach the Gulf coast near the Texas/Louisiana border. After
that time the models diverge some, especially that CMC that strays
to the east, but otherwise this is the best agreement that has
existed so far. By early next week what is left of the system
(with a wide spread between the deepening ECMWF and dissipating
GFS) should continue northeastward ahead of the amplifying Plains
upper trough.

Elsewhere the latest GFS/ECMWF runs and their ensemble means
represented the consensus evolution well. The leading shortwave
crossing the Great Lakes/Northeast along with associated front,
plus the trailing upper trough that amplifies into the
central/eastern U.S. during the first half of next week, are
agreeable in concept. Details aloft within the core of the trough
over southern Canada and northern tier of the U.S. early next week
have varied, thus leading to differences in specifics for Plains
through Upper Great Lakes low pressure that should be strong but
not extreme by historical June standards. As with the likely
tropical system, new 00Z guidance offers some of the best surface
low clustering seen thus far. Another shortwave rounding the
Northeast Pacific mean ridge may approach the Northwest by next
Wednesday. Finally, the 00Z model/ensemble runs also improve
agreement for details of the trough/upper low offshore California
next week.

Guidance comparisons through the 18Z cycle led to the updated
forecast using the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their means, with mostly
operational weight early and a more even model/mean weight later
in the period. Variability for the likely tropical system led to
only a partial adjustment from continuity toward the latest blend.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Record breaking and dangerous heat should continue into Saturday
over the Southwest, California Central Valley, and Interior West
where highs well into the 100s and 110s are likely. This region
should begin to see temperatures moderating a little on Sunday and
to a greater extent during the first half of next week as heights
aloft decline. Meanwhile areas to the north will trend hotter into
early next week with some areas seeing highs reach into the 90s
and possibly low 100s as far north as eastern Washington. These
readings are 10F to 20F or so above normal and could produce a few
isolated daily records. The combination of extreme temperatures
and duration will make this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive
groups. Excessive heat warnings/watches are in place for many
areas of the Southwest and the California Central Valley.  For the
central and eastern U.S., the combination of frontal passages,
potential for scattered to numerous daily thunderstorms, and a
looming tropical system will likely keep temperatures at or
slightly below the mid/late June normals. The broadest area of
cool readings will progress from the northern Plains into the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley Monday-Wednesday.

The National Hurricane Center continues to advertise a high
likelihood of organization and development with a tropical
disturbance currently located in the Bay of Campeche. As it drifts
northward, it will pull along anomalously high moisture and likely
bring an area of heavy rainfall into the central Gulf Coast and
nearby areas. While there still remains uncertainty in the exact
location of the heaviest rainfall, the potential exists for some
impactful flooding, particularly given the continued wetness and
high soil moisture in place from the wet spring.

A leading front that settles from the Plains into Mid-Atlantic
this weekend followed by strengthening Plains through Upper Great
Lakes low pressure that returns the first front northward and then
sweeps a cold front through the central/eastern states early next
week will produce multiple rounds of showers/storms.  Some of this
rain may be heavy. Also worth monitoring will be to what extent
the moisture from the tropical system may interact with the second
front as it reaches the eastern U.S.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 AM CDT Wed Jun 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
Strong zonal flow aloft will persist over the northern Rockies into
Thursday. This will support strong mid-level winds from Wyoming into
Montana and western North Dakota, which will help support areas of
elevated fire weather concerns given the receptive fuels. Mid-level
moisture will continue to linger across the Four Corners region
under an upper-level high, supporting another day of dry
thunderstorm potential.

...Northern Rockies and northern High Plains...
Westerly surface winds are expected across the northern Rockies and
northern High Plains as a surface trough stalls to the east across
the Plains and high pressure builds over the Pacific Northwest.
Sustained winds near 15-20 mph are probable, and strong mid-level
flow may mix down as frequent gusts to 25-35 mph given sufficiently
deep boundary-layer mixing. With afternoon RH values in the teens to
low twenties expected and receptive fuels already in place, elevated
conditions appear likely. Locations along the I-80 corridor in
south-central WY will see the highest potential for critical
conditions as downslope winds support strong warming/drying as well
as wind gusts up to 45 mph. However, recent fuel reports from this
area suggest fuels are not as receptive as areas further north,
precluding a critical risk delineation at this time (though an
upgrade is possible pending new fuel reports).

...Four Corners...
A persistent upper-level high over the Four Corners will continue to
allow mid-level moisture return from the southern Plains into
central AZ, NM, and central CO. Forecast soundings show sufficient
instability above deep, well-mixed boundary layers with mean
boundary-layer RH values near 20% and PWAT values between 0.4 to
0.6. This suggests a mixture of wet and dry storms is possible, and
given recent dry lightning activity under similar thermodynamic
conditions in recent days, at least a few dry strikes seem likely.

...Great Basin...
Dry conditions will persist across much of the Great Basin for
Thursday. Afternoon RH values in the single digits are expected, and
fuels will remain receptive after several days of hot/dry
conditions. Weak upper-level flow aloft will limit the potential for
widespread fire weather concerns, but winds up to 15 mph are
possible, especially in terrain-favored locations, which should
support patchy elevated conditions.

...Dangerous heat to continue across portions of the West and

fire danger in some areas...

...Storms could be severe in the Midwest over the next couple of
days...

...Scattered thunderstorms are expected across Florida in
particular today and Thursday, and tropical rains will approach
the central Gulf Coast by Friday...

A strong upper-level ridge centered across the Four Corners region
will help sustain a substantial heat wave for the majority of the
western U.S. over the next several days, with the northern and
central U.S. also seeing periods of hot weather. Temperatures well
into the 110s into the 120s are forecast for the Desert Southwest,
and temperatures over 100 degrees are expected for
central/northern portions of the Plains today. Dozens (possibly
hundreds) of daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures
are likely to be set over the next few days in California, the
Intermountain West, Desert Southwest, Rockies, and
Central/Northern Plains. By Thursday, the summer heat will push
southward into the Central Plains, as well as expanding west into
the central valleys of California. Widespread Excessive Heat
Warnings and Heat Advisories have been issued throughout eight
states, from California to South Dakota and Nebraska. Residents
enduring the ongoing dangerous stretch of heat are advised to stay
indoors and seek air-conditioned buildings, stay hydrated, and
take frequent breaks if engaging in outdoor activities. Given the
heat, dry conditions, and gusty winds, fire danger is also a
concern throughout much of the West and toward the north-central
U.S., and Elevated Risks of fire weather are in place, along with
the possibility of some dry thunderstorms in the Four Corners
states.

The exception to the hot West will be in the Northwest today, with
cooler air in place behind a cold front. Just ahead of that
frontal system, showers and thunderstorms are expected across the
Dakotas into the Midwest today and tonight, and focusing in the
Midwest and Great Lakes on Thursday. Some storms could be strong
to severe today, but it appears the greater threat for severe
weather will be on Thursday. The Storm Prediction Center has a
Slight Risk of severe weather outlooked then, with tornadoes,
wind, and hail all threats with the storms, along with isolated
flash flooding.

Scattered thunderstorms remain possible across the Gulf Coast
region over the next couple of days. While storms are not expected
to be severe, there is a risk for isolated flash flooding from
heavy downpours over the Florida peninsula today and tonight.
Then, rain chances will increase by Friday along central parts of

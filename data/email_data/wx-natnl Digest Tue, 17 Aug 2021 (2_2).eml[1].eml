...HIGH Risk of flash flooding in place today/tonight as Fred
moves northward and spreads very heavy rainfall and potential for
landslides to the Southern Appalachians...

...Heavy rainfall and scattered flash floods are also possible
across much of the eastern U.S. as tropical moisture streams
north...

...Cooler and wetter conditions are likely for the Northwest
behind a potent cold front, with warm temperatures and Elevated to
Critical fire weather conditions ahead of it...

...Monsoonal moisture will cause additional showers and
thunderstorms as well as the threat of flash flooding for the
Southwest into Utah through midweek...

As Fred is now onshore, its winds will continue to weaken as it
moves northward across the eastern U.S. However, more hazards are
to come with Fred, as extremely heavy rainfall of several inches
(10+ inches in localized areas) is forecast to fall today across
the Southern Appalachians, given Fred's energy and moisture as
well as a weak upper-level trough moving toward the region. This
area is particularly sensitive to heavy rainfall because of the
varying terrain, and widespread flash flooding is expected, along
with the possibility of landslides particularly in the mountains
of North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Escarpment. A High Risk of
excessive rainfall has been raised for this area today into
tonight. In addition, a few tornadoes are possible for the
Southern Appalachians into parts of the Piedmont. Trailing bands
of rain with Fred could also occur over northern Florida and into
South Carolina today. Meanwhile, tropical moisture streaming
northward across much of the East feeding into a weak frontal
system ahead of the aforementioned trough will lead to widespread
rain and thunderstorms across the Central/Northern Appalachians
and parts of the Mid-Atlantic into New York over the next couple
of days. Scattered flash floods are possible in these areas and
are under Slight Risks of excessive rainfall through Wednesday.

A potent cold front pushed by an upper-level low will move through
the Northwest over the next couple of days, significantly cooling
temperatures there. High temperatures are forecast to drop to 20
to 30 degrees below normal in the Northern Rockies by Wednesday,
with highs in the 50s. However, temperatures should remain hot
ahead of the front, with a couple more days of 100+ temperatures
expected for the Northern Plains. Areas such as the Central Great
Basin should see warmer than normal temperatures today followed by
below normal highs by Wednesday as the cold front approaches.
Additionally, Elevated to Critical fire weather conditions are a
threat again today, along with the potential for additional fire
ignitions from dry thunderstorms. Red Flag Warnings are in place
from portions of California through the Central Great Basin into
the Northern High Plains.

Rain showers are also likely with this system in the West, mainly
along and behind the cold front, while in the meantime monsoonal
moisture will continue flowing into the Southwest toward Utah.
With rainfall totals over an inch in some areas with locally
higher amounts, Marginal Risks of excessive rainfall are in place
across portions of the Four Corners states northward into the
Northern Rockies and eastward to Texas over the next couple of
days, along with embedded Slight Risks over much of Utah, which
could be particularly hard hit and tends to be sensitive to rain
causing flash flooding.

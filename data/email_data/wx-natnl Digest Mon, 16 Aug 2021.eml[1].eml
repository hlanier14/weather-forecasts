Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1109 AM CDT Sun Aug 15 2021

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN MONTANA...

Much of the previous forecast remains generally on track. The
isolated dry thunderstorm area was constricted to areas most likely
to experience a couple high-based thunderstorms later today. While
the latest high-resolution guidance suggests very sparse coverage,
dry thunderstorm highlights have been continued given the presence
of critically dry fuels and recent, extreme fire behavior observed.
Only minor changes were made to the ongoing Elevated and Critical
highlights to reflect the latest guidance consensus. Please see the
previous forecast below for more details on the threats for
dry/breezy conditions and dry thunderstorms across the West.

Latest guidance continues to show at least occasional, locally
Elevated winds/RH by afternoon peak heating across parts of eastern
North Dakota into Minnesota. While guidance is lacking consensus in
widespread Elevated surface conditions supporting wildfire spread
for long periods of time (hence no highlights), conditions
supporting more localized wildfire-growth potential are expected.

..Squitieri.. 08/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0235 AM CDT Sun Aug 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
The persistent mid-level anticyclone across the West will start to
break down late on Sunday as a short-wave trough impinges upon its
northern periphery over the Pacific Northwest. Before breakdown
commences, another hot and unstable day will occur across a large
portion of the West. Farther east, broadly cyclonic mid-level flow
will persist across the eastern United States despite a nondescript
height field.

... Wind/RH Areas -- North-central Oregon, much of eastern
Washington, and much of Montana ...

The aforementioned short-wave trough and associated speed maximum
will move across interior portions of the Pacific Northwest and into
the northern Rockies during the forecast period. This belt of
enhanced westerly flow will support strong downslope flow in the lee
of the Cascades across the interior Pacific Northwest and in the lee
of the northern Rockies across Montana. The result will be gusty
afternoon westerly surface winds across these areas, potentially
exceeding 30 mph. Additionally, adiabatic warming from the
downsloping winds will allow relative humidity to fall into the
10-15% range. The result is elevated to critical fire conditions
across these areas.

At this time, the most likely area for critical conditions will
occur across portions of north-central Montana where the greatest
confidence and duration of hot, dry, and windy conditions will
occur. Secondary and tertiary areas of potential critical conditions
will occur across east-central Washington, near and around Spokane,
and across north-central Oregon, in the vicinity and to the west of
Pendleton. Here, lower confidence in the combination of minimum
relative humidity falling below 20% overlapping winds exceeding 20
mph for more than three hours will preclude the introduction of
critical delineation with this outlook. However, locally critical
conditions are possible.

... Dry Thunderstorm Area -- Northern California, Oregon, and areas
to the north and east ...

Mid-level moisture being advected around the large western
anticyclone will combine with another day of diurnal heating to
support terrain-driven circulations capable of initiating
thunderstorms. Thunderstorms across the Sierra will be closely tied
to these terrain circulations and relatively slow-moving, capable of
producing wetting rains. Farther north, the influence of the
previously identified speed maximum moving across the interior
Pacific Northwest will support faster storm motions and a decreased
likelihood of wetting rains across far northeast California and
eastern Oregon. Farther northeast -- across portions of central
Idaho -- a small signal for dry thunderstorms is apparent in the 00
UTC high-resolution guidance. However, confidence in thunderstorm
potential here is too low to warrant probabilistic delineation.

...Tropical Storm Grace to track into the Gulf of Mexico...
...Emerging North-Central U.S. Heavy Rain Threat...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles do not offer a strong and consistent guidance
signal for Grace with emergence from the Caribbean after midweek,
but recent guidance trends have tended to shift the track more
westward across the Gulf of Mexico later week into next weekend.
There is potential for system intensification to monitor for
maritime interests along with a possible Florida/Gulf Coast threat.

Elsewhere, The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a blend of the 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and ECMWF
ensemble mean that offered more mid-latitude flow amplitude and
slower progression than the 00/06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean. This seemed
reasonable considering anchoring upper ridge amplitude in most
guidance set over the eastern Pacific. The 12 UTC GFS/GEFS and 12
UTC UKMET have generally trended (GFS/GEFS slower and UKMET
faster) toward the WPC blend and the 12 UTC ECMWF remains overall

...Pattern Overview and Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Residual tropical moisture from a dissipated Fred will fuel
lingering but increasingly scattered showers/thunderstorms and
localized downpours spread over the east/northeastern U.S. past
midweek. T.S. Grace may also with some uncertainly track from the
Caribbean into the Gulf of Mexico midweek into next weekend.
Please refer to the latest advisories from the National Hurricane
Center for updated information about Grace.

Elsewhere, monsoonal moisture activity lifting out from the Desert
Southwest/Great Basin mid-late week will offer a localized flash
flood risk. Moisture should stream northward and northeastward
ahead of the incoming Northwest to north-central U.S. upper
trough, with an emerging potential for moderate to heavy
rainfall/convection from the northern and central Rockies/Plains
to the mid-upper MS Valley mid-late week and then the east-central
U.S. with gradually diminishing support into next weekend. Expect
organized and enhanced rainfall will focus along/ahead of a
developing frontal system aided by cyclogenesis as height
falls/instability/inflow enhance with amplified upper trough
progression.

...Tropical Storm Grace to track into the Gulf of Mexico...
...Emerging North-Central U.S. Heavy Rain Threat...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles do not offer a strong and consistent guidance
signal for Grace with emergence from the Caribbean after midweek,
but recent guidance trends have tended to shift the track more
westward across the Gulf of Mexico later week into next weekend.
There is potential for system intensification to monitor for
maritime interests along with a possible Florida/Gulf Coast threat.

Elsewhere, The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a blend of the 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and ECMWF
ensemble mean that offered more mid-latitude flow amplitude and
slower progression than the 00/06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean. This seemed
reasonable considering anchoring upper ridge amplitude in most
guidance set over the eastern Pacific. The 12 UTC GFS/GEFS and 12
UTC UKMET have generally trended (GFS/GEFS slower and UKMET
faster) toward the WPC blend and the 12 UTC ECMWF remains overall
in line. WPC continuity is well maintained.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun August 15 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding are possible along a
slow-moving frontal system between the eastern Ohio/Tennessee
valleys and the Mid-Atlantic...

...Tropical Storm Fred forecast to make landfall over the western
Florida Panhandle on Monday and bring the threat of heavy rain,
gusty winds, and dangerous storm surge...

...More potentially record-breaking heat found across portions of
the West and Northern Plains, along with poor air quality and fire
danger...

Multiple weather features will continue to set up to the south of
a typical summer jet stream focused along the northern U.S. and
Canada. One area of concern over the next few days will be the
eastern third of the U.S., with heavy rain and flash flooding the
main concern. A frontal system is forecast to meander around the
region and provide a place for above normal moisture to focus,
causing multiple rounds of scattered downpours. Through tonight, a
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in place for the
Southern/Central Appalachians and into portions of the southern
Mid-Atlantic, where scattered flash floods are possible. The
greatest flash flooding threat should expand northward a bit with
the front on Monday and linger through the day on Tuesday over
parts of the Ohio Valley/Central Appalachians and into the
Mid-Atlantic. Moisture associated with Tropical Storm Fred may
feed into this region by Tuesday as well.

Tropical Storm Fred has redeveloped in the eastern Gulf of Mexico
this afternoon and is expected to continue moving northward before
making landfall somewhere in the western Florida Panhandle on
Monday evening. Heavy rainfall and gusty winds can be expected
along its track, as well as potentially dangerous storm surge for
coastal regions near and to the east of landfall. Most of the rain
may stay offshore of Florida tonight, but by Monday and early
Tuesday, very heavy rain should impact parts the Florida Panhandle
and later shift into the Southeast. Flash Flood Watches have been
issued. As Fred weakens and pushes inland early this week,
additional bands of heavy rain may extend as far north as the
Southern Appalachians and East Tennessee.

Another hazard to contend with through Tuesday will be excessively
hot temperatures, which could break several daily maximum and
minimum temperature records across much of the western U.S. and
Northern Plains. Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories are
in place mainly in lower elevations of California and the
Intermountain West as temperatures soar into the 100s. Dangerous
heat is also expected throughout the Northern Plains, with highs
well above average for this time of year and around 100F. In
addition to the heat, Air Quality Alerts are in place for the
Northwest and into parts of the Northern Rockies given smoke from
fires and high ozone levels. Unfortunately, isolated dry
thunderstorms and Elevated to Critical fire conditions remain a
threat through at least Monday as well, which could worsen the
ongoing fire situation in the West. Relief from the heat is
expected in the Northwest on Monday and Tuesday as a cold front
pushes through and temperatures cool, but temperatures remain near
100F in the Northern Plains. Meanwhile, cooler temperatures are
expected over portions of the Southwest into the Southern High
Plains, along with the chance for rain and thunderstorms as
monsoonal moisture continues to stream into the region. Flash
floods are possible over the next couple days, with Flash Flood
Watches remaining in effect today over southern Arizona and New
Mexico, as well as into far western Texas.

0249 PM CDT Sun Aug 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN MONTANA INTO
EXTREME NORTHWESTERN NORTH DAKOTA...

Confidence has increased for at least localized to widespread
Elevated surface winds/RH to materialize by afternoon peak heating
across much of the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies and
northern Great Basin tomorrow, as modest upper support/flow
overspreads terrain-favoring areas. Ahead of the upper trough axis,
isolated high-based thunderstorms are expected to develop east of
the Cascades and progress across the northern Rockies through the
day. With highly receptive fuels evident over a broad region, the
expansion of both Elevated and isolated dry thunderstorm highlights
seems warranted.

More modest adjustments were made to the Critical area across
northern Montana to reflect the latest guidance consensus. Parts of
far-north Montana into extreme northwest North Dakota will be
overspread by some of the stronger mid-level winds that are forecast
to mix down via a dry boundary layer. Widespread 20+ mph sustained
westerly surface winds and 15-20% RH are expected for at least a few
hours during the afternoon, warranting the maintenance of Critical
highlights.

..Squitieri.. 08/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0239 AM CDT Sun Aug 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
The breakdown of the western anticyclone will continue on Monday as
a lead mid-level speed maximum lifts through the northern Rockies
and a stronger mid-level trough moves into the Pacific Northwest
overnight Monday. Further east, across the central United States,
broadly cyclonic mid-level flow associated with a pocket of cooler
mid-level temperatures will persist.

... Wind/RH Area #1 -- Much of northern Montana and northern North
Dakota ...

The mid-level flow will strengthen on Monday as a lead speed maximum
moves from the interior Pacific Northwest into southern
Saskatchewan.  This belt of enhanced westerly flow will support
strong downslope flow in the lee of the northern Rockies across
Montana and North Dakota. The result will be gusty afternoon
westerly surface winds across these areas, potentially exceeding 30
mph. Additionally, adiabatic warming from the downsloping winds will
allow relative humidity to fall into the 10-15% range. The result is
elevated to critical fire conditions across these areas. At this
time, the most likely area for critical conditions will occur across
portions of north-central and northeast Montana, where the greatest
confidence and duration of hot, dry, and windy conditions will
occur.

... Wind/RH Area #2 -- North-central Oregon and South-central
Washington ...

In the wake of the departing mid-level speed maximum, winds will
temporarily relax early in the forecast period, before strengthening
again in response to the approaching stronger mid-level trough. This
strengthening flow will support an elevated risk of fire conditions
as surface winds strengthen to around 20 mph with gusts exceeding 30
mph locally. The mitigating factor is that cooler surface
temperatures than in previous days, owing to the lowering heights,
will support higher minimum relative humidity. Thus, despite
stronger winds than on Sunday/Day1, critical conditions should be
limited to isolated/brief areas.

... Wind/RH Area #3 -- Western Great Basin ...

The last vestiges of the weakening western ridge will be felt across
western portions of the Great Basin. Here, strong diurnal heating
will once again contribute to a deep, well-mixed boundary layer
allowing minimum relative humidity to fall into the low teens.
Surface troughing will increase in the lee of the Sierra on Monday
supporting an increase in surface winds over previous days. Although
sustained winds will likely remain in the 10-20 mph range, frequent
gusts approaching 30 mph will support elevated fire concerns.

... Dry Thunderstorm Area -- Northern Nevada, much of Idaho,
northwest Wyoming, and southwest Montana ...

Large-scale ascent associated with the approaching Pacific Northwest
mid-level trough should be sufficient to result in high-based
showers and thunderstorms across the area. Dry low levels and fast
storm motions should limit the potential for wetting rains and
support a risk for lightning-induced fire starts.

***Tropical Depression Grace expected to strengthen back to
tropical storm status over the Gulf of Mexico***
***Emerging North-Central U.S. Heavy Rain Threat ahead of cold
front and upper trough***


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A well defined upper level trough with potential for a cut-off low
should be in place across the Intermountain West and Northern
Rockies to begin the forecast period Thursday, and an upper level
ridge situated over the Southeast U.S. in the wake of Tropical
Storm Fred.  The upper trough then reaches the northern Plains and
drives a cold front and surface low eastward, with a building
ridge across the Northeast states.  A more robust ridge axis
developing over the Gulf Coast region will tend to steer Tropical
Storm Grace farther westward across the Gulf compared to the more
eastward track of Tropical Storm Fred.


...Model Analysis and preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite has come into better agreement for
the beginning of the period compared to the 12Z/18Z guidance.
Although still progressive with the northern trough, the GFS
slowed down from its 18Z run and closer to the model consensus.
The past two runs of the CMC have been more amplified with the
western to northern Plains trough, and is slower with the arrival
of the next trough across the Pacific Northwest by the end of the
forecast period.  There still remains significant model spread
with the path of Grace, with latest trends suggesting a more
southern track owing to the strength of the ridge to its north.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily derived from a 12Z
ECMWF/ECENS/UKMET blend along with a smaller portion of the 18Z
GFS and previous WPC continuity for the end of the week, and then
primarily ECMWF/ECENS/GEFS mean for next weekend.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

Residual tropical moisture from what will become the remnants of
Fred will fuel scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms
across the Northeast U.S. on Thursday prior to exiting the region,
along with some lingering showers on Wednesday.  Some instances of
flooding will be possible, particularly across areas that have
received above average rainfall already.  Moderate to heavy
rainfall is also becoming increasingly likely across portions of
the central/northern Plains to close out the work week, with the
potential for some scattered 1 to 3 inch totals where mesoscale
convective complexes develop.  Another corridor of enhanced
showers and storms may materialize across portions of the
Mid-South this weekend owing to a slow moving front in the
vicinity.

In the temperature department, expect readings to be up to 20
degrees below normal across portions of the northern Rockies and
western portions of the northern Plains for the end of the week,
and some high elevation snow for Wyoming and Montana is within the
realm of possibility.  Except for some slightly above average
temperatures across the Great Lakes and New England, no serious
heat waves are currently expected.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN MONTANA INTO NORTHWEST
NORTH DAKOTA...

...Synopsis...
A shortwave mid/upper-level trough is forecast to move from the
interior Northwest into parts of the Canadian Prairies and northern
Great Plains through the day and evening, as a stronger upper trough
begins to amplify over the Pacific Northwest and an upper ridge over
the Great Basin begins to weaken. A surface low is forecast to move
eastward across parts of SK/MB, as a trailing surface trough moves
through the northern Plains. A cold front will move into the
Northwest in conjunction with the amplifying upper trough.

...Montana/North Dakota - Wind/RH conditions...
While afternoon heating may be somewhat muted due to widespread
smoke, downslope flow and mixing/drying in the wake of the surface
trough will likely be sufficient to support critically low RH across
much of MT into the northern High Plains. Meanwhile, a belt of
modestly enhanced low-level westerly flow will support sustained
winds of 15-20 mph with higher gusts from northern MT into northwest
ND. This combination of wind/RH will result in a threat of critical
fire-weather conditions during the afternoon and early evening.

Further eastward across ND into northwest MN, there is greater
uncertainty regarding the eastward extent of RH reductions during
the afternoon, as a narrow low-level moist plume moves northward
ahead of the surface trough, but there is some potential for
elevated conditions to develop should sufficient heating/mixing
occur this afternoon.

...Interior Northwest into the Great Basin - Wind/RH conditions...
A general increase in low/midlevel flow is expected across a broad
area from the interior Northwest into parts of the Great Basin.
Elevated to locally critical conditions will be possible in
downslope-favored areas, where sustained winds of 15-20 mph (with
higher gusts) are possible concurrent with minimum RH values of
10-20%.

...Dry Thunderstorm Potential...
As the upper ridge breaks down, isolated thunderstorms will be
possible across a broad region from Nevada northeastward into
Montana. Thunderstorm coverage may be suppressed to some extent due
to negative impacts on heating/destabilization from widespread
smoke, but any thunderstorm activity will likely be rather dry and
pose a threat of ignitions due to very receptive fuel conditions. At
this time, the greatest relative coverage of thunderstorms is
expected from southwest into central MT, but uncertainty regarding
coverage to the west and rainfall potential to the east preclude an
upgrade to the dry-thunderstorm outlook at this time. Gusty and
erratic outflow winds will also be a threat from thunderstorms,
especially across parts of MT.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR ACROSS PARTS OF CENTRAL/NORTHERN
NEVADA...

...Synopsis...
An upper trough over the Northwest will continue to amplify as it
moves southeastward on Tuesday. Surface lows over the northern High
Plains and eastern Great Basin are forecast to deepen during the
day, as a cold front moves through parts of the interior Northwest
and northern Rockies.

...Parts of the interior Northwest and Great Basin - Wind/RH
conditions...
Elevated to potentially critical fire-weather conditions appear
likely on Tuesday across central/northern NV and adjacent portions
of northeast CA, southeast OR, and southwest ID. As stronger flow
associated with the deepening upper trough spreads over the region,
sustained winds are forecast to increase to 20-25 mph (with higher
gusts), as RH drops below critical criteria during the afternoon.
Portions of the critical area will see a wind shift from
west-southwesterly to northwesterly or northerly as the cold front
moves through, with critical conditions possible on either side of
the front.

...Northern Rockies/Northern Great Plains - Wind/RH conditions...
Elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions may develop
across portions of the northern Great Plains on Tuesday. Across the
Dakotas, low-level southerly flow will increase ahead of the surface
low, but some mixing/drying will be possible along the western flank
of returning moisture. Sustained winds may increase to 15-20 mph as
RH values drop into the 15-30% range, with the magnitude of RH
reduction depending on the extent to which smoke inhibits deep
mixing across the region. Elevated conditions will also be possible
within a dry and breezy post-frontal regime across northeast MT.

...Dry Thunderstorm Potential...
As the deepening upper trough moves eastward, thunderstorm
development is expected by late afternoon, with the greatest
coverage anticipated over parts of western/central MT. While much of
this thunderstorm activity is likely to produce at least some
rainfall, an isolated dry-thunderstorm area has been added due to
very receptive fuels and the potential for initial thunderstorm
activity to be rather dry.

...Tropical Storm Fred is forecast to make landfall over the
western Florida Panhandle today and bring heavy rain and flash
flooding, gusty winds, and dangerous storm surge...

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding are expected along a
slow-moving frontal system over the eastern Ohio Valley,
Appalachians, and the Mid-Atlantic...

...Oppressive heat, poor air quality, and fire weather concerns
continue for parts of the West today before a notable cooldown
Tuesday and Wednesday...

Tropical Storm Fred is forecast to continue tracking northward and
make landfall later today along the western Florida Panhandle.
Heavy rainfall and gusty winds can be expected along its track, as
well as potentially dangerous storm surge for coastal regions near
and to the east of landfall. Flash flooding is a threat with the
heavy rain, and a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall is in the
forecast for portions of the Florida Panhandle and southeastern
Alabama today and tonight, with a Slight Risk stretching farther
inland. Flash Flood Watches have also been issued. Trailing bands
of rain could affect the Florida Big Bend again on Tuesday and
cause flash flooding issues, even after Fred's center has moved
north. Fred's center is currently forecast to dissipate by
Wednesday morning.

As tropical moisture from Fred streams northward, it will feed
into a frontal system lifting slowly northward across the Ohio
Valley to the Mid-Atlantic. While much of the eastern third of the
U.S. should see rain and thunderstorms over the next couple of
days, the front should provide an additional place for the
moisture to focus, enhancing rainfall totals and the possibility
of flash flooding. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in place
through tonight from eastern portions of the Ohio Valley through
the Central Appalachians and portions of the Mid-Atlantic, where
scattered flash floods are possible. Then on Tuesday, as Fred
moves farther inland along with its associated moisture plume, a
large Slight Risk of excessive rainfall stretches from the
Southeast to southern portions of New York. In addition, a small
Moderate Risk area is delineated for parts of the Southern
Appalachians Tuesday into Tuesday night, as several inches of rain
could occur in areas of the mountains that are particularly
sensitive to heavy rainfall.

Another day of hotter than normal temperatures is forecast for
much of the West into the Northern Plains today. Highs topping
100F across much of California, the Central Great Basin, and into
the Northern High Plains have led to the issuance of Excessive
Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories for portions of these areas, and
some daily records have the potential to be set once again. The
heat will not be the only threat for these areas, as Elevated to
Critical Risks of fire weather are in place today and Tuesday,
along with the potential for additional fire ignitions from dry
thunderstorms. Air quality is already an issue over much of the
Northwest given smoke from fires and high ozone levels. However,
cooler temperatures creeping into the Pacific Northwest today is a
sign of what is to come on Tuesday and Wednesday--a potent cold
front pushed by an upper-level low that will bring cooler and
fresher air to the Northwest, as well as increasing rain chances
especially for the Northern Rockies on Tuesday. Meanwhile farther
south, cooler temperatures are expected over portions of the
Southwest into the Southern High Plains, along with the chance for
rain and thunderstorms as monsoonal moisture continues to stream
into the region. Flash floods are possible over the next couple
days, with Flash Flood Watches remaining in effect today over
southern Arizona and New Mexico, as well as into far western
Texas. A few strong to severe thunderstorms are also possible.

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Pacific Northwest through Thursday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southern Plains through Thursday morning...

...Rain and higher elevation snow over parts of the Pacific
Northwest, and Northern Rockies, Snow for the upper Midwest,
starting in earnest on Thursday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Pacific Northwest from Thursday into Friday morning...

Today, a front marching out of the Rockies will move to the Upper
Midwest and deepen as the storm moves across the Upper Great Lakes
by Friday.  Rain will develop over parts of the Northern Plains
and move into the Upper Mississippi Valley by Wednesday evening.
Showers and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the
front from parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley into the
Southern Plains.  Some of these thunderstorms will become severe.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains through Thursday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.

On Thursday into Friday, the severe thunderstorm thread ends.
However, showers and thunderstorms will develop over parts of the
Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys into the Western Gulf
Coast. Additionally, rain moves into the Great Lakes and the Ohio
Valley.  By Friday morning, the rain will move into parts of the
Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and the Southeast.  Moreover, snow will
develop over parts of the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley
today, yet confined to near the U. S./Canadian border.  On
Thursday, the snow will march southward over the Northern Plains
and the Upper Mississippi Valley.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy will produce snow over parts of the
Northern/Central Rockies today and rain over the lower elevations
of the Great Basin. Light snow showers continue over the Northern
Rockies through tonight. In the meantime, moisture from the
Pacific will start to stream into the Pacific Northwest. As a
result, rain will develop over parts of the Northwest that will
become heavier as the day goes on.  Appropriately, the WPC has
issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Northwest through Thursday morning.  The associated heavy rain
will create localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas
that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.  The excessive
rainfall threat increases on Thursday as more moisture streams
into the Northwest. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall on Thursday into Friday morning.  The heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.
Furthermore, snow will return to the Northern/Central Rockies
overnight Thursday into Friday morning.

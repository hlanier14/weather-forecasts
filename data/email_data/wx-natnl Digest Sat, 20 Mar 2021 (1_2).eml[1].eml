Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1035 AM CDT Fri Mar 19 2021

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track for possible locally Elevated
fire weather conditions across northern Minnesota today. Locally
Elevated conditions may also be observed across portions of southern
New Mexico into Far West Texas, as well as portions of eastern
Montana into the northern High Plains later this afternoon. In both
regions, RH may drop to near Critical values, but with sustained
wind speeds likely remaining below 15 mph, precluding Elevated
delineations. However, modest fuel receptiveness in both areas
suggest that some localized wildfire-spread potential exists.

..Squitieri.. 03/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1154 PM CDT Thu Mar 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper ridging will develop between a couple of longer-wave
systems - one along the East Coast and another along the West Coast.
 Meanwhile at the surface, high pressure will dominate across much
of the CONUS, with relatively light surface winds expected
especially in dry areas of the Southwest.  A few locally elevated
fire-weather conditions are possible across northern Minnesota this
afternoon where 20-25% RH values will combined with a few areas of
15 mph surface winds. Larger-scale critical fire weather will remain
minimal today, however.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 19 2021

SYNOPSIS: A surface low pressure system is forecast to lift from the Plains
through the Great Lakes early in Week-2. Mid-level high pressure is forecas=
t
to
persist over the northeastern Pacific, keeping the primary storm track and =
any
associated heavy rain or high wind threats shifted northward into Canada an=
d
away from the Lower 48 states. Some below-normal temperatures are anticipat=
ed
for western parts of the country, although warming climatological values li=
mit
concerns regarding any cold-related hazards. Model guidance is beginning to
show a possible increase in mid-level low pressure over Alaska for Week-2.

HAZARDS

No hazards are depicted in today's outlook as odds are not anticipated to
reach
pre-defined criteria during the forecast period at this time.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MARCH 22 - FRIDAY MARCH 26:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!rFDEaqt868yn437xB3uc18oxXM58qtA3qI9eTzNnLeNnGoMvmBs7slaVTtMud=
BS9xE-ZV-nO$

FOR SATURDAY MARCH 27 - FRIDAY APRIL 02: As has been the case throughout th=
e
week, model guidance continues to be inconsistent in the handling of surfac=
e
low pressure systems over the Central U.S. Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble
means show a surface low tracking from near the Oklahoma Panhandle on the 2=
7th
to the Great Lakes the following day, before shifting near the Ontario/Queb=
ec
border on the 29th. Looking closer reveals substantial spread as early as t=
he
27th, with the 6Z GEFS members placing the surface low anywhere from southe=
rn
New Mexico northeastward through northern Iowa (approximately 900 miles
apart).
The track of the system is fairly displaced from the Gulf of Mexico, which
should help to limit heavy rainfall concerns. Uncalibrated ECMWF rainfall
totals have a 10-20% chance of exceeding an inch on the 29th for a region
focused on the Southern Appalachians. Calibrated guidance is less enthusias=
tic
about heavy rain, likely due to the aforementioned model spread concerns.



Week-2 mean fields continue to feature anomalous 500-hPa ridging over the
northeastern Pacific and associated surface high pressure well west of the
Oregon/California border. This setup favors a northward displacement of the
Pacific storm track toward Canada while the CONUS remains fairly dry. There
are
some weak transient cold signals across the West linked to anomalous northe=
rly
flow east of the surface high in calibrated reforecast guidance, although
warming climatological minimum temperatures limit concern that any of these
signals are actually hazardous. Low-level flow forecast by the ECMWF model
across Northern and Central California during Week-2 is east-northeasterly
which would support some downslope wind potential and associated fire weath=
er
concerns. Conversely, the GEFS persists in having a more northerly componen=
t
to
the flow across California that would limit high wind considerations.



For Alaska, model guidance has backed off the trend of amplifying the
anomalous
500-hPa ridging over the northeastern Pacific in recent days, with today's =
0Z
ensemble suite instead showing more robust troughing across Alaska. This
reduces confidence in above-normal temperatures, although it remains to be
seen
if these model runs are more of a correction by model guidance with the pri=
or
ridging forecasts being overdone or a substantive trend toward a cooler
pattern
in the long-term. This troughing for Alaska would also support a more activ=
e
storm track for the Gulf of Alaska than anticipated recently, with onshore
flow
persisting from the Bering Sea as well. Despite this, no systems approach
Alaskan hazards criteria during Week-2. In the longer term, the relatively
cool
and wet pattern could increase snow water across the mainland leading to
increased flooding concerns during eventual river ice break up later in Apr=
il.

...Overview...

Guidance continues to show a broad mean trough aloft settling over
the lower 48, between a strong eastern Pacific ridge and western
Atlantic mean ridge that will become anchored by a strengthening
upper high over Cuba and the Bahamas by mid-late week. Ahead of
the mean trough expect an active weather pattern over the central
and eastern U.S. with multiple areas of heavy rainfall potential
over the course of next week. Pacific features digging into the
western side of the mean trough will bring periods of rain and
mountain snow to locations from the Pacific Northwest into a
majority of the Rockies. Finally, the upper trough with possible
embedded low forecast to be over the East Coast to start the week
should gradually progress to the east/northeast, pushing along
associated western Atlantic low pressure.  Models and ensembles
continue to agree on the large scale pattern while differing on
some meaningful timing and detail issues.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The system initially off the East Coast continues to provide a
challenge for the guidance and predictability is still tempered by
the fact that the upper support essentially becomes embedded
within the larger scale western Atlantic mean ridge. GFS runs are
persistent in being more offshore than other guidance due to
extending the upper trough farther eastward, while remaining
solutions still vary considerably. At least the new 12Z UKMET has
adjusted southeastward toward the general consensus in contrast to
its previous two northward runs that greater influence on New
England. Preference remains close to continuity as yielded by a
multi-model compromise.

The next system of note is a vigorous shortwave ejecting out of
the Rockies on Monday and reaching into the Upper Midwest by
midweek, supporting surface low pressure that tracks northeast
from the southern High Plains. Trends over the past day or so have
been toward a more concentrated evolution by day 4 Tuesday and
then toward the middle of recent spread by day 5 Wednesday (by way
of the deep GFS trending a little weaker and earlier ECMWF runs
becoming stronger). There is still a fair amount of timing spread
with the GFS/GEFS consistently on the fast side and the UKMET
lagging.

Guidance seems to be in a gradual process of trying to converge
for the next system digging through the West. The most common
theme is that the energy will form a closed low just south of the
Four Corners by early Wednesday and then open up as it ejects to
the east and northeast, encouraging a surface wave to lift
northeastward from the western Gulf Coast late in the week. Among
solutions through the 06Z cycle, the primary cluster appeared to
center over the 00Z ECMWF mean, an average of the past two ECMWF
runs (00Z faster, 12Z/18 run slower), and 00Z CMC/06Z parallel
GFS. Operational GFS runs have been faster with somewhat more
stream separation than indicated by consensus. New 12Z GFS/CMC
runs are now close to each other by 12Z next Friday and a bit
faster than the aforementioned majority/preferred cluster. The new
12Z ECMWF nearly duplicates its 00Z run.

Upstream Pacific energy should dig into the West during the latter
half of next week, with a general model/mean blend providing a
reasonable starting point and good continuity. Stream separation
that occurs over the North Pacific early in the period provides
some lingering uncertainty over specifics (especially in the 12Z
UKMET and to a lesser degree in the CMC).

Guidance preferences led to an early-period blend that leaned
mostly away from the GFS for the western Atlantic and Plains/Upper
Midwest systems, followed by a transition to an average among the
past two ECMWF runs, 00Z CMC/06Z GFSP, and more 00Z ECMWF mean
than 06Z GEFS mean.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The developing mean trough aloft with periodic reinforcement will
bring below normal temperatures over much of the West into the
Rockies during most of next week. Expect coolest temperatures to
be Monday-Wednesday with highs 10-15F below normal over parts of
the Great Basin and central-southern Rockies. Many areas will see
a moderating trend after midweek but another cold front may
reinforce minus 5-10F anomalies for highs from the Northwest into
central Rockies. Incoming shortwaves/leading surface fronts will
bring periods of rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest
and extending eastward/southeastward through the West into the
Rockies as the shortwaves amplify. Most of this activity should be
of light to moderate intensity but some localized heavier areas
will be possible.

The upper dynamics ejecting from the Rockies will support a
central Plains through Upper Midwest system early-mid week. This
system may produce a focused area of enhanced snowfall over or
near the Colorado Rockies (the majority likely to be just before
the medium range period early Monday). Lighter snow is possible on
the northwest fringe of the precipitation shield from the central
High Plains northeastward on the cold side of the surface low
track. Farther south, improving Gulf inflow should promote areas
of heavy rainfall from the central Plains/Midwest into the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast with lighter rainfall extending
northeastward. Recent guidance has been highlighting the potential
for highest rainfall totals near the central/east-central Gulf
Coast around midweek as the front trailing from the Midwest system
decelerates/stalls while awaiting the next western U.S. shortwave.
This latter ejecting western energy should generate a late week
system that lifts northeastward over the east-central U.S.,
spreading areas of enhanced rainfall over a greater portion of the
East. Latest trends for the western Atlantic system have lowered
the rainfall amounts for some locations along the East Coast from
Monday onward. Some areas may still see a period of brisk winds as
supported by the gradient between the system and high pressure to
the north.

Warmest temperature anomalies will progress from the
Midwest/western Great Lakes into the Northeast over the course of
next week. These areas should see one or more days with highs of
10-20F above normal. Morning lows will be somewhat more above
normal with greater southward extent of plus 10F and greater
anomalies over the eastern half of the country, aided by the moist
flow from the Gulf. High temperature anomalies of plus 5-10F over
Florida later in the week are less impressive in absolute terms
but readings could be warm enough to approach daily record values
for some sites with relatively shorter periods of record.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri March 19 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 25 - 29 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa flo=
w
pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day
period. Dynamical models forecast a 500-hPa trough over the Bering Sea with
associated below normal heights extending across much of Alaska. A separate
trough or closed upper low is forecast in the southern stream north of Hawa=
ii,
and amplified ridging is predicted farther to the east over the Northern
Pacific. Downstream, a trough is forecast over the central CONUS and a ridg=
e
is
favored over the eastern CONUS and the Northern Atlantic. The manual height
blend depicts negative height anomalies over the central CONUS and most of
Mainland Alaska. Positive height anomalies are forecast over the eastern an=
d
western CONUS, the Alaska Peninsula, the Aleutians, and the Alaska Panhandl=
e.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across parts of
California associated with above normal heights. Troughing predicted over t=
he
central CONUS favors below normal temperatures across the western CONUS to =
the
High Plains. Above normal temperatures are favored for east of the Mississi=
ppi
River ahead of predicted troughing. Forecast surface low pressure systems o=
ver
southern Alaska during the 6-10 day period increase the odds of near to bel=
ow
normal temperatures.

Strong westerly mid-level flow continues to favor above normal precipitatio=
n
for Alaska.
Enhanced ridging over the Northern Pacific is expected to suppress Pacific
flow
across the western CONUS, leading to elevated chances of below normal
precipitation. Farther to east, increased odds of above normal precipitatio=
n
are indicated across parts of the Northern Rockies, underneath the predicte=
d
mean trough. Above normal precipitation is also favored ahead of this troug=
h
across the eastern CONUS. Exceptions are for parts of the Southern Rockies =
and
Great Plains, where below normal precipitation is favored, consistent with =
the
consolidation forecast tool.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset by increasing uncertainty=
 in
regards to the temperature forecast over the CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 27 - APR 02, 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is forecast to shift
eastward and deamplify compared to the 6-10 day period. A 500-hPa trough is
forecast across the central CONUS with associated below normal heights
predicted for the Great Lakes Region. Above normal heights are forecast ove=
r
much of the remainder of the CONUS due to an eastward progressing ridge.
roughing is forecast across Alaska, with the manual blend depicting above
normal heights across southern Alaska, while near to  below normal heights =
are
likely over northern and central Alaska.

Forecast troughing leads to increased chances of near to below normal
temperatures across Alaska. Troughing favors below normal temperatures acro=
ss
the Northwest CONUS, and the Northern Rockies to the Central High Plains.
Elevated chances of above normal temperatures are forecast across the easte=
rn
third of the CONUS ahead of the mean trough. Near to above normal temperatu=
res
are more likely for the southwestern CONUS due to ridging and associated ab=
ove
normal heights.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across much of Ala=
ska
due to predicted enhanced westerly mid-level flow. Suppressed Pacific flow
across the western CONUS elevates chances of below normal precipitation.
Downstream of the 500-hPa trough, above normal precipitation is favored for
parts of the Northeast, while below normal precipitation is slightly favore=
d
for much of the southeastern CONUS.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0231 PM CDT Fri Mar 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

Widespread high-end Elevated conditions are expected across much of
central New Mexico tomorrow, with the latest guidance consensus
depicting 15-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds
overlapping with 10-20% RH through mid to late afternoon. At least
locally Critical conditions are expected. However, while fuels are
near critically dry in spots, receptiveness to fire spread for some
fuels in other areas (particularly in higher terrain) remains more
mediocre. Since Critical meteorological conditions may not be
widespread for long periods of time, and given the patchy nature of
the receptive fuels, Critical fire weather highlights have been
withheld. Critical highlights may be introduced in future outlooks
should guidance consensus trend any windier/drier.

An Elevated area has also been introduced to portions of the Upper
Mississippi Valley. Sustained winds around 15 mph are expected to
overlap with 20-30% RH around afternoon peak heating. While points
within the Elevated area may struggle to sustain Elevated criteria
for multiple hours, finer fuels are at least marginally receptive to
fire spread given abnormally dry conditions, warranting Elevated
highlights.

..Squitieri.. 03/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1154 PM CDT Thu Mar 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
Somewhat faster flow aloft will extend along an axis from the Desert
Southwest to the north-central U.S. on D2/Sat as a longwave trough
makes steady eastward progress into the Intermountain West.  This
wave will induce lee surface troughing along the High Plains, which
will act to increase surface flow in areas of New Mexico and
Colorado.  Most fire-weather concerns will be tied to the increase
in surface flow amid dry (and locally drought-stricken) areas.

...Portions of New Mexico and Colorado...
The aforementioned flow pattern will assist in spreading areas of
15-25 mph surface flow (with higher gusts) across much of the region
during peak heating hours.  The flow will occur within a continued
dry airmass, with near-critical RH values expected across the region
at times (around 12-20%).  At this time, an elevated delineation has
been drawn across much of New Mexico and portions of southeastern
Colorado.  Fuels in localized areas of Colorado will need to cure in
the wake of recent snowfall, which may temper the threat in
localized areas.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
341 PM EDT Fri Mar 19 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Mar 22 2021 - 12Z Fri Mar 26 2021

...Overview...

Guidance continues to show a broad mean trough aloft settling over
the lower 48, between a strong eastern Pacific ridge and western
Atlantic mean ridge that will become anchored by a strengthening
upper high over Cuba and the Bahamas by mid-late week. Ahead of
the mean trough expect an active weather pattern over the central
and eastern U.S. with multiple areas of heavy rainfall potential
over the course of next week. Pacific features digging into the
western side of the mean trough will bring periods of rain and
mountain snow to locations from the Pacific Northwest into a
majority of the Rockies. Finally, the upper trough with possible
embedded low forecast to be over the East Coast to start the week
should gradually progress to the east/northeast, pushing along
associated western Atlantic low pressure.  Models and ensembles
continue to agree on the large scale pattern while differing on
some meaningful timing and detail issues.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The system initially off the East Coast continues to provide a
challenge for the guidance and predictability is still tempered by
the fact that the upper support essentially becomes embedded
within the larger scale western Atlantic mean ridge. GFS runs are
persistent in being more offshore than other guidance due to
extending the upper trough farther eastward, while remaining
solutions still vary considerably. At least the new 12Z UKMET has
adjusted southeastward toward the general consensus in contrast to
its previous two northward runs that greater influence on New
England. Preference remains close to continuity as yielded by a
multi-model compromise.

The next system of note is a vigorous shortwave ejecting out of
the Rockies on Monday and reaching into the Upper Midwest by
midweek, supporting surface low pressure that tracks northeast
from the southern High Plains. Trends over the past day or so have
been toward a more concentrated evolution by day 4 Tuesday and
then toward the middle of recent spread by day 5 Wednesday (by way
of the deep GFS trending a little weaker and earlier ECMWF runs
becoming stronger). There is still a fair amount of timing spread
with the GFS/GEFS consistently on the fast side and the UKMET
lagging.

Guidance seems to be in a gradual process of trying to converge
for the next system digging through the West. The most common
theme is that the energy will form a closed low just south of the
Four Corners by early Wednesday and then open up as it ejects to
the east and northeast, encouraging a surface wave to lift
northeastward from the western Gulf Coast late in the week. Among
solutions through the 06Z cycle, the primary cluster appeared to
center over the 00Z ECMWF mean, an average of the past two ECMWF
runs (00Z faster, 12Z/18 run slower), and 00Z CMC/06Z parallel
GFS. Operational GFS runs have been faster with somewhat more
stream separation than indicated by consensus. New 12Z GFS/CMC
runs are now close to each other by 12Z next Friday and a bit
faster than the aforementioned majority/preferred cluster. The new
12Z ECMWF nearly duplicates its 00Z run.

Upstream Pacific energy should dig into the West during the latter
half of next week, with a general model/mean blend providing a
reasonable starting point and good continuity. Stream separation
that occurs over the North Pacific early in the period provides
some lingering uncertainty over specifics (especially in the 12Z
UKMET and to a lesser degree in the CMC).

Guidance preferences led to an early-period blend that leaned
mostly away from the GFS for the western Atlantic and Plains/Upper
Midwest systems, followed by a transition to an average among the
past two ECMWF runs, 00Z CMC/06Z GFSP, and more 00Z ECMWF mean
than 06Z GEFS mean.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The developing mean trough aloft with periodic reinforcement will
bring below normal temperatures over much of the West into the
Rockies during most of next week. Expect coolest temperatures to
be Monday-Wednesday with highs 10-15F below normal over parts of
the Great Basin and central-southern Rockies. Many areas will see
a moderating trend after midweek but another cold front may
reinforce minus 5-10F anomalies for highs from the Northwest into
central Rockies. Incoming shortwaves/leading surface fronts will
bring periods of rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest
and extending eastward/southeastward through the West into the
Rockies as the shortwaves amplify. Most of this activity should be
of light to moderate intensity but some localized heavier areas
will be possible.

The upper dynamics ejecting from the Rockies will support a
central Plains through Upper Midwest system early-mid week. This
system may produce a focused area of enhanced snowfall over or
near the Colorado Rockies (the majority likely to be just before
the medium range period early Monday). Lighter snow is possible on
the northwest fringe of the precipitation shield from the central
High Plains northeastward on the cold side of the surface low
track. Farther south, improving Gulf inflow should promote areas
of heavy rainfall from the central Plains/Midwest into the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast with lighter rainfall extending
northeastward. Recent guidance has been highlighting the potential
for highest rainfall totals near the central/east-central Gulf
Coast around midweek as the front trailing from the Midwest system
decelerates/stalls while awaiting the next western U.S. shortwave.
This latter ejecting western energy should generate a late week
system that lifts northeastward over the east-central U.S.,
spreading areas of enhanced rainfall over a greater portion of the
East. Latest trends for the western Atlantic system have lowered
the rainfall amounts for some locations along the East Coast from
Monday onward. Some areas may still see a period of brisk winds as
supported by the gradient between the system and high pressure to
the north.

Warmest temperature anomalies will progress from the
Midwest/western Great Lakes into the Northeast over the course of
next week. These areas should see one or more days with highs of
10-20F above normal. Morning lows will be somewhat more above
normal with greater southward extent of plus 10F and greater
anomalies over the eastern half of the country, aided by the moist
flow from the Gulf. High temperature anomalies of plus 5-10F over
Florida later in the week are less impressive in absolute terms
but readings could be warm enough to approach daily record values
for some sites with relatively shorter periods of record.

...A storm system will continue to overspread the western U.S.
bringing rain and snow...

...Mild to warm temperatures forecast across the Southwest,
central, and northeastern U.S. through the weekend...

The low pressure system responsible for the recent widespread
severe weather, heavy rain, and wintry precipitation across the
eastern U.S. the past couple of days has moved offshore into the
Atlantic. Gusty winds behind the system will continue along the
East Coast through Saturday morning. A trailing cold front
extending westward across the Florida Peninsula into the Gulf of
Mexico will push southward overnight bringing cooler than average
temperatures to the Southeast and a slight chance of light
showers. A low pressure center will develop off the east coast of
Florida Saturday afternoon increasing the chance of rain along the
Florida coast and extending northward to the Carolinas. The
heaviest rain will likely remain offshore.

Across the western half of the country, a cold front is slowly
progressing eastward from the northern High Plains southwestward
through the Great Basin and southern California. Lower elevation
rain and mountain snow will continue overnight Friday for the
Pacific Northwest, Intermountain West, Northern Rockies, and
California. Several more inches of snow are likely for portions of
the Cascades in Washington and central Sierra Nevada Mountains.
Areas of rain in the Great Basin will changeover to snow
throughout the day Saturday as colder air pushes eastward behind
the cold front. Rain chances in the northern High Plains and snow
chances in the Central Rockies will increase throughout the day
Saturday as well. The northern Teton Mountains will see the
greatest snow accumulations with more than a half foot of snow
possible. By Sunday evening, the cold front will move into the
Midwest and Central Plains with light rain showers possible from
Minnesota southwestward through Kansas. A low pressure center will
develop in the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles in the lee of the
Rockies bringing an increasing chance for rain across the central
High Plains and snow for the Colorado Front Range.

Cooler high temperatures are likely for the Northern Rockies and
Intermountain West Saturday and the Central Rockies by Sunday as
the western cold front moves eastward. Ahead of the storm system
in the west, seasonably mild temperatures are forecast for the
Southwest and the Central and Southern Plains, with above average
temperatures likely for the Northern Plains. As high pressure
builds in across the Northeast behind the departing eastern storm
system, mild temperatures are also forecast to spread across the
Midwest and Northeast through the weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0113 AM CDT Sat Mar 20 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
A positive tilt, long-wave trough will emerge across the
Intermountain West and northern High Plains over the course of the
forecast period.  This wave will encourage lee troughing and
strengthening of low-level wind fields from the Texas/New Mexico
High Plains north-northeastward to the Upper Midwest.  Despite
trajectories that would ordinarily favor moisture advection, dry air
remaining in the wake of the prior system will allow for areas of
elevated fire-weather conditions to develop especially across the
southern Rockies/Plains and portions of the upper Midwest.

...Southern Rockies/Plains...
Steepening surface pressure gradient associated with lee troughing
will allow for several areas of 15-25 mph surface winds across broad
areas of New Mexico and southeastern Colorado.  This flow will occur
within a dry airmass, with areas of critically low RH values
developing for a few hours during peak heating, though most areas
should only flirt with 15% RH values based on latest model progs.
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions are possible where
fuels are dry, though some areas in the High Plains have experienced
wetting precipitation recently that may render fuel states
unfavorable for large fires.

...Iowa, Wisconsin, and eastern Minnesota...
This region will reside on the eastern extent of stronger wind
fields across the northern/central Plains.  Nevertheless, areas of
15-25 mph surface winds (strongest in Iowa) are expected to develop
over the course of the afternoon and RH values fall into the 20-30%
range.  Where fuels are dry, elevated fire weather is expected.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0115 AM CDT Sat Mar 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
A trough over the southwestern U.S. will amplify while migrating
toward the Lower Colorado River Valley by early evening.  This will
result in a belt of strong (40-70 kt) mid-level flow from Arizona
through the southern and central High Plains.  At the surface, a low
will gradually organize along the New Mexico/Texas border region
during the forecast period.  Near/west of this low, dry and breezy
conditions will develop along with elevated to near-critical fire
weather.

...Eastern Arizona to far west Texas...
A broad region of westerly surface flow (with speeds of 15-25 mph)
will develop during peak heating hours Sunday. This flow will occur
within a dry airmass across the region with many areas of RH values
at or below 15% at times during the afternoon.  With areas of dry
fuels and ongoing drought, elevated to locally critical fire-weather
is expected.  There are a couple of limiting factors, however.  Many
areas may not experience sub-15% RH values.  Additionally, ERCs are
not particularly high in several areas.  Nevertheless, the most
likely region for critical fire weather is southwestern New Mexico,
and an upgrade may be needed there in subsequent outlooks.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
222 AM EDT Sat Mar 20 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Mar 23 2021 - 12Z Sat Mar 27 2021

...Overview...

The guidance continues to show a broad mean trough aloft settling
over the Central U.S. through much of the medium range period with
several embedded quick moving shortwaves. Ahead of this mean
trough, an active weather pattern is expected with heavy rainfall
potential from the Gulf Coast into the East. Shortwave energy
digging into the western side of the trough should also bring
periods of rain and mountain snow across parts of the West. Models
and ensembles continue to agree on the overall large scale
pattern, but differ on some meaningful timing and detail issues.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A vigorous shortwave ejecting out into the Upper Midwest on
Tuesday, will support surface low pressure that tracks northeast
from the Central Plains. Models have come into better agreement
regarding strength and timing of this system so a multi-model
blend should suffice. Meanwhile, another shortwave will dig
through the West with a possible closed low over the Four Corners
region early Wednesday, before opening back up as it lifts to the
northeast thereafter. The GFS is a notable outlier, now lagging
well behind the majority of the guidance. A blend away from the
GFS is preferred. This does result in a faster progression of the
cold front across the Eastern U.S. compared to previous
continuity, but this is supported by recent trends in both the
ECMWF and the CMC (as well as ensemble means). Finally, amplifying
shortwave energy into the Southwest U.S. late week continues to
offer some degree of uncertainty. Interestingly enough, the GFS is
quite a bit faster/weaker than the ECMWF/CMC and means so again, a
blend away from the GFS is a good starting point.

Overall, guidance preferences led to an early-period blend leaning
mostly on the deterministic guidance (away from the GFS). After
day 5, increasing weighting of the ensemble means was used to
mitigate the late period timing and detail differences, while
still including some deterministic ECMWF/CMC just for better
feature definition.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The developing mean trough aloft with periodic reinforcement will
bring below normal temperatures over much of the West into the
Rockies during most of next week. Expect coolest temperatures to
be Tuesday-Wednesday with highs 10-15F below normal over parts of
the Great Basin and central-southern Rockies. Many areas will see
a moderating trend after midweek but another cold front may
reinforce minus 5-10F anomalies for highs from the Northwest into
central Rockies. Incoming shortwaves/leading surface fronts will
bring periods of rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest
and extending eastward/southeastward through the West into the
Rockies as the shortwaves amplify. Most of this activity should be
of light to moderate intensity but some localized heavier areas
will be possible, especially across parts of the Colorado Rockies
Tuesday into Wednesday.

The upper dynamics ejecting from the Rockies will support an
organized system lifting through the Upper Midwest early to
mid-week dragging a cold front eastward. North and west of the
surface low, some light snowfall could fall in the sufficiently
colder airmass. To the south, improving Gulf of Mexico inflow
should promote areas of heavy rainfall from the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Gulf Coast with lighter rainfall extending northeastward.
Recent guidance continues to highlight the potential for highest
rainfall totals near the central/east-central Gulf Coast around
midweek as the front trailing from the Upper Midwest system
decelerates/stalls while awaiting the next western U.S. shortwave.
This latter ejecting western energy should generate another late
week system that lifts northeastward over the east-central U.S.,
spreading areas of enhanced rainfall into a greater portion of the
East.

Warmest temperature anomalies will progress from the
Midwest/western Great Lakes into the Northeast over the course of
next week. These areas should see one or more days with highs of
10-20F above normal. Morning lows will be somewhat more above
normal with greater southward extent of plus 10F and greater
anomalies over the eastern half of the country, aided by the moist
flow from the Gulf.

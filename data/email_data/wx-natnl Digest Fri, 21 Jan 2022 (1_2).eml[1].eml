30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR FEBRUARY 2022

La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions persist across the equatorial Pacific, =
with persistent
negative SST anomalies in recent weeks over much of the east-central Pacifi=
c
Ocean. Convection continues to be suppressed near the Date Line. Low-level
easterly winds are enhanced over parts of the east-central and eastern
equatorial Pacific Ocean, while upper-level westerly winds are enhanced acr=
oss
most of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The RMM-based Mad=
den
Julian Oscillation (MJO) index indicates MJO conditions have weakened, and
there is no clear MJO signal in most dynamical model forecasts. The ECMWF a=
nd
CFSv2 however forecast a potential reemergence of the active phase of the M=
JO
in the western Pacific in the next couple weeks. Though La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDa is forecasted
to persist into boreal spring, dynamical model forecasts for the next sever=
al
weeks into the beginning of February are inconsistent with a canonical La
Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
pattern. However, given uncertainty in subseasonal variability later in
February, the La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa base state and typical impacts of La=
 Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa are
reflected
in the dynamical model temperature and precipitation forecasts for February
and
play a significant role in the February temperature and precipitation
outlooks.
The February 2022 monthly temperature and precipitation outlooks are based
primarily on dynamical model forecast guidance from the North America
Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and statistical forecast guidance, including th=
e
constructed analog, canonical correlation analysis, and ENSO-OCN tools. Bot=
h
dynamical and statistical models are largely forced by persistent La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
conditions. Although La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions are expected to tr=
ansition to ENSO
neutral conditions in the late spring, February climate conditions are
expected
to be impacted by La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa. In addition, the outlooks for s=
ome areas of the
forecast domain consider current land surface soil moisture and snow cover =
and
nearby ocean surface temperatures.



The February 2022 temperature outlook favors below-normal temperatures for =
the
south coast of Alaska east of the Alaska Peninsula, southeastern Mainland
Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle, supported by dynamical model guidance fro=
m
the NMME, as well as the consolidation of statistical and dynamical
temperature
tools. Below-normal temperatures are also favored for parts of Northern
California, the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, and the northern H=
igh
Plains, consistent with canonical La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts. Statist=
ical guidance and
the
latest CFSv2 dynamical model forecasts suggest the potential for more
extensive
below-normal temperatures into the Northern Plains and Midwest region,
reflecting potential impacts of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa. The potential for=
 larger scale
below-normal temperatures into the Midwest is also associated with the
possible
reemergence of Western Pacific MJO activity. This pattern of large-scale
below-normal temperatures is inconsistent with the consolidated NMME foreca=
st,
as well as the consolidation of both statistical and dynamical model guidan=
ce,
which favor above-normal temperatures for much of the central and eastern
CONUS. The February outlook favors above-normal temperatures across much of
the
southwestern CONUS from Southern California across the Southern and Central
Rockies into the Southern and Central Plains, supported by both NMME dynami=
cal
model forecasts and the consolidation. Above-normal temperatures are favore=
d
for parts of the Lower and Central Mississippi Valley, eastern areas of the
Midwest, and the Eastern Seaboard, primarily supported by dynamical model
forecasts from the NMME. Probabilities of above-normal temperatures are
greatest, exceeding 50 percent, from parts of the Southwest along the Rio
Grande Valley and Gulf Coast to the Florida Peninsula, as well as for much =
of
the Northeast, where dynamical model forecasts are consistent. A large area=
 of
equal chances of below-, near-, and above-normal temperatures is predicted =
for
much of the Northern Plains and western Great Lakes region, where there is
inconsistency among temperature tools.



The February outlook favors above-normal precipitation for northwestern
Mainland Alaska and below-normal precipitation for the south coast of Mainl=
and
Alaska and parts of the northern Alaska Panhandle, supported by dynamical
model
forecasts and consistent with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts. Dynamical m=
odels predict
above-normal precipitation for parts of the Alaska Panhandle early in the
month, resulting in a forecast of equal chances in the February outlook.
Above-normal precipitation is favored for much of the Pacific Northwest
eastward across the Northern Rockies into the northern High Plains, consist=
ent
with most dynamical and statistical model forecasts and canonical La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
impacts. Above-normal precipitation is also likely from the Central
Mississippi
and Ohio Valleys northward across most of the Great Lakes region, following
canonical La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa patterns and the consolidation of precip=
itation forecast
tools. Below-normal precipitation is likely across the southern tier of the
CONUS, including most of the Southwest, parts of the Southern Plains, the G=
ulf
Coast, the southern Atlantic coast, and the Florida Peninsula. The February
precipitation outlook generally reflects canonical precipitation patterns d=
ue
to La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa. Equal chances of below-, near-, and above-norm=
al precipitation is
predicted where there is greater uncertainty among precipitation tools.

An updated monthly outlook... for Feb will be issued on Mon January 31 2022

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1991-2020 base period.

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EST Thu Jan 20 2022

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

The February-March-April (FMA) 2022 temperature outlook favors above-normal
seasonal mean temperatures from the Southwest, across the Central and South=
ern
Plains, to the entire eastern third of the contiguous U.S. The largest
probabilities (above 60 percent) for above-normal temperatures are forecast
across the Rio Grande Valley. Probabilities of below-normal temperatures ar=
e
elevated for parts of the northern Rockies, Pacific Northwest, northern
California, and much of Alaska. The FMA 2022 precipitation outlook favors
below-normal seasonal precipitation amounts from southern California and th=
e
Southwest to the central and southern Great Plains, then east to parts of t=
he
Southeast. Below-normal precipitation is slightly favored for most of coast=
al
southern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Above-normal seasonal
precipitation amounts are most likely across the Great Lakes, Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys, northern Rockies, Pacific Northwest, and much of norther=
n
and western Mainland Alaska. Equal chances (EC) are forecast among areas wh=
ere
seasonal mean temperatures and seasonal accumulated precipitation amounts a=
re
expected to be similar to climatological probabilities.

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

Oceanic and atmospheric observations reflect La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa condi=
tions. In December
2021, below-average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) across the central and
eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean were consistent with a mature La Ni=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDa. With
the exception of the westernmost Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo-4 region, which warm=
ed to -0.2=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDC at
the
end of the December, the other Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo indices were between -=
0.4=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDC and -1.1=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDC
during the first week of Jan 2022. Below-average subsurface temperatures
weakened east of the Date Line, reflecting the slow eastward movement of
positive temperature anomalies, at depth, from the western into the central
Pacific Ocean. However, below-average subsurface temperatures still dominat=
ed
the eastern Tropical Pacific from ~200m to the surface. Low-level easterly
wind
anomalies and upper-level westerly wind anomalies prevailed over the
east-central and eastern Pacific Ocean. Enhanced convection persisted near
Indonesia and the western Pacific, while suppressed convection remained ove=
r
the Date Line.



The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) weakened during early Jan after slow
propagating across the Western Pacific during December. Destructive

interference with the ongoing La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa has likely resulted =
in the weakening,
though the Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo4 SST index was also likely slightly warmer=
 due to this

interaction. The MJO is not likely to play a large role in the observed
seasonal patterns of temperature and precipitation.



PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

The CPC SST consolidation for the Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo-3.4 region depicts =
negative SST
anomalies remaining at or below -0.5 degrees C through FMA and then near

average from the late spring through the summer and autumn of 2022. The Nor=
th
American Multi Model Ensemble (NMME) ensemble mean forecast for the Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo-3.4
SST anomaly depicts a slightly slower transition to near average during the
next six months. The official CPC/IRI ENSO outlook is for La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDa to continue
into the Northern Hemisphere spring (67% chance during MAM 2022) and then
transition to ENSO-neutral (51% chance during AMJ 2022).



PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Dynamical model guidance such as the North American Multi-Model Ensemble
(NMME)
and the Calibration, Bridging, and Merging (CBaM) version of the NMME were
used
through lead 5.  La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa temperature and precipitation com=
posites were a
major
tool relied upon through MAM 2022. The consolidation tool, which includes N=
MME
input and various statistical tools, was also used especially after the
predicted transition to ENSO-neutral conditions by late spring. At longer
leads, such as 7-13 (ASO 2022 - FMA 2023), trends (as represented by OCN)
played a larger role.



PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - FMA 2022 TO FMA 2023

TEMPERATURE

Only minor adjustments were made to the previous temperature outlooks,
released
in Dec 2021, as La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa continues to be the major contribu=
tor to the
predicted
climate state during FMA and MAM 2022. Odds for above normal temperatures w=
ere
decreased across Southern CA and Arizona, reflecting the latest model guida=
nce
and consolidations. Odds for above normal temperatures were increased in th=
e
Rio Grande, as the confidence around La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa and the corre=

odds for below normal temperatures were increased for parts of southeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Through the spring of 2022, odds =
for
above normal temperatures were increased across much of the Upper Mississip=

Valley in response to the latest model guidance and a current lack of

which is not likely to recover dramatically. This outlook is contrary to th=

reflecting OCN based information.



PRECIPITATION

The precipitation outlooks for FMA and MAM 2022 are consistent with La Ni=

composites and recent model guidance. Increased odds for above normal
precipitation in the Ohio Valley and in the Northern Rockies reflect a bit

amplified pattern and reduced uncertainty relative to last month=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlooks
due
to shorter lead time. That increased certainty is also translated to the MA=
M
2022 outlook, where odds of below normal precipitation were increased in th=

Four Corners region, and a slight tilt toward above normal precipitation wa=

added to the northwestern CONUS, reflecting the latest model

guidance. Outlooks for AMJ through JJA were modestly adjusted to reflect th=

latest model guidance and ensure continuity in the outlooks. Further out in

outlook package, JJA through SON, trends and a consolidation of statistical
tools were the main inputs for the outlooks from JAS 2022 through FMA 2023.
The
outlooks for JAS through OND generally favor below normal precipitation acr=

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1005 AM CST Thu Jan 20 2022

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

A cold, dry airmass remains in place across the south-central U.S.
and with surface temperatures struggling to get above freezing by
mid-afternoon, significant wildfire-spread potential should remain
minimal despite the presence of dry fuels.

..Squitieri.. 01/20/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1200 AM CST Thu Jan 20 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low for today as an arctic air
mass remains over the central CONUS. Latest fuel analyses maintain
the driest fuels across the southern Plains/southern High Plains
where little precipitation has fallen over the past week. Although
early-morning surface observations show widespread 15-25 mph
post-frontal winds across OK/TX, winds will steadily abate through
the morning hours as the regional pressure gradient weakens. Strong
cold advection across the region is also ushering unseasonably dry
air (dewpoint values in OK are currently near or below the 10th
percentile for mid-January). This dry air will support RH reductions
into the 20-35% range by the late afternoon hours as winds weaken to
10-15 mph. The poor temporal overlap of stronger winds with drier RH
will limit the overall fire weather threat and precludes introducing
any risk areas. However, 1-2 hours of elevated conditions may occur
across central to northern TX around mid-day as falling RH coincides
with breezy winds.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
150 PM EST Thu Jan 20 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Jan 23 2022 - 12Z Thu Jan 27 2022

18Z Update:  The 12Z model suite is in excellent agreement on the
overall synoptic scale pattern through about early Tuesday, with
broad cyclonic flow aloft with a deep trough anchored over the
central-eastern U.S., and a ridge off the West Coast.  A shortwave
trough tracking around the eastern periphery of that ridge sinks
southward across the Intermountain West, with the past few runs of
the GFS being quite amplified by Wednesday with this feature, and
the overnight run was an outlier solution compared to the ensemble
spaghetti plots.  Therefore, the GFS was weighted less for the
second half of the forecast period.  In terms of QPF, there was a
slight increase in rainfall totals for the central Gulf Coast
region, and a slight decrease across the Mid South.  Otherwise,
the majority of the forecast remains on track and the previous
discussion is appended below for reference.  /Hamrick


...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles are in good agreement with the amplified mean
flow over the lower 48 highlighted by an upper ridge off/along the
West Coast and an upper trough over the central to eastern U.S..
Guidance now offers more characteristic run to run continuity
issues with embedded systems within the larger scale flow over
time in a pattern with seemingly near normal forecast
predictability.

Accordingly, the earlier issued WPC medium range product suite was
mainly derived from a composite of the the reasonably well
clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models for days 3/4 (Sunday/Monday). Transitioned to a composite
of the compatible 18 UTC GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble means
along with the NBM for days 5-7 (Tuesday-next Thursday). This
along with some applied manual adjustments consistent with
uncertainty maintains decent WPC product continuity that also
remains generally in line with a similar composite plan from newer
00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A weekend southern stream Southwest U.S/northern Mexico closed low
offers some snow potential for the Southern Rockies/High Plains.
The system will eject eastward across the U.S. southern tier early
next week and wave genesis on a lingering trailing front over the
Gulf of Mexico will induce lead moisture return from the Gulf of
Mexico to fuel a moderate swath of precipitation within a cooled
airmass from Texas eastward across the Gulf Coast/Southeast. This
may include some snow/ice on the northern periphery of
precipitation.

The next in a series of Arctic Blasts will again spread far south
over the central and eastern U.S. Monday-next Thursday as another
mean flow reinforcing upper trough digs southeastward from Canada.
Transitory frontal enhanced upslope snows will dig through the
cooling Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Northern stream upper
system passage and frontal low genesis on the leading edge of
Arctic air starting Monday should support a windy snow swath from
the Dakotas through the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes. Low development
through the Great Lakes/Northeast Tuesday into Wednesday and
trailing cold frontal passage across the East favors lingering
lake effect along with some threat of plow-able snows from the
Appalachians through the Northeast. System evolution becomes
complex offshore and into the Canadian Maritime by midweek as the
aforementioned southern stream system phases/lifts on the lead
periphery of the amplified northern stream upper trough.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0101 PM CST Thu Jan 20 2022

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, with no changes
or additions made.

..Squitieri.. 01/20/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0114 AM CST Thu Jan 20 2022/

...Synopsis...
The potential for widespread or robust fire weather concerns appears
low for Friday, though a few regional, low-end fire weather concerns
may evolve across the southern Plains and coastal southern
California.

...Southern Plains...
An unseasonably dry air mass currently moving into OK and north TX
will linger into Friday with dewpoint values in the single digits.
While temperatures will remain cool, mostly clear skies should allow
for enough diurnal warming for RH values to fall into the 20-30%
range within the dry air mass. To the west, increasing zonal winds
aloft over the Rockies will support modest lee troughing across
eastern CO and northeast NM. In response, surface winds will
increase to 10-20 mph across the Panhandles and western OK. While
the windiest conditions will generally be displaced from the drier
air, patchy elevated conditions may develop across northwest TX into
western OK where an overlap of dry/windy conditions and dry fuels is
possible. Confidence in the coverage and duration of such conditions
is too low to warrant highlights.

...Coast Southern California...
Building surface high pressure behind a deepening upper-level trough
will bolster the offshore pressure gradient across southern CA over
the next 24-48 hours. Santa Ana winds are expected to increase to
20-35 mph by late Friday afternoon and into early Saturday morning,
and wind gusts up to 50-60 mph are possible within the higher
terrain of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. While a shallow marine
boundary layer is currently in place along the southern CA coast,
downslope warming/drying through Friday night will support RH
reductions into the low 20s and perhaps upper teens. Elevated to
locally critical wind/RH combinations appear likely during the
Friday evening to early Saturday morning time frame, but ERC values
along the CA coast are well below seasonal average due to
anomalously high precipitation totals over the past month. This will
mitigate the fire weather threat, though trends in fuel status will
be monitored.

SYNOPSIS: A strong surface high, with anomalously cold temperatures, is

FOR FRIDAY JANUARY 28 - THURSDAY FEBRUARY 03: The coldest temperatures of t=
he
winter so far are forecast to overspread the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast dur=
ing
the mid to late part of next week. On Jan 28 and 29, a moderate risk of muc=
h
below normal temperatures is posted where the reforecast tools depict that
minimum temperatures have near a 40 percent chance of falling below the 15t=
h
percentile of the climatological distribution. Freezing temperatures are
probable as far south as the Florida Panhandle, while frost or even a light
freeze could extend into the north-central Florida Peninsula and Nature Coa=
st.
A quick moderation in temperatures is expected as 500-hPa heights rise in
response to the developing trough upstream. Therefore, the slight risk of m=
uch
below normal temperatures is discontinued after Jan 30. Although recent
deterministic GFS models runs have featured the potential for a winter stor=
m
along the East Coast early in week-2, the lack of good continuity and suppo=
rt
among its ensemble members preclude any designation of a heavy snow hazard =
at
this time lead.



As an amplified 500-hPa trough develops over the West, the risk of multiple
temperature and precipitation hazards are expected to increase throughout t=
he
western and central U.S. by the beginning of February. For the second
consecutive day, reforecast tools are in good agreement in depicting a 20 t=
o
30
percent chance of minimum temperatures falling into the lowest 15th percent=
ile
of the climatological distribution for parts of the western and north-centr=
al
CONUS. This slight risk begins on Jan 31 and the magnitude of the anomalous
cold is forecast to increase during early February. Accompanying the
amplifying
trough aloft and decreasing 500-hPa heights, a slight risk of heavy snow is
posted for the northern Cascades and northern to central Rockies from Jan 3=
0
to
Feb 3. This slight risk may be expanded southward to include the Sierra Nev=
ada
Mountains in subsequent outlooks. Once the 500-hPa trough becomes establish=
ed,
there is an increasing chance of surface low development across the Great
Plains with a likely northeast track to the Great Lakes. Based on the evolv=
ing
500-hPa height and surface pattern along with precipitation tools, a slight
risk of heavy snow is posted from the central Great Plains northeast to the
Midwest and Great Lakes from Jan 31 to Feb 3. This slight risk area aligns
well
with the northeast surface track that is supported by the GFS and ECMWF
ensemble means. The spatial extent and timing will be refined as this
potential
winter storm becomes better defined in the next week. Meanwhile, in the
predicted warm sector, a slight risk of heavy rainfall (more than 1 inch pe=
r
24
hours) is posted from the Ohio River south to the Gulf Coast. This heavy
rainfall hazard is supported by uncalibrated ECMWF model guidance and
consistent with the return of Gulf moisture later in week-2.



A wind hazard may be added in subsequent outlooks if the model consensus
favors
the 500-hPa trough amplifying into the Southwest which would be more conduc=
ive
for gusty winds from the Four Corners region eastward to the southern Great
Plains. However, at the present time, model solutions depict a more
southeasterly component to the winds for the southern Great Plains. Given t=
he
widespread severe to extreme drought and low soil moisture, any enhanced wi=
nds
would increase the risk of wildfires and dust storms for these areas headin=
g
into February.



A slight risk of much below normal temperatures was introduced today for
extreme southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, based on goo=
d
model agreement and continuity. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicat=
e
that minimum temperatures have at least a 20 percent chance of falling into
the
lowest 15th percentile, beginning on Jan 31.

...Arctic blast to engulf much of the central and eastern U.S. in
bitterly cold temperatures...

...Significant Ice Storm in parts of the Carolinas; treacherous
wintry weather possible in parts of the Deep South...

...Light snow in the Intermountain West Friday; passing snow
showers in the Northern Plains and Upper Great Lakes Saturday...

A strong cold front ushered in an Arctic air-mass that is
engulfing much of the central and eastern U.S. this afternoon.
Daytime highs from the Midwest to South Texas are forecast to
range between 15 to 30 degrees below normal with subzero wind
chills throughout much of the Upper Mississippi Valley. Wind Chill
Advisories remain in effect for parts of the region tonight and
into early Friday. Bitterly cold temperatures will stretch all the
way to the East Coast tonight and into the start of the weekend.
Friday morning lows will range between 0 to -10 in the Upper
Midwest and northern New England. Friday's high temperatures will
struggle to get out of the single digits in northern New England
while the rest of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic reach the teens
and 20s. Much of the South will contend with abnormally cold
temperatures both Friday and Saturday while Florida's surge of
below normal temperatures arrives on Saturday. Saturday morning
lows throughout the interior Northeast will be subzero with even
colder wind chills. The warmest temperature departures Friday and
Saturday reside along the West Coast and the northern High Plains.

Farther to the south, southwesterly flow aloft overrunning the
Arctic air-mass in the South will generate icy precipitation from
South Texas and the central Gulf Coast to the Carolinas. Ice
accumulations of a tenth of an inch and under an inch of snow are
possible in South Texas tonight and into Friday morning, prompting
the issuance of a Winter Storm Warnings. A little farther north,
closer to the San Antonio and Austin metro areas, Winter Weather
Advisories have been posted for the threat of a glaze of ice
causing hazardous travel conditions. Winter Weather Advisories are
also in effect for parts of the central Gulf Coast from this
evening through Friday morning for a light glaze of ice that could
make for slippery travel. The worst winter weather is expected in
the Southeast where a longer period of freezing rain and sleet, as
well as measurable snowfall, is forecast tonight and into not just
Friday, but also into Saturday. The bulk of the freezing rain and
sleet accumulations are expected to occur the second half of the
day Friday and into Friday night as a deepening upper trough
positioned over the Mid-South approaches the Southeast. An Ice
Storm Warning has been posted for parts of southern North Carolina
and far northeast South Carolina where 0.2-0.3" of ice
accumulation is likely with locally higher totals possible. These
locations are most at risk downed trees and power lines. Farther
north in eastern North Carolina, Winter Storm Warnings are in
effect for a combination of treacherous snow and ice
accumulations. Lastly, Southeast Virginia is forecast to receive
measurable snowfall with totals ranging from 3-6" possible Friday
night into Saturday.

Elsewhere, the Intermountain West watches an upper level
disturbance track south through the Great Basin tonight and into
Friday. Moisture starved, this snowfall will be limited to the
higher elevations of the Rockies with totals surpassing 6" most
likely in the highest peaks. Some light rain and snow showers are
possible in the Pacific Northwest early on this evening before
drying out as high pressure build in for Friday. The
aforementioned upper trough becomes a cut-off low in the Desert
Southwest on Saturday, keeping any rain and snow shower activity
confined to primarily Arizona and New Mexico. Lastly, farther
north, a fast moving frontal system will trigger snow showers
throughout the upper Great Lakes on Saturday with light snow
accumulations expected. Another wave of low pressure follows on
its heels as it tracks into the Dakotas Saturday evening with more
snow showers for the North Central U.S..

315 PM EST Thu Jan 20 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Jan 23 2022 - 12Z Thu Jan 27 2022

18Z Update:  The 12Z model suite is in excellent agreement on the
overall synoptic scale pattern through about early Tuesday, with
broad cyclonic flow aloft with a deep trough anchored over the
central-eastern U.S., and a ridge off the West Coast.  A shortwave
trough tracking around the eastern periphery of that ridge sinks
southward across the Intermountain West, with the past few runs of
the GFS being quite amplified by Wednesday with this feature, and
the overnight run was an outlier solution compared to the ensemble
spaghetti plots.  Therefore, the GFS was weighted less for the
second half of the forecast period.  In terms of QPF, there was a
slight increase in rainfall totals for the central Gulf Coast
region, and a slight decrease across the Mid South.  Otherwise,
the majority of the forecast remains on track and the previous
discussion is appended below for reference.  /Hamrick


...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles are in good agreement with the amplified mean
flow over the lower 48 highlighted by an upper ridge off/along the
West Coast and an upper trough over the central to eastern U.S..
Guidance now offers more characteristic run to run continuity
issues with embedded systems within the larger scale flow over
time in a pattern with seemingly near normal forecast
predictability.

Accordingly, the earlier issued WPC medium range product suite was
mainly derived from a composite of the the reasonably well
clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models for days 3/4 (Sunday/Monday). Transitioned to a composite
of the compatible 18 UTC GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble means
along with the NBM for days 5-7 (Tuesday-next Thursday). This
along with some applied manual adjustments consistent with
uncertainty maintains decent WPC product continuity that also
remains generally in line with a similar composite plan from newer
00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A weekend southern stream Southwest U.S/northern Mexico closed low
offers some snow potential for the Southern Rockies/High Plains.
The system will eject eastward across the U.S. southern tier early
next week and wave genesis on a lingering trailing front over the
Gulf of Mexico will induce lead moisture return from the Gulf of
Mexico to fuel a moderate swath of precipitation within a cooled
airmass from Texas eastward across the Gulf Coast/Southeast. This
may include some snow/ice on the northern periphery of
precipitation.

The next in a series of Arctic Blasts will again spread far south
over the central and eastern U.S. Monday-next Thursday as another
mean flow reinforcing upper trough digs southeastward from Canada.
Transitory frontal enhanced upslope snows will dig through the
cooling Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Northern stream upper
system passage and frontal low genesis on the leading edge of
Arctic air starting Monday should support a windy snow swath from
the Dakotas through the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes. Low development
through the Great Lakes/Northeast Tuesday into Wednesday and
trailing cold frontal passage across the East favors lingering
lake effect along with some threat of plow-able snows from the
Appalachians through the Northeast. System evolution becomes
complex offshore and into the Canadian Maritime by midweek as the
aforementioned southern stream system phases/lifts on the lead
periphery of the amplified northern stream upper trough.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu January 20 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 26 - 30 2022

A high amplitude pattern is likely to persist into late January with a 500-=
hPa
ridge (trough) over the northeast Pacific (eastern North America). The
ensemble
means continue to depict the amplified ridge just offshore of the West Coas=
t,
retrograding westward closer to the Aleutians by the end of January. This
ridge
retrogression to near the Aleutians would be more consistent with La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa but
it is expected to take time for a downstream trough to develop over western
North America.

The amplified 500-hPa trough over eastern North America favors a continuati=
on
of the anomalously cold temperatures from the Mississippi Valley to the Eas=
t
Coast, along with the southern Great Plains. Model solutions feature strong
surface high pressure shifting southeastward over the east-central CONUS on
days 6 and 7 (Jan 26th and 27th). Negative temperature anomalies of -10 to =
-20
degrees F are forecast to accompany this surface high. A 500-hPa ridge with
associated above normal heights is forecast to extend east to include much =
of
the western CONUS which favors near to above normal temperatures for this
region. The two most likely areas for above normal temperatures include the
desert Southwest and Northern High Plains, due to good model agreement. Als=
o,
the Northern High Plains remain snow-free, which is unusual for this time o=
f
year. With the absence of cold air advection forecast during this 5-day
period,
the sparse snow coverage is expected to contribute to warming surface
temperatures. A small area with enhanced probabilities of below normal
temperatures forecast across parts of the Great Basin is related to predict=
ed
low-level inversions.

Forecast confidence in the precipitation outlook across the eastern CONUS
remains low due to high uncertainty in the interaction between shortwave
troughs in the northern and southern streams. Given the progressive mid-lev=
el
flow, probabilities of below normal precipitation are slightly elevated for
the
interior Northeast and Ohio to Tennessee Valleys. Near normal precipitation=
 is
more probable closer to the East Coast, Gulf Coast, and Florida as waves of
low
pressure are predicted to track along a mean frontal boundary. A two-catego=
ry
change in the precipitation outlook (wet to dry) was necessary across parts=
 of
the Southern Rockies and Central Plains as the predicted associated shortwa=
ve
trough has shifted south in today's 6-10 day period. Below normal
precipitation
remains likely across much of the western CONUS due to mean 500-hPa ridging
upstream over the North Pacific.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored for Alaska due to modest onsh=
ore
flow and a west-to-east storm track. This predicted surface pattern also
increases probabilities of above normal temperatures along the eastern bord=
er
of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Negative sea surface temperatu=
re
anomalies slightly favor below normal temperatures along coastal western
Alaska, the Aleutians, and Alaska Peninsula.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the temperature tools offset by low confidence in the
precipitation outlook across the eastern CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 28 - FEB 03, 2022

Ensemble means depict an intensification and slight eastward progression of
the
longwave ridge axis over the Northeast Pacific. Models subsequently develop=
 a
500-hPa trough over the western half of the CONUS, and increase heights ove=
r
the eastern U.S. Despite the fact that this pattern is almost a completely
reversal in the 500-hPa pattern over the CONUS since yesterday, today's
ensemble means are in good agreement on some level of trough development in
the
West. The 0z ECMWF ensemble mean depicts the deepest trough, followed by th=
e
0z
Canadian ensemble mean. A teleconnection based on the strong positive heigh=
t
south of the Aleutians supports this solution, as well as the GFS ensemble'=
s
trend toward predicting a neutral to negative PNA towards the end of the
week-2
period. Given this, the significant change from both today's 6-10 day manua=
l
blend and yesterday's week-2 blend is justified.

The significant increase in 500-hPa heights predicted in the eastern U.S.
favors a much smaller coverage of below normal temperatures across the East=
. A
forecast increase in return flow from the Gulf of Mexico favors a two categ=
ory
change (below to above) across the Southern and Central Plains and parts of
the
Mississippi Valley. A developing trough predicted over the western half of =
the
CONUS favors below normal temperatures across much of the West (also result=
ing
in a two category change in some places).

With a trough expected to develop in the western CONUS, the pattern across =
the
CONUS becomes favorable for precipitation to develop across parts of the
Intermountain West, favoring near to above normal precipitation across the
western CONUS. A transient pattern forecast over the eastern U.S., with
several
predicted shortwave troughs anticipated to support surface lows developing
over
parts of the East, favors near to above normal precipitation for the easter=
n
U.S. Probabilities are still relatively low, however, as there is still a g=
ood
deal of uncertainty in where and when storm systems may develop.

A transition to a drier pattern is likely for Alaska heading through the
week-2
period as the high amplitude ridge becomes established from the Aleutians
northward to the Bering Strait. Also, this longwave pattern would eventuall=
y
result in the return of anomalous cold.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 70% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 30% of Yesterday's 12z Europ=
ean
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well below Average, 1 out of 5=
,
due to a predicted significant longwave pattern transition resulting in
significant changes between yesterday's and today's forecast, as well as
between today's 6-10 day and week-2 forecasts.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 17.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 PM CST Thu Jan 20 2022

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Cool/cold temperatures will generally limit fire weather concerns
across the CONUS. A mid-level trough will move southward along the
West Coast before becoming a closed low across the lower Colorado
River Valley. High pressure will strengthen in the Northwest and
Great Basin. Strong offshore winds will develop in southern
California with upper-level winds supporting higher gusts. Despite
the strong winds and areas of lowered RH, fuels are not particularly
supportive of fire spread due to precipitation over the last month.

...Synopsis...
Cool/cold conditions will continue to mitigate fire weather concerns
across the CONUS on Saturday. Offshore flow with areas of reduced RH
will continue in southern California through the afternoon. Without
more receptive fuels, concerns will remain minimal here as well.

Valid 12Z Mon Jan 24 2022 - 12Z Fri Jan 28 2022

...Overview...

A strong eastern Pacific ridge will help to maintain a broad mean
trough across a majority of the lower 48 through the middle of
next week.  Later in the week guidance suggests the overall
pattern may begin to shift a little eastward as Pacific energy
finally nudges the ridge into the western U.S.  This pattern will
favor temperatures that are slightly above normal over the West,
variable over the Plains, and mostly below average  over the East.
 A southern stream wave should produce an area of locally moderate
to heavy rain along/north of the Gulf Coast early in the week
while lighter precipitation spreads across the rest of the eastern
U.S.  Otherwise expect precipitation coverage and intensity to be
fairly modest over most of the lower 48.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The primary forecast uncertainties involve shortwave details
within the lower 48 mean trough, and by late in the week specifics
of Pacific energy pushing into the ridge that drifts into the
western U.S.  The southern stream shortwave emerging into the
southern Plains early in the week is fairly similar in the
guidance, quickly shearing as it becomes embedded within fast
flow.  Some fine-scale surface details that have lower
predictability 4-5 days out in time will still take some time to
be resolved.  Meanwhile guidance has been differing for specifics
of one or more shortwaves dropping into the Great Basin/Rockies by
Tuesday onward, with a blend approach looking best given
persistent differences among the models and between consecutive
runs.  An intermediate solution appears ideal along the West Coast
by Thursday-Friday.  Recent GFS runs through 18Z have been on the
slower/closed side with the Pacific energy (as was the 12Z CMC)
and thus keep more ridging over the West, in contrast to the ECMWF
that has been on the fast/open side with the shortwave.  Their
respective ensemble means are less extreme but with a tilt to
their models' relative timing.  The means have trended toward a
stronger and faster shortwave over the past couple days, which
would at least favor leaning away from the slow side of the
spread.  The new 00Z GFS/CMC have adjusted somewhat faster/more
open while the new 00Z ECMWF has trended slower (albeit straying
to the amplified side of the spread by early Friday), ultimately
leading to better clustering for now.

A 12Z/18Z operational model blend represented consensus well for
the first half of the period.  Detail uncertainties for shortwaves
within the lower 48 mean trough and the intermediate preference
near the West Coast late in the week led to transitioning the
blend to 60 percent total 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF mean weight by day 7
Friday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A southern stream system tracking near the Gulf Coast Monday into
Tuesday should produce an area of locally moderate to heavy
rainfall across the far southern tier.  Highest totals are likely
be from around eastern Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley
during Monday-Monday night with a lighter trend farther eastward.
Also early in the week a separate wave/front crossing the East
will spread mostly light to moderate snow from the Great Lakes
into the Northeast.  Moisture in the northern periphery of the
southern system interacting with the front may lead to some snow
from the Ohio Valley into central Appalachians and could provide
some enhancement farther northeast as well.  Some lake effect snow
will be possible after the system passes by.  Another frontal
system reaching the Great Lakes late in the week could bring some
light snow to the region.  Aided by low level upslope flow as high
pressure builds into the central U.S., an area of snow will drop
southward through the Rockies and High Plains during the first
half of the week.  The rest of the West should be dry except for
possibly some light precipitation reaching the Pacific Northwest
late in the week.

Within the generally cold pattern over the eastern half of the
country, the East Coast will start out chilly on Monday with
Florida and the Northeast most likely to see min and/or max
temperatures at least 10F below normal.  The next Arctic surge
will bring readings down to 15-25F below normal over the
Midwest/Upper Mississippi Valley Tuesday into early Wednesday
while well below normal readings spread south and east through the
Plains and eastern U.S. into Thursday with some moderation over
the East by late week.  The Plains will see a warming trend
Wednesday-Friday with increasing coverage of plus 10F or greater
anomalies from northern into central areas.  Expect the West to
see moderately above normal temperatures next week.  Isolated
locations could see plus 10F or so anomalies.

system reaching the Great Lakes late in the week could bring some
light snow to the region.  Aided by low level upslope flow as high
pressure builds into the central U.S., an area of snow will drop
southward through the Rockies and High Plains during the first
half of the week.  The rest of the West should be dry except for
possibly some light precipitation reaching the Pacific Northwest
late in the week.

Within the generally cold pattern over the eastern half of the
country, the East Coast will start out chilly on Monday with
Florida and the Northeast most likely to see min and/or max
temperatures at least 10F below normal.  The next Arctic surge
will bring readings down to 15-25F below normal over the
Midwest/Upper Mississippi Valley Tuesday into early Wednesday
while well below normal readings spread south and east through the
Plains and eastern U.S. into Thursday with some moderation over
the East by late week.  The Plains will see a warming trend
Wednesday-Friday with increasing coverage of plus 10F or greater
anomalies from northern into central areas.  Expect the West to
see moderately above normal temperatures next week.  Isolated
locations could see plus 10F or so anomalies.

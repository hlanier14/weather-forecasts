Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1005 AM CST Tue Dec 07 2021

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Morning surface observations
across eastern NM/west TX show RH beginning to fall into the mid 30s
for some locations, but pervasive cloud cover is limiting the onset
of strong diurnal heating/RH reductions. Latest ensemble guidance
continues to show limited potential for widespread elevated wind/RH
conditions with the highest probability limited to the lee of the
Sacramento and Guadalupe mountains and along/south of I-40 between
Santa Rosa, NM and Amarillo, TX. While localized elevated conditions
appear probable, the spatial extent remains too limited for
highlights.

..Moore.. 12/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CST Tue Dec 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced midlevel westerly flow will cross the southern
Rockies and emerge over the southern High Plains by this afternoon.
As this occurs, a weak lee surface low will develop over portions of
northeastern New Mexico, resulting in a modest enhancement to the
surface pressure gradient across eastern New Mexico and western
Texas.

...Eastern New Mexico and Western Texas...
Locally Elevated fire-weather conditions appear likely during the
afternoon hours across parts of eastern New Mexico and western
Texas, aided by downslope warming/drying amid breezy westerly
surface winds. Present indications are that the best overlap of low
RH (15-20 percent) and breezy westerly surface winds (15-20 mph)
will be spatially limited, as the stronger surface winds will be
displaced slightly northward from the greater RH reductions expected
over the Trans-Pecos region. The localized nature of the
fire-weather threat precludes highlights at this time, though trends
will be monitored.

...Accumulating snowfall likely for the northern Plains to
Midwest/Upper Great Lakes with heavy rain across parts of the east
central U.S. ahead of the cold front Friday into Saturday...

...Atmospheric River to spread southward along the West Coast late
this week into early next week bringing heavy coastal rain and
mountain snow...

...Overview...

A generally progressive and active weather pattern is forecast to
occur through early next week, as a mid-upper trough pushes from
the Intermountain West early Friday toward the East by Sunday,
while a surface low and potent cold front track ahead of it. A
swath of wintry weather is likely to spread from the Central
Rockies into northern portions of the Plains to the Midwest/Upper
Great Lakes on Friday behind the low, while heavy rain is possible
late this week across the east-central U.S. along and ahead of the
cold front. Meanwhile, a slow-moving and reloading trough in the
eastern Pacific will direct a persistent and moist inflow
(atmospheric river) to the West Coast, with heavy coastal rain and
mountain snows likely that should spread southward with time.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest 00z/06z guidance continues to show very good agreement
through much of the period and a general deterministic model blend
sufficed, especially for the early part of the period. The latest
cycle of models seems to have trended towards a more progressive
and elongated trough through the East. The main exception to this
is the UKMET which continues to show the potential for stream
seperation with the trough, leaving behind a compact closed low
over the Southeast Sunday-Monday. There are many of the EC
ensemble members (and the mean) which also supports this scenario
too (though the GEFS, NAEFS, and CMCE means are more progressive).
Thus, there remains plenty of uncertainty regarding the late
weekend evolution of this trough, which of course would impact how
quickly precipitation moves through and overall flood concerns.
The WPC forecast for today leans towards the better consensus of a
progressive, intact trough from the deterministic GFS, ECMWF, and
CMC along with the GEFS and NAEFS means.

Out West, the guidance also shows good synoptic agreement
regarding the trough dropping south along the West Coast and a
potential atmospheric river event for the Pacific Northwest and
California. Some questions in the details remain however, and
there are some timing differences with the trough axis entering
the West Coast by day 7. Incorporating more of the ensemble means
by the end of the period helped mitigate these differences.

Overall, this update to the WPC medium range forecast remained
fairly consistent with the overnight package. The only notable
changes were regarding a faster cold front through the East, given
the current model trend.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The surface low pressure system tracking northeastward into the
Midwest/Great Lakes Friday to early Saturday will likely spread
snow on its backside from the Central Rockies into northern
portions of the Plains and into the Midwest, with moderate to
locally heavy snow possible. The trailing cold front associated
with this low will track through the eastern half of the U.S. and
spread widespread rain with embedded thunderstorms along and ahead
of it. There is potential for heavy rain amounts with
quick-hitting high rainfall rates that could cause flooding/flash
flooding issues for portions of the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee,
and Ohio Valleys on Friday and especially into Saturday. Then, how
much rain falls along the Eastern Seaboard will depend on the
timing of the upper trough and cold front exiting into the
Atlantic, which remains uncertain. Gusty winds, especially across
portion of the southern High Plains on Friday, may accompany the
low consistent with a tight pressure gradient. Meanwhile,
persistent onshore flow is likely initially in the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies and then could track south into
California by early next week. Enhanced totals are likely along
favored terrain, with heavy mountain snow in the Cascades, Sierra
Nevada, and northern Rockies.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast to be in place in the central U.S. on Friday, with highs
currently forecast to rise into the 80s from portions of Texas to
the Lower Mississippi Valley, which could approach or set daily
records as the temperatures should be 15-30F above normal. These
warm and potentially record-setting temperatures will push into
the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Eastern Seaboard on Saturday, while
temperatures moderate to near normal behind. The western U.S. can
expect below average temperatures especially Friday and Saturday,
with the Central Great Basin in particular seeing temperatures
10-20F below normal. Then, as ridging builds across much of the
lower 48 by early next week, temperatures should return to 10-20F
above normal across the central U.S. by Sunday and lasting/warming
further through Tuesday.

...Accumulating snowfall likely for the northern Plains to
Midwest/Upper Great Lakes with heavy rain across parts of the east
central U.S. ahead of the cold front Friday into Saturday...

...Atmospheric River to spread southward along the West Coast late
this week into early next week bringing heavy coastal rain and
mountain snow...

...Overview...

A generally progressive and active weather pattern is forecast to
occur through early next week, as a mid-upper trough pushes from
the Intermountain West early Friday toward the East by Sunday,
while a surface low and potent cold front track ahead of it. A
swath of wintry weather is likely to spread from the Central
Rockies into northern portions of the Plains to the Midwest/Upper
Great Lakes on Friday behind the low, while heavy rain is possible
late this week across the east-central U.S. along and ahead of the
cold front. Meanwhile, a slow-moving and reloading trough in the
eastern Pacific will direct a persistent and moist inflow
(atmospheric river) to the West Coast, with heavy coastal rain and
mountain snows likely that should spread southward with time.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest 00z/06z guidance continues to show very good agreement
through much of the period and a general deterministic model blend
sufficed, especially for the early part of the period. The latest
cycle of models seems to have trended towards a more progressive
and elongated trough through the East. The main exception to this
is the UKMET which continues to show the potential for stream
seperation with the trough, leaving behind a compact closed low
over the Southeast Sunday-Monday. There are many of the EC
ensemble members (and the mean) which also supports this scenario
too (though the GEFS, NAEFS, and CMCE means are more progressive).
Thus, there remains plenty of uncertainty regarding the late
weekend evolution of this trough, which of course would impact how
quickly precipitation moves through and overall flood concerns.
The WPC forecast for today leans towards the better consensus of a
progressive, intact trough from the deterministic GFS, ECMWF, and
CMC along with the GEFS and NAEFS means.

Out West, the guidance also shows good synoptic agreement
regarding the trough dropping south along the West Coast and a
potential atmospheric river event for the Pacific Northwest and
California. Some questions in the details remain however, and
there are some timing differences with the trough axis entering
the West Coast by day 7. Incorporating more of the ensemble means
by the end of the period helped mitigate these differences.

Overall, this update to the WPC medium range forecast remained
fairly consistent with the overnight package. The only notable
changes were regarding a faster cold front through the East, given
the current model trend.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The surface low pressure system tracking northeastward into the
Midwest/Great Lakes Friday to early Saturday will likely spread

Latest guidance continues to show a weak upper-level disturbance
propagating through the southern High Plains tomorrow that will
enhance westerly downslope flow. However, the axis of stronger
mid-level flow has trended north in recent runs. Consequently, this
has shifted the probability for sustained elevated wind/RH
conditions north as well. This trend is reflected in this update and
further forecast refinements are possible through tomorrow as
confidence in the corridor of stronger winds increases. Other
details outlined in the previous discussion below remain valid.

..Moore.. 12/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0206 AM CST Tue Dec 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong west-southwesterly midlevel speed maximum will overspread
the southern Rockies and adjacent High Plains, resulting in lee
troughing and a tight surface pressure gradient across portions of
the southern High Plains.

...Eastern New Mexico and Texas South Plains...
Enhanced downslope warming/drying combined with diurnal
heating/mixing will result in afternoon RH values of 15-20 percent
across portions of eastern New Mexico and the Texas South Plains.
Here, a tight surface pressure gradient will aid in the development
of sustained west-southwesterly surface winds of 15-25 mph with
higher gusts. The overlap of breezy/gusty surface winds and
critically low RH will likely support a few hours of Elevated
fire-weather conditions.

this week...

...Cool temperatures and light snow expected for parts of the
Great Lakes and Northeast over the next few days...

...Heavy snow possible across parts of the Sierra Nevada and
Intermountain West Wednesday night through Thursday...

An active weather pattern will culminate in the development of a
winter storm over the Central Rockies/Plains towards the end of
the week. A short wave trough will spawn shallow precip in the
form of light snow over parts of the Midwest tonight before
spreading out into the Lower Great Lakes, Central Appalachians,
Mid-Atlantic and up through the Northeast on Wednesday. A
stationary front draped along the Gulf coast and into the Atlantic
will bring rain showers and scattered to isolated thunderstorms to
the region through much of the Southeast and Carolina coast
tonight through Wednesday. A strong upper-level trough will bring
heavy snow to the Cascades and Sierra Nevada beginning Wednesday
and continuing through Thursday. 1-2 feet of snow are expected for
the Northern Cascades while around a foot is likely over the
Sierra.

Heavy snow is then expected to spread into the Intermountain West,
Central Rockies and Front Range Wednesday night and continuing
into Friday the Rockies and Front Range. 1-2 feet with higher
locally higher amounts are likely for much of the Intermountain
West and Central Rockies. Heavy snow really kicks off across the
Front range and into the Central/Northern Plains and Upper Midwest
on Friday.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 13 - 17 2021

There remains strong agreement among the dynamical models regarding an
amplified 500-hPa geopotential height pattern across the forecast domain
during
the 6-10 day period. Anomalous troughing and associated below normal 500-hP=
a
heights are forecast near much of the west coast of North America, includin=
g
over Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, and parts of the western CONUS.
Enhanced ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are favored on both
sides of this trough, across the north-central Pacific, including the
Aleutians, and over most of the CONUS east of the Rockies. The overall patt=
ern
is forecast to gradually shift eastward throughout the period, with the tro=
ugh
moving inland over the western CONUS, and ridging becoming more focused nea=
r
the East Coast. The highest positive height anomalies (>210 meters) for the
period as a whole are forecast across the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and
interior Northeast.

The anomalous ridging across the eastern and central CONUS, along with the
forecast positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation, supports unseasonably wa=
rm
temperatures over a broad region of the CONUS, excluding the West Coast. Th=
e
largest positive temperature anomalies are forecast to be initially focused
over the Great Plains on day-6, and then quickly spread eastward to the
Atlantic Coast by the middle of the period. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs forecast indicates
elevated
probabilities of above normal temperatures from the Rockies to the East Coa=
st,
which is also supported by the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. The highest
probabilities (>90 percent) are located over parts of the Great Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, northern Mid-Atlantic, and
Northeast, corresponding with the largest positive 500-hPa height anomalies=
.
The National Blend of Models indicates the potential for record high
temperatures across portions of the Great Plains and Midwest on days 7 and =
8,
with maximum temperature anomalies exceeding +20 deg F in some places.
Anomalous troughing supports increased chances of near to below normal
temperatures to the west of the Rockies and over Alaska, with the highest
probabilities (>70 percent) of below normal temperatures indicated across
southern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle.

Mid-level ridging over the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS and associated
surface high pressure favor increased probabilities for near to below norma=
l
precipitation over most areas from the Great Plains to the East Coast, with
the
highest probabilities (>60 percent) located over the Southeast. The excepti=
on
is across portions of the eastern Great Plains and the Upper and Middle
Mississippi Valley, where a slight tilt toward elevated above normal
precipitation probabilities is indicated. Dynamical models depict increased
southerly return flow around the surface high pressure forecast near the Ea=
st
Coast, resulting in elevated precipitation chances across these areas. The
exceptionally warm air mass also favors unusually high precipitable water
values for mid-December. Troughing moving into the western CONUS favors
increased probabilities for above normal precipitation over the western thi=
rd
of the CONUS, with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools both indicating
elevated
above normal precipitation probabilities reaching portions of central and
southern California and the Desert Southwest. Increased near to below norma=
l
precipitation probabilities are increased across northern and eastern Alask=
a,
including the Panhandle, as the troughing shifts eastward. However, increas=
ed
westerly mid-level flow overtop the anomalous ridging over the North-Centra=
l
Pacific favors an increase in onshore flow across southwestern Mainland Ala=
ska
and the Alaska Peninsula, favoring slightly elevated chances of above norma=
l
precipitation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GF=

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5=
,
due to excellent model agreement regarding an amplified pattern forecast
across
North America, and in the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 15 - 21 2021

The highly amplified mid-level 500-hPa pattern forecast during the 6-10 day
period is forecast to persist into week-2, with a continued eastward shift.
This would favor the North-Central Pacific ridge to expand eastward and
northward to encompass more of Mainland Alaska by the end of week-2. Below
normal 500-hPa heights remain favored for the period as a whole over most o=
f
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, with positive height anomalies forecast
across the extreme southwestern Mainland and the Aleutians. Troughing and
associated below normal mid-level heights are forecast across the western
third
of the CONUS, with downstream ridging and positive height anomalies favored=
 to
remain over the central and eastern CONUS. The mean ridge axis is shifted e=
ast
relative to the 6-10 day period, and the highest positive height anomalies
(>150 meters) are depicted across parts of the Northeast and northern
Mid-Atlantic.

The enhanced ridging over the eastern and central CONUS supports high
confidence for an anomalously warm pattern east of the Rockies during the
week-2 period, with increased probabilities for above normal temperatures
depicted in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecast from the Rockies to =
the East Coast. There is a
large region with probabilities greater than 90 percent extending from the
eastern Great Plains, through parts of the Middle and Lower Mississippi,
Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, southern Great Lakes, and the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic. While the GEFS reforecast tool is more toned down with the
higher
probabilities compared to the ECMWF reforecast tool, analog guidance suppor=
ts
the very high chances for above normal temperatures during week-2. Positive
mean temperature anomalies of over +15 deg F are indicated in the uncalibra=
ted
ECMWF and GEFS ensembles over the Great Plains and Midwest early in week-2,
with +5-10 deg F anomalies persisting across much of the eastern two-thirds=
 of
the CONUS throughout the period putting winter-like weather on hold for the
time being. Elevated below normal temperature probabilities continue to be
favored across the much of the western third of the CONUS and Alaska
associated
with troughing, although the magnitude of the cold temperature anomalies is
favored to wane across Alaska as mid-level heights increase ahead of the
building ridge.

Elevated probabilities of near to below normal precipitation remain favored
across the Eastern Seaboard, underneath anomalous ridging and supported by =
the
ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools. Increased troughing over the west generall=
y
favors a wetter pattern, with elevated probabilities for above normal
precipitation forecast to spread into the central CONUS. A combination of
increased southerly flow around surface high pressure, and possible influen=
ce
from shortwave disturbances rotating through the trough to the west, may le=
ad
to increased frontal activity across parts of the Mississippi Valley and Gr=
eat
Lakes, resulting in enhanced above normal precipitation probabilities over
these areas as well. Below normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced
across portions of southern California, southern Arizona, southern New Mexi=
co,
and extreme west Texas, due to a weaker and more northward orientation of t=
he
trough compared to the 6-10 day period. Near to below normal precipitation =
is
forecast across much of Alaska, on the backside of this troughing, with the
southwestern Mainland an exception where the mid-level flow becoming more
westerly promotes increased onshore flow and a slight tilt to increased abo=
ve
normal precipitation probabilities.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 0z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=

very good agreement in the dynamical and statistical tools regarding anomal=

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=

FOR WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 15 - TUESDAY DECEMBER 21: There is good multi-model
depiction of amplified troughing across much of Alaska (excluding the
southwestern Mainland and Aleutians), persisting from week-1 into week-2,
continuing a cold pattern throughout much of Alaska. A slight risk (greater
than 20% chance) of much below normal temperatures is maintained for much o=
f
Alaska south of the Brooks Range, excluding the western Aleutians, Dec 15 t=
o
18, where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20%
chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 10th percentile and
interior (coastal) areas dropping below -20 Deg F (0 Deg F). Recent GEFS
ensemble means show 2-meter temperatures reaching 16 Deg F below normal acr=
oss
much of the highlighted risk area and period. A moderate risk of much below
normal temperatures is highlighted for southwestern and south-central Mainl=
and
Alaska, including the Alaska Panhandle and eastern Aleutians, where the
reforecast tools indicate at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures
falling
to the lowest 15th percentile. The area highlighted has been scaled back
compared to yesterday's outlook due to the increased uncertainty regarding =
a
possible pattern transition. Temperatures are anticipated to moderate from =
the
middle to end of the period as the mid-level ridge across the southwestern
portions of Alaska is expected to build and expand eastward across the stat=
e.



The aforementioned mid-level trough over Alaska is expected to extend
southward
to parts of the western half of the CONUS at the beginning of the period.
However, there is significantly more disagreement among model ensemble mean=
s
regarding the placement of this trough compared to yesterday. The 0Z ECMWF
ensemble mean continues the axis of the mid-level trough along the West coa=
st
at the start of the period, whereas the 0Z GEFS indicates split flow with t=
he
axis of a shortwave trough off the coast of the Pacific Northwest and anoth=
er
centered over the Four Corners. The 0Z Canadian ensemble mean favors the
trough
axis centered across the interior West, and is more progressive than the EC=
MWF
and GEFS. Generally models favor the trough being located further inland th=
an
yesterday's solutions, which is less favorable to enhanced moisture flow th=
e
West. This is reflected in the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means of integrated
vapor transport (IVT), which is significantly lower than yesterday. A sligh=
t
risk of heavy precipitation (rain and high-elevation snow) is continued for
parts of the Pacific Northwest and northern and central California, Dec 15 =
to
17, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chanc=
e
of
3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch. =
A
slight risk of heavy snow is posted across portions of the Cascades, Sierra
Nevada Mountains, and the Klamath mountain range, Dec 15 to 17, where heavy
snow is most likely. Surface low pressure may form over the Northern Plains=
 at
the beginning of week-2, which could support localized heavy snow across pa=
rts
of the Rockies. However, due to the decreased signals for enhanced moisture
from the Pacific, a heavy risk for heavy snow is not included in today's
outlook for the Rockies.



A slight risk of high winds is posted for portions of the Pacific Northwest=
,
Dec 15 to 16, where the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
wind
speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph. This high wind risk is
shifted
northward compared to yesterday, associated with the shift of the trough ax=
is
being favored further north in the GEFS ensemble mean. Further south, surfa=
ce
high pressure is favored to build over the Four Corners and Intermountain W=
est
from the beginning to middle of week-2, which could increase chances for Sa=
nta
Ana winds. If there is continued support and good run to run model consiste=
ncy
in the upcoming days, a related high wind risk may be considered for the
southern coast of California.



With the shift of the mid-level trough axis being further inland over the
interior West, there are increased chances for anomalous cold across the
region. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is highlighted for
portions of the Great Basin, Southwest, California, and Oregon, Dec 15 to 1=
8.
The reforecast tools are in good agreement indicating at least a 20% chance=
 of
minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and freezing acr=
oss
these areas.



Following a wet November when precipitation averaged 150 to 200 percent of
normal, many river levels across northwest Washington are running above the
95th percentile. Due to the ongoing antecedent wetness and heavy rainfall (=
3
to
5 inches) forecast during the next week, a flooding possible hazard is post=
ed
for northwest Washington. This flooding risk may persist throughout week-2,
since above normal precipitation is favored to continue in this region.



A wet pattern is forecast to persist over Hawaii for week-2, which could
support localized flooding where there is already saturated ground, but als=
o
provide relief to some areas currently experiencing severe drought. More th=

quarter of Hawaii is currently designated in severe to exceptional drought.

...Long awaited heavy snow to arrive over the Central Rockies late
this week...

...Cool temperatures and light snow expected for parts of the
Great Lakes and Northeast over the next few days; warm air expands
across Plains...

...Heavy snow possible across parts of the Sierra Nevada and
Intermountain West Wednesday night through Thursday...

An active weather pattern will culminate in the development of a
winter storm over the Central Rockies/Plains towards the end of
the week. A shortwave trough will spawn shallow precip in the form
of light snow over parts of the Midwest tonight before spreading
out into the Lower Great Lakes, Central Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic
and up through the Northeast on Wednesday. A stationary front
draped along the Gulf coast and into the Atlantic will bring rain
showers and scattered to isolated thunderstorms to the region and
through much of the Southeast/Carolina coast tonight through
Wednesday. A strong upper-level trough will bring heavy snow to
the Cascades and Sierra Nevada beginning Wednesday and continuing
through Thursday. 1-2 feet of snow are expected for the Northern
Cascades while around a foot is likely over the Sierra.

Heavy snow is then expected to spread into the Intermountain West,
Central Rockies and Front Range Wednesday night and continuing
into Friday the Rockies and Front Range. 1-2 feet with higher
locally higher amounts are likely for much of the Intermountain
West and Central Rockies. Heavy snow really kicks off in earnest
across the Front range and into the Central/Northern Plains and
Upper Midwest upon the development of a Winter storm over the
foothills of the Colorado Rockies on Friday . Downstream of this
system, another low pressure system will produce moderate to heavy
snowfall across portions of the Upper Midwest and/Great Lakes on
Thursday, where 4-8 inches of snow with locally higher amounts are
expected. Anomalously warm air will advect into the Plains and
Mississippi Valley out ahead of this winter storm beginning on
Wednesday. The warmest temperatures, on the magnitude of 15-25
degrees above average will be felt over the Southern Plains
through the Midwest on Thursday and Friday. Relatively dry
conditions and increased wind speeds due to the deepening surface
low will contribute to an Elevated Risk of Fire Weather over parts
of eastern New Mexico and western Texas on Wednesday.

...Accumulating snowfall likely for the northern Plains to
Midwest/Upper Great Lakes with heavy rain across parts of the east
central U.S. ahead of the cold front Friday into Saturday...

...Atmospheric River to spread southward along the West Coast late
this week into early next week bringing heavy coastal rain and
mountain snow...

...Overview...

A generally progressive and active weather pattern is forecast to
occur through early next week, as a mid-upper trough pushes from
the Intermountain West early Friday toward the East by Sunday,
while a surface low and potent cold front track ahead of it. A
swath of wintry weather is likely to spread from the Central
Rockies into northern portions of the Plains to the Midwest/Upper
Great Lakes on Friday behind the low, while heavy rain is possible
late this week across the east-central U.S. along and ahead of the
cold front. Meanwhile, a slow-moving and reloading trough in the
eastern Pacific will direct a persistent and moist inflow
(atmospheric river) to the West Coast, with heavy coastal rain and
mountain snows likely that should spread southward with time.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest 00z/06z guidance continues to show very good agreement
through much of the period and a general deterministic model blend
sufficed, especially for the early part of the period. The latest
cycle of models seems to have trended towards a more progressive
and elongated trough through the East. The main exception to this
is the UKMET which continues to show the potential for stream
seperation with the trough, leaving behind a compact closed low
over the Southeast Sunday-Monday. There are many of the EC
ensemble members (and the mean) which also supports this scenario
too (though the GEFS, NAEFS, and CMCE means are more progressive).
Thus, there remains plenty of uncertainty regarding the late
weekend evolution of this trough, which of course would impact how
quickly precipitation moves through and overall flood concerns.
The WPC forecast for today leans towards the better consensus of a
progressive, intact trough from the deterministic GFS, ECMWF, and
CMC along with the GEFS and NAEFS means.

Out West, the guidance also shows good synoptic agreement
regarding the trough dropping south along the West Coast and a
potential atmospheric river event for the Pacific Northwest and
California. Some questions in the details remain however, and
there are some timing differences with the trough axis entering
the West Coast by day 7. Incorporating more of the ensemble means
by the end of the period helped mitigate these differences.

Overall, this update to the WPC medium range forecast remained
fairly consistent with the overnight package. The only notable
changes were regarding a faster cold front through the East, given
the current model trend.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The surface low pressure system tracking northeastward into the
Midwest/Great Lakes Friday to early Saturday will likely spread
snow on its backside from the Central Rockies into northern
portions of the Plains and into the Midwest, with moderate to
locally heavy snow possible. The trailing cold front associated
with this low will track through the eastern half of the U.S. and
spread widespread rain with embedded thunderstorms along and ahead
of it. There is potential for heavy rain amounts with
quick-hitting high rainfall rates that could cause flooding/flash
flooding issues for portions of the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee,
and Ohio Valleys on Friday and especially into Saturday. Then, how
much rain falls along the Eastern Seaboard will depend on the
timing of the upper trough and cold front exiting into the
Atlantic, which remains uncertain. Gusty winds, especially across
portion of the southern High Plains on Friday, may accompany the
low consistent with a tight pressure gradient. Meanwhile,
persistent onshore flow is likely initially in the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies and then could track south into
California by early next week. Enhanced totals are likely along
favored terrain, with heavy mountain snow in the Cascades, Sierra
Nevada, and northern Rockies.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast to be in place in the central U.S. on Friday, with highs
currently forecast to rise into the 80s from portions of Texas to
the Lower Mississippi Valley, which could approach or set daily
records as the temperatures should be 15-30F above normal. These
warm and potentially record-setting temperatures will push into
the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Eastern Seaboard on Saturday, while
temperatures moderate to near normal behind. The western U.S. can
expect below average temperatures especially Friday and Saturday,
with the Central Great Basin in particular seeing temperatures
10-20F below normal. Then, as ridging builds across much of the
lower 48 by early next week, temperatures should return to 10-20F
above normal across the central U.S. by Sunday and lasting/warming
further through Tuesday.

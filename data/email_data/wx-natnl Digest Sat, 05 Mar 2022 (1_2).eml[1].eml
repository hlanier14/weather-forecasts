Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CST Fri Mar 04 2022

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO INTO PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

No changes to the previous outlook. Cloud cover was in place across
most of the southern High Plains this morning. However, this cloud
cover has moved northeast and temperatures are starting to warm
across New Mexico. In addition, winds have started to strengthen in
response to the deepening surface low. While dewpoints are still on
the high side, they are expected to drop significantly through the
afternoon as mixing deepens.

..Bentley.. 03/04/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1257 AM CST Fri Mar 04 2022/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough currently nearing the southern California coast
will continue eastward through the Southwest today. With time, the
trough will accelerate northeastward into the central and southern
High Plains regions. At the surface, a lee cyclone in eastern
Colorado will during the day. A dryline will eventually sharpen
across the southern High Plains.

...Eastern New Mexico into southwest Kansas...
Mid-level winds will be on the increase through the day. The
mid-level jet will generally be well-timed with peak boundary-layer
mixing. Water vapor imagery early this morning shows mid-level
moisture moving across the region. It is likely that some cloud
cover will be present during the morning and early afternoon. Cloud
cover and a slow deepening surface cyclone may limit temporal
overlap of the strongest winds and lowest RH. Given the dryness of
fuels, large fire growth is possible even with limited duration of
RH near 15% and 20 mph winds.

...Western/Central New Mexico...
Areas to the West of the High Plains are expected to be impacted by
a region of mid-level subsidence. This should lead to greater
potential for dry and windy conditions. Winds of 20-30 mph are
possible along with 10-20% RH. Fuels are not as dry as areas to the
east, particularly within higher elevation. However, the strength of
winds and low RH should bring potential for larger fire growth.

...Heavy rain potential across the Ohio Valley into Monday...

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Monday with broad troughing (with
embedded shortwaves) across the central U.S. pushing a cold front
into the East. This setup brings a threat for heavy to excessive
rainfall across the Ohio Valley, with snow to the north.
Shortwaves should weaken in the flow as they progress downstream
as heights begin to rise over the East Coast. Out West, a strong
ridge over the east Pacific should allow for shortwaves to keep
reinforced troughing over the Rockies, which eventually should
press east into the Plains by late next week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Reasonably good model agreement continues for the large scale
pattern over the last couple of model cycles, but with typical
timing and detail differences remaining, some of which could be
impactful to sensible weather. There is good consensus for
elongated low pressure along the cold front at the beginning of
the period Monday, with lingering differences in the exact
placement of the surface low or two dependent on shortwave
differences. The cold front moving eastward has trended a bit
faster compared to the previous forecast as the low tracks quickly
across the Northeast. A blend of the deterministic guidance
favoring the GFS and ECMWF worked well for this system.

Farther west, energy diving south along the West Coast on Monday
produces differences that become more notable Tuesday and beyond.
Models have been waffling on how much energy is held back across
the Southwest Tuesday, with the bulk of 00Z guidance showed a
slower track and a possibly closed low compared to the previous
cycle, though the 06Z GFS was open and faster. This trend toward a
slower/stronger solution was reflected in the WPC 500mb charts.
The newer 12Z guidance still shows a bit of spread, with the CMC
now among the faster/weaker guidance after the past few runs of it
being slow, but overall model consensus is still slower compared
to about a day ago. The details of this feature remain uncertain
Tuesday and then beyond as it ejects eastward with varied
timing--which influences the Gulf of Mexico return flow and timing
of rainfall beginning across the southeastern quadrant of the
country. Another factor to consider with that is the trough's
eastward extent for the latter half of the week, which appears to
have trended westward (allowing for higher heights in the East)
over the past couple of days, keeping rain chances in the
forecast.

By midweek through Thursday and Friday, the next shortwave arrives
into the Northwest, which should help to reinforce broad troughing
over the Rockies which eventually pushes into the Central U.S. by
the end of the week. There are some timing differences regarding
both the trough axis and the associated surface front and
developing low pressure. ECMWF runs have generally been slower
than GFS runs, and the WPC forecast for the latter part of the
period attempted to take a middle ground approach by phasing in
and increasing the proportions of the reasonably agreeable
ensemble means, with some inclusion of the deterministic runs for
a little added system definition.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and thunderstorms will be widespread along and ahead of the
cold front moving through the eastern U.S. early next week. The
axis of the heaviest rain by Monday is forecast from the lower
Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians and northern
Mid-Atlantic. Flooding and flash flooding are possible
particularly in areas that see repeat/training convection and in
areas where soils are already wet, and newly experimental Slight
Risks of excessive rainfall remain in place for day 4. A swath of
wintry precipitation could develop on the north side, with light
to moderate amounts possible from into the Great Lakes and
interior Northeast. Then by the middle of next week, Gulf moisture
could return to the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast, but
uncertainty remains with respect to rainfall totals and timing,
all dependent on a stalling boundary and possible waves of low
pressure.

The West should see a break in the precipitation on Monday, but
mountains snows return by Tuesday and beyond for the Pacific
Northwest and especially the Rockies. There remains some
potential, but low confidence, on snowfall into the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest late week as low pressure may develop over
the central states.

Temperatures should feel very mild for the south-central to
eastern part of the U.S. on Monday ahead of the cold front, with
temperatures 10 to 30 degrees above average and dozens of daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures possible.
Temperatures should moderate back to near normal after the frontal
passage on Tuesday. The West and parts of the central U.S. will
generally be cooler than average through much of the period, but
particularly for the second half of the week as more substantial
troughing develops and pushes southeast along with cold high
pressure. Temperatures should trend cooler with anomalies 10 to 30
degrees below normal possible across the northern and central
Plains, and as far south as Texas and Oklahoma by Friday.

300 PM EST March 04 2022

SYNOPSIS: The primary hazard focus concerns strong mid-level low pressure
forecast early in the period, which is expected to result in anomalously cold
temperatures for many areas west of the Rockies, with an enhanced risk for
much
below normal temperatures for much of the Great Plains, Mississippi,
Tennessee,
and Ohio Valleys and Great Lakes by next weekend. The associated surface low
helping to usher in this arctic cold air remains favored to deepen as it
tracks
northeastward, increasing the risk of high winds over the northeastern U.S.
The development of mid-level high pressure favored over the southwestern
contiguous U.S. and Alaska is expected to keep weather related hazards at bay
during week-2.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the Great Plains,
Mississippi Valley, western Great Lakes, western Ohio Valley, Sat, Mar 12.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for the Northern Rockies,
Great
Plains, Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Southeast, Appalachians, and
the Great Lakes, Sat-Sun, Mar 12-13.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the central and
eastern CONUS, Sat-Tue, Mar 12-15.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,
Northeast, Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic, Sat-Sun, Mar 12-13.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Cascades and the
Bitterroot Mountains, Sat-Wed, Mar 12-16.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MARCH 07 - FRIDAY MARCH 11:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!tkzBJptJyRZ8SjiCnUGS7I1Z7N3lbB-qUETA5l7ldYf_K2ptsdhBvY17P3gKGiJPibuq4vjW$

FOR SATURDAY MARCH 12 - FRIDAY MARCH 18: Dynamical model forecasts continue to
advertise strongly amplified, full-latitude 500-hPa troughing over much of
North America. This mid-level feature is anticipated to usher in arctic air
throughout much of the central and eastern CONUS, and remains the primary
focus
for unseasonably cold, and potentially hazardous temperatures through the
middle of week-2. Late in week-1, the Weather Prediction Center's (WPC)
surface
analysis shows high pressure overspreading the western and central CONUS in
the
wake of a large, advancing frontal boundary where anomalously cold
temperatures
are favored to be in place by the start of the period. There is general
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicating a broad
region
extending from the Rockies to the eastern seaboard with at least a 20% chance
of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile to support a broad
slight risk area of much below normal temperatures through the middle of the
period. Beyond this time, much of the troughing is favored to lift out and
deamplify in the ensemble guidance, resulting in a decreased risk of much
below
normal temperatures towards the end of the period. Relative to yesterday's
outlook, higher probabilities (>40%) remain focused throughout the Great
Plains
and Mississippi Valley, but now include portions of the Southeast, Tennessee
and Ohio Valleys, and the Great Lakes to warrant the eastward expansion of the
moderate risk area of much below normal temperatures for next weekend (Mar
12-13).  Similarly, a high risk of much below normal temperatures remains
issued and is also expanded eastward to the Mississippi River and through the
Ohio Valley and Great Lakes for day 8 (Mar 12).  It is worth noting that the
ECMWF reforecast tool focuses the highest probabilities for minimum
temperatures falling below the lowest percentiles, suggestive of possible near
record breaking temperatures as far south as the Rio Grande Valley and Gulf of
Mexico early in the period. However, the GEFS reforecast tool is not as
pronounced in this region, instead focusing the strongest cold signals further
north across the Midwest which appears to be the more reasonable and preferred
solution given its better consistency with uncalibrated temperature anomalies
from the ensembles.



WIth surface low pressure favored to traverse the northeastern CONUS early in
the period, much of the heavy precipitation potential along the predicted
frontal boundary is expected to time off, resulting in the removal of the
slight risk of heavy precipitation over the southeastern CONUS in today's
outlook. However, strong pressure gradients are depicted in the deterministic
solutions tied to the deepening surface low, and both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of sustained winds exceeding the
85th percentile over the northeastern CONUS. Thus, a slight risk of high winds
remains posted for Mar 12-13, and is expanded westward to include portions of
the Ohio Valley due to increased signals over the region in the latest
guidance. Increased snowfall is likely across parts of the Ohio Valley, Great
Lakes, and Northeast on the backside of the surface low, however snow
accumulations are not expected to reach hazard thresholds.



Farther west, there is good agreement among the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
featuring the development of anomalous ridging over the southwestern CONUS to
help bring warmer temperatures throughout the region during week-2. However,
there are continued indications of shortwave disturbances propagating from the
eastern Pacific into the Pacific Northwest in the ensembles, where surface low
formation and increased onshore flow favor above-normal precipitation over the
northwestern CONUS. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools are in agreement
indicating at least a 20% chance of 3-day totals exceeding the 85th percentile
over the Pacific Northwest, Northern Intermountain, and Northern Rockies
through the middle of the period. While precipitation totals are not expected
to reach hazard thresholds to warrant the addition of a heavy precipitation
hazard, heavy snowfall is possible over the higher elevations of the
northwestern CONUS given the anomalous cold and increased moisture favored
through the middle of the period. Thus, a slight risk of heavy snow is posted
for Mar 12-16 over the portions of the Cascades and the Bitterroot Mountains.



Over Alaska, the prevailing mid-level height pattern is expected to lead to
warmer than normal temperatures across the western Mainland, with increasing
signals for anomalous cold developing over the southeastern Mainland and the
Panhandle. No temperature related hazards are posted, however, the persistence
of above normal temperatures over the Alaskan Mainland bears monitoring as the
state approaches the river ice breakup season later this spring.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR AREAS FROM FAR EASTERN NEW MEXICO
TO NORTHEAST KANSAS....

Expanded the elevated and critical area slightly farther north and
east across northeast Kansas and vicinity. Dry and windy conditions
pay persist east of the elevated area. However, fuels are more moist
with eastern extent and therefore, the large fire threat should be
reduced, especially since duration of these conditions should remain
limited.

..Bentley.. 03/04/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CST Fri Mar 04 2022/

...Synopsis...
A potent shortwave trough will be present over the southern High
Plains early Saturday morning. This trough will continue its
northeastward progress through the day. A surface cyclone will
continue to deepen in western and central Kansas before pivoting to
the northeast along with its parent trough. Strong winds at low and
mid levels will occur ahead of an advancing cold front moving
through Kansas into Oklahoma.

...Parts of central and eastern Kansas...
As the area of mid-level subsidence moves in by mid to late morning,
areas of cloud cover should begin to clear. Strong southwesterly
winds will develop underneath a strong low and mid-level jet. Wind
speeds of 20-25 mph are possible with up to 30 mph occurring
locally, particularly ahead of the cold front. RH ahead of the
boundary will generally fall to 15-25%. Locally extremely critical
fire weather is possible. Areas at greatest risk for these
conditions are from Wichita to Manhattan into parts of the Flint
Hills. However, the speed of the cold front and the limited spatial
extent of RH less than 15% precludes categorical upgrades. The
post-front environment, though with higher RH, will still be breezy
and produce an abrupt wind shift westerly/northwesterly.

...Southern Plains...
Areas of elevated to critical fire weather will extend from the
Trans-Pecos into the Texas Panhandle and western/central Oklahoma.
Winds of 15-20 mph will be common across these areas along with
15-20% RH. Critical conditions will be most likely in the Texas
Panhandle and northwest Oklahoma where a better coupling of the
low-level and mid-level jet will occur. Locally critical may extend
eastward in to parts of the I-35 corridor, however.

...Heavy rain potential across the Ohio Valley into Monday...

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Monday with broad troughing (with
embedded shortwaves) across the central U.S. pushing a cold front
into the East. This setup brings a threat for heavy to excessive
rainfall across the Ohio Valley, with snow to the north.
Shortwaves should weaken in the flow as they progress downstream
as heights begin to rise over the East Coast. Out West, a strong
ridge over the east Pacific should allow for shortwaves to keep
reinforced troughing over the Rockies, which eventually should
press east into the Plains by late next week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Reasonably good model agreement continues for the large scale
pattern over the last couple of model cycles, but with typical
timing and detail differences remaining, some of which could be
impactful to sensible weather. There is good consensus for
elongated low pressure along the cold front at the beginning of
the period Monday, with lingering differences in the exact
placement of the surface low or two dependent on shortwave
differences. The cold front moving eastward has trended a bit
faster compared to the previous forecast as the low tracks quickly
across the Northeast. A blend of the deterministic guidance
favoring the GFS and ECMWF worked well for this system.

Farther west, energy diving south along the West Coast on Monday
produces differences that become more notable Tuesday and beyond.
Models have been waffling on how much energy is held back across
the Southwest Tuesday, with the bulk of 00Z guidance showed a
slower track and a possibly closed low compared to the previous
cycle, though the 06Z GFS was open and faster. This trend toward a
slower/stronger solution was reflected in the WPC 500mb charts.
The newer 12Z guidance still shows a bit of spread, with the CMC
now among the faster/weaker guidance after the past few runs of it
being slow, but overall model consensus is still slower compared
to about a day ago. The details of this feature remain uncertain
Tuesday and then beyond as it ejects eastward with varied
timing--which influences the Gulf of Mexico return flow and timing
of rainfall beginning across the southeastern quadrant of the
country. Another factor to consider with that is the trough's
eastward extent for the latter half of the week, which appears to
have trended westward (allowing for higher heights in the East)
over the past couple of days, keeping rain chances in the
forecast.

By midweek through Thursday and Friday, the next shortwave arrives
into the Northwest, which should help to reinforce broad troughing
over the Rockies which eventually pushes into the Central U.S. by
the end of the week. There are some timing differences regarding
both the trough axis and the associated surface front and
developing low pressure. ECMWF runs have generally been slower
than GFS runs, and the WPC forecast for the latter part of the
period attempted to take a middle ground approach by phasing in
and increasing the proportions of the reasonably agreeable
ensemble means, with some inclusion of the deterministic runs for
a little added system definition.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and thunderstorms will be widespread along and ahead of the
cold front moving through the eastern U.S. early next week. The
axis of the heaviest rain by Monday is forecast from the lower
Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians and northern
Mid-Atlantic. Flooding and flash flooding are possible
particularly in areas that see repeat/training convection and in
areas where soils are already wet, and newly experimental Slight
Risks of excessive rainfall remain in place for day 4. A swath of
wintry precipitation could develop on the north side, with light
to moderate amounts possible from into the Great Lakes and
interior Northeast. Then by the middle of next week, Gulf moisture
could return to the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast, but
uncertainty remains with respect to rainfall totals and timing,
all dependent on a stalling boundary and possible waves of low
pressure.

The West should see a break in the precipitation on Monday, but
mountains snows return by Tuesday and beyond for the Pacific
Northwest and especially the Rockies. There remains some
potential, but low confidence, on snowfall into the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest late week as low pressure may develop over
the central states.

Temperatures should feel very mild for the south-central to
eastern part of the U.S. on Monday ahead of the cold front, with
temperatures 10 to 30 degrees above average and dozens of daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures possible.
Temperatures should moderate back to near normal after the frontal
passage on Tuesday. The West and parts of the central U.S. will
generally be cooler than average through much of the period, but
particularly for the second half of the week as more substantial
troughing develops and pushes southeast along with cold high
pressure. Temperatures should trend cooler with anomalies 10 to 30
degrees below normal possible across the northern and central
Plains, and as far south as Texas and Oklahoma by Friday.

...Heavy rain potential across the Ohio Valley into Monday...

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Monday with broad troughing (with
embedded shortwaves) across the central U.S. pushing a cold front
into the East. This setup brings a threat for heavy to excessive
rainfall across the Ohio Valley, with snow to the north.
Shortwaves should weaken in the flow as they progress downstream
as heights begin to rise over the East Coast. Out West, a strong
ridge over the east Pacific should allow for shortwaves to keep
reinforced troughing over the Rockies, which eventually should
press east into the Plains by late next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri March 04 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 10 - 14 2022

A highly amplified 500-hPa trough is forecast to progress eastward from the
west-central to the eastern CONUS during mid-March. Large probabilities (more
than 80 and 90 percent) for below normal temperatures are forecast across the
Northern to Central Great Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley. Arctic high
pressure is forecast to shift south from Canada by day 6 with daily
temperature
anomalies of -10 to -25 degrees F through at least day 9, March 13. 5-day
temperatures from March 10 to 14 are likely to average below normal throughout
a majority of the CONUS given the expansive and anomalous troughing.
Probabilities for below normal temperatures decrease closer to the East Coast
as this region is expected to begin the period either with near or above
normal
temperatures. Anomalous warmth early in the period favors above normal
temperatures across the Florida Peninsula. A variable temperature pattern
supports near normal temperatures for California and the desert Southwest.

A frontal passage during this 5-day period favors above normal precipitation
across the eastern CONUS. The slightly elevated probabilities for above normal
precipitation for the Great Lakes and parts of the Midwest are related to
cyclonic flow and increased potential for low pressure along the Arctic front
on days 6 and 7 (Mar 10-11). Near to above normal precipitation remains
favored
for the Midwest and Great Lakes as there could be a wave of low pressure along
the Arctic front. Shortwave troughs and upslope surface flow support enhanced
above normal precipitation probabilities across the Northern to Central
Rockies
and adjacent High Plains, while increasing onshore flow favors above normal
precipitation across the Pacific Northwest. As the 500-hPa trough axis shifts
eastward, favored dryness is forecast to expand eastward from California and
the Southwest to the southern Great Plains.

Mean 500-hPa ridging with above normal 500-hPa heights favors near to above
normal temperatures for much of Alaska although nearby Arctic high pressure
slightly elevates probabilities for below normal temperatures across parts of
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. A relatively dry
pattern
is favored throughout Alaska with southwestern Alaska and the Aleutians most
likely to experience near normal precipitation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 25% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement and continuity among model solutions with a high amplitude
pattern.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 12 - 18 2022

Early in week-2, ensemble means depict a full-latitude 500-hPa trough over the
central CONUS. Therefore, forecast confidence remains high in below normal
temperatures across the Northern Great Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Midwest
where the magnitude of anomalous cold is likely to be the greatest and persist
through much of week-2. The anomalous troughing is expected to be transient to
the south of the 40th parallel and along the East Coast with ensemble means
depicting a rapid change to near or above normal 500-hPa heights across these
areas late in week-2. Therefore, probabilities for below normal temperatures
are more modest closer to the East and Gulf Coasts. During the past few days,
model solutions feature a notable increase in 500-hPa heights across the
southern High Plains, Southwest, Great Basin, and California  where near to
above normal temperatures are favored. Temperature tools generally feature
near
normal temperatures across the Pacific Northwest with periods of enhanced
onshore flow becoming prevalent with time.

As surface high pressure expands south over the central CONUS by day 8,
enhanced below normal precipitation probabilities are forecast throughout most
of this region along with the southern tier of the CONUS. The largest
probabilities (more than 50 percent) for below normal precipitation are
forecast across the Southwest and southern High Plains, consistent with
increasing 500-hPa heights. Cyclonic flow slightly elevates probabilities for
above normal precipitation from the Great Lakes to the Northwest. The favored
area of above normal precipitation along and west of the Central Appalachians
is associated with strong cold air advection and upslope flow early in week-2.
Enhanced Pacific flow supports increased above normal precipitation
probabilities from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern and Central Rockies.

Compared to previous days, the ensemble means depict Arctic high pressure
shifting west and closer to Alaska. Therefore, the coverage of favored near to
below normal temperatures increased to include more of Mainland Alaska.
Temperature tools and the surface indicate that southeastern Mainland Alaska
and the Alaska Panhandle are most likely to experience below normal
temperatures. Conversely, the lack of cold air advection supports elevated
above normal temperatures for the Aleutians and the coastal western Mainland.
Along with the good agreement on a colder outcome overall for Alaska during
week-2, a relatively dry pattern is forecast with the storm track displaced
south of Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools offset by an expected
weakening of the high amplitude pattern later in week-2.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

...Dynamic system to produce winter weather western third of the
country and the Upper Midwest and severe thunderstorms over the
Upper Midwest through Sunday...

...Record-breaking warmth across parts of the East on
Saturday-Sunday, with Critical Risk of fire weather over the
Southern Plains through Saturday...

A Complicated area of low pressure and fronts over the western
third of the country will produce a wave of low pressure over the
Central Plains Saturday that will move northeastward across the
Upper Great Lakes by Sunday into Canada by Sunday evening.
Multiple surges of upper-level energy will move across the West
producing heavy snow over the Sierra Nevada Mountains higher
elevations of the Great Basin/Southwest and Northern/Central
Rockies, mainly on Saturday with lighter amounts on Sunday. In
addition, lower elevation rain will develop over parts of the
Pacific Northwest Coast and California. The rain will wind down
early Saturday morning over the Northwest and Southern California
by early Sunday morning.

On Saturday morning, as the lead low moves into the Upper Midwest,
an area of snow, rain/freezing rain, rain, and thunderstorms will
develop over the region. The biggest threat will be rain/freezing
rain extending from the Northern/Central Plains into the Upper
Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes with freezing rain
accumulations up to 0.50 inches. The next most dangerous threat
will be severe thunderstorms developing over the Upper/Middle
Mississippi Valley. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Upper/Middle Mississippi
Valley on Saturday through Sunday morning. The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

On Sunday, the associate front moves across the Ohio Valley and
Southern Plains, producing showers and thunderstorms. The severe
thunderstorm threat moves southward with the boundary to the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley. Therefore, the SPC has
issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Meanwhile, the rain/freezing rain threat continues across the
Upper Mississippi Valley and the Upper Great Lakes on Sunday. The
possible accumulations of freezing rain will be 0.25 inches or
less. Furthermore, on Sunday, moderate snow will also develop
across parts of the Northern Plains to the Upper Great Lakes.

In the meantime, in the system s warm sector, temperatures will be
15 to 25 degrees above average over parts of the Southern Plains
to the Ohio Valley. Gusty winds associated with the above system
and dry fuels along with low relative humidity have produced
conditions favorable for fire weather from the Southern High
Plains into the Central Plains. Therefore, the SPC has issued a
Critical Risk of fire weather over the Southern High Plains to the
Central Plains for Saturday.

Valid 12Z Tue Mar 08 2022 - 12Z Sat Mar 12 2022

...Overview...

A strong ridge over the Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico and the Eastern
Pacific should keep much of the CONUS within broad and reinforced
troughing through most of the medium range period. Various
shortwaves will progress through the flow sending low pressure
into the Eastern U.S. and the central states. Amplified troughing
should become established over the Rockies/Interior West by mid
week, eventually pushing east into the Plains resulting in a
developing low pressure area tracking into the Upper Midwest late
next week. Periods of moderate to locally heavy rain are possible
across the Southeast, with some wintry weather across northern
areas.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Reasonably good model agreement continues for the large scale
pattern over the last couple of model cycles, but with typical
timing and detail differences remaining, some of which could be
impactful to sensible weather. The initial shortwave/closed low
over the Southwest should weaken as it progresses downstream, but
with some timing uncertainties. The 18z/Mar 4 GFS and the 12z/Mar
4 ECMWF seemed to represent the best middle ground solution in
between a faster CMC and slower UKMET. A quick look at the new 00z
guidance (available after forecast generation) shows the GFS and
ECMWF are a little faster than their previous runs and close to
the CMC now, with the UKMET still notably slower. These subtle
differences in timing may have larger impacts to potential QPF
across the Southeast along a stalling frontal boundary.

Energy diving into the West on Wednesday should act to reinforce
and amplify troughing over the Rockies/Interior West which
eventually presses east into the Plains by Friday/Saturday. This
should induce cyclogenesis in the lee of the Rockies, with a well
developed surface low lifting into the Upper Midwest by Friday.
The 12z/18z guidance from yesterday actually showed quite good
agreement timing wise for this system and so a majority
deterministic blend was used through the period. Incorporated some
of the ensemble means though to help smooth out the less
predictable detail differences. However, the incoming 00z guidance
shows much greater differences in some of the details as well as
timing, with the 00z ECMWF quite a bit slower now, so uncertainty
remains high with this system as a whole.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and thunderstorms will be widespread along and ahead of a
cold front moving through the eastern U.S. on Tuesday. By the
middle of next week, return flow moisture out of the Gulf of
Mexico could result in multiple days of rainfall across parts of
the lower Mississippi Valley/Southeast. Plenty of uncertainty
remains with respect to rainfall totals, timing, and impacts,
dependent on exactly where the boundary stalls and possible waves
of low pressure. At this point, guidance suggests the better
moisture stays south in areas that have been relatively dry the
past few weeks, but just a small jog to the north on the axis,
could bring heavier rainfall into areas which have seen above
normal rain lately, increasing the threat for flooding.

The next round of heavy mountain snow arrives into the West on
Tuesday and Wednesday. As the surface low develops across the
central U.S. Thursday-Friday, snow is likely to develop along the
north side of the low from the central/northern Plains to the
Upper Midwest. Exact amounts and how impactful this system will
actually be remains quite uncertain at this time, but the latest
WPC winter weather outlook for days 5 and 6 do show some modest
potential for accumulating snow.

After a mild start to the week, temperatures across the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast should moderate back towards normal
Tuesday-Thursday, though above normal temperatures may arrive back
on Friday ahead of the next system. Meanwhile, the West and parts
of the central U.S. will generally be cooler than average through
much of the period, but particularly for the second half of the
week as more substantial troughing develops and pushes southeast
along with cold high pressure. Temperatures should trend cooler
with anomalies 10 to 30 degrees below normal possible across the
northern and central Plains, and as far south as Texas and
Oklahoma by Friday. Below normal temperatures should move into the
Mississippi Valley and Midwest states by next weekend.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR TEXAS PANHANDLE...NORTHWEST
OKLAHOMA...PARTS OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN KANSAS...

...Synopsis...
A potent shortwave trough will impact the southern and central
Plains today. This trough will promote a deepening surface cyclone
along the Kansas/Colorado border. This cyclone will move northeast
during the day, accelerating into the upper Midwest by Sunday
morning.

...Central and eastern Kansas...
Fire weather conditions across this region are expected to be quite
high given the favorable overlap of the mid-level and low-level jet.
Winds of 20-30 mph are expected with locally higher speeds possible.
RH of 15-20% is probable, though values near 10% are not out of the
question. Along with very dry fuels, these meteorological conditions
will support periods of extremely critical fire weather. Continued
uncertainty with the duration of these conditions precludes
highlights. The main reason for this uncertainty is the
southeastward progressing cold front. While the front may keep the
most extreme conditions brief, it will also mean an abrupt wind
shift that would impact any ongoing fires.

...Southern High Plains...
With the front remaining north of the region, warmer temperatures
should more readily support critically low RH. The most favorable
overlap of stronger low/mid-level winds will occur in the Texas
Panhandle. There, RH around 15% and winds of 20-25 mph will support
critical fire weather. Similar RH can be expected farther
south/southeast, but the duration of stronger surface winds is
uncertain.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF TRANS-PECOS INTO
SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO AND ADJACENT SOUTH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
On the heels of Saturday's strong trough, another trough will rotate
through the southern High Plains on Sunday. At the surface, another
cyclone, albeit weaker than Saturday, will develop in the Permian
Basin and move southeast through the day. A cold front will then
move through the region during the evening.

Critical fire weather is most likely from the Trans-Pecos into
southeast New Mexico and adjacent parts of the Texas South Plains.
These areas will be impacted by a favorably aligned low and
mid-level jet during the afternoon. Single digit RH will be
possible, particularly into western Texas. Otherwise, 10-20% will
occur broadly. Winds will most likely reach 20-25 mph with locally
higher speeds near 30 mph possible. This brings the potential for
locally extreme fire weather concerns. With the somewhat weaker
surface low expected, confidence in 30+ mph winds remains too low
for extremely critical highlights.

...Dynamic system to produce multiple impactful weather hazards
this weekend from significant icing in the Upper Midwest to
thunderstorms and heavy rainfall over parts of the Middle
Mississippi Valley and Midwest...

...There is a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to Flash
Flooding over portions of the Middle Mississippi Valley and
Midwest on Sunday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley on Saturday and over the Southern
Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday...

...Record-breaking warmth across parts of the East
Saturday-Monday, with Critical Risk of fire weather over the
Southern Plains through today...

A pair of shortwaves rotating through an upper-level trough will
be the driving force behind the main weather hazards of this
weekend. An area of low pressure over the Central Plains will
intensify today as it moves into the Upper Midwest. Moderate to
heavy snow will fall on its backside over parts of the Central
Great Basin, Intermountain West and Central Rockies today. A swath
of light to moderate snow will expand from the Front Range to the
Upper Midwest as the surface low tracks north and eastward.
Freezing rain will be the main concern within the transition zone
between snow and rain across parts of southern Minnesota, northern
Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula where ice accumulations
may exceed a quarter of an inch by Sunday morning. Ice Storm
Warnings are in effect for much of northern Wisconsin and the
western U.P. as a result.

Severe weather, fire weather and potential record breaking
temperatures will be a concern within the warm sector of this
dynamic system. A well defined warm front will lift northward
across the Midwest and Northeast through Sunday. This will allow
for anomalously warm and moist air to follow and expand across the
eastern half of the country. This will lead to widespread
temperature records being tied or broken across much of the East
through Monday. High temperatures are forecast to range between
20-30 degrees above average during this period. This warm and
moist airmass will also interact with a strong cold front driving
south through the central U.S. leading to the threat of severe
thunderstorms and excessive rainfall across parts of the
Mississippi Valley and Midwest over the next couple of days. The
Storm Prediction Center issued a Slight Risk of Severe
Thunderstorms for much of Iowa, northern Missouri, northwestern
Illinois and southwestern Wisconsin for today. Large hail, a few
tornadoes and damaging wind gusts will be the main concern for
these areas today. As the cold front drives farther south on
Sunday, so will the focus for severe storms. Slight Risks of
Severe Thunderstorms and Excessive Rainfall are in effect for
parts of the ArkLaTex, much of Arkansas, southern
Missouri/Illinois/Indiana, and western Kansas/Tennessee, where the
threat of heavy rainfall and a few tornadoes will be the main
concern. A dryline will develop across the Southern Plains today
and persist through at least Monday morning. These dry conditions
combined with warm air and gusty winds thanks to the deep area of
low pressure to the north will contribute to a Critical Fire
Weather area for parts of the Texas panhandle and central
Oklahoma/Kansas. The threat for Critical Fire Weather will retreat
back into eastern New Mexico and western Texas by Sunday. High
pressure will expand across the West over the coming days leading
to a cooldown, especially for parts of the Front Range where high
temperatures will be between 20-30 degrees below normal.

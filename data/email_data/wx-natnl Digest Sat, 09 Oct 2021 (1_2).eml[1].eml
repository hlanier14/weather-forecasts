Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Fri Oct 08 2021

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 10/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Fri Oct 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
Recent satellite imagery shows a mid-level shortwave trough off the
California coast. This trough is forecast to move across California
early today and into the Great Basin through tonight. As this
occurs, a corridor of enhanced mid-level flow near the base of the
trough is forecast to begin impinging on portions of the
central/southern Plains during the afternoon. Meanwhile, lee surface
troughing is forecast to strengthen through today across portions of
the central Plains.

...Central/Southern High Plains and Southern Plains...
Dry southwesterly downslope flow is expected to increase from midday
into this afternoon in response to the aforementioned strengthening
of a lee surface trough and enhanced mid-level flow overspreading
the area. By afternoon, sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph are
expected across northern/central New Mexico into far southern
Colorado and also across west/southwest Oklahoma and western North
Texas. While meteorologically elevated fire weather conditions are
expected amidst minimum RH values of 15-25%, these conditions are
forecast to remain mostly over areas where fuels are only modestly
receptive to large fire spread (e.g., ERC percentiles generally
below the 80th percentile). Locally elevated fire weather conditions
are most likely across western Oklahoma/North Texas (fuels are a bit
more receptive) and across south-central/southeastern Colorado
(fuels are critically receptive but forecast winds are lighter).

...First winter storm of the season possible for parts of the
central and northern Rockies by early to middle of next week...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across portions of
the southern/central Plains Tuesday into Wednesday...


...Overview...

After a couple of upper-level shortwaves and surface low pressure
systems track quickly across the central U.S. Monday into Tuesday,
the dominant system of note during the medium range period will be
a potent low pressure system evolving over the central
Rockies/High Plains before tracking into southern Canada, bringing
significant mountain snow to parts of the Rockies as well as areas
of heavy rainfall to portions of the northern Plains. The trailing
cold front may also serve as a focus for locally heavy and strong
to severe convection over the southern Plains. The amplified upper
pattern will bring a pronounced temperature contrast with well
below normal readings over the West and multiple warm days over
the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance has reasonably good agreement with the early part
of the forecast regarding shortwave and surface low positions
across the central U.S. and south-central Canada, as well as with
the digging trough in the western U.S. that is expected to close
off an upper low likely late Monday into Tuesday. Meanwhile,
models continue to forecast persistent ridging across the
southeastern quadrant of the U.S., for which there is good model
agreement. As the main upper low lifts northeastward toward the
Northern Plains Tuesday through Thursday, model guidance remains
consistent with its general evolution, but with some meaningful
differences in track and timing. Much like the previous cycle, the
00Z/06Z GFS runs remain on the eastern side of the guidance
envelope, while the 00Z CMC initially tracks with the
slower/farther west ECMWF, but ends up still somewhat to the
northwest by around midweek. The 00Z UKMET was closer to the GFS
runs but still a reasonable solution closer to a middle ground.
Overall, the best compromise for the upper and surface low tracks
appeared to be the position of the 00Z EC ensemble mean, which for
the deterministic guidance was closest to the ECMWF. Thus today's
forecast employed a multi-model deterministic blend early, then
eliminating the CMC by around Wednesday, in favor of the EC
ensemble mean and eventually some of the 06Z GEFS mean. Higher
weighting was given to the ECMWF and EC ensemble mean solutions.
This forecast blend maintained reasonable continuity with the
previous forecast, with perhaps the main low system moving a touch
faster. While there are some differences in timing/amplitude of
shortwaves coming into the Northeast Tuesday-Wednesday and into
the West for the latter part of the week, this solution worked for
those areas as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The amplifying western trough and closed upper low development
over the Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring
much below normal temperatures behind a leading cold front/low
pressure, with broad coverage of daytime highs 20-30 degrees below
normal across much of the interior West next Monday-Wednesday.
This colder air will lower snow levels in the mountains with
potential for heavy snow accumulations in the higher terrain of
the northern-central Rockies as low pressure consolidates
Tuesday-Wednesday and then tracks northeastward. This would be the
first significant winter storm of the season for this area. Away
from the mountains, an axis of heavy rainfall is possible around
and to the north of the surface low with some mixing of snow not
out of the question during the colder overnight hours. Gusty winds
may also be possible across the central and northern Plains by
Wednesday and Thursday as the surface low deepens.  Across the
central and southern Plains, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is
possible and the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring another
threat for severe weather on Tuesday and/or Wednesday depending on
exact timing of the front that will extend from the northern
Plains low. By Thursday-Friday there is some potential for eastern
Pacific tropical moisture to stream northeastward and interact
with the front to produce areas of heavy rainfall likely over
Texas, but confidence is low for resolving the location and
magnitude specifics.

Elsewhere, a leading system may bring a band of enhanced rainfall
to parts of the Midwest Monday as it lifts northeastward. The
Pacific Northwest should see mostly light precipitation with
upstream energy coming in from the Pacific through midweek, before
an approaching late week frontal system may increase amounts
somewhat over the Olympics and far northern Cascades.

The West will see its cold temperatures moderate by
Thursday-Friday with gradually shrinking coverage of minus 10-20F
anomalies for highs and morning lows. Within the eastern U.S.
warmth, highest anomalies for max temperatures will be over the
Great Lakes/Northeast with highs tending to be 10-15F or so above
average. An overwhelming majority of the East will see plus 10-20F
anomalies for lows with some locations over/southwest of the Great
Lakes possibly even warmer Monday-Tuesday. Such readings may
achieve daily records for warm lows over some areas.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 14 - 18 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. A trough is forecast over Alaska extending southward along
the
west coast of North America. There is good agreement among the models on
prediction of a strong ridge over the eastern U.S. The circulation pattern =
has
evolved from forecasts several days ago, when an amplified trough was forec=
ast
over the western CONUS in the 6-10 day period. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDs manual blend of model
500-hPa height forecasts predicts only weak troughing over the western CONU=
S
in
the 6-10 day period average and very weak height anomalies over much of the
central CONUS. This is likely due to an initial trough moving across the
region
in the beginning of the 6-10 day period, followed by another trough
approaching
the West Coast. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies extend farther inland in
today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 0Z and 6Z GEFS than in recent ECMWF and C=
anadian ensemble means. The
0Z
Canadian and ECMWF ensembles favor keeping negative height anomalies mostly
offshore. Due to recent model performance, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
s manual 500-hPa height
blend
forecast gives equal weight to the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means and less
weight to the Canadian ensemble mean. The blend indicates negative 500-hPa
height anomalies over Alaska, extending southward into the Gulf of Alaska a=
nd
into the west coast of the CONUS. Positive height anomalies are forecast ov=
er
the eastern half of the CONUS.

With strong ridging forecast over northeastern North America, above normal
temperatures are favored for the central and eastern CONUS and especially f=
or
the eastern Great Lakes and Northeast regions where the temperature
consolidation tool indicates high probabilities. Below normal temperatures =
are
favored over the western CONUS under predicted mean troughing and near to
below
normal 500-hPa heights, and also consistent with the consolidation forecast
tool. Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated over most of Alas=
ka
under predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights.

As a trough is predicted to progress eastward from the Bering Sea into Alas=
ka
during the period, above normal precipitation is favored for the Southwest
Mainland, the south coast of Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle. Predicted
troughing to the west increases the chances of above normal precipitation
across western areas of the Pacific Northwest. Below normal precipitation i=
s
favored for much of the remainder of the western CONUS extending eastward
across the Northern Plains and western Great Lakes region, as 500-hPa heigh=
ts
are predicted to rise during the period. Above normal precipitation is favo=
red
from eastern Texas across most of the Lower and Central Mississippi Valley
supported by the precipitation consolidation tool. Near normal precipitatio=
n
is
favored across the remainder of the eastern CONUS, with greater uncertainty
among precipitation forecast tools.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Near average, 3 out of 5, due =
an
amplified forecast pattern and good tools agreement over much of the domain=
,
offset by a changing circulation pattern and some disagreement among
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 16 - 22 2021

During week-2, the 500-hPa flow pattern is similar to the 6-10 day period
forecast, with an amplified trough over Alaska and the northeastern Pacific=
.
The trough is predicted to amplify and extend further south along the Pacif=
ic
Coast during the period. Ridging is predicted to increase over the central
CONUS during week 2, with positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending into =
the
Four Corners region in most model forecasts.

The temperature pattern forecast for the week 2 period is similar overall t=
o
the 6-10 day period forecast. Below normal temperatures continue to be favo=
red
over most of Alaska, except for parts of northeastern Mainland Alaska, unde=
r
negative 500-hPa height anomalies. With mean troughing expected near the We=
st
Coast, below normal temperatures are favored along the Pacific Coast of the
CONUS. Above normal temperatures are likely for most areas of the central a=
nd
eastern CONUS, under predicted ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights.

Predicted amplified troughing along the coast increases the probabilities o=
f
near to above normal precipitation over the western CONUS. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are elevated from the Rocky Mountains across mo=
st
of the Great Plains region and northeastward into the Midwest, under a
predicted ridge. Near to above normal precipitation is favored over the
eastern
CONUS, supported by the precipitation consolidation tool, with slightly
elevated chances of above normal precipitation along the Atlantic coast of =
the
Southeast. Troughing  and associated surface low pressure increase the chan=
ces
slightly of near to above normal precipitation for parts of southwest
Mainland,
the south coast of Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Near average, 3 out of 5, due =
to
relatively good model agreement and a fairly amplified pattern, offset by
uncertainty due to a transition in the pattern during the period.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 08 2021

SYNOPSIS: A region of mid-level low pressure is forecast to retrograde from
the
western contiguous U.S. into the Pacific Ocean, while the strong anomalous
area
of mid-level high pressure extending from Hudson Bay into the eastern half =
of
the CONUS weakens somewhat. This evolution supports much below-normal
temperatures across the interior West on day 8. East of the mid-level low
setting up in the eastern Pacific and west of the entrenched mid-level high
centered in eastern Canada, heavy precipitation is expected along the centr=
al
and northern West Coast. Finally, the deep trough in the eastern Pacific
extends northward across Alaska, resulting in below-normal temperatures for
most of the state and an active storm track across the far north Pacific Oc=
ean
eastward into the Alaska Panhandle and western Canada. This should bring he=
avy
precipitation and gusty winds into southeast Alaska and the Panhandle, but
anomalies are expected to remain below hazard thresholds.



HAZARDS

Moderate risk of heavy precipitation in northern California and adjacent
Oregon, Tue-Thu, Oct. 19-21

Slight risk of heavy precipitation in central sections of the West Coast
States, Mon-Fri, Oct. 18-22

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for much of the interior west=
ern
U.S., Sat, Oct 16.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY OCTOBER 11 - FRIDAY OCTOBER 15:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!oXq5ttzaYxGiYNluMGv-ECTL4xGxAeMfsvv3NOwFtGFcM2idpf0JUpQEpS1zT=
Qn3pNTS7eZd$

FOR SATURDAY OCTOBER 16 - FRIDAY OCTOBER 22: There is substantial cross-mod=
el
agreement and model-to-model continuity for week-2, although the timing and
amplitude of individual features differ. Anomalous mid-level troughing near
the
West Coast should redevelop and sharpen farther to the west in the
northeastern
Pacific Ocean. Meanwhile, the well-established ridge in eastern North Ameri=
ca
should continue to dominate weather there. By late in the period, this ridg=
e
flattens and expands somewhat while the maximum mid-level height anomalies
drift northward to near southern Baffin Island. The retreating trough could
keep well below-normal temperatures across the interior West on day 8
supporting the slight risk of much below normal temperatures remaining in
place
on 10/16, but thereafter the expanding ridge should keep temperatures moder=
ate
across the CONUS and most of Canada, precluding any other temperature hazar=
ds.



Models agree that one or more individual storms will traverse the western
CONUS
east of the developing northeast Pacific Ocean trough. The location of
potential heavy precipitation is consistent among almost all model guidance=
,
stretching from northern California northward to the Canadian border. Howev=
er,
the timing and resulting weather from individual systems remain in question=
.
The ECMWF ensembles show more precipitation than the GEFS, and brings it in=
to
the region more quickly, near the middle of week-2. The GEFS depicts somewh=
at
lower totals over the same area, mostly later in the period. The GEFS,
however,
has shifted toward the wetter solution from ECMWF ensembles yesterday,
engendering more confidence that heavy precipitation will affect the West
Coast
at some point during week-2. Regardless of timing, storms tracking into the
western CONUS after the first day or two of the period seem likely to bring
increased chances for heavy precipitation. This creates a risk for heavy
precipitation hazards during the middle or later part of week-2 across the
central West Coast region, where hazards thresholds are lower than farther
north across Washington and adjacent Oregon. The GEFS and ECMWF ensembles b=
oth
show a maximum of anomalously heavy precipitation occurring in northern
California and adjacent Oregon, so there is more confidence that this regio=
n
will receive unusually heavy precipitation than elsewhere along the West
Coast,
thus a moderate risk for heavy precipitation hazards exist in this region
10/19-10/21, with slight chances for heavy precipitation hazards posted
farther
to the north and south 10/18-10/22. The hazards are posted for a broad time
window because of the timing differences between GEFS and the ECMWF ensembl=
e.



The 6Z operational GFS has shifted toward the consensus of the other models
and
is not the extreme outlier it was yesterday, but it alone develops a
slowly-moving, cut-off mid-level low in central CONUS. This solution is not
discounted entirely, but seems far less likely than the array of other mode=
ls,
which are in general agreement.

...Developing coastal low to produce showers, gusty winds, and
coastal flooding along the Mid-Atlantic this weekend...

...Anomalous and potentially record-breaking heat found across the
central/southern Plains through Saturday...

...Potent cold front and associated areas of low pressure to
contribute to unsettled weather across the Intermountain West and
northern/central Rockies, while eventually sparking robust
thunderstorms throughout the southern Plains on Sunday...

The weather system that has soaked the Southeast over the last few
days is continuing to slowly push eastward, but is forecast to
stall along the Mid-Atlantic and southeastern coastline this
weekend. As a result, locally heavy rain will remain a concern
tonight across parts of the Southern Appalachians and Carolinas.
Meanwhile, a developing area of low pressure to the southeast of
North Carolina will aid in producing lingering showers and shift
the heavy rain threat toward eastern North Carolina on Saturday.
The National Hurricane Center is monitoring this disturbance for
potential subtropical development. Regardless, unsettled weather
and gusty winds, along with coastal flooding, can be expected
through Sunday along coastal sections of the Mid-Atlantic.

For the central and south-central U.S. mainland, a building ridge
of high pressure aloft will bring the potential of record-breaking
heat beginning this afternoon and continuing into the weekend,
with high temperatures forecast to soar well into the 90s across
the central and southern Plains. These temperatures equate to
around 10 to 25 degrees above average with the warmest day
forecast to occur on Saturday. Additionally, the warm temperatures
combined with gusty winds and low relative humidity may lead to
elevated fire weather concerns. Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather
Watches have been issued across parts of the central Plains and
southern High Plains.

In contrast, a deep upper-level trough swinging through the
western U.S. will usher in below average temperatures and chances
for precipitation across much of the Intermountain West and
Rockies through the beginning of the weekend. In fact, snow is
forecast for the highest mountain ranges. Scattered showers and
some thunderstorms are also expected for the lower elevations, a
few storms could turn severe and produce isolated flash flooding
between northern Nevada and southeast Idaho through tonight. By
Saturday, a developing low pressure system ejecting into the
northern Plains will likely bring a period of enhanced rainfall
together with gusty winds across the region. Isolated severe
thunderstorms are not out of the question for parts of the Dakotas
and Minnesota from Saturday night into early Sunday. As the
aforementioned upper-level trough enters the southern High Plains
late on Sunday, severe thunderstorms may develop ahead of an
associated cold front situated between the middle Mississippi
Valley and southern Plains. The Storm Prediction Center has issued
an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of severe weather centered around
Sunday evening across parts of eastern Oklahoma and northern
Texas.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Fri Oct 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough is expected to deepen as it moves from the Great
Basin into the Four Corners region Day 2/Saturday. Meanwhile,
enhanced mid-level flow near the base of trough is forecast to
persist across portions of the central/southern Plains. At the
surface, a lee cyclone is forecast to deepen over portions of Kansas
and vicinity during the afternoon, which will strengthen the surface
pressure gradient over the central/southern Plains.

...Southern/Central Plains...
Breezy/gusty southwest surface winds are forecast to develop by
midday and strengthen into the afternoon in association with the
aforementioned deepening lee cyclone and enhanced flow aloft. While
sustained surface wind speeds in excess of 20 mph coupled with
minimum RH values of 15-20% should yield several hours of
meteorologically critical conditions, fuels across much of the
southern Plains are forecast by WFAS to remain only modestly
receptive to large fire spread. Fuels are more receptive across the
central Plains but the uncertainty in widespread critical fire
weather conditions is lower. Nevertheless, at least locally critical
conditions are expected over much of the area from midday into the
evening (especially in areas with an abundance of fine/grassy
fuels).

...Northern Rockies...
A few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions are possible
across portions of northern Montana Day 2/Saturday afternoon as
westerly sustained surface winds near 15-20 mph overlap minimum RH
values of 20-30%. At this time, uncertainty regarding fuel status
due to potential preceding rainfall, and also poor confidence in a
favorable wind/RH overlap, preclude an elevated fire weather area.

...First winter storm of the season possible for parts of the
central and northern Rockies by early to middle of next week...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across portions of
the southern/central Plains Tuesday into Wednesday...


...Overview...

After a couple of upper-level shortwaves and surface low pressure
systems track quickly across the central U.S. Monday into Tuesday,
the dominant system of note during the medium range period will be
a potent low pressure system evolving over the central
Rockies/High Plains before tracking into southern Canada, bringing
significant mountain snow to parts of the Rockies as well as areas
of heavy rainfall to portions of the northern Plains. The trailing
cold front may also serve as a focus for locally heavy and strong
to severe convection over the southern Plains. The amplified upper
pattern will bring a pronounced temperature contrast with well
below normal readings over the West and multiple warm days over
the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance has reasonably good agreement with the early part
of the forecast regarding shortwave and surface low positions
across the central U.S. and south-central Canada, as well as with
the digging trough in the western U.S. that is expected to close
off an upper low likely late Monday into Tuesday. Meanwhile,
models continue to forecast persistent ridging across the
southeastern quadrant of the U.S., for which there is good model
agreement. As the main upper low lifts northeastward toward the
Northern Plains Tuesday through Thursday, model guidance remains
consistent with its general evolution, but with some meaningful
differences in track and timing. Much like the previous cycle, the
00Z/06Z GFS runs remain on the eastern side of the guidance
envelope, while the 00Z CMC initially tracks with the
slower/farther west ECMWF, but ends up still somewhat to the
northwest by around midweek. The 00Z UKMET was closer to the GFS
runs but still a reasonable solution closer to a middle ground.
Overall, the best compromise for the upper and surface low tracks
appeared to be the position of the 00Z EC ensemble mean, which for
the deterministic guidance was closest to the ECMWF. Thus today's
forecast employed a multi-model deterministic blend early, then
eliminating the CMC by around Wednesday, in favor of the EC
ensemble mean and eventually some of the 06Z GEFS mean. Higher
weighting was given to the ECMWF and EC ensemble mean solutions.
This forecast blend maintained reasonable continuity with the
previous forecast, with perhaps the main low system moving a touch
faster. While there are some differences in timing/amplitude of
shortwaves coming into the Northeast Tuesday-Wednesday and into
the West for the latter part of the week, this solution worked for
those areas as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The amplifying western trough and closed upper low development
over the Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring
much below normal temperatures behind a leading cold front/low
pressure, with broad coverage of daytime highs 20-30 degrees below
normal across much of the interior West next Monday-Wednesday.
This colder air will lower snow levels in the mountains with
potential for heavy snow accumulations in the higher terrain of
the northern-central Rockies as low pressure consolidates
Tuesday-Wednesday and then tracks northeastward. This would be the
first significant winter storm of the season for this area. Away
from the mountains, an axis of heavy rainfall is possible around
and to the north of the surface low with some mixing of snow not
out of the question during the colder overnight hours. Gusty winds
may also be possible across the central and northern Plains by
Wednesday and Thursday as the surface low deepens.  Across the
central and southern Plains, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is
possible and the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring another
threat for severe weather on Tuesday and/or Wednesday depending on
exact timing of the front that will extend from the northern
Plains low. By Thursday-Friday there is some potential for eastern
Pacific tropical moisture to stream northeastward and interact
with the front to produce areas of heavy rainfall likely over
Texas, but confidence is low for resolving the location and
magnitude specifics.

Elsewhere, a leading system may bring a band of enhanced rainfall
to parts of the Midwest Monday as it lifts northeastward. The
Pacific Northwest should see mostly light precipitation with
upstream energy coming in from the Pacific through midweek, before
an approaching late week frontal system may increase amounts
somewhat over the Olympics and far northern Cascades.

The West will see its cold temperatures moderate by
Thursday-Friday with gradually shrinking coverage of minus 10-20F
anomalies for highs and morning lows. Within the eastern U.S.
warmth, highest anomalies for max temperatures will be over the
Great Lakes/Northeast with highs tending to be 10-15F or so above
average. An overwhelming majority of the East will see plus 10-20F
anomalies for lows with some locations over/southwest of the Great
Lakes possibly even warmer Monday-Tuesday. Such readings may
achieve daily records for warm lows over some areas.

ensemble mean and eventually some of the 06Z GEFS mean. Higher
weighting was given to the ECMWF and EC ensemble mean solutions.
This forecast blend maintained reasonable continuity with the
previous forecast, with perhaps the main low system moving a touch
faster. While there are some differences in timing/amplitude of
shortwaves coming into the Northeast Tuesday-Wednesday and into
the West for the latter part of the week, this solution worked for
those areas as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The amplifying western trough and closed upper low development
over the Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring
much below normal temperatures behind a leading cold front/low
pressure, with broad coverage of daytime highs 20-30 degrees below
normal across much of the interior West next Monday-Wednesday.
This colder air will lower snow levels in the mountains with
potential for heavy snow accumulations in the higher terrain of
the northern-central Rockies as low pressure consolidates
Tuesday-Wednesday and then tracks northeastward. This would be the
first significant winter storm of the season for this area. Away
from the mountains, an axis of heavy rainfall is possible around
and to the north of the surface low with some mixing of snow not
out of the question during the colder overnight hours. Gusty winds
may also be possible across the central and northern Plains by
Wednesday and Thursday as the surface low deepens.  Across the
central and southern Plains, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is
possible and the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring another
threat for severe weather on Tuesday and/or Wednesday depending on
exact timing of the front that will extend from the northern
Plains low. By Thursday-Friday there is some potential for eastern
Pacific tropical moisture to stream northeastward and interact
with the front to produce areas of heavy rainfall likely over
Texas, but confidence is low for resolving the location and
magnitude specifics.

Elsewhere, a leading system may bring a band of enhanced rainfall
to parts of the Midwest Monday as it lifts northeastward. The
Pacific Northwest should see mostly light precipitation with
upstream energy coming in from the Pacific through midweek, before
an approaching late week frontal system may increase amounts
somewhat over the Olympics and far northern Cascades.

The West will see its cold temperatures moderate by
Thursday-Friday with gradually shrinking coverage of minus 10-20F
anomalies for highs and morning lows. Within the eastern U.S.
warmth, highest anomalies for max temperatures will be over the
Great Lakes/Northeast with highs tending to be 10-15F or so above
average. An overwhelming majority of the East will see plus 10-20F
anomalies for lows with some locations over/southwest of the Great
Lakes possibly even warmer Monday-Tuesday. Such readings may
achieve daily records for warm lows over some areas.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Sat Oct 09 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level trough is forecast to move from the western Great
Basin this morning and into the Four Corners region through tonight.
This will maintain a broad corridor of vigorous
southwesterly/westerly mid-level flow -- near the base of the trough
-- from the Southwest to the central/southern Plains. At the
surface, lee troughing is forecast to strengthen across the central
Plains through this afternoon while a cold front gradually shifts
southward across southeast Colorado and into the Oklahoma/Texas
Panhandles.

...Central/Southern Plains...
Strong/gusty southwesterly winds (westerly winds over Colorado) are
expected to develop around midday as strong surface heating promotes
efficient vertical mixing to the surface of the aforementioned
enhanced winds aloft. Sustained surface winds of 20-30 mph are
likely (with stronger gusts) with winds peaking during the mid/late
afternoon as minimum RH values dip to near 15-20%. Despite these
meteorologically critical fire weather conditions, fuels across much
of this area remain just below critical status, which precludes a
Critical fire weather area. Locally critical fire weather conditions
are most likely over southeast Colorado, far southwest Kansas, and
western portions of the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles, where the most
favorable combination of surface wind/RH and receptive fuels is
expected.

Near critical meteorological conditions are also expected farther
south into southeast New Mexico. However, fuels across this area are
even less favorable to large fire spread (ERCs below the 60th
percentile), which should generally keep any fire weather threat
localized.

...Montana...
A few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions are expected
this afternoon across portions of north-central Montana as sustained
westerly surface winds near 15 mph overlap RH values of 15-20% and
receptive fuels. At this time, the brief/spotty nature of the threat
precludes introducing an Elevated fire weather area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CDT Sat Oct 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level trough -- over the Four Corners region at the
start of Day 2/Sunday -- is expected to move across the
central/southern Plains through the remainder of the day. Meanwhile,
another mid-level trough is forecast to deepen as it moves southward
across the Pacific Northwest late Day 2/Sunday. At the surface, a
deepening lee cyclone over portions of western North Texas is
forecast to move northeastward into Missouri through the overnight.

...Southern Plains...
Critical meteorological fire weather conditions are likely by midday
Day 2/Sunday as enhanced mid-level flow near the base of the
aforementioned trough mixes to the surface. While several hours of
sustained westerly surface winds of 25-30 mph (stronger gusts)
overlapping critical RH values are expected, fuels across this area
remain mostly unfavorable to large-scale fire spread. Nevertheless,
the potential for higher-end critical conditions will likely yield
at least elevated fire weather concerns.

...California...
Gusty northerly surface winds are forecast to develop late Day
2/Sunday night as the aforementioned trough over the Pacific
Northwest begins to impinge on the area. While locally elevated fire
weather conditions are likely, overnight RH recoveries are currently
forecast to be sufficient to preclude introducing an Elevated fire
weather area. The fire weather threat is forecast to increase early
Day 3/Monday as RH values drop and the strong surface winds persist.
Please see the Day 3/Monday fire weather outlook for more
information.

...First significant winter storm of the season for parts of the
central and northern Rockies continuing into the middle of next
week...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across portions of
the southern/central Plains Tuesday into Wednesday...


...Overview...

Behind a Great Lakes system that rapidly weakens as the supporting
dynamics flow around a Gulf of Mexico/Eastern U.S. upper ridge, a
Southwest/southern Great Basin upper low will track northeastward
through the northern Plains and into Canada.  This upper low will
support strong low pressure expected to progress from the central
Rockies through the northern Plains during Tuesday-Thursday,
bringing significant mountain snow to parts of the Rockies as well
as areas of heavy rainfall to portions of the northern Plains. The
trailing cold front may also serve as a focus for locally heavy
and strong to severe convection over the southern half of the
Plains. The amplified upper pattern will bring a pronounced
temperature contrast with well below normal readings over the West
and multiple warm days over the East.  Features should become a
little more progressive by next weekend as an upper trough over
the northeastern Pacific helps to build a western ridge that in
turn will encourage an eastward displacement of the mid-late week
trough.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

At least in terms of the track and timing of the ejecting upper
low, the ECMWF mean continued to provide the most reasonable
individual solution relative to the full array of 12Z/18Z
guidance.  GFS runs have continued to be a bit on the fast side of
the spread (especially late Tuesday into Wednesday) while the 12Z
ECMWF leans to the slow side.  From about late Wednesday onward,
latest guidance including the new 00Z GFS/UKMET/CMC reinforce the
idea of somewhat faster progression than the 12Z ECMWF.  The new
00Z ECMWF has indeed adjusted a bit faster.  Employing a 12Z/18Z
model blend provided the desired intermediate timing while
providing more detail than the ECMWF mean at the surface.
Guidance agrees fairly well that weak shortwave energy arriving
from the Pacific by Wednesday will drop into the western U.S. mean
trough and likely promote some waviness along the trailing front
over the southern half of the Plains late in the week.  An added
complication after midweek will be what happens with the energy
aloft and moisture associated with a tropical system that is
likely to develop in the eastern Pacific (high formation chance in
the next two days per the latest Tropical Weather Outlook from the
National Hurricane Center).  There is general agreement on a
corridor for this energy/moisture to travel between the Gulf of
Mexico ridge and western U.S. trough but there are still
significant track and timing differences for the expected tropical
system.  CMC runs are particularly fast with it.

Toward the end of the period the primary issues are how quickly
height falls reach into the Pacific Northwest/western Canada ahead
of a northeastern Pacific trough and progression of the remaining
upper trough across the central U.S.  The 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means
are quite similar and provide reasonable support for the 18Z
GFS/12Z ECMWF timing of the upper trough reaching the east-central
U.S. by Saturday.  The 12Z GFS was somewhat faster while multiple
CMC runs have been slower than consensus.  The new 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted slower, closer to the 00Z CMC.  Meanwhile GFS runs thus
far have been more eager than most other guidance to bring height
falls into western North America.  These considerations led to
adjusting the early-period operational model blend toward
two-thirds total ensemble weight and more 12Z ECMWF than 18Z GEFS
for the rest by day 7 Saturday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The cold storm system developing over the Interior West/Rockies on
Tuesday and then tracking northeastward will lower snow levels in
the mountains with potential for heavy snow accumulations in the
higher terrain of the northern-central Rockies, specifically from
Colorado through Wyoming into far southern Montana.  This would be
the first significant winter storm of the season for this area.
Away from the mountains, an axis of heavy rainfall is possible
around and to the north of the surface low.  Some mixing of snow
may not be out of the question during the colder overnight hours.
A fairly broad area of strong/gusty winds will also progress from
the Interior West/Rockies into the Plains Tuesday through
Thursday.  Across the central and southern Plains, moderate to
locally heavy rainfall is possible and the Storm Prediction Center
is monitoring a threat for severe weather on Tuesday and/or
Wednesday depending on exact timing of the front that will extend
from the northern Plains low. Around mid-late week there continues
to be a potential for eastern Pacific tropical moisture to stream
northeastward and interact with the front to produce areas of
heavy rainfall over parts of Texas and possibly extending
northeastward.  However the combined uncertainties over timing of
the front, wave details, and timing/track of the likely tropical
system keep confidence fairly low for resolving important
specifics of location and magnitude of heaviest rainfall.  The
cold front and accompanying rainfall should extend farther into
the East by next weekend.  Elsewhere, the Pacific Northwest may
see one or more episodes of mostly light precipitation, first from
weak Pacific energy that continues into the West and then flow on
the leading edge of a Northeast Pacific upper trough.  The Great
Lakes and vicinity may see some rainfall on Tuesday from the
weakening system initially over the region.

The West will see a broad area of highs 15-30F below normal
through midweek followed by gradual moderation toward more
single-digit anomalies by Saturday.  Morning lows will be less
extreme but there will still be multiple days with lows of 10-20F
below normal.  On the other hand the East will be quite warm
through late week.  At least the northern half of the region will
see highs of 10F or more above normal on one or more days while a
much broader area will see plus 10-20F or so anomalies for lows.
Numerous record warm lows will be possible from the western Gulf
Coast northeastward.  Eventual progression of the Plains cold
front should bring a cooling trend from west to east by late
Friday/Saturday.

specifics of location and magnitude of heaviest rainfall.  The
cold front and accompanying rainfall should extend farther into
the East by next weekend.  Elsewhere, the Pacific Northwest may
see one or more episodes of mostly light precipitation, first from
weak Pacific energy that continues into the West and then flow on
the leading edge of a Northeast Pacific upper trough.  The Great
Lakes and vicinity may see some rainfall on Tuesday from the
weakening system initially over the region.

The West will see a broad area of highs 15-30F below normal
through midweek followed by gradual moderation toward more
single-digit anomalies by Saturday.  Morning lows will be less
extreme but there will still be multiple days with lows of 10-20F
below normal.  On the other hand the East will be quite warm
through late week.  At least the northern half of the region will
see highs of 10F or more above normal on one or more days while a
much broader area will see plus 10-20F or so anomalies for lows.
Numerous record warm lows will be possible from the western Gulf
Coast northeastward.  Eventual progression of the Plains cold
front should bring a cooling trend from west to east by late
Friday/Saturday.

...A wavy front will bring showers, gusty winds, and coastal
flooding along the Mid-Atlantic through this weekend...

...Anomalous heat across the central/southern Plains this weekend
will be followed by strong to severe thunderstorms late Sunday
into early Monday...

...A surge of cold air behind a potent cold front will set the
stage for the first wintry weather event for the northern/central
Rockies on Monday...

An increasingly active weather pattern is taking shape across the
U.S. during the next few days as a rapid surge of cold air mass is
forecast to push through the western U.S. against a slow-moving
front near the East Coast while a couple of low pressure systems
are forecast to form in the mid-section of the country.  First of
all, the slow-moving regime in the eastern U.S. will continue to
allow unsettled weather to persist through the weekend and into
early next week for much of the East Coast.  Waves of low pressure
are forecast to form near a stalled front.  The National Hurricane
Center is monitoring the potential of tropical cyclone development
amid these low pressure waves near the North Carolina coast today
into early Sunday.  Regardless, unsettled weather and gusty winds,
along with coastal flooding, can be expected along coastal
sections of the Mid-Atlantic through the weekend.  Farther north
across much of the Midwest, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and into the
southern Appalachians, a slow-moving upper trough/low will help
trigger additional clusters of showers and thunderstorms
containing locally heavy
downpours.  These activities should decrease on Sunday as the
upper trough finally shows signs of dissipating.

For the central and south-central U.S. mainland, a building ridge
of high pressure aloft will bring the potential of record-breaking
heat especially today as high temperatures forecast to soar well
into the 90s to near 100 across the central and southern Plains.
These temperatures equate to around 10 to 25+ degrees above
average with the warmest day forecast to occur on Saturday.
Additionally, the warm temperatures combined with gusty winds and
low relative humidity may lead to elevated fire weather concerns.
Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches have been issued across
parts of the central Plains and southern High Plains.

In contrast, a deep upper-level trough swinging through the
western U.S. will usher in below average temperatures and chances
for precipitation across much of the Intermountain West and
Rockies through the beginning of the weekend. In fact, snow is
forecast for the highest mountain ranges. Scattered showers and
some thunderstorms are also expected for the lower elevations, a
few storms could turn severe and produce isolated flash flooding
between northern Nevada and southeast Idaho through tonight. By
Saturday, a developing low pressure system ejecting into the
northern Plains will likely bring a period of enhanced rainfall
together with gusty winds across the region. Isolated severe
thunderstorms are not out of the question for parts of the Dakotas
and Minnesota from Saturday night into early Sunday. As the
aforementioned upper-level trough enters the southern High Plains
late on Sunday, severe thunderstorms may develop ahead of an
associated cold front situated between the middle Mississippi
Valley and southern Plains. The Storm Prediction Center has issued
an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of severe weather centered around
Sunday evening across parts of eastern Oklahoma and northern
Texas.

system ejecting into the northern Plains will likely bring a
period of enhanced rainfall today across the region, along with
the possibility of severe thunderstorms for parts of the area into
early Sunday.  As this system begins to moves into the upper Great
Lakes on Sunday, another low pressure system is forecast to
rapidly develop over the southern High Plains.  This system is
expected to bring a higher threat of severe thunderstorms into
Oklahoma on Sunday along with heavy rain.

Last but not least, another cold air mass surging behind a potent
cold front is forecast to move through the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday.  This will set the stage for the first potentially
significant wintry weather event of the season for the
northern/central Rockies on Monday where a large low pressure
system is forecast to form.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Sat Jun 19 2021

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE FOUR CORNERS AND WESTERN
SLOPE...

Minor changes to the ongoing dry thunderstorm areas. Remaining
convective debris is most prevalent across the Uintas this morning.
Elsewhere, skies a mostly clear and diurnal heating should promote
scattered dry thunderstorms in portions of the Four Corners and
nearby vicinity. A weak perturbation is evident on water vapor
imagery in western/central Utah. Greater storm coverage is
anticipated for near the Utah/Colorado border in association with
this feature. Another local maximum in coverage appears likely
within eastern portions of the Mogollon Rim into west-central New
Mexico.

Elsewhere, other forecast reasoning remains valid. See the previous
discussion for more details.

..Wendt.. 06/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Sat Jun 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
Ridging across the Southwest will remain in place while a shortwave
trough develops southward into the northern Rockies this evening.
Increasing northwesterly flow aloft will spread a dry airmass across
the northern and central Rockies, while widespread dry thunderstorms
are expected near the Four Corners.

...Four Corners and Western Slope Dry Thunder...
Mid-level ridging centered over the Four Corners will remain
dominate across the Southwest through the day. Around the upper
high, moist southerly mid-level flow is forecast to continue
advecting moisture northward into the southern Rockies. Strong
diurnal heating and the glancing influence of the northern US trough
will support widespread shower and thunderstorm development from mid
morning through early evening. Dry sub-cloud layers with RH below
20% are likely, suggesting storms will be high-based. With little
precipitation expected, scattered dry lightning strikes appear
likely. The corridor of greatest activity appears to be from central
and western Colorado toward eastern Utah. Given very receptive fuels
and expected storm coverage, scattered dry thunder probabilities
will be maintained.

...Snake River Valley...
Northwest flow aloft ahead of shortwave trough across the northern
Rockies will enhance westerly surface winds to around 15 mph through
southern Idaho. Warm and dry surface conditions with RH of 10-20%
developing during the day will support elevated to locally critical
fire weather conditions.

...Wyoming and Montana...
Increasing flow aloft associated with the aforementioned Rockies
shortwave will result in westerly downslope flow across much of
Wyoming and eastern Montana. Weak lee cyclogenesis is forecast
across eastern Montana this afternoon, enhancing surface winds to
around 15-20 mph. Through the afternoon, a warm and well-mixed
boundary layer with RH below 20% will overlap with fuels supporting
elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions. A dry cold
front will move in from the northwest later in the evening, bringing
a shift to northwesterly flow and gradually decreasing wind speeds
after dark.

...Heat intensifies later next week over the interior Northwest
toward record levels...

...Midweek heat for portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

Upper ridging is again forecast to build/strengthen into parts of
the West next week as troughing along the West Coast slowly drifts
offshore. This will allow another stretch of warm/hot weather and
records highs to expand over the Pacific Northwest southward to
the Desert Southwest by late in the week. In turn, this will
promote downstream troughing over the Great
Lakes/Midwest/Northeast as another frontal boundary pushes through
the region with showers and storms.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the models and ensembles showed
reasonable clustering with the exiting eastern trough (containing
Claudette just offshore) and the next Pacific/Canadian trough
forecast to dig through southern central Canada late in the
period. Despite some detail differences in the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian
in timing and strength, a blended solution sufficed with a bit
more weighting to the ECMWF as it paired better with its ensemble
mean and to most extent the GEFS mean. This ECMWF-led solution
showed a bit more amplitude than continuity but was supported by
recent trends. Even in the ensemble mean solution, 500mb heights
are forecast to build to over +3 sigma in the PacNW by next
weekend, suggesting well above normal temperatures and likely ran
expanding area of record highs.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Recent record-breaking heat over the Southwest/California is
expected to ease by the start of the medium range (Tue). As the
upper low just off northern California weakens, strong ridging
from the Pacific and from Texas will build over the West, allowing
temperatures to climb to 15-25 degrees above normal in
Washington/Oregon late in the period, and more generally at least
5-10 degrees above normal along and west of the Rockies. Record
highs are likely for an expanding area late in the week as
temperatures near and over 100F will be possible in interior
sections of the West into eastern Washington. Rainfall will be
little to none throughout the region.

In the East, exiting trough with Claudette will sweep organized
rainfall into the Atlantic, ensuring a brief respite from the
active weather. Temperatures will be near to below normal east of
the Mississippi for 1-2 days before moderating. By later next
week, troughing out of Canada will carry another cold front
southeastward as a warm front lifts through and out of the
southern Plains, inviting moisture northward. Showers and storms
will likely increase in coverage and intensity later next week
along and ahead of the front and near areas of low pressure,
focused over the Upper Midwest/Corn Belt into the Ohio Valley.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat June 19 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...The threat of flash flooding and isolated tornadoes associated
with Tropical Storm Claudette will continue across portions of the
Southeast tonight and into the Carolinas on Sunday...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across parts of
the Ohio Valley and Midwest through the end of the weekend...

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat continues across California
and the Southwest, while expanding into the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday...

The center of Tropical Storm Claudette is currently pushing
northeast into southwestern Alabama and is expected to become a
tropical depression by tonight. Much of the hazardous weather
associated with Claudette is occurring on the northern and eastern
peripheries of the storm. Additional rainfall totals of 3 to 6
inches with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches are expected
across eastern Alabama, northern Georgia, and the Florida
Panhandle. This amount of rain will likely lead to flash flooding
where continuous downpours occur. WPC has issued a Moderate Risk
(level 3/4) of Excessive Rainfall throughout portions of the
Southeast and into the Southern Appalachians. Storm total rainfall
amounts could reach as high as 15 inches in southeast Louisiana,
southern Mississippi, southern Alabama, and the western Florida
Panhandle. Additionally, thunderstorms capable of producing brief
tornadoes will remain a concern into this evening for southeast
Alabama, southwest Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. By Sunday
the center of Claudette is expected to cross through central
Georgia and into the eastern Carolinas on Monday, producing a few
inches of additional rainfall here. Some restrengthening is
possible and Claudette could regain tropical storm strength on
Monday as it exits off the North Carolina coastline. Tropical
Storm Watches have been issued for coastal North Carolina.

Farther north, a quasi-stationary boundary and a strengthening low
pressure system exiting the northern High Plains will produce
additional rounds of showers and thunderstorms from the Northeast
to the central Plains this weekend. Severe thunderstorms are most
likely this evening between the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley, as
well as a large region from the central Plains to the Middle
Mississippi Valley. The biggest threat with these storms will be
associated with damaging wind gusts and large hail. Flash flooding
is also a concern in the Ohio and Middle Mississippi valleys,
where heavy rain already occurred earlier this morning. On Sunday,
the advancing low pressure system is forecast to reach the Upper
Midwest. A warm front is then expected to lift north into the
Great Lakes and produce ripe conditions for severe weather over
the Midwest and Lower Michigan. The Storm Prediction Center has
issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of severe thunderstorms on
Sunday that stretches from southeast Iowa to northern Indiana and
southwest Lower Michigan. Damaging wind gusts are the greatest
concern here, but large hail and isolated tornadoes are also
possible. A trailing and rather potent cold front is expected to
swing into the southern Plains and eastern U.S. by Monday, which
will shift severe weather and thunderstorm chances eastward.

The western U.S. is also dealing with potentially dangerous
weather, but heat and fire weather remains the culprit. A
long-duration heat wave has gripped the southwest corner of the
country and is expected to continue through this evening and
Sunday. Above average temperatures are forecast throughout
California, the Intermountain West, and Southwest through the rest
of today before expanding into the Pacific Northwest on Sunday and
Monday. A few daily record high temperatures could fall throughout
these regions this weekend, with cooler temperatures projected to
return to the Southwest on Monday. Excessive Heat Warnings and
Heat Advisories remain in effect throughout much of the Southwest,
California, and the central Great Basin. The combination of record
heat and exceptional drought is also leading fire weather concerns
throughout the  northern High Plains and central/southern Rockies.
Red Flag Warnings are in effect across parts of eastern Montana,
Wyoming, southeast Idaho, Utah, and western Colorado.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Sat Jun 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

Minor changes to the elevated area in Wyoming based on expected
back-door cold front position. A few areas of terrain-driven
critical conditions are possible in eastern Utah, but conditions
will be limited in space and duration. Though mid-level dry air will
be moving into the Southwest, lingering moisture may be enough for
very isolated dry thunderstorms in eastern Arizona into
north-central New Mexico. With coverage likely under 10%, no
highlights will be added.

..Wendt.. 06/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Sat Jun 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging across the Southwest will yield under the
influence of a deepening trough over the upper Midwest as northwest
flow aloft increases. At the surface, a cold front will shift east
out of the Rockies into the central Plains. Dry northwesterly flow
will support elevated fire weather conditions through much of the
southern Rockies and Southwest.

...Southwest and Southern Rockies...
As the trough across the northern US deepens Day2/Sunday, mid-level
ridging will weaken and shift to the south and west through the day.
Increasing northwesterly flow aloft will overspread much of the
Great Basin and southern Rockies supporting gusty surface winds of
15-20 mph. Surface conditions will remain warm and dry, with daytime
highs in the 80s and 90s F and widespread RH below 20%. Receptive
fuels and recent lightning activity suggest elevated fire weather
conditions will be likely. The lack of stronger forcing aloft should
limit greater surface winds to local enhancement from terrain.
Widespread critical fire weather conditions appear unlikely, though
small pockets will likely exist where local fuel and meteorological
conditions overlap.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CDT Sun Jun 20 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing will gradually deepen across the north-central
CONUS today, while high pressure remains entrenched across the
Southwest. Mid-level ridging will gradually build later this
afternoon, keeping warm and dry conditions across the Southwest. At
the surface, a cold front will move south across the Rockies and
back up to the Front Range this evening. Ahead of the front, warm
and dry conditions will support elevated fire weather potential
through the Southwest and portions of the Rockies.

...Southwest and southern Rockies...
As the mid-level trough across the northern US continues to dig
southeastward, northwest flow will overspread much of the Great
Basin and Southwest this afternoon. Gusty surface winds around 15-20
mph will coexist with warm temperatures and low humidity below 20%.
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions appear possible
from southwest Wyoming to southern Arizona. Fire weather conditions
will begin to diminish this evening as a cold front moves south
bringing cooler and less favorable conditions.

Across southwestern New Mexico and eastern Arizona, isolated
thunderstorms are again forecast to develop during the afternoon
hours. Warm surface temperatures above 90 F will favor high-based
storms with little precipitation potential. A few dry lightning
strikes will be possible with any storms that develop along the
higher terrain through the afternoon. The resurgence of the ridge
should limit storm coverage with only a few dry strikes expected.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Sun Jun 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
A deepening trough across the northern third of the US will keep
cooler and wetter conditions across the center of the country
through Monday. High pressure over the Southwest will gradually
weaken as a mid-level low moves onshore across California. Elevated
fire weather conditions may develop across portions of the
Southwest, while thunderstorms are expected across the West Coast.

...Southern Great Basin...
On the periphery of the suppressed ridge across the Southwest,
stronger mid-level flow will begin to overspread the southern Great
Basin ahead of a Pacific trough Day2/Monday. Sheltered from the
cooler airmass associated with the stalled front through the
Rockies, warm and dry conditions are expected with surface RH of
10-15%. The favorable overlap of dry surface conditions and gusty
winds will support elevated to near critical fire weather potential
through the day. A corridor of critical fire weather conditions may
develop across southern Nevada and Utah Monday afternoon, where
stronger mid-level flow may enhance westerly surface winds to 20-30
mph. However, model differences highlight some uncertainty with the
eastward extent of the stronger mid-level flow, suggesting low
predictability for widespread/concentrated critical conditions.

..Northern California and southern Oregon...
A few thunderstorms may develop Monday as moist onshore flow ahead
of the Pacific trough overspreads the West Coast. Model soundings
show sufficient instability for isolated lightning strikes from late
afternoon through the evening. Fuels are receptive to starts, but
increasing moisture with PWATS near 1 inch suggest storms may
produce enough precipitation to limit significant potential for dry
strikes.

...Heat intensifies late week over the interior Northwest/West
toward record levels...
...Mid-late week heat for portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

Ample upper ridging is again forecast to build/strengthen into
parts of the West next week as troughing along the West Coast
slowly drifts offshore. This will allow another stretch of
warm/hot weather and records highs to expand over the Pacific
Northwest southward to the Desert Southwest by late in the week.
In turn, this will promote downstream troughing over the Great
Lakes/Midwest as another frontal boundary pushes through the
region with showers and storms.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

A composite blend of best clustered model solutions of the 18 UTC
GFS/GEFS mean and the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean along with
the 01 UTC National Blend of Models seem to offer a good basis for
the day 3-5 (Wednesday-Friday) forecast period in a pattern with
above average continuity and predictability. The WPC product suite
was then primarily derived from still compatible GEFS/ECENS means
and the NBM next weekend in a period with slowly growing forecast
spread and uncertainty. Developing differences into next weekend
included details with the hot ridging over the West, but
especially with the amplitude and longitudinal focus of downstream
upper trough amplification over the east-central U.S.. The 00 UTC
GFS/ECMWF/Canadian solutions have converged upon a more
common/amplified trough solution favorably aligned with the
aforementioned ensemble means, bolstering forecast confidence at
these longer time frames.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

As an upper low just off northern California slowly weakens/lifts
northward, strong ridging will build over the West, allowing
temperatures to climb to 15-25+ degrees above normal in
Washington/Oregon next weekend, and more generally 5-15 degrees
above normal along and west of the Rockies. Record highs are
likely for an expanding area late in the week as temperatures near
and over 100F will focus in interior sections of the West.
Rainfall will be little to none throughout the region.

In the East,  By later week, an increasingly robust/amplified
upper trough digging from south-central Canada will carry a wavy
and fortified cold front southeastward into the east-central U.S.
as a warm front lifts through and out of the southern Plains,
inviting moisture return northward. Showers and storms will
significantly increase in coverage and intensity later week along
and ahead of the front and near areas of low pressure, focused
over the Upper Midwest/Corn Belt into the Ohio Valley/Appalachians.

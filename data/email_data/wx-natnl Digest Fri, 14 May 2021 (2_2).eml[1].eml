...Heavy rain Threat for the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley next week...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of reasonably well clustered larger scale guidance
of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS, 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean/Canadian
along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Smaller scale
system differences and convective rainfall focus details are much
less certain. System differences increase more significantly
mid-later next week, especially with the GFS digging much less
upper troughing down over the West than the ECMWF/Canadian. Leaned
toward the more run to run consistent GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means
that similarly develop a moderately deep upper trough over the
West at these long time frames. Latest 00 UTC models and ensembles
tend to maintain these aforementioned guidance differences.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A favored model and ensemble composite solution indicates that
deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return into an
emerging and slow moving south-central U.S. frontal system next
week. This will occur in downstream response to the slow ejection
and passage of a southern stream upper-level trough/low energies
forecast to exit the southern Rockies. Expect a multi-day period
with a threat of significant rainfall along with periods of
increased instability and strong to severe convection. Locations
and magnitude of heaviest rainfall will likely vary on a
day-to-day basis and some specifics may take until well into the
short range to be resolved, but the guidance signal for a wet
pattern over the south-central U.S. has been consistent.
Meanwhile, the Midwest eastward into the Mid-Atlantic may see one
or more convective systems aided by a wavy front and uncertain
northern shortwave energy aloft to focus moisture and instability.
Well south, late period moisture/vorticity influx underneath a
building Southeast upper ridge may support some organized heavy
downpours over southern Florida.

The favored GEFS/ECMWF ensemble mean solution over the West
mid-later next week would support mainly moderate precipitation
from the Pacific Northwest out across the north-central
Intermountain West/Rockies to include some mountain snows. Ahead
of the Pacific front that moves into the West next week, lead
maximum temperatures 10-20F above normal will also progress from
the Northwest U.S. eastward though the northern Rockies/Plains. A
cooling trend behind the front may bring 5-10F below normal
temperatures.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central/Southern High Plains Friday and Saturday...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Great Basin/Southwest Friday and Saturday...

A quasi-stationary front extends from Middle Mississippi Valley
westward to the Southern High Plains, then into the Great Basin
through Sunday morning. Moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico
will stream northward over the Plains and the Mississippi Valley
through Sunday.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop over parts
of the Central/Southern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley
through Sunday, too.  The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Central/Southern High Plains on
Friday.  The main threats from the severe thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few
tornadoes.  Additionally, there is a 10% or greater probability of
wind gust 65 knots or greater and two-inch or greater hail over
the Central High Plains.  Furthermore, there is a 10% or greater
probability of two-inch or greater hail over the Central High
Plains.  The showers and thunderstorms will redevelop over the
Central/Southern Plains on Saturday, with the severe thunderstorm
threat over the same area.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy over the Upper Midwest will produce
rain over the area through Saturday night.  On Saturday, rain will
develop over parts of the Great Lakes and the Northeast,
continuing into Sunday.  Scattered thunderstorms will also develop
over parts of the Rockies and the Great Basin through Sunday.  An
upper-level low will develop over parts of California overnight
Friday into Sunday.  The energy will produce scattered rain over
parts of California, with a few embedded thunderstorms over
Northern California.  Additionally, as the upper-level low
develops, dry conditions and gusty winds have led to an Elevated
Risk of fire weather over parts of the Great Basin/Southwest
through Sunday morning.

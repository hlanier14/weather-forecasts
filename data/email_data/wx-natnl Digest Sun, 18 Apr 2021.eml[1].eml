...Heavy Rainfall for parts of Florida Tuesday...

17Z Update:  Similar to the overnight forecast, the WPC medium
range forecast was favored more in line with the ECMWF/CMC/EC mean
given better clustering among these models for most of the
forecast period.  The exception is that the 00Z CMC is out of
phase near the Hudson Bay region with a secondary closed low
aloft.  Regarding the GFS/GEFS mean, they are quicker to eject the
southwestern U.S. shortwave across the Plains by the end of next
week, and also displaced well to the east with the eastern Pacific
upper ridge axis as part of this quicker progression.  The 00Z
UKMET was an outlier solution over California with a much stronger
upper low dropping southward compared to all of the other ensemble
members, so this solution was ruled out for this forecast cycle.
The WPC forecast included more of the EC mean by Friday and
Saturday, and also incorporated some of the previous WPC forecast
with fronts/pressures to maintain good overall continuity.  The
previous discussion follows below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Strong upper ridging is forecast to drift west-northwestward out
of northwestern Canada and through Alaska as an upper low in the
northeastern Pacific wobbles its way toward the Pacific Northwest.
This favors troughing over most of the CONUS next week and cooler
than normal temperatures to all but the West. A wavy frontal
boundary will bring a chance of heavy rain over Florida from the
short range into the medium range early in the week before
dissipating. A lead boundary over the Plains to Midwest on Tuesday
will bring light rain and snow into the Great Lakes as it winds up
over southeastern Canada. A western system may tap the Gulf for
moisture later next week and bring widespread rainfall to the
lower Mississippi Valley by next weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The GFS/GEFS have struggled over the past week or so with the
amplified/cutoff flow from the Pacific across North America,
though over many areas they seemed fairly adequate. However,
overall preferred the ECMWF-led consensus with the 12Z Canadian
and the ECMWF ensembles which were generally more amplified than
the GFS/GEFS. There was a notable trend toward a slower
progression across Canada and the Northeast next Thursday with a
farther west upper low near the Canadian archipelago, allowing the
Northeast system to close off and wrap up over Maine. With the
upstream upper low still forecast to drop down into southern
Canada Friday, this should be enough of a kicker overall to nudge
the Maine system farther to the northeast. By later in the week,
the GFS may be too slow over Texas/Mexico with an upper/sfc system
(related to a slower progression of the incoming Pacific system
toward WA/OR) but the breakdown/relaxation of the amplified
pattern suggests low confidence in evolution. Opted to remain
closer to the ECMWF ensemble mean which typically handles
amplified flow the best, but even it can be too slow once the
pattern opens up (which can favor the GFS/GEFS).

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Northern and central Florida may see a continuation out of the
short range (Mon) into the medium range (Tue) with rainfall along
a front that will slowly push southward. Several inches are
possible in some areas during the period. Generally light
precipitation is expected near a frontal system moving into the
Great Lakes and Northeast Tue-Wed with some snow on its northwest
side. As the system deepens through the Northeast, rain/snow could
increase over New England where temperatures may be cold enough
for snow especially at higher elevations and overnight. The next
system of interest would be out of the southern Rockies around Fri
and through the Plains. A modest signal exists for at least some
heavy rainfall over the lower Mississippi Valley next Fri-Sat.

Warmer than normal temperatures are expected for the West Coast
closer to or underneath upper ridging, with much milder air just
ahead of the Pacific system late next week. The central states
will see the coldest readings relative to normal for late April,
perhaps 10-25 degrees below normal on Tuesday east of the Rockies
behind the frontal boundary. That cold air mass will push eastward
but moderate though parts of the East may see at least one day
with temperatures 5-15 degrees below normal (Thu along the I-81
corridor).

Surface high pressure over the central Rockies will limit overall
fire weather concerns today. Dry conditions will be present from the
Pacific Northwest across the Great Basin and into Arizona. However,
winds will be light across much of this region. Some locally
elevated winds may be present across portions of Nevada and southern
Arizona, but the longevity and isolated nature of the threat will
preclude any need for an elevated delineation.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat April 17 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...Several rounds of showers and thunderstorms likely across
northern/central Florida through Monday...

...Strong cold front to bring another spring snow event to the
Northern Rockies and northern High Plains beginning Sunday
afternoon...

The active weather currently found across the central Gulf Coast
is forecast to slowly move eastward and into the Sunshine State
this evening and linger through Monday. A slow moving cold front
will be responsible for multiple rounds of showers and
thunderstorms. A few storms could turn severe from the central
Gulf Coast to northern Florida, with much of the activity shifting
into Florida by tomorrow. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Marginal Risk for severe thunderstorms through Monday morning for
the region. Additionally, flash flooding will be a concern due to
upwards of 5 inches of rain forecast to fall across
northern/central Florida. A Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall
has been issued to highlight the potential hazard.

Meanwhile, light snow found throughout the Southern Rockies will
come to an end early Sunday morning as a more significant system
drops into the Northern Rockies from Canada. A strong cold front
will enter the Northern High Plains by Sunday afternoon and
quickly sink southward before reaching the Central Rockies and
Central Plains by Monday evening. In its wake, below average
temperatures and wintry precipiation will be found across the
region. The highest snowfall amounts are forecast to occur along
the Bighorn Mountains of north-central Wyoming, where over a foot
of snow is possible. Other mountain peaks from northwest Montana
to Wyoming, as well as the Black Hills of Wyoming and South
Dakota, could see snowfall accumulations over 6 inches. Winter
Storm Watches and Winter Weather Advisories have been issued.
Light snow could extend as far east as northwest Iowa by late
Monday evening as cold temperatures enter the Upper Midwest.

Speaking of temperatures, much of the lower 48 will experience
below average temperatures over the next few days. The only
exceptions will be found across southern Florida and the Western
U.S., where above normal temperatures remain locked in place. A
few new daily high temperature records are not out of the question
for these areas on Sunday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Sat Apr 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

Minor adjustments based on recent guidance. The cold front within
the northern Plains into the Upper Midwest will bring some potential
for elevated fire weather, particularly ahead of the front. The
greatest area of risk appears to be from South Dakota into
central/southern Minnesota. However, the strength and speed of the
front is such that these conditions are not likely to last more than
an hour or two in most areas. Behind the front, strong cold air
advection and cloud cover should decrease the fire weather threat
quickly. Given the drought-impacted fuels in North Dakota, fire
behavior could be more intense even in higher RH/lower temperatures,
should an ignition occur.

..Wendt.. 04/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1204 AM CDT Sat Apr 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Sunday, a weak mid level shortwave trough will drop out of
British Columbia and lead to some surface cyclogenesis in the
Columbia Basin. This will bring a return to onshore flow across the
Pacific Northwest. Some breezy conditions are expected through the
gaps in the Cascades as well as across portions of eastern Oregon.
Multiple smoke plumes from fires across this region on Friday show
that at least some fuels are cured and are ready for fire spread.
Therefore, an elevated delineation is warranted for the threat.

Offshore flow is expected across portions of Southern California
starting Sunday morning. The strongest winds are expected to be in
the Mojave desert where fuels are minimal, but high resolution
guidance suggests some stronger winds reaching the coastal
mountains. Therefore, these stronger winds in addition to widespread
single digit relative humidity forecast across the region support an
elevated threat for large-fire spread.

A strong cold front is expected to dive south across the northern
Plains on Sunday. 20+ mph sustained winds are expected behind this
front, but rapidly dropping temperatures and the potential for some
rain/snow should limit the overall fire weather threat. Drought
conditions are ongoing in the northern Plains and some fire weather
threat may exist in any areas which do not receive any precipitation
despite relative humidity above 50 percent given the strong winds
and dry fuels. This will be monitored closely in later outlooks to
assess the need for an elevated delineation.

...Record cold likely for parts of the central U.S. Wednesday and
Thursday morning...

...Overview...

Strong upper ridging is forecast to drift west-northwestward out
of northwestern Canada and through Alaska as an upper low in the
northeastern Pacific wobbles its way toward the Pacific Northwest
next weekend. This favors troughing over most of the CONUS next
week and generally cooler than normal temperatures to all but the
West. A system moving into the Northeast on Wednesday will bring
light rain and snow into the eastern Great Lakes region into the
Northeast/New England as it winds up over southeastern Canada.
Another system exiting the Southwest by Friday may tap the Gulf
for moisture and bring widespread rainfall to the lower
Mississippi Valley into the Southeast (perhaps locally heavy) next
Fri-Sun.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The amplified/closed pattern so typical of April continues to
challenge the guidance. Ensembles generally agree on the evolution
but the ECMWF ensembles continued to be favored due to ongoing
better performance over the past week or so (from the Pacific
across North America). However, the Canadian ensembles, typically
more amplified like the ECMWF ensembles, were notably closer to
the GEFS ensembles. Thus, incorporated a minority weighting of the
GFS/Canadian to start the forecast but a majority of the ECMWF. By
next Fri-Sun, ECMWF became rather suspect out of the Pacific (much
quicker than its ensemble mean) but was still a plausible
solution, as was its depiction of an East Coast system. Favored
the ECMWF and GEFS mean by next weekend amid lowering certainty.
It is a pattern more reminiscent of winter than spring over the
CONUS. Way farther upstream, Super Typhoon Surigae will recurve
east of the Philippines and lift into the westerlies, but may
enter on the back side of a trough off Japan late in the week with
little direct influence on the CONUS at that point.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Generally light precipitation is expected along a frontal system
and on the north/northwest side of the surface low as it moves
into the Northeast Wednesday. As the system deepens through the
Northeast, rain/snow could increase over New England where
temperatures may be cold enough for snow especially at higher
elevations and overnight. The next system of interest would be out
of the southern Rockies around Fri and through the Plains.
Rainfall should expand over Texas and points eastward with at
least some heavy rainfall quite probable over the lower
Mississippi Valley next Fri-Sat and into the Southeast by Sunday.

Warmer than normal temperatures are expected for the West Coast
closer to or underneath upper ridging, with much milder air just
ahead of the Pacific system late in the period. The region between
the Rockies and Appalachians will see the coldest readings
relative to normal for late April on Wednesday, perhaps 10-25
degrees below normal. This will lead to record cold low
temperatures from Texas northward toward the Corn Belt. That cold
air mass will push eastward but moderate Thu-Fri into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic. Another cooler shot of air may arrive from
Canada through the northern Plains/Upper Midwest Fri-Sat.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CDT Sun Apr 18 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
...Southern California...
High pressure centered over the Intermountain West is strengthening
tonight as the desert cools. This will lead to a tightening LAX/TPH
gradient to around -10 mb by morning. Winds of 20 to 30 mph with
gusts 35 to 50 mph are expected with relative humidity of 15 to 20
percent in the morning dropping to 10 to 15 percent by afternoon. A
disconnect between the strongest winds (morning), and lowest RH
(afternoon) combined with only marginally dry fuels, precludes the
need for a critical delineation. Winds should gradually weaken
through the afternoon as the gradient weakens.

...Pacific Northwest...
Cyclogenesis is expected in the Columbia Basin during the day Sunday
as a mid level shortwave trough digs south out of British Columbia.
Winds of 15 to 25 mph are expected as the gradient strengthens with
relative humidity around 20 percent. Lack of appreciable rainfall
for the past 2-3 weeks has started to stress fuels with several
fires observed in the last few days.

...Northern Plains...
A strong cold front will move southward through the northern Plains
through the day today. Some elevated to critical conditions are
expected immediately following the frontal passage, but rapidly
falling temperatures and the potential for snow/rain behind the
front will limit the overall threat. Some increase in initial attack
is possible given the dry fuels and strong winds expected.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CDT Sun Apr 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted upper-level trough will move southeastward
through the Northwest and into the Great Basin during the day on
Monday. At the surface, low pressure will develop in the southern
Great Basin and Southwest. The surface pressure gradient will
tighten in response to the cyclogenesis and winds are expected to
increase above 20 mph in a broad region from Nevada into Northern
New Mexico. These stronger winds will also be aided by a strong
mid-level jet and deep mixing bringing some of these winds to the
surface. Much of this area will be dry and thus elevated
meteorological conditions will be present. However, some portions of
this area have fuels which are not cured and thus the elevated
delineation was drawn where the most burnable fuel exists within the
broader region of elevated threat.

...Snow is expected to overspread the northern and central Rockies
as well as the High Plains behind a strong cold front during the
next couple of days...

...Heavy showers and thunderstorms continue across
northern/central Florida...

As the remaining light snow slowly tapers off over the southern
Rockies, a surge of cold air from Canada is entering Montana early
this morning.  The cold surge will bring rapidly falling
temperatures as well as a quick burst of snow down across the
northern Rockies to the High Plains today and into Monday,
followed by the central Rockies and central High Plains by Monday
evening.  The highest snowfall amounts are forecast to occur along
the Bighorn Mountains of north-central Wyoming, where over a foot
of snow is possible.  Other mountain peaks from northwest Montana
to Wyoming, as well as the Black Hills of Wyoming and South
Dakota, could see snowfall accumulations over 6 inches.  Winter
Storm Watches and Winter Weather Advisories have been issued.
Light snow could extend as far east as the Upper Midwest as a low
pressure wave develops along the front and moves across the
region.

Meanwhile, active weather is expected to linger across northern to
central Florida where a front will become nearly stationary.
Occasional showers heavy at times together with embedded
thunderstorms can be expected to continue through Monday.  A few
storms could turn severe.  In addition, flash flooding will be a
concern due to upwards of 5 inches of rain forecast to fall across
northern/central Florida during the next few days.  A Marginal
Risk of Excessive Rainfall has been issued to highlight the
potential hazard.

Much of the lower 48 will experience below average temperatures
over the next few days.  The only exceptions will be found across
southern Florida, New England, and along the West Coast where
above normal temperatures remain locked in place.  Finally,
residents in parts of the interior western U.S. as well as
southern California should beware of an elevated risk of wildfire
during the next couple of days.

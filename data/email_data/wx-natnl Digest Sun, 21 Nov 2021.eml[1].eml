0954 AM CST Sat Nov 20 2021

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions
made. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 11/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0113 AM CST Sat Nov 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
Persistent zonal midlevel flow across the southern Rockies into the
southern High Plains will continue today. A weak surface low will
move southeastward over northwest TX as a cold front moves down the
High Plains. Farther west, a surface ridge will gradually build over
the Great Basin, resulting in the development of offshore flow
across southern CA.

...East-central NM into the TX South Plains...

West of the surface low and south of the cold front, dry and breezy
conditions will develop. Downslope flow combined with diurnal
heating and mixing will result in minimum RH around 15% with winds
of 15 to 20 mph. These conditions will support an elevated
fire-weather threat during the afternoon.

...Southern CA...

Offshore winds of greater than 20 mph will begin late in the period
across terrain-favored areas, with a gradual decrease in RH values
overnight. There is some uncertainty in the magnitude of RH
reduction prior to the end of the period, though elevated conditions
appear possible by early Sunday morning with a greater threat
expected later in the day on Sunday.

Valid 12Z Tue Nov 23 2021 - 12Z Sat Nov 27 2021

...Potential heavy rainfall for portions of the Southern Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley may impact travel for the
Thanksgiving holiday...

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Tuesday rather amplified in the
upper levels, with a trough axis near the West Coast, a deep
trough in the East, and ridging in between. The eastern trough is
forecast to develop a closed upper low around Wednesday and spin
over the Atlantic along with its associated surface low, likely
far enough east not to impact the Northeast U.S. significantly
from midweek onward. The trough in the West will move eastward as
the week progresses, and it is becoming more likely it will split
into two separate streams, with southern energy digging into
Mexico and northern stream energy sliding across the Northern
Plains and Great Lakes. The latter may eventually combine with a
shortwave in central Canada to form a closed low over eastern
Canada next weekend. The southern stream energy and moisture
flowing into a frontal system could produce locally heavy rain
across the south-central U.S. on Wednesday into Thanksgiving Day.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

00Z/06Z model agreement was fairly good with the departing trough
across the East, with some lingering questions regarding timing
when the closed mid-upper low develops and placement of surface
lows. The bulk of model guidance agrees that these features will
mainly cause marine and southeast Canada threats, with the system
far enough from the Northeast U.S. during the medium range period
not to cause significant impacts.

In the West, guidance continues to show plenty of run to run
variability regarding placement and strength of shortwaves moving
through the mean trough, which leads to differences in timing and
progression of the separation into northern and southern streams
during the latter half of the week. The 00Z/06Z model cycle
generally flipped back to a solution with more separation of
streams, with many deterministic models (though not the 00Z GFS)
and even the 06Z GEFS mean and 00Z EC mean at times indicating a
southern stream closed low over northern Mexico that lingers there
Friday and Saturday. The 00Z deterministic ECMWF showed this 500
mb closed low farthest west, along with a good portion of the EC
ensemble members, pushing the 00Z EC ensemble mean trough/low
farther west compared to CMC and GEFS ensemble solutions that are
not as slow to move the southern stream trough/low. The stream
separation does cause sensible weather differences as well--the
cold front ahead of the northern stream trough could move faster
with more separation, and QPF in these solutions is lower over the
south-central U.S., possibly because the pattern holds back more
Pacific moisture. The updated WPC forecast did follow the trend
toward a closed low and attempted to take a middle ground solution
in placement between the slower EC suite and the faster guidance.
Given the variability between models and from run to run, there is
still considerable uncertainty with this evolution. Currently
incoming 12Z guidance remains split, with the ECMWF and GFS still
showing considerable stream separation (with the new 12Z EC a bit
faster than the 00Z run and the 12Z GFS aligned with its 06Z run),
while the CMC shows a more phased solution.

Overall the WPC fronts/pressures began with a blend of the
deterministic guidance early in the period, lessening the
proportion of the slow 00Z ECMWF as the period progressed,
splitting the difference with the faster 00Z and slower 06Z GFS,
while increasing the proportion of the 06Z GEFS and 00Z EC
ensemble means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The cold front associated with the Northeast low pressure should
be well off the Atlantic coast by Tuesday with sprawling high
pressure in its wake across much of the eastern third of the
nation. As a result, daytime highs and morning lows Tuesday and
Wednesday could be 10-20 degrees below normal from portions of the
Tennessee/Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast.
Near to below freezing morning lows could extend rather far into
parts of the South, resulting in the potential for the first frost
or freeze for some locations, most certainly impacting sensitive
vegetation. Low pressure lingering off the Northeast Coast may
bring periods of breezy/gusty winds to parts of New England and
combined with already chilly temperatures could make for some
unpleasant wind chills during at least the beginning of next week.

Some light to perhaps locally moderate precipitation is expected
to spread across the Rockies around Tuesday-Wednesday as a cold
front moves across. Then by midweek, the cold front should reach
far enough into the Plains to begin interacting with Gulf moisture
to produce an expanding area of moderate to possibly heavy
rainfall from eastern Texas into parts of the Lower Mississippi
Valley for Wednesday and especially into Thanksgiving Day, with
amounts currently expected to lessen by Friday as the front moves
offshore. Though this update lowered forecast rainfall amounts per
the latest model consensus, stay tuned for forecast updates as
totals could increase again, and the rain could have impacts for a
couple of the busiest travel days of the year. Additional
shortwave energy into the Pacific Northwest may also bring another
round of moderate to locally heavy coastal rain and mountain snows
on Thursday and Friday, which could impact travel as well.

Above normal temperatures ahead of the western front will across
the Plains Tuesday-Wednesday with anomalies +10 to +20F possible.
Much of the country looks to be generally near normal on
Thanksgiving, before modestly above normal temperatures may begin
to spread across the West and High Plains by later in the week.

...Potential heavy rainfall for portions of the Southern Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley may impact travel for the
Thanksgiving holiday...

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Tuesday rather amplified in the
upper levels, with a trough axis near the West Coast, a deep
trough in the East, and ridging in between. The eastern trough is
forecast to develop a closed upper low around Wednesday and spin
over the Atlantic along with its associated surface low, likely
far enough east not to impact the Northeast U.S. significantly
from midweek onward. The trough in the West will move eastward as
the week progresses, and it is becoming more likely it will split
into two separate streams, with southern energy digging into
Mexico and northern stream energy sliding across the Northern
Plains and Great Lakes. The latter may eventually combine with a
shortwave in central Canada to form a closed low over eastern
Canada next weekend. The southern stream energy and moisture
flowing into a frontal system could produce locally heavy rain
across the south-central U.S. on Wednesday into Thanksgiving Day.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

00Z/06Z model agreement was fairly good with the departing trough
across the East, with some lingering questions regarding timing
when the closed mid-upper low develops and placement of surface
lows. The bulk of model guidance agrees that these features will
mainly cause marine and southeast Canada threats, with the system
far enough from the Northeast U.S. during the medium range period
not to cause significant impacts.

In the West, guidance continues to show plenty of run to run
variability regarding placement and strength of shortwaves moving
through the mean trough, which leads to differences in timing and
progression of the separation into northern and southern streams
during the latter half of the week. The 00Z/06Z model cycle
generally flipped back to a solution with more separation of
streams, with many deterministic models (though not the 00Z GFS)
and even the 06Z GEFS mean and 00Z EC mean at times indicating a
southern stream closed low over northern Mexico that lingers there
Friday and Saturday. The 00Z deterministic ECMWF showed this 500
mb closed low farthest west, along with a good portion of the EC
ensemble members, pushing the 00Z EC ensemble mean trough/low
farther west compared to CMC and GEFS ensemble solutions that are
not as slow to move the southern stream trough/low. The stream
separation does cause sensible weather differences as well--the
cold front ahead of the northern stream trough could move faster
with more separation, and QPF in these solutions is lower over the
south-central U.S., possibly because the pattern holds back more
Pacific moisture. The updated WPC forecast did follow the trend
toward a closed low and attempted to take a middle ground solution
in placement between the slower EC suite and the faster guidance.
Given the variability between models and from run to run, there is
still considerable uncertainty with this evolution. Currently
incoming 12Z guidance remains split, with the ECMWF and GFS still
showing considerable stream separation (with the new 12Z EC a bit
faster than the 00Z run and the 12Z GFS aligned with its 06Z run),
while the CMC shows a more phased solution.

Overall the WPC fronts/pressures began with a blend of the
deterministic guidance early in the period, lessening the
proportion of the slow 00Z ECMWF as the period progressed,
splitting the difference with the faster 00Z and slower 06Z GFS,
while increasing the proportion of the 06Z GEFS and 00Z EC
ensemble means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The cold front associated with the Northeast low pressure should
be well off the Atlantic coast by Tuesday with sprawling high
pressure in its wake across much of the eastern third of the
nation. As a result, daytime highs and morning lows Tuesday and
Wednesday could be 10-20 degrees below normal from portions of the
Tennessee/Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast.
Near to below freezing morning lows could extend rather far into

0102 PM CST Sat Nov 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes made to the
ongoing fire weather highlights. The latest high-resolution model
guidance continues to show widespread 20-40 mph offshore surface
winds peaking around 18Z, with the stronger sustained winds and
associated gusts more likely across terrain-favoring areas. While
surface winds will gradually weaken from mid-afternoon into the
evening hours, RH is expected to drop to 10% in some locales. As
such, multiple hours of overlapping Critical surface winds/RH remain
likely through much of the day tomorrow, possibly to 12Z Monday
given poor RH recovery.

..Squitieri.. 11/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0113 AM CST Sat Nov 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A surface ridge will persist over the Great Basin, supporting
moderate to locally strong offshore flow over southern CA. Farther
east, a cold front will move southward across the southern High
Plains, with relatively cool, dry and breezy conditions possible in
its wake.

...Southern CA...

As offshore winds strengthen through the first part of the day on
Sunday, downslope flow and diurnal heating will result in the
development of critical RH across parts of southern CA. Winds of 20
to 30 mph with higher gusts will be possible, especially across
terrain-favored areas and possibly to the coast across parts of
Ventura County. Critical conditions may persist into the overnight
hours owing to poor RH recoveries and the continuation of sufficient
offshore flow.

...Heavy rain and isolated instances of flash flooding possible
across portions of eastern Florida through Sunday...

...Elevated to critical fire weather located across Southern
California this weekend...

...Widespread shower activity to be found across the eastern third
of the country on Sunday and Monday thanks to a sweeping cold
front, with lake effect snow possible in its wake...

A fairly tranquil weather pattern is in place across the Nation
this weekend, with hazardous weather confined to localized
regions. A gradually weakening stationary front currently located
across southern Florida will continue to be the focus for isolated
downpours, particularly throughout eastern portions of the
Sunshine State. A few thunderstorms could linger long enough to
create isolated flooding concerns. Rough surf along the Atlantic
Coast of Florida may also lead to numerous rip currents.

Meanwhile, along the West Coast, elevated to critical fire weather
is in place for Southern California this weekend as gusty offshore
winds strengthen on Sunday and interact with low relative
humidity. This Santa Ana wind event has also prompted Red Flag
Warnings to be issued throughout the region.

For the eastern half of the Nation, the biggest weather-maker will
be associated with a sweeping cold front and strengthening low
pressure system over southeast Canada. This cold front will help
fuel widespread shower activity on Sunday from southeast Texas to
the Lower Great Lakes, with much of the precipitation spreading
into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Monday. Behind the cold
front, lake effect snow is possible across the Upper Great Lakes
beginning Sunday evening and eventually the Lower Great Lakes by
Monday. Eastern sections of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan could
see snowfall accumulations over six inches, with much lighter
snowfall amounts elsewhere.

Temperature-wise, the aforementioned cold front will spread much
below average temperatures into the Midwest, Ohio and Tennessee
valleys by Monday. Simultaneously, a warm-up will commence by the
beginning of the weekend throughout the Plains, with highs
reaching into the 50s and 60s.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat November 20 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Potential heavy rainfall for portions of the Southern Plains,
Lower Mississippi Valley, and Pacific Northwest may impact travel
for the Thanksgiving holiday...

...Overview...

An amplified pattern should prevail through much of the medium
range period (Wed-Sun) beginning with a trough axis moving through
the interior West, a closed low off the Northeast Coast, and
ridging in between. The developing closed low off the Northeast
coast may linger for a few days but likely remaining far enough
east not to impact the Northeast U.S. significantly. Out west,
guidance continues to advertise the trough will likely split into
two separate streams, with southern energy digging into Mexico and
northern stream energy sliding across the Northern Plains and
Great Lakes. The latter may eventually combine with a shortwave in
central Canada to form a closed low over eastern Canada next
weekend. The southern stream energy and moisture flowing into a
frontal system could produce locally heavy rain across the
south-central U.S. during the late week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 12z/18z model runs from yesterday remain in fairly good
agreement with the lingering closed low off the Northeast Coast
Wed-Fri. Some lingering uncertainty regarding placement of the
upper low and surface low, but the bulk of the model guidance does
agree that regardless, these features will mainly be a marine and
southeast Canada threat.

In the West, the guidance agrees the main trough over the
Rockies/Southwest should split into two streams. The southern
stream energy continues to trend weaker in the models, but should
linger for at least a few days near Baja California. Questions
begin to arise by later in the period regarding timing of the
energy as it eventually slides eastward. The CMC is the quickest
to bring the energy into the Southern Plains next weekend while
the latest runs of the GFS/ECMWF hold it back through the weekend.
The ECMWF and GFS have more support from the ensemble means. The
northern stream energy shows better agreement and run to run
consistency. By next weekend though, the CMC is faster to lift a
newly formed closed low into eastern Canada, likely a result of
stronger shortwave energy dropping in behind it from western
Canada. Again, the ensemble means are closer to the GFS and ECMWF
solutions, both of which are is good agreement with each other.

Finally, the next shortwave should begin impacting the West by
Saturday-Sunday. The CMC is much slower with the shortwave as it
drops southward from Alaska late this week and quickly becomes out
of phase with the GFS, ECMWF, and the ensemble means showing
strong ridging over the West Coast on day 7 rather than troughing
like the better consensus would suggest.

Overall, the deterministic solutions showed good enough agreement
for a general model blend days 3-4. After this, the ensemble means
were used in place of the CMC for the various issues listed above.
Was able to maintain a 60/40 blend of the GFS/ECMWF with the
ensemble means days 6 and 7 which should help give some added
definition to systems normally washed out by the means. This
approach maintains good continuity with the previous WPC forecast
as well for days 3-6.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The western U.S. cold front should reach the Plains by Wednesday
and begin interacting with Gulf moisture to produce an expanding
area of moderate to possibly heavy rainfall from eastern Texas
into parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday and
especially into Thanksgiving day. The best chance for heavy
rainfall may be Thursday along the western Gulf Coast where
instability should be greatest and at least a localized flood
threat may develop. Less intense and more scattered rain may
extend northward along the cold front into parts of the Ohio
Valley Wednesday-Thursday and eventually the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Friday.

Shortwave energy may help direct an elongated plume of moisture
into the Pacific Northwest to produced terrain enhanced moderate
to heavy rain and mountain snows across eastern ports of
Washington and Oregon on Thursday. Conditions remain unsettled
into the weekend out West, but precipitation should weaken in
intensity for a few days. The next system moving towards the
region Saturday into Sunday could bring another period of locally
heavy rains to the Pacific Northwest.

For temperatures across the CONUS, sprawling high pressure in the
East on Wednesday should continue well below normal daytime highs
and morning lows across especially the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic
where morning lows near or below freezing are likely. Temperatures
may briefly warm back towards normal on Thursday and Friday but
could trend chillier again next weekend as the next cold front
moves through. Out West, temperatures should trend warmer through
the period and eventually spill over into the Plains next weekend.
Daytime highs for the northern and central High Plains could be 10
to 20 degrees above normal by next Sunday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0132 AM CST Sun Nov 21 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will extend from the eastern Pacific into
portions of the Great Basin for most of today, as an upper-level
trough amplifies over the central and eastern CONUS. The surface
ridge over the Great Basin is expected to peak in intensity during
the day today, before gradually weakening later tonight into Monday
morning.

...Southern CA...
Critical fire-weather conditions are expected to develop across
parts of southern CA today, as offshore flow intensifies through the
first half of the day. Diurnal heating and downslope flow will
result in rapid drying, with RH values dropping below 15% across
much of the region by late morning/early afternoon. Meanwhile,
sustained winds of 20-30 mph (with higher gusts) will develop across
terrain-favored areas, and also potentially toward coastal regions
of Ventura County. While offshore flow is expected to peak this
afternoon, gusty winds are expected to continue into tonight, and
overnight RH recovery is expected to be very poor. As a result,
elevated to locally critical conditions will likely persist
overnight into Monday morning.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CST Sun Nov 21 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper ridge over the Great Basin is forecast to weaken and shift
eastward on Monday, as an upper trough moves into parts of the
Pacific Northwest. As a result, offshore flow will weaken across
parts of southern California. A surface low is forecast to deepen
across parts of Alberta, with a lee trough developing into portions
of the northern and central High Plains.

...Southern CA...
Despite weakening offshore flow, elevated to locally critical
conditions will likely be ongoing at the start of the period Monday
morning across terrain-favored areas of southern CA, due to poor
overnight RH recovery and lingering gusty winds. Winds are generally
expected to weaken through the day, though RH will remain critically
low (generally in the 7-15% range at peak heating). At this time,
confidence in a sufficient duration of critical conditions is too
low to include more than an Elevated delineation. Observations and
short-term guidance will continue to be evaluated, and an upgrade
for the first part of the period remains possible in the Day 2
update.

...Parts of MT/WY...
In response to the developing surface low across AB and lee trough
extending into the northern/central High Plains, relatively dry and
breezy conditions appear possible across two separate areas; one
across the plains of northern MT, and the other across southeast WY
and vicinity. In both areas, sustained winds of 20 mph or greater
(with higher gusts) appear possible in combination with minimum RH
values of 15-25%. These conditions will support an elevated to
locally critical fire-weather threat where receptive fuels are
available.

...Heavy rain and isolated instances of flash flooding possible
across portions of eastern Florida and South Texas today...

...Widespread showers to track across the eastern third of the
country today and early Monday due to a sweeping cold front,
colder temperatures return with lake effect snow possible in its
wake...

...Elevated to Critical fire weather conditions in Southern
California; warming temperatures in the Rockies and Plains early
week; wet weather return to the Pacific Northwest late Monday...

The weekend concludes on a wet and stormy note in the southern
most reaches of the Lower 48. Southeast Florida continues to
experience onshore flow that is responsible for training showers
and thunderstorms, prompting a Marginal Risk for Excessive
Rainfall on Sunday. In South Texas, an approaching cold front will
trigger showers and thunderstorms capable of producing Excessive
Rainfall rates atop overly saturated soils. Both areas should
trend drier by Monday as a pair of cold frontal passages usher in
drier and cooler conditions the first half of Thanksgiving week.

Speaking of "cold frontal passages", a pair of cold fronts will
sweep across the eastern third of the U.S. to kickoff Thanksgiving
week. Unsettled weather is anticipated ahead of the fronts with
much colder temperatures rushing in behind the fronts today and
Monday. The leading front is responsible for numerous showers from
the Northeast and Ohio Valley on south to the South-Central U.S.
today and into Sunday night. Meanwhile, a secondary cold front is
guiding a cold Canadian air-mass through the Upper Midwest on
Sunday and eventually into the Great Lakes Sunday night. Lake
effect snow bands are expected to breakout over the Upper Great
Lakes Sunday night into Monday morning. Snowfall accumulations
will be highest in the eastern half of the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan where snowfall in excess of 6" is likely, while several
inches are possible in northern Michigan and downwind of Lakes
Erie and Ontario. By Monday morning, the cold fronts race across
the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, forcing temperatures to fall and
drier conditions to return the second half of the day.
December-like temperatures look to engulf much of the East as high
pressure builds in Monday night into Tuesday morning.

Farther west, a ridge of high pressure leads to an expansive area
of dry conditions and warming temperatures from the Great Plains
to California. The strong high pressure over the Great Basin and
surface troughing off the California coast will lead to Santa Ana
winds in the higher elevations of Southern California and even to
the coastal areas. This has resulted in the issuance of Red Flag
Warnings and a Critical Risk for fire weather today. An Elevated
Risk for fire weather is forecast to persist in Southern
California on Monday. As upper level riding moves into the Rockies
and Great Plains on Monday, warmer temperatures will push into the
Heartland by Tuesday. Meanwhile, a storm system in the northeast
Pacific delivers another round of precipitation to the Pacific
Northwest late Monday into Tuesday. Coastal and valley locations
can expect periods of rain while mountain ranges such as the
Olympics and Cascades receive several inches of snowfall.

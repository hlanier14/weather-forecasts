Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 AM EDT Wed Nov 03 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Nov 06 2021 - 12Z Wed Nov 10 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will be characterized by an upper ridge
with its axis gradually shifting from the central U.S. over the
weekend toward the East by Tuesday-Wednesday, separating weekend
troughing in the East and rounds of troughing in the eastern
Pacific/West. A series of fronts and shortwaves coming into the
West Coast will keep precipitation chances high there, while a
front and developing low pressure system off the East Coast will
spread some rain across Florida and up the Southeast coast this
weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance begins the medium range period with reasonably good
agreement this weekend, indicating a shortwave over the
Midwest/Great Lakes and southern stream troughing over the
Southeast beginning to combine in the Eastern Seaboard, shortwave
energy tracking through the Northwest, and upper ridging in the
central U.S. The main exception is the 12Z CMC in the eastern
Pacific/West, as it has less initial energy with the Pacific
Northwest shortwave but more energy dropping southward around
Sunday in the eastern Pacific, causing a mid-upper trough to dig
along the West Coast by Monday. This is not supported by other
guidance including almost all GEFS/EC/CMC ensemble members. The
new 00Z CMC appears to be more in line with consensus, another
indication that leaning away from the 12Z is a good move. Other
than that, a multi-model deterministic blend favoring the 12Z
ECMWF and UKMET and 18Z GFS was used for the beginning of the
period. At the surface, this maintains a low track from the
Florida Peninsula northeastward into the western Atlantic.

As the workweek begins, there are some differences with placement
of shortwaves among guidance, but nothing too out of the ordinary
for that time range. For the most part, deterministic and ensemble
guidance indicate deeper troughing and likely a closed low just
offshore of the Pacific Northwest Tuesday, with troughing/energy
making its way quickly eastward Wednesday. The 18Z GFS and 12Z
ECMWF were both quite strong with this upper closed low and the
associated surface low, and this updated forecast showed an
increase in its strength, though not to the level of 957 or 965 mb
respectively at the surface Tuesday at 12Z. Other than that, the
main change to the previous forecast issuance was pushing a cold
front more quickly through the central U.S., per the recent model
guidance indicating a faster movement of incoming troughing for
the western/central U.S. and upper ridging pushing eastward. The
latter part of the medium range forecast utilized a fairly even
blend of the 18Z GFS and GEFS mean and 12Z ECMWF and EC mean.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As a surface low pressure and frontal system develops near/over
Florida Saturday and tracks northeastward into the western
Atlantic, it will spread rain across Florida and into the coastal
Carolinas and possibly the Mid-Atlantic region on the backside of
the low over the weekend. Current forecasts do not show rainfall
reaching very far inland, given a well offshore track of the low,
but small shifts of the low track could lead to significantly more
or less rainfall in coastal areas, especially for the Carolinas.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation this weekend into early next week near the
West Coast. Through the period, the Pacific Northwest and northern
California can expect the heaviest precipitation, with normal
terrain enhancements and higher elevation snow. Precipitation is
likely to spread into the Intermountain West and Rockies as well,
with amounts there increasing by next Monday into Wednesday.

Behind the low pressure system in the western Atlantic, a cold
surface high to the west will bring northerly winds and high
temperatures that are 10-20F below normal to the Southeast through
the weekend. Lows could be 5-10F below normal farther north in
this pattern as well, with temperatures in the mid to low 30s for
much of the Ohio Valley Saturday morning, which could result in
the first frost or freeze of the season for some places.
Meanwhile, a persistent upper-level ridge over the west-central
U.S. should lead to temperatures that are above average by 10-20
degrees over the Plains into the Midwest through early next week,
with highs 5-10F above normal stretching toward the East Coast by
Tuesday-Wednesday. Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs
somewhat below normal over the West Coast on most days, eventually
entering into the Great Basin and Rockies by midweek.

...Another round of light to moderate Lake Effect snow
accumulations expected across portions of Michigan and New York...

...Quasi-stationary boundary to bring heavy rain to portions of
the Southern Plains today...

...Unseasonably cool temperatures to persist across the Central
and Eastern US as above average temperatures dominate out West...

Anticyclonic flow around a large region of high pressure centered
over the Midwest is serving to force cool Canadian air southward
over the Great Lakes. As this cold air moves over the warm,
unfrozen waters it is expected to interact with shortwave forcing
both at the surface and aloft, creating conditions favorable for
the development of Lake Effect rain and snow downwind of the Great
Lakes through Thursday. Light to moderate snow accumulations of
3-6" are currently forecast for portions of the Michigan Upper
Peninsula and extreme northern Wisconsin, while a slightly lighter
2-5" are in store for Upstate New York east of Lake Ontario and
along the New York/Pennsylvania border east of Lake Erie. Winter
Weather Advisories remain in effect for these affected locations
through the late morning. Out West a stationary boundary curving
through the Rockies will also serve as the focal point for the
development of both rain and snow over central Colorado and
southern Wyoming today. Unlike its eastern counterpart, moderate
to heavy snow accumulations in this part of the country will be
isolated higher elevations above 8500 ft, where additional
accumulations of 4-6" remain possible through mid-morning.

In the neighboring Southern Plains, the southern edge of the
previously mentioned stationary front is forecast to bring showers
and thunderstorms to much of the region through Thursday morning.
As the front and an associated low pressure wave slowly meander
through southern Texas, anywhere from 1-2+" of rain are expected
to fall over the southern and eastern parts of the state in 24
hours. These rainfall totals combined with the potential for
rainfall rates of 1.5-2"/hr and localized flash flooding has
prompted the Weather Prediction Center to issue a Marginal Risk of
Excessive Rainfall for portions of south/southeast Texas through
Thursday morning.

Meanwhile, a series of low pressure systems approaching the
Pacific Northwest will bring moderate amounts of coastal rain and
high elevation snow to the region throughout the period. High
winds will accompany the first system as it moves onshore tonight,
with gusts as strong as 60 to 75 mph possible over portions of
southern Oregon and northern California, where scattered High Wind
Watches and Warnings as well as Wind Advisories will go into
effect this evening. The trailing cold front associated with this
first system is forecast to remain intact as it moves further
inland, bringing light rain and high elevation snow to the
Northern Great Basin and Northern Rockies on Thursday.

Temperature-wise, unseasonably cool weather is expected to persist
throughout the Central and Eastern US as surface high pressure
dominates and draws cold air south. The greatest hit to daily
maximum temperatures will be felt in the Southern Plains, Lower
Mississippi Valley, and the Carolinas where highs are forecast to
sit 20 to 25 degrees below normal as they struggle to escape the
40s and 50s. Furthermore, near to below freezing overnight lows
will be possible in the Middle Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, and extreme southern New England, where a mixture of
Freeze Watches and Warnings as well as Frost Advisories have been
put into effect. In stark contrast to the cold spell to the east,
temperatures from the West Coast to the Northern Plains are
forecast to remain around or just above average today. Thanks to a
building upper-level ridge, high temperatures across these regions
are expected to rise on Thursday to 10 to 15 degrees warmer than
normal.

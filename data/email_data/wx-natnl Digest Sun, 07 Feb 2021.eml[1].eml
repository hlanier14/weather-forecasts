.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1248 AM CST Sat Feb 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper-level trough anchored over the central U.S. will
remain quasi-stationary throughout the day. Enhanced mid-level flow
along the southern periphery of the trough will gradually shift
northeastward across the Southern Plains. At the surface, a cold
front will quickly sweep through much of the Southern Plains
throughout the day. Behind the front, surface winds will increase
during the afternoon as diurnal heating and vertical mixing
processes allow the aforementioned mid-level flow to mix toward the
surface. This will result in sustained winds of 20-25 mph, gusting
to 35 mph for a few hours during the afternoon. Meanwhile, RH values
should fall into the low 20s and upper teens across much of the
Southern Plains, with lower RH values expected with westward extent.
Despite marginally receptive fuels across the region, the wind/RH
combo expected should yield an elevated fire-weather risk. An
elevated area has been included for portions of northwest Texas,
where agreement in the wind/RH overlap is highest among the latest
short-term model guidance.

...Frigid Arctic Air Persists for Northern Plains And Upper
Midwest...
...Possible Mid-Atlantic to Northeast U.S. Winter Storm Later Next
Week...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest suite of deterministic and ensemble guidance shows the
blocky upper level pattern remaining mostly in place through the
place, with the main feature being the slowly retrograding polar
vortex into the Canadian prairies, which is well agreed upon by
the models through day 5. Its slow southward and southeastward sag
by day 6/7 is more uncertain. At the surface, this setup favors
more Gulf moisture to stream northeastward along the East Coast in
the quasi-southwest flow aloft with favorable setup for
cyclogenesis, which is depicted somewhat by all the various global
models. While the ingredients are there, deterministic runs of the
ECMWF/CMC/GFS vary widely with the track and position of cold air
in place so the sensible weather details are far from certain.

Elsewhere, the adjusted synoptic evolution also helps to develop a
swath of mostly light snow to traverse the north-central U.S.
during the latter part of next week in response to upper-level
impulses exiting the central Rockies under the retrograding polar
vortex in the Canadian prairies.  Meanwhile, upslope snows will
likely linger over the Colorado Rockies in the vicinity of the
arctic front.  The West will see more moderate temperatures but
with a general cooling trend as the arctic air filters in from the
north.  Models have shown a slowing trend of the arctic front
moving across the West.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS, together with a
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  More of the
ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7 as well given the
increasing model uncertainties.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A stationary front across southern Florida will lift northward and
likely provide a period of enhanced rainfall from the eastern Gulf
Coast region to the southeastern U.S. coast.  A quick moving
shortwave impulse tracking from the lower Ohio Valley into the
central Appalachians could bring some meaningful accumulations of
snow to the favored terrain areas of eastern Kentucky and West
Virginia. The latest winter weather outlook probabilities have
increased there this cycle.

Later next week, Gulf moisture is forecast to return and expand in
coverage across the southern tier states and possibly the East in
an overrunning pattern north of a stationary front across the
northern Gulf.  Depending on details of upper flow there is also
potential for this front/embedded wave(s) to lift farther
northward over the East.  With the cold air in place farther
inland, a swath of wintry weather remains possible from portions
of the southern tier into the Northeast later next week but with
lower confidence on the specifics. The latest Winter Weather
Outlook probabilities for snow show 30-50 percent chances from
southern VA to New England.

The forecast is fairly consistent in showing coldest anomalies of
at least 20-30F below normal early in the week from the
northern-central Plains into the Midwest, with some readings
possibly as low as 30-45F below normal over parts of Montana.
During the rest of the week this core of cold air will remain in
place and steadily push to the south and east.  Temperatures
reaching 20-35F below normal may extend into the southern Plains
and much of the Mississippi Valley by later in the week but
uncertainty in the eastern U.S. pattern lowers confidence in
exactly how cold the East will be at that time.  Most locations
west of the Rockies will see a general cooling trend.  Northern
areas should start out near to moderately below normal and trend a
bit colder, while the Great Basin/Southwest start the weak
moderately above normal and then decline toward normal (or
slightly below in parts of the Great Basin).

...Frigid Arctic Air Persists for Northern Plains And Upper
Midwest...
...Possible Mid-Atlantic to Northeast U.S. Winter Storm Later Next
Week...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest suite of deterministic and ensemble guidance shows the
blocky upper level pattern remaining mostly in place through the
place, with the main feature being the slowly retrograding polar
vortex into the Canadian prairies, which is well agreed upon by
the models through day 5. Its slow southward and southeastward sag
by day 6/7 is more uncertain. At the surface, this setup favors
more Gulf moisture to stream northeastward along the East Coast in
the quasi-southwest flow aloft with favorable setup for
cyclogenesis, which is depicted somewhat by all the various global
models. While the ingredients are there, deterministic runs of the
ECMWF/CMC/GFS vary widely with the track and position of cold air
in place so the sensible weather details are far from certain.

Elsewhere, the adjusted synoptic evolution also helps to develop a
swath of mostly light snow to traverse the north-central U.S.
during the latter part of next week in response to upper-level
impulses exiting the central Rockies under the retrograding polar
vortex in the Canadian prairies.  Meanwhile, upslope snows will
likely linger over the Colorado Rockies in the vicinity of the
arctic front.  The West will see more moderate temperatures but
with a general cooling trend as the arctic air filters in from the
north.  Models have shown a slowing trend of the arctic front
moving across the West.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS, together with a
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  More of the
ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7 as well given the
increasing model uncertainties.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A stationary front across southern Florida will lift northward and
likely provide a period of enhanced rainfall from the eastern Gulf
Coast region to the southeastern U.S. coast.  A quick moving
shortwave impulse tracking from the lower Ohio Valley into the
central Appalachians could bring some meaningful accumulations of
snow to the favored terrain areas of eastern Kentucky and West
Virginia. The latest winter weather outlook probabilities have
increased there this cycle.

Later next week, Gulf moisture is forecast to return and expand in
coverage across the southern tier states and possibly the East in
an overrunning pattern north of a stationary front across the
northern Gulf.  Depending on details of upper flow there is also
potential for this front/embedded wave(s) to lift farther
northward over the East.  With the cold air in place farther
inland, a swath of wintry weather remains possible from portions
of the southern tier into the Northeast later next week but with
lower confidence on the specifics. The latest Winter Weather
Outlook probabilities for snow show 30-50 percent chances from
southern VA to New England.

The forecast is fairly consistent in showing coldest anomalies of
at least 20-30F below normal early in the week from the
northern-central Plains into the Midwest, with some readings
possibly as low as 30-45F below normal over parts of Montana.
During the rest of the week this core of cold air will remain in
place and steadily push to the south and east.  Temperatures
reaching 20-35F below normal may extend into the southern Plains
and much of the Mississippi Valley by later in the week but
uncertainty in the eastern U.S. pattern lowers confidence in
exactly how cold the East will be at that time.  Most locations
west of the Rockies will see a general cooling trend.  Northern
areas should start out near to moderately below normal and trend a
bit colder, while the Great Basin/Southwest start the weak
moderately above normal and then decline toward normal (or
slightly below in parts of the Great Basin).

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0134 PM CST Sat Feb 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

Expanded the elevated area northward into eastern Colorado where
downslope flow is expected to enhance low-level flow. The area of
stronger winds is expected to stay near the mountains where fuels
are also more dry. Winds will be weaker and fuels more moist farther
east. Therefore, have kept the elevated delineation rather narrow
along this corridor.

..Bentley.. 02/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1252 AM CST Sat Feb 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough positioned over the central U.S. is forecast
to remain quasi-stationary through Sunday. Although guidance
suggests most of the enhanced mid-level flow should continue
shifting northward into the central Rockies/Plains, the trough
should pivot about the upper-low, allowing for more zonal flow
trajectories along the far southern extent of the trough to
overspread much of the southern High Plains.

Diurnally driven momentum transfer should result breezy surface
winds of 15-20 mph, with locally higher gusts, along the lee side of
high terrain from central/southern New Mexico into portions of far
West Texas. A dry post-frontal airmass remains in place, and added
drying from down-slope winds will yield RH values into the teens and
perhaps single digits. Despite these conditions, fuels across the
region remain marginally receptive to large-fire spread. Thus, an
elevated fire-weather risk has been introduced for the
aforementioned areas of central/southern New Mexico into portions of
far West Texas for Sunday afternoon.

...Southern storm system tracking up the East Coast on Sunday to
bring heavy snow to the Northeast...

...Wintry weather to persist in the Northern Rockies and Northern
Plains...

...Prolonged period of life-threatening wind chills to impact the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest...

An upper level disturbance tracking through the South Central U.S.
this afternoon is aiding in the development of low pressure along
the Gulf Coast. Widespread showers have formed throughout the
Southeast and will track northeast through the evening hours. Some
thunderstorms could become severe over Florida this afternoon and
evening, which has led to the issuance of a Slight Risk today.
Additionally, Winter Weather Advisories are in place for parts of
the Midwest through this evening as several inches of snow are
possible. Overnight, the wave of low pressure will strengthen
along the Southeast coast with periods of snow breaking out across
the southern Appalachians and southern Mid-Atlantic. By early
Sunday morning, the storm is expected to be somewhere near the
North Carolina Outer Banks and its accompanying shield of snowfall
will be positioned over the northern Mid-Atlantic. Snow may be
falling heavily at times along the I-95 corridor from Richmond and
Washington D.C. to Philadelphia Sunday morning. Farther south,
scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible in central
Florida as a cold front passes through the state. The storm will
race north and east bringing accumulating snowfall to the NYC
metro area and southern New England by midday and continuing into
the afternoon hours. Snow will exit out to sea by evening with
below normal temperatures surging in behind the departing winter
storm on Monday. Snowfall accumulations are forecast to range
between 4 to 8 inches on average up and down the I-95 megalopolis
from Washington D.C. to Boston with the highest amounts most
likely to occur in southern New England. Expect hazardous travel
conditions on Sunday with re-freezing of snow and ice on untreated
roads and surfaces Monday morning.

To the west, waves of low pressure will continue to ride along a
quasi-stationary frontal boundary that stretches from the
Northwest to the central High Plains. This is resulting in a
prolonged period of snowfall in parts of the Cascades, the
northern Rockies, and northern High Plains. Winter Storm Warnings
have been issued for much of Montana that last into Sunday
afternoon. Moderate-to-heavy snowfall is also expected to continue
in the Bitterroots and Tetons into Monday morning. Snowfall
accumulations through Monday evening range between 1 to 2 feet in
the higher elevations of the northern Rockies with over a foot of
snow also possible in the Colorado Rockies. Another round of
snowfall is likely to occur in parts of the Midwest on Monday as a
new area of low pressure develops in the south-central Plains.

The North Central U.S. is forecast to remain stuck under a dome of
frigid temperatures that encompasses a large area from Montana to
the western Great Lakes. Daily minimum temperatures both Sunday
and Monday are likely to be -10 to as low -20 degrees. High
temperatures will also struggle to get above zero in parts of the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Wind Chills will be dangerously
cold throughout much of the North Central U.S. with Wind Chill
Warnings and Advisories in place through Monday. Wind Chills,
particularly in northern North Dakota and Minnesota, could be as
low as -50 degrees. Unfortunately, Old Man Winter shows no sign of
loosening his grip over the region as much below normal
temperatures look to continue into the middle of the upcoming
week.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat February 06 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1224 AM CST Sun Feb 07 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
An expansive upper-level trough situated east of the Rockies should
remain quasi-stationary throughout the day. Most of the enhanced
mid-level flow will stay confined to northern/central parts of the
CONUS. However, a weak mid-level short-wave trough is forecast to
traverse portions of the Southwest throughout the forecast period.
This process will allow winds over the southern High Plains to take
on a more westerly component, particularly during the afternoon
hours. Diurnally driven momentum transfer should allow these winds
to mix to the surface, resulting in sustained winds of 15-20 mph
during the afternoon. Meanwhile, low-level drying will be aided by a
down-slope orientation of the flow off high terrain across much of
the southern/central High Plains, resulting in RH values into the
teens. Despite marginally receptive fuels, elevated fire-weather
conditions can be expected for this region.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 AM CST Sun Feb 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level flow pattern is forecast to change very little
across much of the CONUS. An upper-level trough will remain
entrenched across the central U.S., resulting in broad regions of
enhanced westerly mid-level flow. Once again, diurnal heating and
vertical mixing, combined with down-slope winds off high terrain,
will result in a wind/rh combo conducive for elevated fire-weather
conditions across the southern High Plains. Areas farther north,
into the central High Plains, may also experience localized/brief
elevated fire-weather conditions, however surface temperatures may
remain a bit too cool to fully realize this threat. Fuels remain
marginally receptive to large-fire spread in most locations, but
fuels are becoming increasingly more receptive given several
consecutive days of dry conditions.

...Arctic air lingers over the Plains and the Midwest...
...Possible Mid-Atlantic to Northeast U.S. winter storm late this
week...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance continues to show a polar vortex
meandering over the Canadian prairies through the medium-range
period with an arctic air mass engulfing much of the northern and
central U.S.  Farther south, models are again trending slightly
slower on the southward and southeastward expansion of the arctic
air into the southern tier states.  Meanwhile, models are bringing
additional moisture from the Gulf into the Deep South by the
midweek, and will likely overrun the cold air already in place
across the Northeast under a general southwesterly flow aloft.
The consensus of ensemble means indicate at least modest
cyclogenesis just off the New England coast late this week.
Farther inland, models continue to suggest that upper-level
impulses exiting the central Rockies under the polar vortex will
bring a swath of mostly light snow across the north-central U.S.
before possibly interacting with the system off New England later
this week.  Under this setup, parts of the Northeast should
experience some form of wintry weather later this week although
the details are far from certain at this time.

Elsewhere, upslope snows will likely linger over the Colorado
Rockies in the vicinity of the arctic front.  The West will see
more moderate temperatures but with a general cooling trend as the
arctic air filters in from the north, with a continued slowing
trend for the arctic front to move across the West.  By late this
week, models are now in good agreement that moisture from the next
Pacific will mostly likely reach the middle of the West Coast and
will persist into the weekend.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 18Z GFS/GEFS, together with a
smaller contribution from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean.  More of the
ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7 as well given the
increasing model uncertainties.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A stationary front across southern Florida will lift northward as
a warm front and likely provide a period of enhanced rainfall from
the eastern Gulf Coast region to the southeastern U.S. coast
midweek.  A quick moving shortwave impulse tracking from the lower
Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians could bring some
meaningful accumulations of snow to the favored terrain areas of
eastern Kentucky and West Virginia.

By midweek, Gulf moisture is forecast to return and expand in
coverage across the southern tier states and then up the East
Coast in an overrunning pattern north of a stationary front across
the northern Gulf.  With the cold air in place farther inland, a
swath of snow and ice remains possible from portions of the
southern tier into the Northeast.  The latest Winter Weather
Outlook probabilities call for a 30-60 percent chances of snow and
ice from upper Ohio Valley to southern New England from Wednesday
to Thursday.

Focus of upslope snow over the Colorado Rockies near the arctic
front will gradually shift to the West Coast as the next Pacific
system pushes moisture onshore by Thursday.  The Cascades and the
Sierra Nevada can expect snowfall to resume and continue into the
weekend while periods of rain spreads into a good portion of
California.

Temperature-wise, the arctic air mass will sustain a large area of
single digit and sub-zero temperatures across the northern to
central Plains where readings will be 30-40F below normal from
midweek into the weekend.  Temperatures reaching 20-35F below
normal may extend into the southern Plains and much of the
Mississippi Valley by later in the week but uncertainty in the
eastern U.S. pattern lowers confidence in exactly how cold the
East will be at that time.  Most locations west of the Rockies
will see a general cooling trend.  Northern areas should start out
near to moderately below normal and trend a bit colder, while the
Great Basin/Southwest start the weak moderately above normal and
then decline toward normal (or slightly below in parts of the
Great Basin).

Mid-Atlantic to southern New England today...

...Consistent light snow to persist across the Northern Rockies
and Central Plains before moving east into the Midwest and Ohio
Valley by Monday...

...Prolonged period of life-threatening wind chills to continue
for the foreseeable future throughout the Northern Plains and
portions of the Midwest...

A low pressure system taking shape along the Southeast coastline
this morning is set to race up the East Coast today and bring
potentially hazardous winter weather for several major cities from
the Mid-Atlantic to New England.  Snow is already falling across
portions of the southern and central Appalachians, including
western North Carolina and southwest Virginia. A mix of rain and
snow is forecast to move north throughout the day today and bring
a few inches of snow from Washington D.C. to New York City.
Farther northeast, upwards of 6 to 8 inches of snow could fall
across far southern New England, including Cape Cod. Even though
temperatures are right around the freezing mark for the more
highly populated regions in the Northeast, snowfall intensity
could be heavy at times and rapidly reduce visibility. This could
potentially make travel difficult at times. Wintry precipiation
will be quick to exit and come to an end across eastern Maine
early Monday morning. Meanwhile, showers and isolated severe
thunderstorms will be a concern across central and southern
Florida today ahead of an approaching cold front. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk for severe
thunderstorms across the region due to the threat of damaging wind
gusts and isolated tornadoes.

Snowfall is also making headlines across the Northern Rockies and
Central Plains as light-to-moderate snow impacts the region. A
wave of low pressure is expected to move along a stationary front
today across the Northern Rockies and enter the Central Plains by
Monday. Continued snowy conditions will add an additional foot of
snow across the mountainous terrain of northwest Wyoming, western
Montana, and northern Idaho.  Winter Storm Warnings and Winter
Weather Advisories remain in effect for this area. Light snow is
also expected to swing through portions of Nebraska today, before
moving eastward across the Midwest and Ohio Valley on Monday.
Although snowfall accumulations will be on the lighter side,
temperatures well below freezing could make for slippery road
conditions regardless.

Speaking of cold temperatures, the Northern Plains and Midwest
will be in for another day of brutal wind chills as arctic air
remains locked across the region for the foreseeable future. High
temperatures 20 to 30 degrees below normal will be found from the
Canadian border to Oklahoma, extending as far east as northern
Indiana and as far west as Montana through Tuesday. Many northern
locations will struggle to see temperatures above zero, with wind
chills as cold as -50 degrees. Wind Chill Warnings and Wind Chill
Advisories have been issued for many of these locations. While
this cold is definitely anomalous, only a few daily low
temperature records are forecast to fall over the next few days.

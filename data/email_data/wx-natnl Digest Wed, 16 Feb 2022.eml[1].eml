Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
134 PM EST Tue Feb 15 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Feb 18 2022 - 12Z Tue Feb 22 2022

1900 UTC Update...

The latest 00z/06z model cycle continues to show above average
agreement through the entire period on the large scale, with some
lingering uncertainties in the smaller scale details which mostly
show run to run variability anyways. Models have remained mostly
consistent with their previous runs and so, no major changes were
needed for todays update to the WPC medium range product suite.
The only notable change to previous continuity was a slight
northward shift in the QPF axis across the Deep South early next
week, although given the longer time range, remains rather
uncertain anyways. Todays blend consisted of the updated
deterministic model runs for days 3-5, with some incorporation of
the ensemble means on days 6-7 to help mitigate the detail
differences. See previous discussion below for model evaluation
details and associated sensible weather threats.

Santorelli


Previous discussion issued at 0700 UTC...

...Overview...

Low pressure and a strong cold front along with its associated
precipitation will be exiting the East Coast on Friday, behind
which northern stream energy will push a clipper system with some
snow near the Great Lakes region. Then early next week, troughing
is forecast to develop in the West and slowly track eastward along
with a frontal system. Precipitation chances should increase in
the West with this pattern and spread into the central U.S. once
again by next Monday and Tuesday, with the possibility of northern
tier snow and southern U.S. rain.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance shows good agreement overall with the large
scale pattern even through early next week, with some typical
differences in the smaller scale details. 12Z/18Z models remain
fairly well clustered with the strengthening surface low near the
Northeast/southeastern Canada early Friday, along with the track
and strength of the surface low near the U.S./Canadian border
pushing into the Great Lakes region Friday into Saturday. A
multi-model deterministic blend of the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF, CMC,
and UKMET worked well for these features and kept with continuity
well. A somewhat less certain feature during this timeframe is a
compact shortwave rounding the ridge in the eastern Pacific that
could enter the Pacific Northwest or northern California around
Friday night and move eastward, but with some differences in its
timing and placement, which may not be resolved for a while given
its small scale. However, troughing developing in the West early
next week is coming into somewhat better agreement overall with
its development, depth, and movement, but there are still notable
differences as energy spills in from the low predictability high
latitudes. GFS runs have been the strongest with the trough and
occasionally close off an upper low, but recent runs have backed
off a bit on the strength, closer to the pattern shown by the more
consistent ECMWF. Some phasing differences with potential stream
separation also are causing minor model differences that could
continue to be an issue with the evolution of the troughing. But
overall agreement is better than usual considering the forecast
time range of 6-7 days. The WPC forecast phased in some GEFS and
ECMWF ensemble mean guidance for the latter part of the period,
but still kept a majority deterministic model blend throughout
given the fairly good agreement currently, with the blending
process and some usage of the means taking care of individual
model eccentricities.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

As the medium range period begins Friday, rain and snow will
mostly be exiting the East Coast along with a low pressure/frontal
system, though showers could linger in Florida. Gusty winds could
also continue on Friday particularly in the Northeast near the
strong surface low. Snow is forecast for the end of the week
across the Great Lakes region with the clipper system, with
generally light to perhaps locally moderate amounts. Mainly dry
conditions are expected elsewhere on Friday, before precipitation
starts to increase in the West over the weekend with the upper
trough coming in. Coastal and valley rain and mountain snow are
likely over the Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the
Great Basin, and the Rockies. Snow is possible for the Northern
Plains as well by early next week, but with low confidence in the
snow axis and amounts at this point. By Monday and Tuesday moist
inflow will return from the Gulf of Mexico, increasing rain
chances across the Gulf Coast states.

The East Coast can expect temperatures to be warmer than average
Friday morning, even setting daily records for warm lows, before
quickly falling behind the cold front, leading to temperatures
right around average for the weekend. Meanwhile, colder than
normal temperatures by 10-20F are expected in the south-central
U.S. to Midwest on Friday and moderating by Saturday. Temperatures
will be warmer than average starting in the Northwest late this
week and spreading into the Plains this weekend, and highs in the
60s are forecast by Sunday as far north as Nebraska and western
Iowa. Warm temperatures shift/spread to the East Coast early in
the workweek while the western half of the nation cools down
underneath the trough. The northern and central High Plains could
see temperatures 15-25F below normal Monday into Tuesday.

deterministic model runs for days 3-5, with some incorporation of
the ensemble means on days 6-7 to help mitigate the detail
differences. See previous discussion below for model evaluation
details and associated sensible weather threats.

Previous discussion issued at 0700 UTC...

...Overview...

Low pressure and a strong cold front along with its associated
precipitation will be exiting the East Coast on Friday, behind
which northern stream energy will push a clipper system with some
snow near the Great Lakes region. Then early next week, troughing
is forecast to develop in the West and slowly track eastward along
with a frontal system. Precipitation chances should increase in
the West with this pattern and spread into the central U.S. once
again by next Monday and Tuesday, with the possibility of northern
tier snow and southern U.S. rain.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance shows good agreement overall with the large
scale pattern even through early next week, with some typical
differences in the smaller scale details. 12Z/18Z models remain
fairly well clustered with the strengthening surface low near the
Northeast/southeastern Canada early Friday, along with the track
and strength of the surface low near the U.S./Canadian border
pushing into the Great Lakes region Friday into Saturday. A
multi-model deterministic blend of the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF, CMC,
and UKMET worked well for these features and kept with continuity
well. A somewhat less certain feature during this timeframe is a
compact shortwave rounding the ridge in the eastern Pacific that
could enter the Pacific Northwest or northern California around
Friday night and move eastward, but with some differences in its
timing and placement, which may not be resolved for a while given
its small scale. However, troughing developing in the West early
next week is coming into somewhat better agreement overall with
its development, depth, and movement, but there are still notable
differences as energy spills in from the low predictability high
latitudes. GFS runs have been the strongest with the trough and
occasionally close off an upper low, but recent runs have backed
off a bit on the strength, closer to the pattern shown by the more
consistent ECMWF. Some phasing differences with potential stream
separation also are causing minor model differences that could
continue to be an issue with the evolution of the troughing. But
overall agreement is better than usual considering the forecast
time range of 6-7 days. The WPC forecast phased in some GEFS and
ECMWF ensemble mean guidance for the latter part of the period,
but still kept a majority deterministic model blend throughout
given the fairly good agreement currently, with the blending
process and some usage of the means taking care of individual
model eccentricities.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

As the medium range period begins Friday, rain and snow will
mostly be exiting the East Coast along with a low pressure/frontal
system, though showers could linger in Florida. Gusty winds could
also continue on Friday particularly in the Northeast near the
strong surface low. Snow is forecast for the end of the week
across the Great Lakes region with the clipper system, with
generally light to perhaps locally moderate amounts. Mainly dry
conditions are expected elsewhere on Friday, before precipitation
starts to increase in the West over the weekend with the upper
trough coming in. Coastal and valley rain and mountain snow are
likely over the Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the
Great Basin, and the Rockies. Snow is possible for the Northern
Plains as well by early next week, but with low confidence in the
snow axis and amounts at this point. By Monday and Tuesday moist
inflow will return from the Gulf of Mexico, increasing rain
chances across the Gulf Coast states.

The East Coast can expect temperatures to be warmer than average
Friday morning, even setting daily records for warm lows, before
quickly falling behind the cold front, leading to temperatures
right around average for the weekend. Meanwhile, colder than
normal temperatures by 10-20F are expected in the south-central
U.S. to Midwest on Friday and moderating by Saturday. Temperatures
will be warmer than average starting in the Northwest late this
week and spreading into the Plains this weekend, and highs in the
60s are forecast by Sunday as far north as Nebraska and western
Iowa. Warm temperatures shift/spread to the East Coast early in
the workweek while the western half of the nation cools down
underneath the trough. The northern and central High Plains could
see temperatures 15-25F below normal Monday into Tuesday.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Confidence has increased regarding the development of critical
fire-weather conditions across a large portion of the southern High
Plains from the late morning into early evening hours on Day
2/Wednesday. A multi-model guidance consensus depicts widespread
sustained southwesterly surface winds of 20-25 mph with gusts up to
45 mph amid critically low RH behind a sharpening dryline. There is
some uncertainty on the eastern and northern bounds of the Critical
area, as the fire-weather threat will depend on both the eastward
advance of the dryline and southward progression of a cold front,
respectively. Therefore, additional adjustments to the Elevated and
Critical areas may become necessary with subsequent outlooks. For
additional details, see the previous discussion below.

..Weinman.. 02/15/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CST Tue Feb 15 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will linger across the southern High Plains as
a lee cyclone becomes consolidated across the TX Panhandle/eastern
NM. Fuels across this region are already dry and will undergo
further curing after dry/windy conditions Tuesday.

...Southern High Plains...
Westerly downslope flow will persist across eastern NM into west TX
through the day as the surface trough/dryline sharpens to the south
of the surface low. RH reductions into the single digits and low
teens appear likely with winds increasing to 20-25 mph. Strong
westerly flow between 850-700 mb and deep boundary-layer mixing will
support wind gusts between 30-45 mph. The spatial extent of the fire
weather threat will be determined by the placement of the dryline to
the east across west TX, the southward progression of a cold front
to the north, and increasing clouds/showers from the west across
south-central NM. While confidence remains somewhat low on the
periphery of the threat area, critical conditions are still expected
across southeastern NM/west TX.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 15 2022

SYNOPSIS: There is good agreement among the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble means indicating amplified mid-level low pressure across the weste=
rn
half of the lower 48, continuing from the end of week-1 into the beginning =
of
week-2. Of greatest hazard concern is the widespread potential for much bel=
ow
normal temperatures across the West extending into the Great  Plains. The
mid-level pattern is generally anticipated to gradually deamplify by the
middle
of the period, although mid-level low pressure may remain across the
North-Central contiguous U.S. (CONUS), supporting increased chances for
extreme
cold across the Northern Rockies and Northern and Central Great Plains
extending into the middle of week-2. A storm is predicted to form over the
Bering Sea by the beginning of week-2, which may bring unsettled weather to
parts of Alaska, although no related hazards are anticipated at this time.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the Norther=
n
and Central Plains, Wed, Feb 23.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the Northern
Rockies and Northern and Central Great Plains, Wed-Sun, Feb 23-27.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across the Great Basin,
Southwest, Central and Southern Plains, Pacific Northwest, California, and
Central and Southern Rockies, Wed-Fri, Feb 23-25.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Middle and Lower
Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and
Southeast,
Wed, Feb 23.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 18 - TUESDAY FEBRUARY 22:

RzGM3TrB8GS$

FOR WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 23 - TUESDAY MARCH 01: There is good multi-model
depiction of amplified mid-level troughing across the western half of the
CONUS
continuing from the end of week-1 into the beginning of week-2, bringing an
increased potential of much below normal temperatures to many parts of the
West. There are however some differences in the details of this feature. Th=
e
0Z
ECMWF and Canadian ensemble means favor a more amplified trough extending t=
o
the Four Corners and western Texas at the beginning of the period, compared=
 to
the GEFS. This translates to greater chances of reaching much below normal
temperature thresholds being across a broader area in the ECMWF reforecast
tool
compared to the GEFS. The GEFS and ECMWF ensembles show mid-level ridging
extending from the North Pacific into the West Coast at the beginning of
week-2, whereas the GEFS favors a more positively tilted trough extending f=
rom
the Northern Plains to the West Coast. The mid-level pattern is predicted t=
o
weaken by the middle of the period, although mid-level troughing across the
Northern Plains is favored to extend the increased potential for much below
normal temperatures into the middle of period.



Despite some of the differences in the details of the evolution of the
mid-level trough across the West, there is relatively good agreement among =
the
guidance supporting a broad area of slight risk of much below normal
temperatures across the the Great Basin, Southwest, Central and Southern
Plains, Pacific Northwest, and California, and Central and Southern Rockies=
,
Wed-Fri, Feb 23-25. A separate area is highlighted for a slight risk of muc=
h
below normal temperatures across portions of the Northern Rockies and North=
ern
and Central Great Plains, Feb 23 to 27, where lingering mid-level troughing
could prolong the increased likelihood for much below normal temperatures i=
nto
the middle of the period. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at
least
a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile
(10th percentile in some areas). Temperatures could range from below 0 Deg =
F
across the North-Central CONUS, which could negatively  impact agriculture,=
 to
below 40 Deg F across the Southern Plains, which could impact livestock and
outdoor activities.



A moderate risk of much below normal temperatures is posted across parts of
the
Northern and Central Plains, Feb 23, primarily based on the ECMWF reforecas=
t
tool which indicates at least a 50% chance of minimum temperatures falling =
to
the lowest 15th percentile (and greater than 40% chance of falling to the
lowest 10th percentile) and 0 Deg F. Recent deterministic GFS and ECMWF
solutions have indicated 2m temperatures reaching anomalies of at least -24
Deg
F across the Northern and Central Plains at the beginning of the period.



A front is anticipated to form ahead of the amplified mid-level trough acro=
ss
the West, stretching from the Northeast to Southern Plains at the end of
week-1, and continue into the outset of week-2. There is relatively good
agreement among multiple ensemble means indicating this feature bringing he=
avy
precipitation to parts of the eastern CONUS on day 8 (Feb 23). A slight ris=
k
of
heavy precipitation is designated across parts of the Middle and Lower
Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and
Southeast,
Feb 23. A broad area is highlighted based on the uncalibrated ECMWF ensembl=
e
daily means indicating enhanced probabilities of totals exceeding one inch =
and
where the reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall tot=
als
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch.



Yesterday's high wind hazard is removed in today's outlook due to the synop=
tic
pattern being less favorable for supporting a high wind event over the Four
Corners and western Texas and reforecast tools and recent deterministic
guidance showing a weaker signal for wind speeds reaching hazardous
thresholds.



There is good agreement in the models ion indicating possible storm formati=
on
over the Bering Sea at the beginning of week-2. This could bring windy
conditions to portions of the western Aleutians. However, the reforecast to=
ols
and recent deterministic guidance does not support the inclusion of a relat=
ed
high wind hazard at this time.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Tue February 15 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 21 - 25 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. A ridge and associated above norma=
l
500-hPa heights are predicted across the Northeast Pacific, extending north=
 to
Alaska.. An enhanced trough is predicted over the western half of the CONUS
with below normal 500-hPa heights. Downstream, mean ridging is forecast to
persist over the eastern CONUS, leading to predicted above normal heights
there.

Above normal temperatures are favored for Alaska, associated with above nor=
mal
500-hPa heights in the period. There are enhanced probabilities of below
normal
temperatures across the western half of the CONUS beneath amplified troughi=
ng.
Above normal temperatures are likely for parts of the Southern Plains, Midd=
le
and Lower Mississippi Valley, and the eastern CONUS due to predicted ridgin=
g
and above normal heights over most of these regions

The potential for several storm systems tracking ahead of a mean trough wes=
t
of
Mainland Alaska favors above normal precipitation for most of the state. Th=
e
predicted ridge over the Northeast Pacific favors enhanced odds of below
normal
precipitation across the West Coast of the CONUS. Predicted cyclonic flow
increases the chances of above normal precipitation for much of the interio=
r
West. An amplified storm system is forecast to develop in the Plains and tr=
ack
east across the country, enhancing the likelihood of above normal
precipitation
for most of the central and eastern CONUS, except the Florida Peninsula as =
the
strong Southeast ridge is expected to keep the storm track north of the
Peninsula.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.



8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 23 - MAR 01, 2022

During the week-2 period, the overall 500-hPa flow pattern across North
America
is forecast to be mostly similar to that indicated for the 6-10 Day period.=
.

Above normal temperatures are favored for Alaska near the predicted ridge o=
ver
the Northeast Pacific. Conversely, below normal temperatures are favored fo=
r
the western and central CONUS associated with troughing forecast during the
period. Near to above normal temperatures are favored for the eastern CONUS=
,
consistent with predicted above normal 500-hPa heights.

An active pattern is likely to continue into week-2 across much of Alaska
underneath enhanced southwesterly mid-level flow, leading to elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation for most of the state. Below
normal
precipitation is most likely across the western CONUS, associated with stro=
ng
ridging forecast off the West Coast. Ahead of the mean trough predicted ove=
r
the western CONUS, above normal precipitation is favored across most of the
CONUS between the Rockies and the Appalachians extending eastward to includ=
e
much of the Northeast. Conversely, near to below normal precipitation is
favored for the Florida Peninsula  based on the likelihood of prevalent
surface
high pressure.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern, off=
set
by some disagreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 17.

Valid 12Z Fri Feb 18 2022 - 12Z Tue Feb 22 2022

1900 UTC Update...

The latest 00z/06z model cycle continues to show above average
agreement through the entire period on the large scale, with some
lingering uncertainties in the smaller scale details which mostly
show run to run variability anyways. Models have remained mostly
consistent with their previous runs and so, no major changes were
needed for todays update to the WPC medium range product suite.
The only notable change to previous continuity was a slight
northward shift in the QPF axis across the Deep South early next
week, although given the longer time range, remains rather
uncertain anyways. Todays blend consisted of the updated
deterministic model runs for days 3-5, with some incorporation of
the ensemble means on days 6-7 to help mitigate the detail
differences. See previous discussion below for model evaluation
details and associated sensible weather threats.

Previous discussion issued at 0700 UTC...

...Overview...

Low pressure and a strong cold front along with its associated
precipitation will be exiting the East Coast on Friday, behind
which northern stream energy will push a clipper system with some
snow near the Great Lakes region. Then early next week, troughing
is forecast to develop in the West and slowly track eastward along
with a frontal system. Precipitation chances should increase in
the West with this pattern and spread into the central U.S. once
again by next Monday and Tuesday, with the possibility of northern
tier snow and southern U.S. rain.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance shows good agreement overall with the large
scale pattern even through early next week, with some typical
differences in the smaller scale details. 12Z/18Z models remain
fairly well clustered with the strengthening surface low near the
Northeast/southeastern Canada early Friday, along with the track
and strength of the surface low near the U.S./Canadian border
pushing into the Great Lakes region Friday into Saturday. A
multi-model deterministic blend of the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF, CMC,
and UKMET worked well for these features and kept with continuity
well. A somewhat less certain feature during this timeframe is a
compact shortwave rounding the ridge in the eastern Pacific that
could enter the Pacific Northwest or northern California around
Friday night and move eastward, but with some differences in its
timing and placement, which may not be resolved for a while given
its small scale. However, troughing developing in the West early
next week is coming into somewhat better agreement overall with
its development, depth, and movement, but there are still notable
differences as energy spills in from the low predictability high
latitudes. GFS runs have been the strongest with the trough and
occasionally close off an upper low, but recent runs have backed
off a bit on the strength, closer to the pattern shown by the more
consistent ECMWF. Some phasing differences with potential stream
separation also are causing minor model differences that could
continue to be an issue with the evolution of the troughing. But
overall agreement is better than usual considering the forecast
time range of 6-7 days. The WPC forecast phased in some GEFS and
ECMWF ensemble mean guidance for the latter part of the period,
but still kept a majority deterministic model blend throughout
given the fairly good agreement currently, with the blending
process and some usage of the means taking care of individual
model eccentricities.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

As the medium range period begins Friday, rain and snow will
mostly be exiting the East Coast along with a low pressure/frontal
system, though showers could linger in Florida. Gusty winds could
also continue on Friday particularly in the Northeast near the
strong surface low. Snow is forecast for the end of the week
across the Great Lakes region with the clipper system, with
generally light to perhaps locally moderate amounts. Mainly dry
conditions are expected elsewhere on Friday, before precipitation
starts to increase in the West over the weekend with the upper
trough coming in. Coastal and valley rain and mountain snow are
likely over the Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the
Great Basin, and the Rockies. Snow is possible for the Northern
Plains as well by early next week, but with low confidence in the
snow axis and amounts at this point. By Monday and Tuesday moist
inflow will return from the Gulf of Mexico, increasing rain
chances across the Gulf Coast states.

The East Coast can expect temperatures to be warmer than average
Friday morning, even setting daily records for warm lows, before
quickly falling behind the cold front, leading to temperatures
right around average for the weekend. Meanwhile, colder than
normal temperatures by 10-20F are expected in the south-central
U.S. to Midwest on Friday and moderating by Saturday. Temperatures
will be warmer than average starting in the Northwest late this
week and spreading into the Plains this weekend, and highs in the
60s are forecast by Sunday as far north as Nebraska and western
Iowa. Warm temperatures shift/spread to the East Coast early in
the workweek while the western half of the nation cools down
underneath the trough. The northern and central High Plains could
see temperatures 15-25F below normal Monday into Tuesday.

...Critical fire weather conditions forecast to continue into
Wednesday across portions of the southern High Plains...

...Potential for disruptive snow and freezing rain extends from
northern Oklahoma to central Michigan on Thursday...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible from the Southern
Plains to the Southeast beginning Wednesday night...

Over the next few days, a deep upper-level trough and its
associated cold front will continue to push south and east through
the western and central U.S., producing a variety of hazardous
weather types through midweek.  In the near term, this includes
strong and gusty winds across portions of central and southern
California, southern Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, where high
wind warnings and wind advisories remain in effect.  Widespread
wind gusts of 45-55 mph are expected, with the potential for even
stronger gusts, especially across the higher terrain of the
southern Sierra and the Southern California mountains into the
evening hours.  Meanwhile, a burst of light to moderate snow is
likely to spread south behind the cold front from the
Intermountain West to the northern Rockies this evening, before
entering the Southwest, the central to southern Rockies and
central High Plains by early Wednesday.

Farther east, strong southerly winds ahead of the front are
supporting another day of well-above average temperatures across
much of the central and southern Plains into the Mississippi
Valley.  This combination of strong winds and above normal
temperatures, along with dry conditions, is producing dangerous
fire weather conditions across portions of the region, with Red
Flag warnings remaining in effect for parts of the southern and
central Plains, and the lower Mississippi Valley into this
evening.  Sustained windy and dry conditions are expected to
support critical fire weather conditions lingering into Wednesday
across portions of the southern High Plains.

By Wednesday night and into Thursday, the aforementioned
upper-level trough is forecast to eject into the Southern Plains.
Low pressure is expected to develop over the Texas Panhandle and
Oklahoma along before tracking northeastward along the associated
cold front as it advances across the Mississippi Valley.   While
precise details remain uncertain, significant winter weather
impacts appear probable on the north side of the system.  This
includes a stripe of impactful snow that is most likely to stretch
from south-central Kansas through central Missouri, northern
Illinois, and into central Michigan.   A wintry mix, including
areas of sleet and freezing rain, will like fall just to the south
of the heaviest axis of snow, but uncertainty remains regarding
where exactly the transition zone will set up.

On the warm side of the system, rich atmospheric moisture
streaming out of the Gulf of Mexico and into the southern Plains
and lower Mississippi Valley will fuel the potential for areas of
heavy rain and severe thunderstorms.   As the advancing cold front
clashes with the warm and moist airmass Wednesday night, a line of
thunderstorms may develop across North Texas and Oklahoma. The
potential exists for storms to produce damaging wind gusts, large
hail, and isolated tornadoes in this region.  The Storm Prediction
Center has maintained a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe
thunderstorms Wednesday evening through Thursday morning for North
Texas and central to eastern Oklahoma.   The severe weather threat
is expected to shift eastward along the cold front and into parts
of the lower Mississippi Valley, Mid-South and Southeast on
Thursday.   With plenty of moisture to work with, the threat of
heavy rain also exists from parts of the southern Plains to the
Appalachians through Thursday. There are expected to be two main
modes of heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding; the first
is associated with intense rainfall rates related to thunderstorms
and the second is related to widespread heavy rain along the
strong cold front. Both are expected to lead to isolated flooding
concerns. Thunderstorm-induced heavy rain is most likely across
the southernmost affected areas, particularly from the southern
Plains to the southern Appalachians between Wednesday night and
Thursday night. Farther north, flood watches are in effect from
portions of central Illinois and across much of Indiana into the
eastern Great Lakes, where the combination of heavy rain along
with melting snow is expected to cause flooding concerns.

159 AM EST Wed Feb 16 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Feb 19 2022 - 12Z Wed Feb 23 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Saturday with generally quiet
weather, besides a clipper system bringing snow to the Great Lakes
region. Then as next week begins, troughing is forecast to develop
in the West and slowly track eastward along with a strong frontal
system. Precipitation chances should increase in the West with
this pattern and spread into the central U.S. once again by next
Monday through Wednesday, with the possibility of northern tier
snow and southern U.S. rain.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance shows good agreement overall with the large
scale pattern even through the middle of next week, with some
typical differences in the smaller scale details. To start the
period, the surface low/clipper over the Great Lakes and
upper-level energy supporting it have good consensus among 12/18Z
models. A less certain feature during this timeframe is a compact
shortwave tracking into the West ahead of the main larger scale
trough. Overall recent models have trended stronger with this
initial energy, with increasing consensus for a closed low likely
centered just west of California on Saturday. The GFS was the
slowest model to come to this conclusion (the 12Z had its low
displaced east and the 18Z run showed an open trough), but the 00Z
GFS does show a closed low in line with other guidance. Though
there is better agreement now, considering the small scale of the
low rounding the Pacific ridge, additional shifts in the forecast
are possible.

Then there is good agreement for energy to spill into the West and
develop troughing as next week begins, while much of the central
and eastern U.S. shifts to zonal flow and then ridging. 12/18Z GFS
runs remain among the strongest, specifically with closing off a
low within the trough even by early Sunday sinking into the
Pacific Northwest, while the 12Z CMC was slightly east with its
trough axis by around Tuesday compared to consensus. The phasing
differences with potential stream separation are causing minor
model differences that could continue to be an issue with the
evolution of the troughing. The ECMWF has been more consistent and
favored among the deterministic guidance, though both the 12Z and
new 00Z runs may be a bit slow with lingering energy across the
West by Wednesday. Despite these model differences, the theme of
troughing developing in the West for the first half of the week
slowly shifting eastward as well as sending northern stream energy
across the north-central U.S. by midweek is consistent.

The WPC forecast utilized a multi-model deterministic blend of the
12/18Z guidance for the early part of the period, slightly
favoring the ECMWF and CMC. Phased in some GEFS and ECMWF ensemble
mean guidance for the latter part of the period, ending up with
about half deterministic models and half means by day 7,
mitigating the individual model eccentricities. The main
difference from the previous WPC forecast was a continued trend
northward with the axis of heaviest QPF across the Mid-South
Monday-Wednesday of next week.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Lingering snow is forecast on Saturday across the Great Lakes
region with the clipper system, with generally light to perhaps
locally moderate amounts. Mainly dry conditions are expected
elsewhere on Saturday other than a few showers possible in
Florida, except that precipitation will be increasing in the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies with the upper trough
coming in. Coastal and valley rain and mountain snow are likely
over the Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the Great
Basin, and the Rockies through the early part of next week. Snow
could also spread farther east into the northern High Plains
Sunday and into the rest of the northern tier states as the first
half of the week progresses. The confidence in the axis of
heaviest snow and snowfall amounts remains somewhat low. Farther
south, moist inflow is forecast to return to the south-central and
southeastern U.S., increasing chances for rainfall that could
become heavy over the Mid-South in particular by Monday and
Tuesday.

Temperatures over the weekend are expected to be above normal for
parts of the West into the Plains, with the largest anomalies of
highs 20+ degrees above average over South Dakota and Nebraska.
Meanwhile, cooler to near average temperatures over the eastern
third of the country Saturday will warm Sunday. As the pattern
amplifies, the south-central U.S. to the East Coast will further
warm through the first half of next week, with widespread highs
10-20F and lows 20-30F above normal. Meanwhile, a cold Arctic high
is forecast to shift into the north-central U.S., leading to well
below average temperatures initially across the northern High
Plains and spreading southward through midweek. Temperatures in
some places could be 30 or more degrees below normal, and highs in
the single digits are expected for Montana and the Dakotas Monday
and Tuesday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 AM EST Wed Feb 16 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Feb 19 2022 - 12Z Wed Feb 23 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Saturday with generally quiet
weather, besides a clipper system bringing snow to the Great Lakes
region. Then as next week begins, troughing is forecast to develop
in the West and slowly track eastward along with a strong frontal
system. Precipitation chances should increase in the West with
this pattern and spread into the central U.S. once again by next
Monday through Wednesday, with the possibility of northern tier
snow and southern U.S. rain.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance shows good agreement overall with the large
scale pattern even through the middle of next week, with some
typical differences in the smaller scale details. To start the
period, the surface low/clipper over the Great Lakes and
upper-level energy supporting it have good consensus among 12/18Z
models. A less certain feature during this timeframe is a compact
shortwave tracking into the West ahead of the main larger scale
trough. Overall recent models have trended stronger with this
initial energy, with increasing consensus for a closed low likely
centered just west of California on Saturday. The GFS was the
slowest model to come to this conclusion (the 12Z had its low
displaced east and the 18Z run showed an open trough), but the 00Z
GFS does show a closed low in line with other guidance. Though
there is better agreement now, considering the small scale of the
low rounding the Pacific ridge, additional shifts in the forecast
are possible.

Then there is good agreement for energy to spill into the West and
develop troughing as next week begins, while much of the central
and eastern U.S. shifts to zonal flow and then ridging. 12/18Z GFS
runs remain among the strongest, specifically with closing off a
low within the trough even by early Sunday sinking into the
Pacific Northwest, while the 12Z CMC was slightly east with its
trough axis by around Tuesday compared to consensus. The phasing
differences with potential stream separation are causing minor
model differences that could continue to be an issue with the
evolution of the troughing. The ECMWF has been more consistent and
favored among the deterministic guidance, though both the 12Z and
new 00Z runs may be a bit slow with lingering energy across the
West by Wednesday. Despite these model differences, the theme of
troughing developing in the West for the first half of the week
slowly shifting eastward as well as sending northern stream energy
across the north-central U.S. by midweek is consistent.

The WPC forecast utilized a multi-model deterministic blend of the
12/18Z guidance for the early part of the period, slightly
favoring the ECMWF and CMC. Phased in some GEFS and ECMWF ensemble
mean guidance for the latter part of the period, ending up with
about half deterministic models and half means by day 7,
mitigating the individual model eccentricities. The main
difference from the previous WPC forecast was a continued trend
northward with the axis of heaviest QPF across the Mid-South
Monday-Wednesday of next week.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Lingering snow is forecast on Saturday across the Great Lakes
region with the clipper system, with generally light to perhaps
locally moderate amounts. Mainly dry conditions are expected
elsewhere on Saturday other than a few showers possible in
Florida, except that precipitation will be increasing in the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies with the upper trough
coming in. Coastal and valley rain and mountain snow are likely
over the Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the Great
Basin, and the Rockies through the early part of next week. Snow
could also spread farther east into the northern High Plains
Sunday and into the rest of the northern tier states as the first
half of the week progresses. The confidence in the axis of
heaviest snow and snowfall amounts remains somewhat low. Farther
south, moist inflow is forecast to return to the south-central and
southeastern U.S., increasing chances for rainfall that could
become heavy over the Mid-South in particular by Monday and
Tuesday.

Temperatures over the weekend are expected to be above normal for
parts of the West into the Plains, with the largest anomalies of
highs 20+ degrees above average over South Dakota and Nebraska.
Meanwhile, cooler to near average temperatures over the eastern
third of the country Saturday will warm Sunday. As the pattern
amplifies, the south-central U.S. to the East Coast will further
warm through the first half of next week, with widespread highs
10-20F and lows 20-30F above normal. Meanwhile, a cold Arctic high
is forecast to shift into the north-central U.S., leading to well
below average temperatures initially across the northern High
Plains and spreading southward through midweek. Temperatures in
some places could be 30 or more degrees below normal, and highs in
the single digits are expected for Montana and the Dakotas Monday
and Tuesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0105 AM CST Wed Feb 16 2022

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected once again this afternoon across
the southern High Plains. A surface low across western KS will
continue to consolidate through the afternoon as an upper-level
trough, currently over southern CA, approaches the region. Fire
weather concerns will increase on the western side of a sharpening
dryline where fuels have undergone considerable drying after very
dry/windy conditions on Tuesday.

...Southern High Plains...
Early-morning observations across central/southern NM show a dry
pocket with dewpoints in the single digits. This air mass is
expected to advect to the northeast into northeastern NM and the TX
Panhandle by afternoon, which should support widespread RH
reductions below 15% to the south of the surface low. Farther south
into west-central TX and the Trans Pecos region, weak moisture
advection is ongoing, but increasing southwesterly downslope winds
through the day should support sufficient drying for RH values to
fall to near 15%. Latest guidance continues to suggest strengthening
mid and upper-level winds will approach the region ahead of the
synoptic wave by early afternoon. Combined with strong diurnal
warming and deep boundary-layer mixing, wind gusts up to 40-50 mph
appear likely within the Critical area. A few gusts up to 60 mph
seem plausible across far southwest TX given nearly uni-directional
wind profiles up to 600-700 mb.

Although confidence is high in critical wind/RH along the TX/NM
border, the spatial extent of critical conditions remains somewhat
uncertain. A cold front moving south out of KS may limit the
northern extent of the threat, and the position of the dryline
across western OK and the Rolling Plains of TX will determine how
far east critical/elevated conditions can develop. Additionally,
scattered showers/thunderstorms may move into southern NM by late
afternoon, limiting the duration of the fire weather concern.
Further refinement of the risks areas is possible as hi-res guidance
comes into better agreement regarding these details.

...Heavy snow possible across parts of the central High Plains
today...

...Potential for a swath of disruptive snow and freezing rain to
extend from northern Oklahoma to southern Michigan on Thursday...

...Severe thunderstorms possible from the Southern Plains to the

Valleys and Southern Appalachians...

...Critical fire weather conditions forecast to continue across
portions of the southern High Plains today...

Over the next few days, a deep upper-level trough and its
associated cold front will continue to push south and east through
the southwestern and central U.S., producing a variety of
hazardous weather types. In the near term, this includes the
potential for heavy snow over parts of the central High Plains and
strong winds across portions of New Mexico and West Texas.
Scattered snow showers are expected to slowly sink southward this
morning from the Northern Rockies and eventually become more
widespread over the central High Plains by tonight as the
upper-level trough ejects into the Southern Plains. Locally heavy
snow, with amounts up to 8 inches, may impact areas along the
Front Range of Colorado. This includes Denver, CO and surrounding
regions, where Winter Storm Watches have been issued. Minor
accumulating snow is also anticipated across the Central Rockies
during this time frame. Farther south, strong southwesterly winds
are forecast ahead of an approaching cold front from southern New
Mexico to West Texas today. Maximum wind gusts may approach 75 mph
here, which will make travel difficult for high profile vehicles.
High Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories have been issued to
highlight the potential hazard. Additionally, the combination of
gusty winds and low relative humidity will lead to critical fire
weather conditions throughout the southern High Plains. Well above
average temperatures will also surge ahead of the cold front and
into the eastern half of the Nation. This will also allow for
plenty of atmospheric moisture content to flow out of the Gulf of
Mexico and set the stage for widespread shower and thunderstorm
activity beginning Wednesday night.

An area of low pressure is forecast to develop over the Texas
Panhandle and Oklahoma by Thursday morning before tracking
northeastward along an attached cold front as it advances across
the Mississippi Valley. As the advancing cold front clashes with
the warm and moist airmass Wednesday night, a line of
thunderstorms may develop across North Texas and Oklahoma. The
potential exists for storms to produce damaging wind gusts, large
hail, and isolated tornadoes in this region. The Storm Prediction
Center has maintained a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe
thunderstorms Wednesday evening through Thursday morning for North
Texas and central to eastern Oklahoma. The severe weather threat
is expected to shift eastward along the cold front and into parts
of the lower Mississippi Valley, Mid-South and Southeast on
Thursday. With plenty of moisture to work with, the threat of
heavy rain also exists from parts of the Southern Plains to the
Appalachians through Thursday night. There are expected to be two
main modes of heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding; the
first is associated with intense rainfall rates related to
thunderstorms and the second is related to widespread heavy rain
along the strong cold front. Both are expected to lead to widely
scattered flooding concerns. Thunderstorm-induced heavy rain is
most likely across the southernmost affected areas, particularly
from the southern Plains to the southern Appalachians between
Wednesday night and Thursday night. Farther north, flood watches
are in effect from portions of southern Missouri, central
Illinois, across much of Indiana into the eastern Great Lakes,
where the combination of longer duration heavy rain along with
melting snow is expected to cause flooding concerns. A Slight Risk
(level 2/4) of excessive rainfall is in effect from southern
Illinois to western New York, as well as over parts of the
Southern Appalachians on Thursday. These areas are expected to
have the greatest chances for scattered instances of flash
flooding.

On the cold side of the system, a swath of potentially heavy snow
is possible from northern Oklahoma to southern Michigan on
Thursday, with wintry weather also clipping the northern tip of
Maine by Friday morning. The location of the heaviest snowfall
remains uncertain, but areas that do see an extended period of
heavy snow could experience snowfall rates over 2 inches per hour
at times. Gusty winds will also accompany this system, which will
combine with snowfall to severely reduce visibility. A wintry mix,
including areas of sleet and freezing rain, will like fall just to
the south of the heaviest axis of snow. Winter Storms Watches are
in effect for the locations most likely to see significant
snowfall or a combination of snow and a wintry mix. This includes
far northern Oklahoma, eastern Kansas, northern-central Missouri,
north-central Illinois, northern Indiana, and southern Michigan.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE RIO GRANDE OF SOUTH TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough and attendant surface low currently over
southern CA and west KS (respectively) are forecast to quickly shift
into the OH River Valley by Thursday afternoon. In their wake, a
Pacific cold front will push eastward across TX towards the
northwestern Gulf. Breezy and dry post-frontal conditions will
support fire weather concerns across parts of southern TX.

...Southern Texas...
Although cooler temperatures are expected behind the Pacific front,
dry air off the southern Rockies will overspread central and South
TX. Scattered high clouds may meander across the region, but diurnal
warming should help warm temperature enough for RH reductions to
15-20% along the Rio Grande. Breezy northwesterly winds near 20 mph
should occasionally gust up to 25-30 mph as moderate mid-level winds
linger over the region. South TX should miss out on most
precipitation over the next 48 hours, which will maintain receptive
fuels and support elevated to critical fire weather conditions. The
duration of these conditions may be limited by the southward
progression of a stronger polar front, but at least 2-4 hours of
elevated/critical conditions seem likely.

...Southern California...
Building surface high pressure over the Great Basin and increasing
north/northeasterly mid-level flow should support increasing Santa
Ana winds for coastal southern CA. Winds gusting between 20-40 mph
are possible within the higher terrain and downslope warming/drying
may allow for areas of 15-20% RH. While localized elevated to
critical fire weather conditions are possible, most of the coastal
mountains/LA Basin received wetting rainfall over the past 24 hours
that likely mitigated fuel status. Fuels will be monitored over the
next day for a more robust fire weather concern.

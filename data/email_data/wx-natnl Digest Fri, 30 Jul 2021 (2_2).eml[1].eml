Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Fri Jul 30 2021 - 12Z Sun Aug 01 2021

...Strong to severe thunderstorms with locally heavy rain across
the northern Plains today and then toward the Midwest early on
Saturday...

...More monsoonal moisture expected across the interior western
U.S. with increasing focus over central Colorado and the northern
Great Basin during the weekend...

...Excessive heat/heat advisories continue for the interior
Pacific Northwest, central U.S. and Deep South while much cooler
air overspreads the Northeast/Great Lakes into the Mid-Atlantic...

A developing low pressure system currently near the New England
coast will move steadily eastward into the Canadian Maritimes
today, bringing much of the heavier rainfall away from New
England.  A large dome of cool air behind the low will usher
across the Great Lakes and overspread much of the Northeast and
down into the Mid-Atlantic during the weekend.  This will bring
welcome relief to the recent spell of summer heat and humidity
across these areas.  Before the arrival of the cool air mass
however, some showers and thunderstorms can be expected from
upstate New York to northern New England near and ahead of a
reinforcing cold front.  Much of the heat and tropical humidity
will be across the central Plains, the Deep South, and into the
Southeast today ahead of the trailing front.  A low pressure wave
developing over the central High Plains is forecast to trigger
organized thunderstorms that could become severe today across the
northern Plains before moving toward the Midwest today into
Saturday morning.  In addition, heavy rain associated with the
thunderstorms could trigger flash flooding.

Over the western U.S., a persistent ridge of high pressure aloft
will continue to sustain the excessive heat across interior
Pacific Northwest through the weekend.  Farther south, monsoonal
moisture continues to bring much needed rainfall to the
drought-stricken regions of the western U.S.  The broad area of
monsoonal showers and thunderstorms is expected to show increasing
focus across central Colorado as well as spreading further north
into the northern Great Basin during the weekend, where the threat
of heavy rainfall will increase.

Lastly, Air Quality Alerts are currently in effect for portions of
Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Minnesota, and Iowa due to
smoke from ongoing wildfires out west and in Canada being advected
into their areas by the prevailing northerly-northwesterly winds.

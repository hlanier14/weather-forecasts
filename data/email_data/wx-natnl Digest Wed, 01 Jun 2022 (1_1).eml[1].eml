Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1025 AM CDT Tue May 31 2022

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

A few minor adjustments based on current observations and expected
afternoon conditions. The forecast is on track otherwise. See the
previous discussion for more details.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Tue May 31 2022/

...Synopsis...
Within broad western US troughing, the main shortwave is forecast to
continues across the upper Midwest and into southern Canada
weakening overall troughing across the western CONUS. A second and
weaker wave embedded within the residual southwesterly flow will
pass over the central Rockies through the afternoon while a cold
front approaches. While flow aloft is forecast to gradually weaken
through the day, a few hours of gusty winds will likely remain
across NM and the southern High Pains supporting brief elevated fire
weather concerns.

...Northern New Mexico and southern Colorado...
Lingering mid-level flow behind the departing trough should support
gusty low-level winds near and south of a slow moving cold front
across the Four Corners and southern High Plains. Ahead of the
front, area soundings show a warm and well-mixed boundary layer with
RH of 10-20%. With surface winds expected to peak near 15-20 mph
elevated fire weather conditions appear possible through the
afternoon. Fire weather concerns will quickly subside later in the
evening with weakening winds and recovering humidity after the
frontal passage.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 31 2022

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure is expected to lead to a
continuation of above-normal temperatures and possible excessive heat
conditions across much of the southwestern and south-central U.S. during th=
e
period. Predicted surface low formation and accompanying frontal activity
favors above-normal, and possibly heavy precipitation over portions of the
east-central U.S. Springtime flooding remains a concern across the Red Rive=
r
of
the North and surrounding areas of northern Minnesota.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Central California Valley=
,
Desert Southwest and Southern Plains, Wed-Tue, Jun 8-14.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Great Plains,
Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and the Great Lakes, Thu-Sun, Jun =
9-
12.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North, northern
Minnesota, and much of the James River.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY JUNE 03 - TUESDAY JUNE 07:

ISBEYKk6PCU2dL3P80CJzIoF_Xz3sE$

FOR WEDNESDAY JUNE 08 - TUESDAY JUNE 14: There is fair agreement between th=
e
GEFS and ECMWF ensemble mean 500-hPa height forecasts this morning featurin=
g
anomalous ridging across the West and downstream troughing centered over th=
e
Midwest. One notable difference between the dynamical models concerns the
eastern extent of the anomalous ridging featured in the ensemble means earl=
y
in
the period, where the ECMWF favors a flatter ridge than the GEFS across the
southern tier of the U.S associated with more shortwave troughing energy
traversing the Pacific Northwest. As a result, the ECMWF (GEFS) maintains a
warmer solution over the south-central (western) CONUS in the uncalibrated =
and
calibrated reforecast guidance early in the period. Despite these differenc=
es,
above-normal temperatures are predominately favored over the lower latitude=
s
of
the U.S. with excessive heat conditions possibly emerging across the
southwestern and south-central CONUS later in June.



Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools generally depict a broad region
extending from the West Coast to the Southern Plains with at least a 20%
chance
of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 100 degrees F (>1=
05
degrees across the Desert Southwest) through the end of the period. Thus, a
broad slight risk area of excessive heat is posted for the entirety of week=
-2.
Moderate risk areas for excessive heat were considered over the West and
south-central CONUS given periods with higher probabilities (>40%) for maxi=
mum
temperatures reaching hazard thresholds in the reforecast tools. However,
these
elevated risk areas are omitted from the outlook at this time due to the
aforementioned differences in regards to the timing and strength of the
predicted mid-level ridge between the GEFS and ECMWF during the period.
Although ensembles and reforecast tools are less supportive of high wind
potential across the southwestern and south-central CONUS, the combination =
of
above-normal temperatures and drier than normal conditions are likely to
sustain an elevated wildfire potential in week-2.



Farther east, ensembles continue to show southerly return flow from the Gul=
f
of
Mexico to help provide ample available moisture conducive for above-normal
precipitation over the east-central CONUS. While both the ECMWF and GEFS
ensembles favor mid-level troughing centered over the Midwest to support
surface low formation and accompanying frontal activity, there is a good
amount
of disagreement in the raw guidance at the surface. The 0z ECMWF ensemble a=
nd
deterministic solution show a deepening surface low ejecting out of the Pla=
ins
early in the period, with increased precipitation amounts overspreading muc=
h
of
the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys by the middle of the period. Th=
e
GEFS is much less supportive of this realization, depicting much drier amou=
nts
throughout this portion of the country. These differences are also reflecte=
d
in
the reforecast tools, where the GEFS shows little to no potential for heavy
precipitation during the period. In contrast, the ECMWF shows a broad regio=
n
extending from the Great Plains to the Appalachians with at least a 20% cha=
nce
of 3-day precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 in=
ch
through the middle of the period. In consideration of the favorable synopti=
c
pattern for enhanced precipitation, and higher mean week-2 precipitation
forecast consolidation weights in the ECMWF than the GEFS over this portion=
 of
the country, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is issued for Jun 9-12.



Over the north-central CONUS, there is ongoing flooding in the Red River
Valley
of the North, neighboring parts of the James River basin, and northern
Minnesota due to antecedent above-normal precipitation and seasonal snowmel=
t.
Although more near-normal precipitation is favored during the next two week=
s
over these areas, any additional precipitation may exacerbate the saturated
grounds, and the corresponding flooding possible hazards remain posted for
week-2.



Across Alaska, above-normal temperatures are predominately favored througho=
ut
much of the Mainland during week-2, which may accelerate the rate of
springtime
snowmelt and ice-river breakup, and trigger localized flooding during the
period. Many of the rivers throughout the Mainland appear to be fully open,
with the exception of some frozen river sections in the Brooks Range and
Northern Slope regions.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Tue May 31 2022


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR JUNE 2022

The updated monthly temperature and precipitation outlooks for June 2022 ar=
e
based on the latest dynamical model guidance, WPC temperature and
precipitation
forecasts during the first week of the month, the CPC 6-10/8-14 day
temperature
and precipitation outlooks, and climate linkages to current soil moisture. =
The
GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means depict either another Kelvin wave or an emerg=
ing
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) propagating eastward over the Western
Hemisphere during early to mid-June which would maintain an elevated chance
for
tropical cyclone (TC) development across the western Caribbean Sea or south=
ern
Gulf of Mexico. Please refer to CPC=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs Global Trop=
ics Hazards for updates on
the
MJO along with TC development forecasts throughout June.



The most notable change to the previous June temperature outlook, released =
on
May 19, is the introduction of a favored area of below normal temperatures
from
the north-central CONUS westward to parts of the Pacific Northwest. The Arc=
tic
Oscillation (AO) index rapidly became negative during late May as positive
500-hPa heights developed over the higher latitudes of the Northern
Hemisphere.
This transition to a negative AO is likely to contribute towards below-norm=
al
temperatures for the northern tier of the CONUS during the first two weeks =
of
June. The GEFS and ECMWF week 3-4 temperature outlooks support a continuati=
on
of the cooler-than-normal temperatures for the Pacific Northwest, northern
Rockies, and northern Great Plains through late June. High soil moisture
(above
the 90th percentile) across the Red River Valley of the North was also a
factor
for increasing probabilities to above 50 percent for below-normal
temperatures.
Temperature tools at all time scales throughout June generally predict
above-normal temperatures across the southern tier of the CONUS, California=
,
and along the East Coast. The largest probabilities (above 60 percent) of
above-normal temperatures coincide with the lowest soil moisture across
eastern
New Mexico and western Texas and are also consistent with temperature tools
during early to mid-June.



As of May 31, model solutions remain consistent that there is an increased
chance of an early season TC forming across the northwestern Caribbean Sea =
or
southeastern Gulf of Mexico during the first few days of June. Given the mo=
st
likely track of this potential TC northeastward and WPC 7-day rainfall amou=
nts
of more than 5 inches, probabilities for above-normal precipitation exceed =
60
percent across south Florida. Above-normal precipitation is favored for par=
ts
of the south-central Great Plains eastward to the middle Mississippi Valley
due
to  periods of moderate to heavy rainfall during the first week of June and
favored near to above-normal precipitation associated with northwest flow
aloft
along a thermal gradient, through mid-June. Although there is expected to b=
e a
favorable pattern for episodes of convective rainfall for the northern Grea=
t
Plains, equal chances (EC) of below, near, or above-normal precipitation ar=
e
forecast since the storm track is expected to be displaced southward to sta=
rt
the month. The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means depict a longwave trough over =
the
northeastern Pacific for much of June which favors above-normal precipitati=
on
across parts of the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies. Due to predicte=
d
anomalous 500-hPa ridging for much of June, probabilities for below-normal
precipitation are slightly elevated for parts of the Great Basin, Southwest=
,
and western to central Texas. Based on the expectation of a variable
precipitation pattern during early to mid-June, mixed signals among the wee=
k
3-4 guidance, and inherent uncertainty spatially with convective rainfall, =
EC
is forecast for the precipitation outlook across the Corn Belt and much of =
the
eastern CONUS.



Ensemble means depict above normal 500-hPa heights persisting over Alaska
through mid to late June, favoring above normal temperatures for the state.=
 A
mean 500-hPa trough over the northeastern Pacific and week-2 precipitation
tools support a slight lean towards above-normal precipitation for the Alas=
ka
Panhandle. Based on a likely dry start to the month and good consistently
among
daily CFS model runs, below-normal precipitation is favored for western
Mainland Alaska.



********* Previous discussion, released on May 19, is below ***************



The June 2022 temperature and precipitation outlooks are based on dynamical
model guidance (including the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) an=
d
the week 3-4 model solutions), statistical tools, current soil moisture
conditions, and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites. The Madden-Julian Osci=
llation (MJO)
remains
weak as multiple Kelvin waves (KWs) continue to propagate rapidly eastward
over
the global tropics. The MJO is not expected to provide any significant
influence on the mid-latitude circulation pattern across North America duri=
ng
June. However, the passage of KWs over the Western Hemisphere from late May
into June and its potential contribution to the development of an early sea=
son
tropical cyclone across the western Caribbean Sea was considered as a facto=
r
in
the precipitation outlook.



During early to mid-May, anomalous 500-hPa ridging resulted in much above
normal temperatures throughout the southern Great Plains with positive
anomalies of more than 6 degrees F across the western half of Texas. Althou=
gh
there could be brief periods of weakening of this subtropical riding, ensem=
ble
means depict the anomalous 500-hPa ridging over the southern tier of the CO=
NUS
likely persisting through the first half of June. Based on good agreement
among
dynamical and statistical tools, above-normal temperatures are favored acro=
ss
the southern two-thirds of the CONUS. The largest probabilities (above 60
percent) are forecast for western Texas and New Mexico, coinciding with the
lowest soil moisture. Conversely, anomalously wet soil moisture was one rea=
son
for equal chances (EC) of below, near, or above-normal temperatures across
much
of the northern Great Plains and upper Mississippi Valley. Also, the
calibrated
NMME supports EC for the northern tier of the CONUS. The EC forecast along
much
of the West Coast was due in part to negative sea surface temperature
anomalies
nearby. The week 3-4 tools, covering the first two weeks of June, along wit=
h
most of the inputs to the NMME support slightly elevated probabilities of
below
normal temperatures across western parts of Oregon and Washington along wit=
h
the Alaska Panhandle. Due to conflicting and weak signals among the tools, =
EC
is forecast for the remainder of Alaska.



The NMME supports elevated probabilities of below-normal precipitation acro=
ss
much of the central to southern Great Plains, extending westward to parts o=
f
the Great Basin, Pacific Northwest, and northern California. The slightly
larger probabilities, focused from southern Wyoming southward to the Texas
Panhandle, was due to La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites and week 3-4 tool=
s. Since June is
typically a dry time of year for southern California and the desert Southwe=
st,
EC was forecast for these areas. Regardless of any effects from a potential
early season tropical cyclone, the GEFS and ECMWF models depict broad
upper-level divergence over the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent areas of the
northern Gulf Coast and Florida during early to mid-June. This is expected =
to
promote enhanced sea breeze convection. Based on this expectation and suppo=
rt
from the NMME, above-normal precipitation is slightly favored for Florida a=
nd
areas along and close to the northern Gulf Coast. For the remainder of the
eastern and northern tier of the CONUS and Alaska, a large area of EC was
necessary in the June precipitation outlook due to weak signals among the
dynamical model solutions. This large coverage of EC and prospects for an
early
season TC, potentially emerging from the western Caribbean Sea, will be
reevaluated with the updated June outlook, released on May 31.

As mid-level western US troughing weakens ahead of shortwave ridging
developing along the West Coast, flow aloft over the Southwestern US
is forecast to slacken. At the surface, a cool upslope post-frontal
airmass should support large humidity recoveries and light winds
unsupportive of widespread fire weather concerns. The increase in
moisture may support isolated thunderstorm potential in the
afternoon along the eastern edge of the higher terrain. While a few
lightning strikes will be possible, relatively high PWATS and
limited storm coverage will be largely unsupportive of dry thunder
potential.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue May 31 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 06 - 10 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. An amplified longwave trough and associated below normal
500-hPa heights are predicted over the North Pacific. Weak ridging and
positive
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over the southwestern CONUS. Troughin=
g
with below normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over the western Great Lake=
s
region. Ridging and associated above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast ov=
er
much of Alaska.

Troughing and near to below normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased odds o=
f
below normal temperatures over the Pacific Northwest extending eastward to =
the
Northern and Central Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, and the
Great
Lakes region. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are elevated for t=
he
southern tier of the CONUS due to predicted low amplitude 500-hPa flow and
near
to above normal heights, and consistent with the consolidation temperature
forecast tool. Above normal temperatures are favored over Alaska under
predicted ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights.

Predicted enhanced Pacific flow over the Pacific Northwest coupled with
forecast  cyclonic flow farther to the east over the eastern CONUS lead to
increased chances of near to above normal precipitation over most of the
northern tier of the CONUS. Below normal precipitation is likely for parts =
of
the Great Central Basin, Southern Rockies, and Southern Plains due to the
forecast ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights,  and consistent with the
consolidation precipitation forecast tool. Near to above normal precipitati=
on
is slightly favored for Alaska, consistent with dynamical model precipitati=
on
tools.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 34% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 33% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 33% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and in
the
forecast temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 08 - 14 2022

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement on th=
e
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
A 500-hPa trough and below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast south of the
Aleutian Islands. A ridge with above normal 500-hPa heights is predicted ov=
er
the western CONUS, while a trough and associated below normal mid-level
heights
are forecast over most of the central and eastern CONUS. Above normal 500-h=
Pa
heights are predicted over much of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, while
near to below normal 500-Hpa heights are forecast over the Alaska Panhandle=
.

Troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased odds of below
normal temperatures over parts of the Pacific Northwest extending eastward =
to
the Northern and Central Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, and t=
he
Great Lakes region. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are elevated
for
the southern tier of the CONUS due to predicted near to above normal 500-hP=
a
heights and low amplitude flow over the region, consistent with the
consolidation temperature forecast tool. Above normal temperatures are favo=
red
over most of Alaska under ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights.

A ridge and above normal 500-hPa heights increase the likelihood of near to
below normal precipitation over parts of the Southern Plains and most of th=
e
western CONUS, except for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Northern Great Ba=
sin
and Northern Rockies, where slightly elevated odds of above normal
precipitation is indicated. Predicted troughing over the eastern CONUS lead=
s
to
increased chances of near to above normal precipitation over the eastern
CONUS,
consistent with the consolidation precipitation forecast tool. Below normal
precipitation is slightly favored for western Aleutians, while above normal
precipitation is likely over the Alaska Panhandle, consistent with GEFS and
ECMWF calibrated reforecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 33% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 33% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 34% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and in
the
forecast temperature and precipitation tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on

...Heavy rain threat increasing over Florida due to tropical
moisture inflow and a possibly forming tropical system...


...Overview...

While the overall pattern across much of the lower 48 will remain
fairly stagnant late week into early next week, with West Coast
troughing and a south-central Canada upper low sending some low
amplitude troughing across the central to eastern U.S. But the
main notable feature to watch during the medium range period will
be the possibility for a tropical cyclone to develop over the
northwestern Caribbean Sea/southeastern Gulf of Mexico partially
from energy from what is currently Tropical Storm Agatha over
Mexico. At this time, a low track northeastward near or over the
Florida Peninsula is possible, but with fairly low confidence in
the track, timing, and strength of a tropical system. Regardless,
heavy rain is possible late week into the weekend with substantial
moisture streaming ahead of this potential system and then near
its possible eventual track.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The latest model guidance appears to be in modest agreement as to
the general synoptic pattern through the medium range period with
some notable differences toward early next week. Deterministic
models seem to suggest a more progressive system in the
Gulf/Caribbean this weekend with the 00z CMC being an even faster
outlier with the axis of precipitation. A general deterministic
model blend of the 00z EC/UK/CMC and 06z GFS was applied on
Friday. The 00z UK was replaced by the 00z ECE on Saturday due to
better handling of the low over the Florida peninsula. The 00z
CMCE was introduced on Sunday followed by a more probabilistic
blend through Tuesday. The 00z EC weighting was reduced on Sunday
and Monday then removed on day 7 due to the fact that it was the
only bit of guidance with a closed low moving through the western
Atlantic. Ensemble guidance does a good job of capturing the
trough associated with the potential tropical system through next
Tuesday.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Tropical Storm Agatha has currently moved into Mexico and will
weaken quickly over unfavorable terrain there. But its associated
deep tropical moisture will stream into southern Florida Friday,
increasing the likelihood of rain and thunderstorms becoming more
frequent and widespread, first ahead of the remnant disturbance
and then with the potential for a tropical low to develop
(possibly partially from Agatha's remnants) and track over or near
the state. Moisture aloft from the far eastern Pacific and lower
level moisture from the Caribbean should lead to heavy rainfall,
even if the system's timing is in question. Even in the cyclone's
wake, its convergent tail appears to be stuck in the vicinity of
South Florida and the Keys, keeping the threat of moderate to
heavy rainfall in play into early next week. Slight Risks are in
place in WPC's experimental Days 4 and 5 Excessive Rainfall
Outlook.

Elsewhere, rain chances are expected to increase in the Northwest
late week into the weekend given the trough axis near the West
Coast and onshore flow. However, the Southwest should remain dry
and hot, with Death Valley expected to meet or exceed 110F high
temperatures this weekend into early next week. Farther east,
fronts are expected to spark rounds of showers and thunderstorms
across the central and eastern U.S., with the Carolinas an area of
focus on Friday and parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley
seeing convection Friday into the weekend and early next week as
fronts meander there. There are increasing probabilities of an
axis of heavy rainfall developing over parts of the Central Plains
and Middle/Upper Mississippi Valley on Sunday.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the more amplified
short range period should produce lesser temperature anomalies
late this week into early next week. Cooler than average spots
will be across the central/southern Plains Friday with rain cooled
air, but should switch to above normal in Texas by 10-15F by early
next week. Periodic troughing in the northern tier should lead to
slightly below average temperatures by around 10F. The western
U.S. could be warmer than normal by 5-10F late in the workweek but
cooler temperatures are forecast by the weekend under the
troughing influence and as a cold front moves through the area.

...Frontal system moving southward across eastern and central
portions of the country will continue to drive the threat for
severe weather and heavy rainfall...

...Much cooler temperatures to arrive across the Plains and
Midwest through the middle of the week while heat and humidity
increase across the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic...

...Some scattered showers expected but mostly tranquil, seasonal
conditions west of the Rockies...

Warm, moist air ahead of a cold front moving south and eastward
through central and eastern portions of the country will continue
to fuel widespread showers and thunderstorms along with the threat
for severe weather and some flash flooding through the short-term
forecast period (Thursday evening). Storms will stretch through
the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Mid-Mississippi Valley, and into the
Central and Southern Plains on Wednesday, spreading further into
the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Lower-Mississippi Valley
Thursday. Instances of severe weather and flash flooding are
expected to occur with some of the storms. The Storm Prediction
Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe storms for
portions of the Interior Northeast and Upper Ohio Valley for the
chance of strong, gusty winds. Another Slight Risk has been issued
for southwestern Oklahoma through northwestern Texas and portions
of the Texas Panhandle where storms are also expected to produce
some strong, gusty winds as well as carry the risk for large hail
and perhaps a tornado. The risk for severe weather transitions to
portions of the southern Mid-Atlantic Thursday where there is a
Slight Risk for gusty winds and isolated large hail. In addition
to the threat for severe weather, there is a Slight Risk (level
2/4) of Excessive Rainfall across portions of Oklahoma Wednesday.
Slow moving storms are forecast to continue over areas that saw
heavy rainfall Tuesday leading to the risk of flash flooding. The
widespread nature of the storms as well as the generally slow
movement of the front may lead to localized instances of heavy
rainfall outside of the Slight Risk area.

Meanwhile, in the Northeast, a stubborn backdoor cold front
sliding southwestward will also continue to trigger scattered
showers and thunderstorms across New York and most of New England.
Tempeartures will be cooler than normal behind the front,
particularly across central and northern New England where highs
will be mostly in the 60s Wednesday and Thursday.

Temperatures will also be quite cool behind the cold front across
the Plains and Midwest for early June. Highs across the Central
High Plains will struggle to get out of the 50s on Wednesday with
60s expected elsewhere through the Upper Midwest and most of the
Plains outside of Texas and southern Oklahoma.  In contrast, ahead
of the front, temperatures will be quite warm with highs generally
in the 90s. These temperatures will be particularly above normal
for the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic where increasing humidity will
also lead to quite steamy, mid-summer conditions.

In the West, a ridge of high pressure will build aloft leading to
mostly tranquil and seasonal conditions. Temperatures will be
within about 10 degrees of normal. Daytime highs are forecast to
be in the 70s in the Pacific Northwest, the 80s for western
portions of the Great Basin, and the low 100s in the Desert
Southwest. Highs in the eastern Great Basin will warm up from the
70s Wednesday into the 80s Thursday as the ridge shifts a bit
eastward. One exception to these conditions will be the Central
Rockies where scattered showers and thunderstorms, as well as a
chance for higher elevation snow, will linger as a shortwave
passes through. The Pacific Northwest will also see shower and
thunderstorm chances increase later Thursday as a Pacific storm
system approaches the region.

...Heavy rain threat over Florida due to tropical moisture inflow
and a possibly forming tropical system...


...Overview...

One notable feature to watch this weekend will be the possibility
for a tropical cyclone to develop over the northwestern Caribbean
Sea/southeastern Gulf of Mexico partially from energy from what
was Agatha in the eastern Pacific which has now dissipated over
Mexico. The National Hurricane Center currently shows a high
chance for a tropical cyclone to develop, and its most likely
track would be northeastward near or over the Florida Peninsula
around Saturday and then deepening as it goes into the western
Atlantic. Though the exact timing for development and the track
are uncertain, heavy rain will be a threat across southern Florida
regardless. Farther north, fairly flat flow is forecast over the
lower 48, but with shortwaves and surface frontal boundaries
providing foci for thunderstorms and potential for heavy rainfall
over much of the central U.S.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Regarding the possibly forming tropical cyclone, model guidance
shows considerable variations on when it would form during the
short range period, as an elongated area of energy and low
pressure is present across the Bay of Campeche/Yucatan/western
Caribbean Sea with questions as to how multiple features could
consolidate into a tropical depression or storm. During the medium
range period, models have continued with a faster trend for the
track of the tropical low, reaching and quickly crossing the
Florida Peninsula around Saturday. GFS runs have been on the
southern side with the low track, but have trended northward with
the 18Z run and the newer 00Z run, which is closer to the
ECMWF/UKMET runs. The latter cluster with a slightly more northern
track is what the WPC/NHC collaborated forecast has been leaning
toward. Models continue to indicate strengthening as it ejects
northeastward in the western Atlantic and away from land, but with
north/south spread (the ECMWF stays the farthest north).

Across the rest of the CONUS, good model agreement is seen over
the weekend with the general synoptic pattern, including an upper
low off British Columbia producing troughing across the West Coast
and a persistent south-central Canada upper low, but with more
variation and thus less certainty in smaller-scale shortwaves that
could help drive frontal positions and locations of enhanced
convection. But during the workweek, these differences increase as
there is potential for energy stemming from the western low to
possibly interact with and join with the Canada low. This
interaction is indicated by GFS runs in particular, but ECMWF and
CMC runs maintain some low amplitude ridging in between the
features through Tuesday. There is considerable spread in the
ensemble members with the wiggles of the pattern so confidence is
low. But overall the 12/18Z GFS runs seemed too quick to merge the
features and preferred the ECMWF and CMC and those models'
ensemble means instead.

The WPC forecast began with a blend of 12/18Z deterministic
guidance, but with lessening influence from the GFS suite as the
period progressed while adding and increasing the proportion of
the EC and CMC ensemble means.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Regardless of the timing of development of a tropical system, deep
tropical moisture is forecast to stream into southern Florida and
cause the possibility for heavy rainfall and flash flooding
particularly through Saturday, with some possibility of heavy rain
in central/northern Florida as well. A Slight Risk is in place in
WPC's experimental Day 4 Excessive Rainfall Outlook. Gusty winds
could also be a threat if the tropical system develops, with
stronger winds for a tropical storm than a tropical depression (by
definition). Lingering convergence across South Florida and the
Keys could promote additional rain and thunderstorms there through
at least the first half of next week.

Elsewhere, rain chances are expected to increase in the Northwest
into the weekend given the trough axis near the West Coast and
onshore flow. However, the Southwest should remain dry and hot,
with Death Valley expected to meet or exceed 110F high
temperatures this weekend into early next week. Farther east,
fronts are expected to spark rounds of showers and thunderstorms
across the central and eastern U.S., with parts of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley seeing convection over the weekend and early
next week as fronts meander there. The axes of enhanced rainfall
will be highly dependent on where individual boundaries set up,
and it could take into the short range to resolve these
differences between models on placement of excessive rainfall, but
the ingredients are in place for heavy rainfall in some areas
across the central U.S. into early next week. Some showers and
thunderstorms could press into the eastern U.S. Monday-Wednesday
ahead of a cold front.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the more amplified
short range period should produce lesser temperature anomalies
this weekend into the first half of next week. Periodic troughing
in the northern tier should lead to slightly below average
temperatures by around 10F. Meanwhile much of the southern tier
can expect above normal temperatures by around 5-10F but reaching
+15F anomalies in Texas early next week. The West Coast should be
a bit cooler than normal over the weekend under the troughing
influence, but moderating and warming to above normal in
California by around midweek.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the somewhat more
amplified short range period should produce lesser temperature
anomalies this weekend into the first half of next week. Periodic
troughing in the northern tier should lead to slightly below
average temperatures by around 10F. Meanwhile much of the southern
tier can expect above normal temperatures by around 5-10F but
reaching +15F anomalies in Texas early next week. The West Coast
should be a bit cooler than normal over the weekend under the
troughing influence, but moderating and warming to above normal in
California by around midweek.

...Heavy rain threat over Florida due to tropical moisture inflow
and a possibly forming tropical system...


...Overview...

One notable feature to watch this weekend will be the possibility
for a tropical cyclone to develop over the northwestern Caribbean
Sea/southeastern Gulf of Mexico partially from energy from what
was Agatha in the eastern Pacific (which has now dissipated over
Mexico). The National Hurricane Center currently shows a high
chance for a tropical cyclone to develop, and its most likely
track would be northeastward near or over the Florida Peninsula
around Saturday and then deepening as it goes into the western
Atlantic. Though the exact timing for development and the track
are uncertain, heavy rain will be a threat across southern Florida
regardless. Farther north, fairly flat flow is forecast over the
lower 48, but with shortwaves and surface frontal boundaries
providing foci for thunderstorms and potential for heavy rainfall
over much of the central CONUS.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Regarding the possibly forming tropical cyclone, model guidance
shows considerable variations on when it would form during the
short range period, as an elongated area of energy and low
pressure is present across the Bay of Campeche/Yucatan/western
Caribbean Sea with questions as to how multiple features could
consolidate into a tropical depression or storm. During the medium
range period, models have continued with a faster trend for the
track of the tropical low, reaching and quickly crossing the
Florida Peninsula around Saturday. GFS runs have been on the
southern side with the low track, but have trended northward with
the 18Z run and the newer 00Z run, and thus closer to the
ECMWF/UKMET runs. The latter cluster with a slightly more northern
track is what the WPC/NHC collaborated forecast has been leaning
toward. Models continue to indicate strengthening as it ejects
northeastward in the western Atlantic and away from land, but with
north/south spread (the ECMWF stays the farthest north).

Across the rest of the CONUS, good model agreement is seen over
the weekend with the general synoptic pattern, including an upper
low off British Columbia producing troughing across the West Coast
and a persistent south-central Canada upper low, but with more
variation and thus less certainty in smaller-scale shortwaves that
could help drive frontal positions and locations of enhanced
convection. But these differences increase by Monday-Tuesday as
there is potential for energy stemming from the western low to
possibly interact with and join with the Canada low. This
interaction causing the formation of a slightly deeper central
U.S. trough is indicated by GFS runs in particular, but ECMWF and
CMC runs maintain some low amplitude ridging in between the
features through Tuesday. There is considerable spread in the
ensemble members with the wiggles of the pattern, so confidence is
low. But overall the 12/18Z GFS runs seemed too quick to merge the
features and preferred the ECMWF and CMC and those models'
ensemble means instead.

The WPC forecast began with a blend of 12/18Z deterministic
guidance, but with lessening influence from the GFS suite as the
period progressed while adding in and increasing the proportion of
the EC and CMC ensemble means.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Regardless of the timing of development of a tropical system, deep
tropical moisture is forecast to stream into southern Florida and
cause the possibility for heavy rainfall and flash flooding
particularly through Saturday, with some possibility of heavy rain
in central/northern Florida as well. A Slight Risk is in place in
WPC's experimental Day 4 Excessive Rainfall Outlook for the
southern Florida Peninsula. Gusty winds could also be a threat if
the tropical system develops, with stronger winds for a tropical
storm than a tropical depression (by definition). Lingering
convergence across South Florida and the Keys could promote
additional rain and thunderstorms there through at least the first
half of next week.

Elsewhere, rain chances are expected to increase in the Northwest
into the weekend given the trough axis near the West Coast and
moist onshore flow. However, the Southwest should remain dry and
hot, with Death Valley expected to meet or exceed 110F high
temperatures this weekend into early next week. Farther east,
fronts are expected to spark rounds of showers and thunderstorms
across the central and eastern U.S., with parts of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley seeing convection over the weekend and early
next week as fronts meander there. The axes of enhanced rainfall
will be highly dependent on where individual boundaries set up,
and it could take into the short range to resolve these
differences between models on placement of excessive rainfall, but
the ingredients are certainly in place for heavy rainfall in some
areas across the central U.S. into early next week. Some showers
and thunderstorms could press into the eastern U.S.
Monday-Wednesday ahead of a cold front.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the somewhat more
amplified short range period should produce lesser temperature
anomalies this weekend into the first half of next week. Periodic
troughing in the northern tier should lead to slightly below
average temperatures by around 10F. Meanwhile much of the southern
tier can expect above normal temperatures by around 5-10F but
reaching +15F anomalies in Texas early next week. The West Coast
should be a bit cooler than normal over the weekend under the
troughing influence, but moderating and warming to above normal in
California by around midweek.

...A frontal system advancing southeast across the central and
eastern U.S. will continue to drive the threat for severe weather
and heavy rainfall...

...Cooler temperatures to over the Plains and Midwest will slowly
advance toward the eastern U.S. by later this week...

...Some scattered showers expected but mostly tranquil, seasonal
conditions to continue west of the Rockies...

A very warm, moist, and unstable airmass ahead of a cold front
moving southeast through central and eastern portions of the
country will again set the stage for widespread showers and
thunderstorms along with the threat for severe weather and some
flash flooding heading through the end of the week. In fact, the
Storm Prediction Center has highlighted parts of the southern
Plains, Ozarks, Ohio Valley, lower Great Lakes, and central to
northern Appalachians with a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
for today and tonight as this cold front approaches and slowly
crosses the region. Large hail and damaging winds will be the main
concerns with these areas of stronger thunderstorms. Locally heavy
rainfall is also expected, and locally a few inches of rain will
be possible. The heaviest amounts today should be across areas of
west-central to northern Texas, and across central and southern
Oklahoma. The Weather Prediction Center has depicted a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall across this region, and some flash flooding
will be possible where these heavy concentrations of showers and
thunderstorms occur.

On Thursday, the biggest threat area for severe weather and heavy
rain will shift to the Mid-Atlantic states. The Storm Prediction
Center does currently have a Slight Risk of severe weather
depicted here with concerns for thunderstorms producing damaging
wind gusts. An isolated concern for some flash flooding will be
possible too from these storms producing heavy rainfall.

Meanwhile, in the Northeast, a stubborn backdoor cold front
sliding southwestward will also continue to trigger scattered
showers and thunderstorms across New York and most of New England.
Temperatures will be cooler than normal behind the front,
particularly across central and northern New England where highs
will be mostly in the 60s today and Thursday. This will contrast
to adjacent areas of the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast
where temperatures will be well above normal and reaching well
through the 80s and locally into the 90s today. However, the cold
front approaching the region from the west, and along with the
threat of rain, will set the stage for cooler temperatures for the
latter part of the week.

Over the West, a ridge of high pressure will build aloft leading
to mostly tranquil and seasonal conditions. Temperatures will be
within about 10 degrees of normal. Daytime highs are forecast to
be in the 70s in the Pacific Northwest, the 80s for western
portions of the Great Basin, and the low 100s in the Desert
Southwest. Highs in the eastern Great Basin will warm up from the
70s today into the 80s Thursday as the ridge shifts a bit
eastward. One exception to these conditions will be the Central
Rockies where scattered showers and thunderstorms, as well as a
chance for higher elevation snow, will linger today as an upper
trough passes through. The Pacific Northwest will also see shower
and thunderstorm chances increase later Thursday as a Pacific
storm system approaches the region.

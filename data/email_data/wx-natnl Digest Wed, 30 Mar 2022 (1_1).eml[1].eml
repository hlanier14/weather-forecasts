NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1111 AM CDT Tue Mar 29 2022

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE TEXAS
PANHANDLE...THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE AND FAR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...AND
SOUTHWEST KANSAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THE SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS INTO NORTHERN KANSAS...

***DANGEROUS FIRE-WEATHER OUTBREAK EXPECTED ACROSS PARTS OF THE
SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS THROUGH THIS EVENING***

The previous forecast remains on track, and only minor
changes/expansions were made with this update. The latest surface
observations across the TX/OK Panhandles into southwest KS show
sustained southwesterly surface winds of 30-40 mph with gusts of
45-50 mph amid 15-20 percent RH. At the same time, low/mid-level
water vapor imagery depicts a deep/pronounced dry slot associated
with a strong midlevel speed maximum overspreading the risk area,
which will continue to support mostly clear skies and additional RH
reductions into the lower teens this afternoon. These conditions,
combined with sufficiently dry fuels, are promoting a dangerous
wildfire-spread threat. In fact, shortwave IR imagery already shows
multiple hot spots emerging across the TX/OK Panhandles and
southwest KS -- indicating ongoing wildfires where the strongest
winds and driest conditions are developing. For additional details
on the dangerous fire-weather threat across parts of the southern
and central Plains, see the previous discussion below.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0116 AM CDT Tue Mar 29 2022/

...Synopsis...
...A Significant Wildfire Outbreak is Likely Across the Southern
High Plains...

A strong upper-level jet streak will advance from the Southwest into
the southern High Plains today. The core of this jet streak will
extend from southeast New Mexico into southwest Kansas this
afternoon with 500mb flow from 70 to 90 knots. In addition, a strong
surface low will deepen across western Kansas and move into northern
Kansas by this evening. This surface low will lead to strong surface
winds in excess of 20 mph for most of the southern and Central
Plains. Even stronger winds are expected beneath this mid-level jet
streak. This jet streak will clear any residual cloud cover as it
ejects into the Plains, which will allow for strong surface heating
at the surface. The environment across the TX Panhandle has very
poor relative-humidity recovery this morning and the airmass remains
well mixed. Therefore, it won't take much heating for very deep
mixing to occur and for some of this stronger flow to reach the
surface. Sustained winds in excess of 30 mph may begin by
mid-morning with increasing winds and lowering relative humidity
through the day. By the afternoon, a broad region of 12 to 18
percent relative humidity and sustained winds of 35 to 40 mph with
gusts 65 to 70 mph are expected from the Texas Panhandle into
central Kansas. Extremely critical meteorological conditions will
likely extend as far as north-central Kansas, but fuels are somewhat
less favorable with northern and eastern extent.

Expanded the elevated delineation as far east as 40 to 45 percent
relative humidity. Despite the higher relative humidity, winds will
be sustained 25 to 30 mph. Numerous fires have occurred in the past
48 hours, indicating fuels are sufficiently dry for large fire
spread.

A cold front will move through the extremely critical area between
06 and 10Z, which will lead to a 90 degree wind shift from southwest
to northwest. This will likely have a significant impact on any
ongoing fires, especially considering sustained winds of 25 to 30
mph are expected in the post-frontal airmass.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 29 2022

SYNOPSIS: A strong storm system is forecast to move northeastward from the
Mississippi Valley toward the Great Lakes and Northeast during the first ha=
lf
of week-2, bringing the increased risk for heavy rainfall and high winds
across
parts of the eastern U.S. An increased potential for river flooding is also
possible across parts of the southern Mississippi Valley and parts of the
Southeast. The high wind threat will continue in the days following the
passage
of this storm system, as strong northwesterly winds will usher in colder ai=
r
across parts of the eastern lower 48 during the middle of week-2. Across th=
e
Northern Tier states, a low pressure system could bring high winds to parts=
 of
the Northern Plains early in the period. Farther east, snow melt coupled wi=
th
daytime high temperatures remaining near or above freezing throughout week-=
2
increases the risk of flooding near the Red River along the Minnesota-North
Dakota border. In Alaska, a strong storm system in the Gulf of Alaska early=
 in
week-2 is likely to bring high winds to parts of the Panhandle.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for parts of the eastern half=
 of
the CONUS, Sat-Sun, Apr 9-10.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of the southeastern U.S. and
Mid-Atlantic, Wed-Thu, Apr 6-7.

Slight risk of high winds for the Northern Plains, Wed-Thu, Apr 6-7.

Slight risk of high winds for much of the eastern U.S., Wed-Sun, Apr 6-10.

Slight risk of high winds for the Alaska Panhandle, Wed-Thu, Apr 6-7.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible in the Lower Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southeas=
t.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 01 - TUESDAY APRIL 05:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=

B4lNbigSUl3$

FOR WEDNESDAY APRIL 06 - TUESDAY APRIL 12: There is good model agreement
indicating the amplification of mid-level low pressure over the east-centra=
l
CONUS near the beginning of week-2. However, there is some uncertainty
regarding the evolution of the long-wave pattern during the first half of t=
he
period with respect to the strength of the mid-level features, as the ECMWF
ensemble long-wave pattern is slightly more amplified than the GEFS, with t=
he
Canadian falling somewhere in between. Despite these differences, the eastw=
ard
progression of the pattern lines up better in the models, relative to
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs week-2 outlook. Additionally, the sur=
face temperature and
precipitation fields remain in decent agreement with respect to regions whe=
re
the most hazardous conditions may occur. As the storm system over the
east-central CONUS moves eastward during the first half of the period, heav=
y
rainfall is expected along a trailing frontal boundary across portions of t=
he
eastern CONUS, east of the Mississippi River. A slight risk of heavy
precipitation is posted Apr 6-7 across eastern parts of the Lower Mississip=
pi
Valley, much of the Southeast, and the Mid-Atlantic. The GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance for rainfall to exce=
ed
the 85th percentile of the historical distribution across highlighted sligh=
t
risk areas, with several locations also likely to receive at least 1 inch
during the first two days of week-2. The GEFS and Canadian raw ensemble
guidance indicate the potential for some locations to receive in excess of =
1.5
inches of rainfall for some locations.



Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions depict a more amplified s=
urface low pressure over
the
eastern U.S. early in the period, relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.
Given the increased amplification of this feature in the models, strong
southerly flow is more likely to accompany this surface low pressure system
ahead of its trailing frontal boundary, mainly across the Appalachians and
Eastern Seaboard. As the storm exits the eastern U.S. during the middle of =
the
period, strong northwesterly winds are likely in the days that follow acros=
s
an
area spanning from the Middle Mississippi Valley to the Eastern Seaboard.
Given
the wind risks at various locations during much of the period, a broad slig=
ht
risk of high winds is posted for much of the eastern U.S. from the Mississi=
ppi
Valley to the East Coast Apr 6-10, associated with the passage of the storm
system through the middle of the period. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tool=
s
support this potential, depicting at least a 20 percent chance of wind spee=
ds
exceeding the 85th percentile of the climatological distribution during and
following the passage of this system.



In addition to the potential for high winds, cold air is also forecast in t=
he
days following the passage of the surface low. Therefore, a slight risk of
much
below-normal temperatures is posted Apr 9-10 across parts of the Southeast,
the
Ozarks, and the Middle Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys. GEFS and
ECMWF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance of minimum temperatu=
res
falling below the 15th percentile of the historical distribution and 40=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF.
These tools also indicate some areas of the Ohio River Valley having at lea=
st
a
20 percent chance of sub-freezing minimum temperatures during this time. A
slight risk of high winds is also issued for parts of the Northern Plains A=
pr
6-7, associated with a surface low progressing across southern Canada,
enhancing downslope flow on its western and southwestern periphery. This
slight
risk area is expanded eastward in coverage and extended by one day, relativ=
e
to
yesterday, given the deeper surface low across the Northern Tier states in =
the
models. Reforecast tools also indicate at least a 20 percent chance for win=
d
speeds to exceed the 85th percentile for the slight risk of high winds area
designated across the north-central U.S.



Rainfall totals have exceeded 6 inches since the middle of March across man=
y
areas of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast, with some locations
picking up more than 10 inches of rain, which has already resulted in some
minor river flooding across the region. With additional heavy precipitation
forecast during week-1 (more than 2 inches for several locations) and the
slight risk of heavy precipitation during the first half of week-2, floodin=
g
will be possible throughout the week-2 period in the highlighted areas.
Flooding is also possible along the Red River of the north, where snow-melt=
 is
likely to continue, due to likely above-freezing daytime high temperatures
during week-2.



Although not reaching hazardous thresholds, given the time of year, amplifi=
ed
mid-level ridging during the first few days of week-2 could result in much
above-normal daytime high temperatures across the Desert Southwest and the
Central Valley of California. GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at
least
a 40 percent chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile o=
f
the climatological distribution for many locations. Across parts of the Des=
ert
Southwest, there is also at least 20 percent chance for temperatures to exc=
eed
95=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF, Apr 6-9.



In Alaska, a slight risk of high winds is posted for the Panhandle Apr 6-7,
associated with the potential for a strong surface low pressure system over
the
Gulf of Alaska early in the period. Reforecast tools indicate at least a 20
percent chance for wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile, with the ECMW=
F
reforecast tool indicating some locations having greater than a 40 percent
chance of wind speeds exceeding this percentile threshold. The orientation =
of
the surface flow could also result in locally higher wind speeds (upwards o=
f
40
mph) near coastal areas and in the channels, due to orographic enhancement.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

There continues to be some run to run differences in the timing
and strengthen of individual features over the next week. As a
whole, the general pattern has an initial low exiting across the
East with multiple waves digging across the West that are well
clustered. Today's suite of products primarily used a combination
of the ECWMF/GFS and their respective ensemble means; with an
initial weighting of 60/40 deterministic to ensemble means to
ending with 100% ensemble means. This reduced some of the noise
and followed continuity.

...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A deep cyclone will be lifting through eastern Canada Friday which
will allow persistent high winds and areas of wrapping snow in the
wake of the low, primarily east of the Great Lakes and the
Northeast. The trailing front front this low will move out over
the Atlantic Ocean with the southern extent slowing/stalling over
the Southeast U.S, the Gulf and into Mexico. Scattered to
widespread showers are expected near the front, particularly
across Florida and the Gulf coast through Saturday and then will
taper off.

Across the West, a series of upper troughs and low pressure
systems are expected track through with varying degrees of
uncertainty within the model guidance. These systems are expected
to bring an increase in precipitation potential for the Pacific
Northwest and modest snow for the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies. There is a growing trend for scattered to widespread
convection to develop over the Central/Southern Plains as the
systems exit into the central U.S. before spreading to the
Mid-Atlantic/Appalachian region by the end of the extended period.
Moderate rainfall will likely materialize within the deeper return
moisture as it focuses into wavy fronts and a stalled lead front.
Heavy downpours will be likely from the Gulf Coast to the
Southeast into the weekend.

By early next week there is also a growing guidance signal to
bring more energetic Pacific jet flow toward the West Coast. This
may transport deeper moisture to fuel and emerging precipitation
pattern focus into the Pacific Northwest to include heavy terrain
enhancing snows.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0216 PM CDT Tue Mar 29 2022

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN TEXAS FROM THE BIG BEND
TO THE GULF OF MEXICO...

Elevated highlights were added for portions of the Florida
Peninsula. In addition, the Elevated and Critical areas over South
Texas were expanded northward slightly. Elsewhere, the previous
forecast (see below) remains on track.

Across parts of southern and central Florida, breezy southeasterly
surface winds of 15-20 mph (gusts up to 25 mph) are expected
tomorrow/Wednesday. While low-level moisture return may temper RH
reductions to an extent, efficient diurnal heating/mixing across
inland and western portions of the Peninsula could result in minimum
afternoon RH of 30-40 percent. The combination of the breezy
boundary-layer winds, near-critical RH, and very dry fuels will
support elevated fire-weather conditions during the afternoon hours.
Confidence in the development of elevated conditions is highest from
Fort Myers northwestward toward Tampa Bay, where RH reductions
should be maximized amid the breezy surface winds.

High-end critical conditions are still expected across South Texas
tomorrow/Wednesday afternoon and early evening. While RH reductions
may be limited over the northern portions of the Elevated and
Critical areas (i.e., 25-35 percent), sustained west-northwesterly
surface winds of 20-30 mph (with higher gusts) and very dry fuels
should compensate for the marginal RH.

..Weinman.. 03/29/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Tue Mar 29 2022/

...Synopsis...
...South Texas...
A mid-level trough will move into the Mississippi Valley on
Wednesday with a mid-level jet streak extending from the Great Lakes
to southern New Mexico. 50+ knots of mid-level westerly flow will
persist across Texas for most of the day. A dry and well-mixed
airmass will be in place across Texas in the wake of the cold front,
which will allow some of the stronger mid-level flow to make it to
the surface. Therefore, sustained winds of 20 to 25 mph are expected
from the Big Bend to the Gulf of Mexico with relative humidity of 13
to 18 percent.

Fuels are very concerning across south Texas. ERC values are near
the 95 to 98th percentile across most of south Texas with some areas
at record dryness. Therefore, concern for fire spread is even larger
than a typical critical event. In fact, if surface winds trend
somewhat stronger in later outlooks, an extremely critical
delineation may need to be added.

...Southeast into the Ohio Valley...
Southerly flow will strengthen on Wednesday across much of the
eastern CONUS as a strong surface low moves into the Great Lakes.
This southerly flow will bring an increase in low-level moisture to
the Mississippi Valley and the lower Ohio Valley, but a very dry
airmass will remain Wednesday afternoon from eastern Indiana south
into eastern Tennessee and Georgia. Therefore, an overlap in dry and
windy conditions is expected across a broad region. Sustained winds
will range from 15 to 30 mph across the region with relative
humidity 20 to 35 percent.

Eventually, low-level moisture will increase in these regions after
dark with the potential for thunderstorms and even some severe
weather on Wednesday night. This rainfall is expected to be
widespread and should help control any fires which develop in the
region.

period. A trough is predicted in all ensemble means over southwestern Alask=
a
and the adjacent North Pacific, with a ridge downstream over the Pacific co=
ast
of the CONUS. The ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are amplified=
 in
all of today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ensemble means relative to yesterd=
ay=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecasts. Ensemble
means
generally depict troughing and weak negative 500-hPa height anomalies over
parts of the CONUS to the east of the ridge, with some differences in the
orientation and location of this troughing between the various ensemble mea=
ns.
The manual blend of model 500-hPa heights favors negative height anomalies
over
all of Alaska, positive height anomalies from the Pacific Coast to the Rock=
y
Mountains, weak negative height anomalies over most of the CONUS to the eas=
t
of
the Rockies, and near average 500-hPa heights over the Eastern Seaboard.

Near to below normal temperatures are favored for all of Alaska, under belo=
w
normal 500-hPa heights in the manual blend, with some differences among mod=
el
temperature tools. Near to below normal temperatures are favored for parts =
of
the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, supported by the model temperat=
ure
consolidation. Above normal temperatures are favored for most remaining are=
as
of the western CONUS extending across southern areas of Texas and the North=
ern
Plains, under and ahead of the predicted ridge. Above normal temperatures a=
re
also favored for much of the Eastern Seaboard, with greater probabilities o=
ver
parts of New England, consistent with the model temperature consolidation.
Near
normal temperatures are favored for remaining areas of the central and east=
ern
CONUS, under relatively weak 500-hPa height anomalies.

Probabilities of above normal precipitation are slightly enhanced for the
southeastern Alaska Mainland, the Alaska Panhandle, and parts of the Pacifi=
c
Northwest, ahead of the trough over the North Pacific. Below normal
precipitation is favored for central and northern California across the Gre=
at
Basin into the Central Rockies, under the predicted ridge. Above normal
precipitation is slightly favored over most of the eastern half of the CONU=
S,
under a weak trough and supported by the model precipitation consolidation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by uncertainty associated with a changing pattern a=
nd
weak mean mid-level height anomalies across the central and eastern CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 06 - 12 2022

Dynamical model forecasts of the 500-hPa height pattern for week-2 are in g=
ood
agreement and consistent with evolution of the predicted circulation for th=
e
6-10 day period, with greater uncertainty due to relatively weak anomalies
over
much of the forecast domain. The trough and negative 500-hPa height anomali=
es
over the North Pacific weaken, while a ridge and positive 500-hPa height
anomalies over the western CONUS weaken but expand further eastward into th=
e
Southern Plains in the week 2 period. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies
amplify
slightly over northern areas of the eastern CONUS in the week-2 manual blen=
d.

Below normal temperatures continue to be slightly favored over the northern
Alaska Mainland in week-2, under slightly below average 500-hPa heights. Ne=
ar
normal temperatures are favored for most of the southern Alaska Mainland,
under
slightly above average 500-hPa heights. Near to below normal temperatures a=
re
favored for the Alaska Panhandle and parts of the Pacific Northwest, suppor=
ted
by the model temperature consolidation. The probabilities for above normal
temperatures are enhanced across most remaining areas of the West in week-2=
,
under a predicted ridge. Below normal temperatures are favored for much of =
the
Lower Mississippi Valley and Tennessee Valley, under a trough and consisten=
t
with dynamical model temperature tools. Above normal temperatures are favor=
ed
for the Eastern Seaboard, consistent with model temperature forecasts.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for the Alaska Panhandle, ah=
ead
of a predicted trough. Near to below normal precipitation is favored over t=
he
West and most of the central CONUS, under and ahead of the expanding ridge.
Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Northern Plains, muc=
h
of
the Great Lakes region, and the Eastern Seaboard, associated with a mean
trough
predicted over the eastern CONUS.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
relatively good model agreement, offset by uncertainty associated with weak
mean mid-level height anomalies over most of the forecast domain.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

There continues to be some run to run differences in the timing
and strengthen of individual features over the next week. As a
whole, the general pattern has an initial low exiting across the
East with multiple waves digging across the West that are well
clustered. Today's suite of products primarily used a combination
of the ECWMF/GFS and their respective ensemble means; with an
initial weighting of 60/40 deterministic to ensemble means to
ending with 100% ensemble means. This reduced some of the noise
and followed continuity.

...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A deep cyclone will be lifting through eastern Canada Friday which
will allow persistent high winds and areas of wrapping snow in the
wake of the low, primarily east of the Great Lakes and the
Northeast. The trailing front front this low will move out over
the Atlantic Ocean with the southern extent slowing/stalling over
the Southeast U.S, the Gulf and into Mexico. Scattered to
widespread showers are expected near the front, particularly
across Florida and the Gulf coast through Saturday and then will
taper off.

Across the West, a series of upper troughs and low pressure
systems are expected track through with varying degrees of
uncertainty within the model guidance. These systems are expected
to bring an increase in precipitation potential for the Pacific
Northwest and modest snow for the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies. There is a growing trend for scattered to widespread
convection to develop over the Central/Southern Plains as the
systems exit into the central U.S. before spreading to the
Mid-Atlantic/Appalachian region by the end of the extended period.
Moderate rainfall will likely materialize within the deeper return
moisture as it focuses into wavy fronts and a stalled lead front.
Heavy downpours will be likely from the Gulf Coast to the
Southeast into the weekend.

By early next week there is also a growing guidance signal to
bring more energetic Pacific jet flow toward the West Coast. This
may transport deeper moisture to fuel and emerging precipitation
pattern focus into the Pacific Northwest to include heavy terrain
enhancing snows.

Midwest, icy conditions possible in the Great Lakes and central
Appalachians Wednesday morning; warmer temps return to the Ohio
Valley and Northeast, cooling trend in the Plains and Midwest...

A vigorous upper level trough emerging out of the Rockies will be
responsible for generating severe thunderstorms from the Plains to
the Southeast over the next couple days. The first round of severe
weather takes shape due to a strengthening surface low pressure
system in the Central Plains this afternoon. The Storm Prediction
Center (SPC) has issued an expansive Slight Risk area (threat
level 2/5) stretching from western Iowa on south into central
Texas. Severe hazards such as large hail, damaging winds, and
tornadoes are all possible with southeast Kansas, eastern
Oklahoma, and far north-central Texas most at risk for tornadoes.
The severe threat moves east on Wednesday where and even more
dangerous setup for severe storms is expected in the Deep South.
SPC has issued a Moderate Risk (threat level 4/5) over the Lower
Mississippi Valley, across southwest Tennessee, for virtually all
of Mississippi, and southwest Alabama. In these areas, there is an
increased threat of EF2-EF5 tornadoes and severe thunderstorm wind
gusts of 65 knots or greater. The severe threat extends as far
north as central Illinois and central Indiana. In addition, due to
the associated heavy rain, the Weather Prediction Center has
issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for the heart of the
Deep South. The associated heavy rainfall may result in localized
areas of flash flooding with urban areas, roads, and small streams
the most vulnerable through Wednesday night. The severe threat
moves to the East Coast by Thursday with a pair of Slight Risks
(threat level 2/5) in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

Thunderstorms are not the only mode of severe weather on tap
today. The SPC has issued an Extreme Risk of fire weather in parts
of the Central/Southern High Plains this afternoon due to strong
gusty winds, low relative humidity, and sufficiently dry fuels.
The winds are so strong that High Wind Warnings have been issued
from far West Texas and the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles to central
Kansas. The Critical Risk for favorable fire weather conditions is
quite expansive, extending from central Kansas on south and west
into West Texas and southeast New Mexico. A Critical Risk of fire
weather continues into Wednesday and Wednesday night across the
southern third of Texas. There is also an Elevated Risk for fire
weather conditions in parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and into
central Georgia through Wednesday evening courtesy of gusty
southerly winds and dry relative humidity levels well ahead of an
approaching cold front.

Elsewhere, while the calendar is just about ready to flip over to
April, "Old Man Winter" is not through just yet as the
aforementioned upper trough in the Rockies will also help to
produce periods of snow. Snow will pile up in the central Rockies
tonight with as much as a foot of snow possible by Wednesday
morning. Speaking of Wednesday morning, an icy morning commute is
possible from the central Appalachians to the Upper Great Lakes
where light snow accumulations and ice accretion up to two tenths
of an inch are possible. This has resulted in the issuance of
Winter Weather Advisories for these highlighted regions. As the
primary wave of low pressure deepens over the Midwest Wednesday,
on the storm's northern and western flanks, periods of snow are
anticipated in the northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley
with accumulations generally staying under 4 inches. The heaviest
totals are likely to occur in Michigan's Upper Peninsula with the
heaviest snowfall rates arriving late Wednesday night into
Thursday morning. Up to a foot of snow is possible in the U.P.
with locally high amounts possible. Temperature-wise, a
more-spring-like airmass returns to the Ohio Valley on Wednesday,
which then moves into the Northeast by Thursday. On the backside
of the storm system, cooler than normal temperatures look to
filter into the Northern Plains and Midwest

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 02 2022 - 12Z Wed Apr 06 2022

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a blend
of reasonably well clustered mid-larger scale guidance from the 18
UTC GFS/GEFS mean and the 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian/ECMWF
ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models days
3-7 (Sat-next Wed). However, embedded smaller scale system
differences and ample run to run continuity variances remain
problematic. Accordingly, blend weighting was transitioned from
primarily the models days 3-5 to the ensemble means days 6/7 to
mitigate less predictable forecast components amid steadily
growing forecast spread. Overall, WPC product continuity is best
maintained with this plan and the forecast seems in line with a
similar composite of newer 00 UTC guidance.

...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A closed upper trough and deepened surface low will work into the
Canadian maritimes by Saturday. Expect lingering high winds across
New England in the wake of the low. The southern portion of a
trailing western Atlantic cold front will slow over Florida, the
Gulf of Mexico and into Mexico. Scattered to widespread showers
are expected near the front, particularly across Florida and
possibly the Gulf coast Saturday.

Across the West, a leading series of upper troughs and low
pressure systems with modest precipitation potential are expected
track through with varying degrees of uncertainty through the
weekend. Infusion of highly energetic Pacific jet flow will then
up the ante and work increasingly inland from the Northwest to the
Rockies/Plains early-mid next week. This should act to transport
deeper moisture to fuel an emerging precipitation focus for some
heavier rains and mountain enhancing snows, mainly across the
Northwest.

Downstream progression and systems out from the West and
increasing northern stream phasing potential over time may combine
to support uncertain cyclogenesis/frontogensis over the central
and eastern states next week. There is a growing guidance signal
for development of a building area of moderate to heavy rainfall
across the east-central U.S. and especially a more
unstable/convective South early-mid next week as deeper Gulf
moisture returns and interacts with the complex series of wavy
fronts and a stalled lead front.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 AM CDT Wed Mar 30 2022

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MOST OF SOUTHERN TEXAS FROM THE
BIG BEND TO THE GULF OF MEXICO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE TX/OK PANHANDLES
INTO SOUTHWEST OKLAHOMA AND NORTH TEXAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE WESTERN APPALACHIANS INTO THE
OHIO VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
FLORIDA....

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough will move from South Texas to the
eastern Great Lakes during the day today. A very strong surface low
will deepen through the day as it moves from the Plains to the Great
Lakes. This surface low will lead to a significant surface pressure
gradient across much of the central and eastern CONUS and therefore,
winds will be very strong. A dry airmass will be in place in several
locations which will lead to fire weather concerns across broad
regions in the CONUS.

...South Texas...
Once the dryline/cold front move east of the Plains this morning, a
well-mixed airmass will remain across the southern Plains.
Therefore, with minimal surface heating, very strong winds from
aloft will start to transfer some of their momentum toward the
surface. Sustained surface winds of 20 to 25 mph are expected from
southern New Mexico to southeast Texas. Relative humidity will be
drier with southern extent with values less than 15 percent near the
Rio Grande and across far southern Texas. Fuels are very dry across
the region with near-record ERCs across much of South Texas. The
northern edge of the critical/elevated delineation attempts to track
the southern extent of significant precipitation from overnight
convection. There is still uncertainty with the southern extent of
the wetting rains, which may necessitate shifts in the northern
fringe of the threat during the outlook update late this morning.

Local extremely critical conditions cannot be ruled out across parts
of South Texas from Del Rio to west of Corpus Christi. This is the
region beneath the core of the mid-level jet where downward momentum
transfer should be the greatest. However, the threat appears too
localized/short lived to justify an extremely critical area.

...Far southeast Colorado southeastward to portions of North
Texas...
A mid-level shortwave trough, currently near the Montana/North
Dakota border, will move south through the day today. This will
overspread moderate mid-level flow across the southern High Plains.
A dry/well-mixed airmass will be in place in the wake of the
dryline/cold front. Therefore, some of this stronger mid-level flow
may reach the surface with winds of 15 to 25 mph expected and
relative humidity of 15 to 25 percent. Additionally, this overlaps
the region that had extremely critical fire weather conditions on
Tuesday with numerous large fires. Therefore, any ongoing fires
could start to run again today with a wind direction from the
northwest.

...Southeast into the Western Appalachians and the Ohio Valley...
Strong southerly flow will develop today across most of the eastern
CONUS as a surface low deepens and moves into the Great Lakes. This
southerly flow will bring Gulf moisture northward in the Mississippi
Valley and into the Lower Ohio Valley. However, farther east a
continental airmass remains in place, with trajectories keeping a
dry low-level airmass through the afternoon/evening. Therefore,
relative humidity of 25 to 35 percent is expected from southern
Georgia into the western Appalachians and southern Ohio Valley. The
airmass across eastern Kentucky and Tennessee will likely dry even
further due to downslope flow off the Appalachians. In addition,
terrain influences on the downslope side of the Appalachians will
bring very strong winds with wind gusts in excess of 80 mph in some
locations.

The region from eastern Tennessee to far southern Ohio will have the
greatest fire weather concern. This should result from additional
drying from the downslope flow, and relative humidity of 20 to 30
percent, combined with winds of 15 to 20 mph. ERC percentiles also
will be near record for this time of year. Therefore, a critical
delineation is warranted across this region where the worst
conditions are expected.

...Portions of central and South Florida...
Winds will be mostly parallel to the Peninsula across Florida today
which will allow for some inland drying and mixing. Expect winds of
15 to 20 mph for much of the Peninsula with relative humidity of 30
to 35 percent. ERC percentiles are high, particularly across south
Florida where values are near record for this time of year. Evidence
of this could be seen on visible satellite imagery Tuesday afternoon
as a large smoke plume was seen across south Florida.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0207 AM CDT Wed Mar 30 2022

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
High pressure will build across the Plains on Thursday which should
keep winds light and limit overall fire weather concerns. Windy
conditions will remain across the eastern CONUS as the surface low
moves east across eastern Canada. However, moist and/or cool
conditions will prevail, which will keep fire weather concerns
minimal. The only exception will be across portions of central and
southern Florida. A dry and well-mixed airmass is expected to
develop across the Peninsula with sustained winds around 15 mph and
relative humidity of 25 to 35 percent. For now, the stronger winds
are forecast to stay west of the drier low-level airmass, but if
these stronger winds overlap the drier surface conditions, a
critical delineation may be needed in later outlooks.

...Severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall threat on Wednesday
into Friday morning...

...Heavy snow over the Upper Great Lakes and widespread
rain/freezing rain from parts of the Great Lakes to Central
Appalachians/Northern New England...

...There are multiple areas of Critical Risk of fire weather over
parts of the Southern Plains, Ohio/Tennessee Valley, and parts of
the Florida Peninsula on Wednesday...

A strong storm over Upper Midwest to the Southern Plains moves
north and eastward to Eastern Canada and Maine by Friday morning.
The storm will produce showers and thunderstorms from the Great
Lakes to the Southern Plains; some of the thunderstorms will be
severe. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Moderate Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee
Valleys and the Southeast through Thursday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. In addition,
over the Central Gulf Coast, Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys,
and the Southeast, there is an increased threat of EF2-EF5
tornadoes and severe thunderstorm wind gusts of 65 knots or
greater.

Moreover, due to the associated heavy rain, the WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valley/Southeast through Thursday morning.
The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of
flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the
most vulnerable.

The severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall threat decrease
slightly from Thursday into Friday as the associated front moves
eastward. Consequently, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over two regions, the northern Mid-Atlantic and the
Southeast Coast, Thursday into Friday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. In addition,
the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Southeast Thursday into Friday. The associated heavy
rain will create localized areas of flash flooding, affecting
areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain. Additionally,
temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average ahead of the
cold front.

Meanwhile, rain and snow will develop over parts of the Northern
Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley on Wednesday. An area of light
rain/freezing rain will develop over a wide area from the Upper
Great Lakes and parts of the Central Appalachians Wednesday into
Thursday morning. Likewise, snow and rain/freezing rain will
develop over parts of Northern New England overnight late
Wednesday afternoon into Thursday morning. A multiple-day heavy
snow event will develop over northern Michigan near Lake Superior.
Snow will also develop over most of Michigan and parts of the Ohio
Valley on Thursday. On Friday, the snow will slowly taper off over
parts of the Northeast/Central Appalachians.

In addition, the SPC has issued a Critical Risk of fire weather
over multiple areas on Wednesday. The first area is over the
southern third of Texas, with the second over parts of the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles. The third is over parts of the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, while the fourth is over parts of the
Florida Peninsula due to gusty winds, low relative humidity, and
dry fuels. On Thursday, the threat reduced in area and category to
an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the Florida
Peninsula.

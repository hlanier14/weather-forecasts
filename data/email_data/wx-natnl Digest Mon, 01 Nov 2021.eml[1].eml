Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1100 AM CDT Sun Oct 31 2021

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed to the ongoing fire weather outlook (see
previous discussion below).

..Jirak.. 10/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0126 AM CDT Sun Oct 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
Cool and/or moist conditions will prevail across the majority of the
CONUS today. Some drier conditions (25 to 35 percent relative
humidity) are expected across portions of the southwest and southern
Great Basin. However, winds will be light in these areas and fuels
are not that dry. Therefore, fire weather concerns are expected to
be minimal across the entire CONUS.

...Overview...

An omega block initially centered over western Canada during the
medium range period will be instrumental in digging shortwave
energy toward a slow-moving broad trough across the eastern U.S.
where the potential for cyclogenesis late this week will continue
to be monitored.  Meanwhile, unsettled weather will likely
continue along the West Coast and especially the Pacific Northwest
where shortwaves will attempt to pass under the omega block into
the western U.S.  Models are in disagreement as to how much of the
shortwave energy will get through the West and eventually reach
the Plains states late this week where potential exists for the
development of an upper trough/low over the southern Plains.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance this morning continues to maintain their own
preferences as to how the amplified pattern described above will
evolve through next weekend.  The ECMWF solutions continue to
indicate cyclogenesis near the East Coast late this week due to
more aggressive digging of shortwaves into the northern part of
the U.S. midweek.  The deeper upper trough in turn opens the door
for shortwave energy to penetrate the western U.S. under the omega
block and phase with the eastern U.S. upper trough.   The GFS
continues to be much less aggressive with the deepening of the
upper trough and therefore keeping the potential for cyclogenesis
much lower and much farther off the East Coast.  On the other
hand, the CMC shows elements from both the ECMWF and GFS
solutions, and offers an intermediate solution.  Meanwhile, the
00Z EC mean takes the low center off the East Coast in contrast
with its deterministic solution which has been indicating
cyclogenesis near the coast.  With these in mind together with
past performances of these models, an intermediate solution was
adopted to compose this morning's WPC medium-range forecasts.
This solution was based on a blend of 35% 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 35%
06Z GFS/GEFS mean, and 30% 00Z CMC/CMC mean, yielding a storm
track off the East Coast.  This solution is also reasonably
compatible with the previous WPC forecasts (with a faster forward
motion of the storm center) as well as the latest (12Z) ECMWF
deterministic run.

In addition, this blend allows for an intermediate solution
regarding the uncertainty in the amount of shortwave energy
traversing the western U.S. under the omega block.  The GFS and
GEFS have been more aggressive with developing an upper trough/low
over the southern Plains late this week whereas the ECMWF shows
only a modest indication of this feature.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Shortwave energy moving across the southern Plains with moisture
overrunning a wavy frontal boundary will promote to moderate to
heavy rainfall and potential for thunderstorms Wednesday into
Thursday across the region.  Some wintry precipitation can be
expected over the central High Plains and central Rockies
Wednesday morning.  The precipitation is forecast to spread
east/northeast during the latter part of the week, with the higher
elevations of the central Appalachians and the interior Northeast
seeing some possibility for snow, but with low confidence in the
specifics.  The possibility for cyclogenesis near the East Coast
this coming weekend will continue be monitored.  It appears that
the storm track should stay off the East Coast at this time.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation during the second half of the week near the
West Coast.  Northern California and the Pacific Northwest can
expect the heaviest precipitation, with normal terrain
enhancements and higher elevation snow. Lesser precipitation
amounts are likely to spread into the Intermountain West and
Rockies, particularly Thursday into early Friday.

Behind the aforementioned front in the southern Plains across the
Gulf Coast, a cold high pressure system will maintain well below
normal temperatures across the central and eastern CONUS.  This
will especially be the case for highs which should be 10-20F below
average from the central and southern parts of the Plains and
spreading across the Mississippi Valley toward the eastern U.S.
Chilly lows are also forecast, with temperatures about 5-10F below
normal across the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and stretching toward
the south-central U.S. by Friday.  Expect above normal low
temperatures under the western ridge aloft, but periods of
unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat below normal over
California on most days and near to slightly above normal
elsewhere.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Sun Oct 31 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR NOVEMBER 2021

The update to the November 2021 monthly temperature and precipitation outlo=
ok
released in late-October primarily considered and utilized the latest ensem=
ble
model guidance at multiple time scales.



La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions have developed in the tropical Pacific,=
 and equatorial sea
surface temperatures (SSTs) are below average across the central and
east-central Pacific Ocean, with tropical Pacific atmospheric conditions
consistent with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa. La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa remains =
a primary factor in the outlook.
MJO
remains weak due to destructive interference from La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa,=
 and did not play a
substantial role in the November update. Cold coastal SST anomalies (SSTA),
particularly near the Alaska and western U.S. coasts, influenced the update=
.
Current anomalous soil moisture conditions remain a minor influence due to
time
of year.



For temperature, the updated November outlook remains consistent with the
mid-month outlook. Updated dynamical model guidance supports elevated odds =
of
above-normal monthly mean temperatures for the western U.S. The previous
mid-October outlook included elevated probability of above-normal temperatu=
res
(40%) for much of California. Probabilities of above-normal temperatures ar=
e
weakened to probability of Equal-Chances (EC) of above, near, and below-nor=
mal
temperatures for much of coastal central and northern California due to
anomalously cold SSTA stemming from La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa in the updated=
 November outlook.
In
the southeastern U.S. the mid-month outlook favored slightly elevated chanc=
es
of above-normal temperatures (33%). Elevated probability of a low pressure
system and cooler temperatures in the central and southeastern U.S. in earl=
y
November with elevated probability of above-normal temperatures in later
November supports a change to EC in the region. Disagreement among models o=
n
the position and strength of the circulation pattern for the beginning of t=
he
month also supports the change to EC. Probability of below-normal temperatu=
re
over southern Alaska is expanded to include the Aleutians and an area of
greater confidence for below-normal temperatures (40%), consistent with
dynamical model guidance depicting confident elevated probability of
below-normal temperatures and anomalously cold coastal SSTAs with
predominantly
northerly flow.



For precipitation, the updated November outlook remains similar to the
mid-October release in the Pacific Northwest where La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa=
 impacts are
expected. Elevated chance of above-normal precipitation (33%) is expanded i=
nto
northern California consistent with model guidance and mid-level toughing o=
ff
the northwestern coast. The area of 40% probability of above-normal
precipitation over Idaho is expanded westward into northern Nevada and
California in the updated November outlook given dynamical model guidance
favoring above-normal precipitation and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts. H=
igh precipitation
climatology in the Pacific Northwest supports weak probability of above-nor=
mal
precipitation (33%). Weak chances of below-normal precipitation (33%) are
expanded westward over Alaska due to persistent dry probabilities in both
short
and long-term model guidance. Elevated odds for below-normal precipitation =
in
the southern U.S. was favored in the mid-month outlook given dynamical mode=
l
guidance and expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts. The area of EC in t=
he central U.S. in
the mid-month outlook is expanded into the southeast in the updated Novembe=
r
outlook given potential for early November enhanced precipitation. High
uncertainty in dynamical model circulation related to the enhanced
precipitation supports EC. Dynamical model guidance supports elevated odds
(33%) of below-normal precipitation along the southern parts of the eastern
seaboard, Gulf states, and Florida, with higher probabilities of below-norm=
al
precipitation (40%) in northern Florida, and southern parts of Alabama,
Georgia, and South Carolina in the updated November outlook. The area of we=
ak
elevated above-normal precipitation (33%) in the northeast has been expande=
d
in
the updated November outlook consistent with dynamical model guidance for t=
he
second half of November, La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts, and trend, thoug=
h confidence is low
given inconsistent dynamical model guidance in early November. Enhanced
confidence for above-normal precipitation (40%) is added over the northern
parts of the Great Lakes and New York given potential for lake effect
precipitation.

***************************************************************************=
***



The November 2021 outlook is prepared against the backdrop of recently
developed La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions in equatorial Pacific sea sur=
face temperatures
(SSTs) and the tropical Pacific atmosphere. The developed La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDa conditions
were a primary factor in the outlook given the moderate strength La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
predicted for November. Due to destructive interference from the developmen=
t
of
La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa, the MJO has weakened substantially and did not no=
tably contribute to
the outlook. Coastal SST anomalies remain a factor in the outlook, as do
precipitation and temperature trends. Statistical, hybrid, and dynamical mo=
del
based forecast guidance contribute significantly to the November outlook.



For temperature, elevated probabilities of above-normal monthly mean Novemb=
er
temperatures are depicted across much of the contiguous U.S. with the regio=
n
stretching from the western U.S. eastward to cover much of the central and
southern Great Plains, Ohio Valley, and the Eastern Seaboard. The greatest
odds
are over the southwestern U.S., consistent with expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDa conditions
and
temperature trends, as well as dynamical and statistical model forecast
information. The Northeast also has an elevated chance of above-normal
temperatures (greater than 40 percent) given large positive local SST
anomalies
and expected impacts from La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa.



Conflicting signals in forecast tools support equal chances (EC) of above,
near, and below normal temperatures in the Pacific Northwest eastward to mu=
ch
of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley. Uncertainty is also hi=
gh
across the Gulf States, as some dynamical model forecasts depict an area of
EC.
However, a weak tilt toward above-normal temperatures is favored given
anomalously warm Gulf of Mexico SSTs.



Observed cold local SST anomalies around Alaska that are forecasted to pers=
ist
into November support elevated odds for below-normal temperatures for much =
of
southeastern/eastern Alaska westward to the Alaska Peninsula. Additionally,
anomalous upper level ridging off the southern coast of Alaska supports low
level cyclonic flow and colder surface air temperatures over southern Alask=
a.
Dynamical and statistical model guidance as well as expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDa impacts
also support below-normal temperatures over Alaska in November. Though the =
MJO
is forecasted to deteriorate, the potential for suppressed convection over =
the
maritime continent and enhanced convection over the eastern Pacific during
week
2 supports cold temperatures over much of interior Alaska.



The November precipitation outlook is influenced by background La Ni=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDa
impacts,
statistical forecast tools, and dynamical model guidance. Elevated odds of
below-normal total precipitation amounts are depicted for the southern tier=
 of
the U.S., with strongest odds over the south central U.S. Below-normal tota=
l
precipitation in this region is consistent with expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDa impacts and
precipitation trends, and supported by dynamical and statistical model
guidance. Expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impact to the gulf states and F=
lorida is typically
enhanced odds for below-normal precipitation, but disagreement in dynamical
and
statistical models warranted a shift of the strongest probability to the
south-central U.S.



Dynamical model guidance and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts support eleva=
ted odds of
above-normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest stretching into Montan=
a
and parts of Wyoming. Though there is evidence of elevated odds for
above-normal precipitation across the entire region, the strongest
probabilities are shifted eastward due to high precipitation climatology in
the
more western parts of the region. A second region of mildly elevated odds o=
f
above-normal precipitation stretches from the Great Lakes into the northern
parts of New England, supported by expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impact=
s, statistical, and
most dynamical model guidance. Given the potential for lake effect
precipitation as we enter into the colder parts of the year, slightly eleva=
ted
odds for above-normal precipitation are depicted over the Great Lakes.



Weak probabilities of below-normal precipitation are forecasted for
southeastern Alaska, shifting to weak probabilities of above-normal
precipitation in northern Alaska, consistent with statistical model guidanc=
e.
La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa and long term precipitation trends support this pa=
ttern, as well as
potential for more open water north of Alaska in early winter.

300 PM EDT Sun October 31 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

Valid 00Z Mon Nov 1 2021 - 00Z Wed Nov 3 2021

...Light to moderate snow likely from the Central Rockies to the
High Plains...

...Cold front to bring cooler weather to much of the Plains and
Midwest for early in the week...

A much quieter weather pattern will be returning to much of the
nation in the wake of the strong East Coast storm system, which is
now departing New England as of Sunday evening.  However, breezy
to windy conditions will still be likely across the Northeast
through tonight before abating later on Monday.  Broad cyclonic
flow across the Great Lakes along with cold air advection is
expected to result in lake effect rain and snow downwind of lakes
Superior, Erie, and Ontario, with snow most likely for the higher
terrain downwind of the lakes.  Snow is also expected from the
central Rockies to western Nebraska as a modest disturbance aloft
moves across this region where winter weather advisories are in
effect and a few inches of accumulation will be possible.  Some
showers are possible across coastal portions of the Florida
Peninsula, but should remain light.

For the West Coast region, a storm system over the eastern Pacific
will approach the coast of the Pacific Northwest and northern
California by Monday morning.  Portions of northwestern California
and southwest may get on the order of 1 to 2 inches of rainfall,
but should avoid any noteworthy flooding concerns.  Snow is
expected only for the highest elevations of the northern Sierra
given the warmer temperatures associated with this front that
should weaken shortly after moving inland.

In terms of temperatures, it will be rather chilly across much of
the central/northern Plains and extending eastward across the Ohio
Valley and Great Lakes for the beginning of the week.  Highs will
only be in the 30s and 40s for many of these areas, and widespread
subfreezing overnight lows expected.  Seasonably warm conditions
can still be expected for the Desert Southwest, Texas, and the
Gulf Coast region.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period will begin Thursday with a ridge axis
across the Southwest to northern High Plains separating troughing
over the eastern Pacific and in eastern North America. Model
guidance agrees on this much, before diverging by the end of the
week with a couple of key features. First, shortwave energy moving
through the trough in the East creates differences in the trough's
evolution Friday into the weekend, namely the depth that the
trough digs, whether or not a separate/possibly closed low
develops in the southern stream with this energy, and the speed
the trough tracks eastward. These differences also impact the
possibility of a surface low forming and its track likely in the
western Atlantic, along with precipitation chances for the East
Coast. There have been ample run-to-run and model-to-model
variations with these features over the past couple of days, with
generally the GFS suite taking the weaker/faster side compared to
other guidance. For the 12/18Z cycle, somewhat better model
agreement was finally seen as the 12Z ECMWF (and now the new 00Z
ECMWF) no longer spin up a deep closed low with the energy on
Friday and lasting into the weekend, but take a more middle ground
approach with weaker but still potent energy producing a southern
stream open trough. Additionally, the 18Z GFS, while overall still
fast compared to consensus, keeps troughing persistent across the
East into Saturday, though is now on the aggressive side with a
small closed upper low off the East Coast by Sunday. The 12Z CMC
shows a brief closed low forming Saturday but certainly within
reason. Thus for these features in the East, a blend mainly based
on the 18Z GFS, the 12Z ECMWF, and the 12Z CMC was utilized
through the weekend, weighting the GEFS and EC ensemble means
(which were better clustered tonight) more heavily as the period
progressed. With this blend, surface cyclogenesis occurs off the
East Coast, and most guidance tonight shows a trend toward most
precipitation remaining offshore with the low, but with the
possibility for lighter amounts over the East Coast Friday and
Saturday.

Farther west, there is uncertainty with track and timing of
shortwave energies entering the West Coast late this week. Most
guidance (though the 00Z CMC is on the weaker side) takes a
shortwave across the Northwest and southwestern Canada Thursday
into Friday, which pushes upper ridging somewhat eastward into the
central U.S. Just behind this shortwave there is potential for
additional shortwave energy to come into the West Friday into
Saturday. This is where model guidance begins to diverge more
notably. The 12Z UKMET is quite strong with a closed mid-upper low
forming in the central U.S. on Saturday, the 12Z ECMWF splits
energy to take some into central Canada while some tracks quickly
southward over the Mississippi Valley and reinforces the East
Coast troughing by Sunday but keeps ridging over the central U.S.,
and the 12Z CMC takes most energy eastward along the U.S./Canadian
border and creates zonal flow over the western and central CONUS.
The 12Z and 18Z GFS differ notably, as the 12Z GFS aggressively
combines strong energy to create a central U.S. closed low Sunday,
somewhat like the UKMET but a day later, while the 18Z shears the
shortwave energy north of the west-central U.S. ridging. The new
00Z GFS is more like the 18Z GFS, though does close off a 500mb
low in the Upper Midwest more quickly than the 18Z run. For this
feature leaned toward the 18Z GFS and GEFS mean for the forecast,
which seemed to be a good middle ground solution among guidance,
as it maintains some ridging in the central U.S. but accounts for
the shortwave energy as well. Overall, variability in model and
ensemble guidance leads to below average confidence in the
forecast evolution, though may be improving somewhat compared to
previous cycles.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Precipitation is expected across the Gulf Coast and the
southeastern quadrant of the country on Thursday as a weak
shortwave moves through the base of the trough and sufficient
moisture streams north of a Gulf Coast front. The heaviest
precipitation will likely be in the Southern Appalachians, and the
highest peaks there could see snow. Then some rain may spread into
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday into Saturday, but how far
west precipitation reaches will depend on the surface low track in
the western Atlantic. If moisture does reach the higher elevations
of the Central Appalachians and interior Northeast, snow is
possible there as well.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation during the latter half of the week into the
weekend near the West Coast. Through the period, the Pacific
Northwest/far northern California can expect the heaviest
precipitation, with normal terrain enhancements and higher
elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with highest amounts
Thursday into early Friday.

Behind the aforementioned front across the Gulf Coast, a cold high
pressure system will maintain well below normal temperatures
across the central and eastern CONUS. This will especially be the
case for highs, which should be 10-20F below average from southern
parts of the Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley
toward the eastern U.S. Chilly lows are also forecast, with
temperatures about 5-10F below normal across the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley and stretching toward the south-central U.S. by Friday, and
into the Southeast over the weekend. Expect above normal
temperatures under the western/central U.S. ridge aloft, with
highs about 10-15F above average for the north-central U.S.
southward into the central High Plains, with the Desert Southwest
a few degrees above normal as well. Meanwhile, periods of
unsettled weather will keep highs near to somewhat below normal
over the West Coast on most days.

...Wintry mix forecast for the Central Rockies and Plains, while
showers and thunderstorms are forecast for the Southern Plains...

...Cold front to bring cooler, Fall-like temperatures from the
Plains to the East Coast...

...Rain likely ahead of a Pacific storm system along the West
Coast...

...Daily rain and snow showers expected for the Great Lakes
Region, spreading into the Northeast on Tuesday...

At the start of the forecast period, a cold front will be moving
off the East Coast as well as into the South and Texas. The
western portion of this front from Texas northwestward into the
Central Rockies will remain relatively stationary. A wintry mix of
freezing rain, sleet, and snow is forecast to continue along and
north of this front from the Central Rockies east into the Central
Plains. Moisture will be rather limited so accumulations should
generally remain on the lighter side overall. However, a Winter
Weather Advisory is currently out for southwestern Nebraska and
southeastern Wyoming through Monday afternoon, where higher snow
accumulations between 3-5 inches are possible. Meanwhile, shower
and thunderstorm chances will increase along and north of the
frontal boundary for portions of Texas and Oklahoma as a
short-wave passes over the region Tuesday into Tuesday night. The
highest rain totals of around an inch are most likely from
northwest Texas to southeast Oklahoma.

Much cooler temperatures are forecast behind the cold front as it
continues southward, with many locations seeing their first
Fall-like weather of the season. Highs in the 40s over the Central
Plains Monday will spread as far south as Oklahoma and the Texas
Panhandle Tuesday. Similarly, highs in the 40s and 50s from the
Midwest and Ohio Valley northeast to New England Monday will reach
the Mid-South, Tennessee Valley, and Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.
Subfreezing low temperatures are also forecast Tuesday and
Wednesday morning. The freezing line will likely stretch from the
Chicago area southwestward through northern Missouri and Kansas
Tuesday morning. The line will move eastward Wednesday morning,
with subfreezing low temperatures forecast for northern portions
of the Ohio Valley.

A storm system approaching the West Coast will bring rain to the
Pacific Northwest and northern California on Monday. The system is
forecast to weaken as it reaches the coast, so any significant
impacts should remain isolated. However, rain totals between
between 1-2 inches are possible along the immediate coast. Rain
and higher elevation snow showers are also forecast to overspread
the northern Great Basin and Northern Rockies Monday night into
Tuesday.

For the Great Lakes Region, a deep low pressure center over Canada
will lead to northerly onshore flow, producing daily rain and snow
showers. Additional waves rotating around the system, including a
cold front forecast to form Tuesday morning, will also help to
continue the shower chances through the forecast period. As the
cold front moves east, rain and snow shower chances will increase
for the interior Northeast and New England, with showers also
possible as far south as the Mid-Atlantic.

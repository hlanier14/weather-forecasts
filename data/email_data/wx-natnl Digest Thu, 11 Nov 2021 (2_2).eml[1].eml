...Moderate to heavy precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
Sunday-Monday...

...Lake Effect/enhanced precipitation this weekend through mid
next week across the Great Lakes...


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...
The latest guidance is in general agreement as the flow pattern
goes from one that is amplified to more zonal.  The WPC medium
range suite used a general blend of the deterministic models,
ensemble means, and the National Blend of Models to help mitigate
the differences which begin to arise mid next week.


...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...
An amplified trough will pass slowly through the eastern CONUS,
periodically reinforced by shortwaves rounding its southwest side.
Its associated cold fronts sweep across the East this weekend with
mainly light and scattered showers. Cold northwest flow on the
backside of the mean trough should help support enhanced lake
effect precipitation/snows from the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and
into the northern Appalachians/Northeast. Temperatures should be
generally around 10F below average for portions of the East
Saturday through Tuesday. Moderation in the East is expected on
Wednesday and Thursday as low pressure moves across central
Canada, with its cold front moving into the Upper Midwest and
Great Lakes, and the surface ridge axis slides off the East Coast.

For the Pacific Northwest, a cold front with a long fetch of
Pacific moisture directed onshore, will drop slowly south along
the Pacific northwest Coast Sunday-Monday resulting in moderate to
heavy rainfall in the valleys -- perhaps excessively in areas with
burn scars -- and snow in the highest peaks. Overall, favorable
flow should focus heavy rains and elevation snows mainly over the
Olympics and Cascades, though some spill over precipitation is
possible across parts of the northern Rockies next Tuesday into
Wednesday. Until the Western trough moves into the area next
Tuesday and Wednesday, temperatures are expected to be 10-20F
above average before nudging slightly below average in the
Northern Continental Divide on Wednesday and Thursday.  The warmer
than average temperatures shift into the Plains ahead of the
trough Monday through next Wednesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 AM CST Thu Nov 11 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will evolve into an upper-level cut-off low
across the central CONUS, with a surface low expected to meander
around the Upper Mississippi Valley today. By afternoon, over 80 kts
of 500 mb northwesterly winds will pivot around the backside of the
upper trough and coincide with dry west-northwesterly surface flow,
promoting dry and breezy conditions across the central and southern
High Plains.

While the lowest RH/highest surface winds are expected across
portions of the central Plains, fuels remain mediocre for fire
spread, precluding fire weather highlights. However, drier fine
fuels do exist across portions of the Colorado Front Range, where 15
mph sustained westerly surface winds are expected to overlap with
20-25% RH, hence the introduction of Elevated highlights. Locally
Elevated fire conditions may also be observed across the southern
High Plains, but a weaker surface wind field along with poorly
receptive fuels suggest that fire weather highlights are not
necessary in this region.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CST Thu Nov 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
As an upper-level low evolves into a progressive open wave and moves
across the eastern U.S. with a surface low, a secondary mid-level
impulse is expected to pivot around the open wave and traverse the
Plains states tomorrow/Friday. Subsequently, high pressure will
build into the central Plains, fostering a bout of dry northwesterly
surface flow Friday afternoon. At least Elevated to locally Critical
conditions are expected across portions of the central Plains.
However, finer fuels across the region marginally support
wildfire-spread potential. As such, fire weather highlights have
been withheld this outlook. An Elevated area may need to be added in
forecast updates if stronger, drier flow is anticipated,
compensating for mediocre fuel status.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Pacific Northwest through Friday morning...

...Snow for the Upper Midwest...

...Temperatures will be above average over parts of the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic...

Moisture will stream into the Pacific Northwest ahead of the next
front that will come onshore by Friday afternoon.  The moisture
will produce rain, heavy at times, over parts of the Northwest
from Thursday into Saturday morning.  Consequently, the WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall through Friday morning.
 The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of
flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the
most vulnerable. The excessive rainfall threat decreases slightly
on Friday, as the WPC has a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall
over parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Intermountain
Region on Friday into Saturday morning.

Meanwhile, a deep low over the Upper Midwest will produce rain and
snow over parts of the Upper Midwest. On Thursday, the snow will
march southward over the Northern Plains, the Upper Mississippi
Valley, and parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley by Friday
afternoon. Overnight Friday, light snow will move into parts of
the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes, as the snow over the Upper
Mississippi Valley tapers off.

In the meantime, rain will develop along and ahead of the
associated front from the Upper Great Lakes to the Middle
Mississippi Valley.  By Friday, the rain will move eastward into
the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.  In addition, the temperatures
will be above average over parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic
ahead of the front.  Furthermore, as the system moves eastward,
moisture from the Atlantic will stream into parts of the Northeast
on Friday.  The rain, heavy at times, will move into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and the Carolinas.  Hence, the WPC has
issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Northeast on Friday into Saturday morning.  The associated heavy
rain will create localized areas of flash flooding, affecting
areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.

Furthermore, on Thursday, showers and thunderstorms will develop
over parts of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys into the
Western Gulf Coast. By Thursday evening the showers and
thunderstorms move into parts of the Central Gulf Coast, as rain
fills in over the Tennessee valley and the Southeast. The rain
starts to taper off on Friday morning over the Southeast.

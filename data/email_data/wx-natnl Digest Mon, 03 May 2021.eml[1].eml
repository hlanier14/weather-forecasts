Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 AM CDT Sun May 02 2021

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA...NEW
MEXICO...TEXAS SOUTH PLAINS...

Overall, only minor changes based on recent guidance and
observations. Today's morning RAOBs in AZ/NM show a very dry airmass
which has led to very poor overnight RH recoveries. Current surface
observations from the Southwest into the southern High Plains show
RH already dropping to near 10%. As winds continue to increase while
the surface low develops in the TX/OK Panhandles, critical
conditions will become widespread this afternoon. Locally extremely
critical conditions are possible, particularly in southern New
Mexico where a relatively more favorable combination of surface to
500 mb flow will exist. The only mitigating factor will be recent
rainfall across southeastern New Mexico into the Trans-Pecos where
the threat level remains less than atmospheric conditions would
normally dictate.

..Wendt.. 05/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Sun May 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
In a split flow regime across the CONUS, a southern-stream shortwave
trough over the Great Basin will dig southeastward and arrive over
the Four Corners by the end of the forecast period. As the trough
moves southeast, mid-level flow will gradually increase above the
southern Rockies and Southwest where a lee cyclone is forecast to
deepen across the western Texas Panhandle. In response to the
increasing flow aloft and lee cyclone, strong west-southwesterly
surface winds are expected across much of Arizona and New Mexico
ahead of a cold front forecast to strengthen across the southern
Great Basin.

...Arizona, New Mexico, and west Texas...
As mid-level flow increases ahead of the trough moving in from the
Great Basin, southwesterly surface winds will increase considerably
across eastern Arizona and New Mexico. Hi-res ensemble guidance
members show high confidence in sustained critical winds of 25-35
mph and higher gusts through much of the day. Warm temperatures and
very dry conditions, with surface RH in the 6-10% range, will be
conducive for elevated and critical fire weather conditions along a
corridor from eastern Arizona eastward into portions of northern and
central New Mexico.

Fuel conditions and the nature of the fire weather threat across
southeastern New Mexico and far west Texas remain much less clear
after widespread precipitation in the previous 72 hours. Rapid
curing of lower and middle-elevation fuels, given the significant
dry/windy conditions, appears probable by mid afternoon. This
suggests the threat for widespread critical fire weather conditions
exists, but is somewhat conditional and likely limited to
lower-density fuels. The critical area was expanded slightly
eastward to account for this threat.

...Northern California...
Dry post-frontal flow is expected across the northern half of the
Central Valley through the day and into this evening. Low-level
winds, primarily from the north, are forecast to reach speeds of
10-20 mph through the day. Already limited surface moisture is
expected to gradually mix out through the afternoon, aided by a 50
kt mid-level jet on the backside of the departing Four Corners
trough. With surface temperatures expected to remain warm (in the
70s and 80s F), source humidity should fall to near 10-15% by peak
heating. Only modest recoveries to 30-35% are expected after sunset,
suggesting the threat may linger into the overnight hours. The
combination of meteorological factors and above-average fuel dryness
should easily support elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions across much of the Sacramento Valley through the forecast
period.

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

Models and ensembles remain in above average agreement days 3-7
and offer good run to run continuity. This bolsters forecast
confidence in a pattern expected to significantly amplify over
medium range time scales as upper troughs work into the West and
the East to sandwich a warming west-central U.S. upper ridge.
Variance remains with the timing and strength of smaller scale
systems, but guidance composites tend to mitigate these
differences consistent with predictability. Accordingly, the WPC
medium range product suite was primarily derived from a blend of
best clustered guidance of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, the 00 UTC
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models.
The latest 12 UTC models and ensembles remain very much in line
with this forecast strategy.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Heavy showers and storms remain likely from the central Gulf Coast
into the southeast Wednesday into Thursday, with additional
enhanced activity up across the East near a wavy front. A
developing coastal low Friday and Saturday along a trailing front
with renewed upper trough support should produce unsettled coastal
conditions to include some moderate rains for the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast.

Upstream over the western U.S., heat is expected to build in
response to the upper level ridge, with highs 10-20 degrees above
normal possible Wednesday-Friday. This will equate to some 100+
degree high temperatures for the lower elevations of eastern
California and southern Arizona. With the passage of the cold
front on Saturday with emergence of an upper trough over the West,
seasonal to below normal temperatures are expected for the
weekend. Trough amplification offers potential for some moderate
precipitation from the Pacific Northwest to the cooling Northern
Rockies where terrain enhanced snows are possible. Meanwhile, an
emerging downstream return flow pattern over the south-central
U.S. may set the stage for an expanding rainfall/strong convection
threat with deepening Gulf moisture and instability.

Extended Forecast Discussion

255 PM EDT Sun May 02 2021

Valid 12Z Wed May 05 2021 - 12Z Sun May 09 2021

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

Models and ensembles remain in above average agreement days 3-7
and offer good run to run continuity. This bolsters forecast
confidence in a pattern expected to significantly amplify over
medium range time scales as upper troughs work into the West and
the East to sandwich a warming west-central U.S. upper ridge.
Variance remains with the timing and strength of smaller scale
systems, but guidance composites tend to mitigate these
differences consistent with predictability. Accordingly, the WPC
medium range product suite was primarily derived from a blend of
best clustered guidance of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, the 00 UTC
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models.
The latest 12 UTC models and ensembles remain very much in line
with this forecast strategy.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Heavy showers and storms remain likely from the central Gulf Coast
into the southeast Wednesday into Thursday, with additional
enhanced activity up across the East near a wavy front. A
developing coastal low Friday and Saturday along a trailing front
with renewed upper trough support should produce unsettled coastal
conditions to include some moderate rains for the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast.

Upstream over the western U.S., heat is expected to build in
response to the upper level ridge, with highs 10-20 degrees above
normal possible Wednesday-Friday. This will equate to some 100+
degree high temperatures for the lower elevations of eastern
California and southern Arizona. With the passage of the cold

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 02 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0209 PM CDT Sun May 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

A stronger northerly/northwesterly pressure gradient and slightly
warmer temperatures in northern California suggest that critical
fire weather potential on Monday will be increased as compared to
today. However, these conditions still appear to be relatively brief
and localized to mostly western/southern portions of the Valley.
These limitations preclude a categorical upgrade to critical.

Conditions in Southwest Texas still appear locally elevated given
the current state of fuels in the Trans-Pecos, even after today's
high potential for drying. Farther northwest into southern New
Mexico/southeast Arizona, dry an windy conditions are still probable
ahead of surface boundaries to the north and west. Given the filling
cyclone to the east, the stronger mid-level winds to the south, and
the potential for increasing cloud cover during the afternoon,
conditions in this region also appear locally elevated despite more
receptive fuels.

..Wendt.. 05/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Sun May 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing across the Four Corners will gradually intensify
as it shifts eastward into the central Plains through Day2/Monday.
High pressure is forecast to increase over the West Coast, while
northwesterly flow aloft dominates the East. At the surface, a cold
front is forecast to move from the Rockies southeastward onto the
Plains, bringing cooler air and little fire weather activity to much
of the country.

...Northern California...
With poor overnight humidity recoveries expected from the scouring
of low-level moisture by the previous days frontal passage, elevated
fire weather conditions appear possible again across the Sacramento
Valley. The onshore pressure gradient will support down-valley winds
of 10-15 mph through the afternoon, though winds are forecast to
gradually weaken through the day as the mid-level jet shifts
eastward. Warm temperatures and little moisture will support
humidity values as low as 6-10%, suggesting elevated and locally
critical fire weather conditions are likely.

...Southwest Texas...
Ahead of the cold front forecast to move across through the
Southwest late in the period, dry and windy conditions may support
locally elevated fire weather potential along the Rio Grande Valley.
Warm surface temperatures and humidity near 15-20% are expected with
westerly winds of 10-15 mph. Relatively dry fuels will support some
potential for fire weather conditions until higher RH recoveries
develop with the passage of the front later in the evening.

...There is an Enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Plains through Monday morning and a Slight risk over
the Ohio Valley to the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday and
Tuesday...

...There is a Slight risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Central Plains and the Central Gulf Coast through Monday morning
and a risk over the Ohio Valley to the Lower Mississippi Valley on
Monday and Tuesday ...

...Late-season heavy snow to impact the Northern/Central Rockies
through
Monday...

A quasi-stationary front extending from the Northeast to the Upper
Midwest, then to the Southwest will move slowly to the Ohio Valley
roughly southwestward to the Lower Mississippi Valley by Tuesday
evening.  Additionally, upper-level impulses will move eastward
ahead of the boundary in the warm sector, moving to the Mid-
Atlantic through Tuesday.  Multiple days of severe thunderstorms
and heavy rain will be associated with this system from the
Central Plains to the Lower Mississippi Valley into parts of the
Ohio Valley and parts of the Southeast through Tuesday.

The SPC has issued an Enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Central Plains and a Slight risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys through Monday morning. Over the Central Plains, the main
hazards will be frequent lightning, severe thunderstorms wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. There is a 10% or greater
probability of wind gusts 65 knots or greater over parts of the
Central Plains.  Furthermore, the SPC has issued a Sight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee
Valleys through Monday morning. The main hazards associated with
the severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorms wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Moreover, heavy rain will be associated with the severe
thunderstorms.  The WPC has issued a Slight risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Central Plains and the Central Gulf
Coast through Monday morning.  The heavy rain will produce
scattered areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams the most vulnerable over regions of the Central
Plains and the Central Gulf Coast.

On Monday, the severe and flash flooding threat will move to parts
of the Ohio valley, Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley, and parts of
the Southern Plains.  The threat will extend from the Ohio
Valley/Central Appalachians to the Lower Mississippi Valley on
Tuesday.  In the meantime, showers and thunderstorms will extend
along the boundary from parts of the Upper Midwest to the
Northeast on Sunday and Monday.  Also, on Monday, showers and
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Southern
Appalachians/Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and continue on
Tuesday.

Meanwhile, an upper-level trough will develop over the Rockies.
The energy will produce wet snow over parts of the Northern
Rockies as rain moves into parts of the Northern/Central Plains
overnight Sunday.  On Monday, the wet snow will expand into parts
of the Central Rockies as scattered areas of wet snow and
lowerelevation rain continues over the Northern Rockies. The
lowerelevation rain and wet snow will continue over parts of
the Rockies on Tuesday. Elsewhere, a new front will move onshore
over the Pacific Northwest on Monday, moving inland by Monday
evening.  Late Monday morning, light rain will move into parts of
the Northwest.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0133 AM CDT Mon May 03 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Progressive mid-level flow is expected across the US during the
forecast period, as a Four Corners shortwave trough moves east into
the Plains. Weak ridging along the West Coast will be suppressed as
a second shortwave and jet max move onshore across northern
California this morning. At the surface, low pressure across the
Plains will draw moisture northward, while a cold front moves
southeast out of the Rockies.

...Northern California...
Dry northerly flow is expected to linger through the day across
portions of the Sacramento Valley exacerbating fire weather concerns
through the afternoon. Northerly surface flow around 15-20 mph
should continue down valley through the day, even as upper-level
flow decreases this afternoon. Dry surface conditions with RH around
10-15% are expected as evident in the poor humidity recoveries
currently ongoing early this morning. The overlap of dry and windy
conditions should support widespread elevated to locally critical
fire weather conditions across the Central Valley.

...Southwest Texas...
Ahead of a cold front forecast to move out of the southern Rockies
later this evening, dry and windy conditions will likely develop
from the Rio Grande Valley eastward across the Trans-Pecos region.
Fuels in this area are not particularly supportive of robust fire
weather conditions, given 1-2 inches of QPE over the last several
days. However, with west winds of 20-30 mph and surface RH as low as
15%, some threat for locally elevated fire weather conditions may
develop this afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0133 AM CDT Mon May 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Split mid-level flow will persist across the CONUS as shortwave
trough initially above the southern Plains will move eastward into
South through the day. Meanwhile, zonal flow will develop across the
Great Basin and Southwest as ridging becomes better established off
the West Coast. At the surface, high pressure across the central US,
and widespread precipitation across the eastern CONUS, will create
conditions generally unfavorable for widespread fire weather
activity. The only exception will be pockets of locally elevated
fire weather potential across the southern Great Basin, where
relatively warm and dry conditions will coexist with dry fuels. No
areas will be highlighted due to the limited spatial overlap of
favorable fire weather conditions.

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

An amplified upper level pattern will be in place across the
nation through Saturday with well developed troughs near the West
Coast and East Coast, with an upper ridge over the Rockies that
weakens with time as it emerges over the Plains.  As the trough
over the Northeast lifts out, a more quasi-zonal pattern is
expected by Sunday and Monday, with a second trough building
across the West by next Monday.

Models and ensembles remain in above average agreement through the
end of the week and offer good run to run continuity.  There is
some variance with the timing and strength of smaller scale
systems, but guidance composites tend to mitigate these
differences that is consistent with predictability.  The GFS
remains stronger and farther west with the coastal low near New
England Friday night compared to the other guidance, including the
GEFS mean, so a more offshore solution is being favored at this
time.  The greatest model spread resides across the Great Lakes
and Ohio Valley region by early next week, so more of the ensemble
means were incorporated for the Sunday through Monday time period.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Residual showers and some thunderstorms remain likely from the
central Gulf Coast into the southeast Wednesday into Thursday,
with additional enhanced activity up across the East near a wavy
front. A developing coastal low Friday and Saturday along a
trailing front with renewed upper trough support should produce
unsettled coastal conditions to include some moderate rains for
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, but the worst weather conditions
are expected to remain offshore.  By Sunday, another area of
enhanced rainfall is becoming more likely across portions of the
middle Mississippi River valley as deep Gulf moisture intersects a
stationary front, with locally 1-2 inches of rain possible.

Upstream over the western U.S., above normal temperatures are
likely from the Desert Southwest to the Intermountain West through
Friday, which will equate to some 100+ degree high temperatures
for the lower elevations of eastern California and southern
Arizona on Thursday.  With the passage of the cold front on
Saturday with emergence of an upper trough over the West, seasonal
to below normal temperatures are expected for the weekend.  Trough
amplification offers the potential for some moderate precipitation
from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern Rockies, where terrain
enhanced snows are possible.

...A spring cold front is set to bring multiple rounds of heavy
rain and severe thunderstorms today and Tuesday across a large
area that stretches from the Southern Plains and Mid-South to the
Southeast...

...Heavy snow in the Central Rockies to diminish by tonight...

Much of the attention to start the workweek will be associated
with a cold front marching across the central U.S. today and into
the East by Wednesday. As this frontal boundary swings
east-southeast, ample moisture ahead of the system will lead to
developing showers and thunderstorms. Starting with today, the
best chances for severe thunderstorms exist throughout the
Mid-South from southern Indiana to southeast Oklahoma. Showers and
thunderstorms are expected to form this evening and could
producing damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes.
The Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
weather (level 3 out of 5) across the region. Elsewhere, a warm
and humid airmass in place could pose a risk for a few isolated
severe thunderstorms across the Southeast. Damaging wind gusts and
hail will be a concern from Alabama northeastward into Georgia and
parts of the Carolinas through early this evening. Downpours
associated with the widespread shower and thunderstorm activity
may cause isolated instances of flash flooding as well.

By Tuesday, the aforementioned cold front is forecast to enter the
Ohio and Middle/Lower Mississippi valleys. As it does so, another
round of thunderstorms should develop and impact areas from the
Deep South to Ohio Valley. Strong wind gusts will be the primary
concern associated with the thunderstorm activity, with large hail
and isolated tornadoes also a possibility. SPC has issued an
Enhanced Risk of severe weather for Tuesday that includes
central/eastern Louisiana, Mississippi, northern/central Alabama,
south-central Tennessee, and far northwest Georgia. Along with the
severe thunderstorm threat, flash flooding will also be a concern
for the same region. The combination of heavy rain and previously
saturated soils could lead to rapid water rises in flood prone
areas.

A tale of two seasons will be found across the western half of the
country. Heavy snow is ongoing across the Central Rockies today,
while above normal temperatures and fire weather a concern in
California. Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories
are in effect across northern and central Colorado as up to a foot
of snow could accumulate by tonight, with the heaviest amounts
expected along and just east of the Continental Divide. Meanwhile,
high temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average will be found to
start the first full week of May throughout the Golden State. The
combination of warm temperatures, low relative humidity, expanding
drought conditions, and gusty winds cold produce an elevated fire
weather threat. Red Flag Warnings have been issued across Northern
California to highlight the potential for wildfires to spread
uncontrollably.

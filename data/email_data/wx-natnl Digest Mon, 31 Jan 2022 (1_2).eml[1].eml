Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1038 AM CST Sun Jan 30 2022

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The overall forecast remains on track with no changes. A few hours
of locally elevated fire weather conditions may occur across far
western NE where gusty winds of 15-20 mph may develop this
afternoon. Drying surface conditions and humidity below 20% should
support at least modest short-hour fuels, though coverage should
remain local. A few hours of locally elevated fire weather
conditions may also develop across parts of the Southeast. Low-level
winds behind the departing cold front may briefly reach 12-15 mph
with gusts as high as 20 mph across parts of GA and SC. Weak winds
and diurnal humidity values near 35% suggest that any fire weather
threat will remain local. See the previous discussion for more
information.

..Lyons.. 01/30/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0112 AM CST Sun Jan 30 2022/

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper air pattern will exist across the CONUS today,
with embedded mid-level troughs traversing the East Coast,
Intermountain West, and Texas. Corresponding weak surface lee
troughing is expected across the High Plains, with a surface low
poised to move across the southern Appalachians. Across the central
and southern High Plains, 15-25 percent surface RH will develop by
afternoon peak heating. While the surface wind field in Nebraska
(closer to the upper support) will likely be a bit stronger than the
southern High Plains, surface winds across much of the Plains states
are expected to be too weak on a widespread basis to support
significant wildfire-spread potential. Nonetheless, at least
localized wildfire growth may occur in terrain-favoring areas with
higher wind speeds, given the low RH and dry fuels in place.

Across portions of southern Georgia into central and southern South
Carolina, the surface low will encourage 10-15 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds amid 25-35 percent RH. The lower-end
meteorological surface conditions to support fire spread, and the
lack of more receptive fuels, precludes Elevated highlights this
outlook.

1240 PM CST Sun Jan 30 2022

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWESTERN
NEBRASKA...

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments. The
elevated area across the central High Plains was expand slightly
westward into portions of eastern WY where stronger winds, but more
marginal RH conditions appear likely to develop. Farther south
across western TX/OK, low-level winds still appear to be lower end,
but the presence of very dry air and fuels should result in
widespread elevated to locally critical conditions for part of the
afternoon. See below for additional info.

..Lyons.. 01/30/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CST Sun Jan 30 2022/

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude but progressive mid-level shortwave trough will
quickly cross the northern Rockies and overspread the northern
Plains tomorrow/Monday, with a belt of 60-80 kt 500 mb winds
overspreading a dry, mixed boundary layer. Surface lee troughing
will become established across the Plains states, with a surface low
also developing across the southern High Plains, encouraging the
development of dry and breezy flow.

...Western into central Nebraska...
The combination of downward momentum transport of the stronger flow
aloft, and gradient winds induced by surface lee troughing, will
support widespread 20+ mph sustained west-northwesterly winds across
much of northwestern into central Nebraska during the afternoon. By
afternoon peak heating, at least a couple hours of 15-20 percent RH
overlapping the stronger winds appears likely. Critical highlights
have been introduced, since fuels are at least modestly dry across
portions of the central High Plains that have experienced snow melt
and are experiencing a moderate to severe drought.

...Southern High Plains...
The development of a surface low across the southern High Plains
will encourage 15 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds across
extreme southwest Kansas into extreme northeast New Mexico and the
northern Texas into Oklahoma Panhandles. Dry air will usher in from
the southwest, promoting 15 percent RH amid the modest surface
winds. Given the very dry fuels across the area, Elevated highlights
have been introduced.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
140 PM EST Sun Jan 30 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Feb 2 2022 - 12Z Sun Feb 6 2022

...Heavy precipitation likely to impact the central and eastern
U.S. later this week, including a winter storm from the Central
Plains to Great Lakes and interior Northeast...

18Z Update:  Overall the 12Z model guidance suite is in good
overall agreement on the magnitude and timing of the
central-eastern U.S. storm system for the middle of the week, and
a multi-deterministic model blend sufficed as a starting point in
the forecast process.  The axis of highest snow/sleet
probabilities is very slightly adjusted southeast with this
forecast update from Missouri to Michigan, and significant icing
remains a threat just south of this corridor across northern
Arkansas, southeast Missouri, and western portions of Tennessee
and Kentucky.  Lesser amounts of ice are still possible across
portions of northern Texas and eastern Oklahoma.  After this front
and its precipitation emerges off the East Coast, a cold but
mainly dry weather pattern is expected across the majority of the
nation for next weekend.  By this time, the GFS remains more
amplified with both a trough dropping southeastward across the
northern Rockies and a cut-off low over the southwestern U.S., so
less weighting was applied to the GFS and more to the ensemble
means for days 6 and 7.  The previous forecast discussion is
appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Mean troughing should dominate much of the CONUS east of the
Rockies as strong upper ridging builds over both the western
Atlantic and East Pacific. A shortwave initially over the
Southwest on Wednesday will drive a potent cold front eastward
through Friday bringing widespread heavy rain to the South and a
potentially significant winter storm from the mid-Mississippi
Valley to the interior Northeast. Additional waves of shortwave
energy dropping down the east side of the ridge in the West,
should help reinforce mean troughing across the central U.S.
through next weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance has come into overall good agreement regarding an
amplified shortwave initially across the Southwest on Wednesday
and into the Southern Plains/Mid-South Thursday-Friday. There
remain some minor differences in the shortwave timing (ECMWF has
been consistently slightly faster than the GFS), which ultimately
affects frontal timing, especially into the East. Albeit
differences in timing and placement, guidance shows this energy
may ultimately combine with a northern stream shortwave through
the Great Lakes/Northeast late this week to help induce a
deepening surface low well off the Northeast Coast. Given the
overall agreement, a general model compromise between the latest
runs of the deterministic models seemed a good starting point for
now through day 5 for this system which also maintained good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast.

Next energy drops into the mean trough out of the West by Friday
and the models continue to struggle both with strength and timing
of the shortwave. Recent model runs have been back and forth
between a weaker/faster shortwave and a stronger/slower possible
closed low lingering over the Southwest for a day or two. At least
through the latest 12z/18z (yesterday) guidance, the ECMWF and CMC
are weaker and faster while the 18z GFS is notably more
amplified/slower. The bulk of the ensemble guidance would support
something more towards the quicker ECMWF/CMC so that's the way the
WPC forecast leaned tonight.

Yet another shortwave rounding the top of the ridge drops into the
Northern Rockies by Saturday. Much of the guidance shows the
shortwave progress rather harmlessly south and eastward into the
northern/central Plains on Sunday, but the last few runs of the
GFS have been quite aggressive with deepening this energy and a
closed low forming over the Southwest. Ensemble plots suggest the
GFS is likely much too deep with this, and the actual solution may
be somewhere in the middle of a significantly weaker/faster ECMWF
and the GFS (similar to the 12z CMC). The best course of action
for the WPC forecast for next weekend was to stay close to the
ensemble means, with lesser influence from the CMC and ECMWF just
for some added system definition across the board.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The deepening trough in the West will initially bring light to
moderate precipitation across the central/southern Rockies and the
Four Corners region on Wednesday. Ahead of this, ample Gulf
moisture will be drawn northward ahead of the trough and
associated surface cold front. This should result in widespread
moderate to heavy precipitation from the southern Plains into the
Northeast Wednesday and Thursday. The best chance for heavy
rainfall extends from the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley into parts of the lower Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the
Appalachians and the East. The overall pattern would certainly
support at least local spots excessive rainfall/flash flooding,
but the exact locations remain quite uncertain and dependent on
smaller scale detail differences, and impeded by an overall lack
of instability.

Possibly the bigger threat however is the increasing potential for
a significant winter storm on the backside of this system from the
central Plains into the Midwest/Lower Great Lakes and eventually
the interior Northeast. Heavy accumulating snow is likely, while
possible impactful sleet and freezing rain just to the south
within the transition zone between the rain to the south and snow
to the north. Exact amounts of any wintry precipitation remain in
flux at this point and highly dependent on the lower-confidence
details of ejecting shortwave energy, frontal waves, and timing of
colder temperatures.

Above average temperatures (generally +10-15F) will spread across
the East Wednesday-Thursday. Meanwhile, as arctic high pressure
dives into the central U.S. behind the cold front midweek,
downright chilly and much below normal temperatures will spread
from the northern Rockies/High Plains all the way as far south as
Texas. Widespread daytime highs (and slightly less extreme
overnight lows) as much as 10-25 degrees below average are likely
with some locally higher spots especially Thursday across parts of
Oklahoma and north/central Texas. These temperatures may moderate
slightly as they shift east into the Ohio Valley/Gulf Coast states
next Friday and the East on Saturday, though Texas remains below
average through the end of the week. The West Coast states should
be near normal through much of next week owing to amplified
ridging across the East Pacific.

...Storm system to produce locally heavy snow across the northern
Cascades/Rockies tonight before impacting the Northern Plains with
gusty winds and potential blizzard conditions beginning Monday
evening...

...Heavy rain and scattered flash floods possible throughout
southeast Texas on Monday...


A potent cold front traversing the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Rockies tonight will spread moderate snowfall across the higher
terrain, with totals up to a foot in spots. Additionally, gusty
winds could reduce visibility at times and make travel very
difficult. By Monday morning, an area of low pressure is expected
to strengthen and move eastward across far southern Canada. This
will create a strong pressure gradient across the Northern Plains
on Monday and thus the potential for high winds. Where there
remains substantial fresh snow depth, blizzard conditions are
possible by Monday evening. High Wind Warnings and Watches have
been issued for parts of Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota.
Winter Storm Watches have been issued throughout eastern North
Dakota and northwestern Minnesota to highlight the potential for
light snow and simultaneous wind gusts as high as 60 mph.

Farther south, an upper-level low ejecting out of the Southwest
will spawn numerous showers and scattered thunderstorms across
southeast Texas on Monday. The main hazard forecast throughout
this region is expected to be associated with locally heavy rain.
A few thunderstorms will have the potential to produce sufficient
rainfall rates while remaining nearly stationary. This will create
the possibility of scattered instances of flash flooding. A Slight
Risk (level 2/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued for an area
that roughly situates between Houston, Corpus Christi, and Austin,
TX.

Elsewhere, the combination of low relative humidity and gusty
winds will potentially lead to critical fire weather throughout
western and central Nebraska on Monday. Meanwhile, a warming trend
is on the way for the eastern half of the U.S. ahead of an
approaching cold front that should bisect the country from the
Great Lakes to the Southern Plains by Tuesday night. Warm
southerly winds will allow for well above normal temperatures to
surge from the Gulf of Mexico to the Midwest to start the
workweek. Showers are expected to develop across the
Mid-Mississippi Valley on Tuesday as the aforementioned cold front
clashes with the warm airmass. Finally, after a bitter cold last
few days Florida and the majority of the East Coast will enjoy
temperatures only slightly below average on Monday and Tuesday.

"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Storm system to produce locally heavy snow across the northern
Cascades/Rockies tonight before impacting the Northern Plains with
gusty winds and potential blizzard conditions beginning Monday
evening...

...Heavy rain and scattered flash floods possible throughout
southeast Texas on Monday...


A potent cold front traversing the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Rockies tonight will spread moderate snowfall across the higher
terrain, with totals up to a foot in spots. Additionally, gusty
winds could reduce visibility at times and make travel very
difficult. By Monday morning, an area of low pressure is expected
to strengthen and move eastward across far southern Canada. This
will create a strong pressure gradient across the Northern Plains
on Monday and thus the potential for high winds. Where there
remains substantial fresh snow depth, blizzard conditions are
possible by Monday evening. High Wind Warnings and Watches have
been issued for parts of Montana, Wyoming, and North/South Dakota.
Winter Storm Watches have been issued throughout eastern North
Dakota and northwestern Minnesota to highlight the potential for
light snow and simultaneous wind gusts as high as 60 mph.

Farther south, an upper-level low ejecting out of the Southwest
will spawn numerous showers and scattered thunderstorms across
southeast Texas on Monday. The main hazard forecast throughout
this region is expected to be associated with locally heavy rain.
A few thunderstorms will have the potential to produce sufficient
rainfall rates while remaining nearly stationary. This will create
the possibility of scattered instances of flash flooding. A Slight
Risk (level 2/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued for an area
that roughly situates between Houston, Corpus Christi, and Austin,
TX.

Elsewhere, the combination of low relative humidity and gusty
winds will potentially lead to critical fire weather throughout
western and central Nebraska on Monday. Meanwhile, a warming trend
is on the way for the eastern half of the U.S. ahead of an
approaching cold front that should bisect the country from the
Great Lakes to the Southern Plains by Tuesday night. Warm
southerly winds will allow for well above normal temperatures to
surge from the Gulf of Mexico to the Midwest to start the
workweek. Showers are expected to develop across the
Mid-Mississippi Valley on Tuesday as the aforementioned cold front
clashes with the warm airmass. Finally, after a bitter cold last
few days Florida and the majority of the East Coast will enjoy
temperatures only slightly below average on Monday and Tuesday.

...Heavy rainfall likely across the central Gulf Coast and
Tennessee Valley on Thursday, with a significant winter storm from
the Midwest to Great Lakes and interior Northeast...


...Overview...

Mean troughing should dominate much of the CONUS through the
medium range as strong upper ridging builds over both the western
Atlantic and East Pacific. A shortwave initially over the Rockies
on Thursday will drive a potent cold front eastward through Friday
bringing widespread heavy rain to the South and a potentially
significant winter storm from the Ohio Valley to the interior
Northeast. Additional waves of shortwave energy dropping down the
east side of the ridge in the West, should help reinforce mean
troughing across the central U.S. through next weekend, while
northern stream shortwaves send a series of low pressure systems
across the northern tier states.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to exhibit overall good agreement regarding an
amplified shortwave initially over the Rockies on Thursday and
into the Mid-South/East Friday-Saturday. There remain some
differences in the shortwave timing especially into the East,
though the CMC is notably more amplified with this system as a
whole. Guidance shows this energy may ultimately combine with a
northern stream shortwave through the Great Lakes/Northeast late
this week to help induce a deepening surface low well off the
Northeast Coast. A general non-CMC model compromise seemed a good
starting point for now through day 5 for this system which also
maintained good continuity with the previous WPC forecast.

After this, the guidance shows another couple of shortwaves
rounding the top of the ridge and diving into the Southwest, the
first on Friday and the next on Sunday. There continues to be some
pretty significant variability in strength and timing of these
systems, especially the second one. With that one, the GFS has
consistently been much stronger in showing a deep closed low
settling into the Southwest/northern Baja California
Sunday-Monday. The ECMWF is back and forth between a similar
closed low solution and a weaker/more progressive shortwave into
the Plains. The 31/12z CMC has a nice middle ground. At this
point, given the uncertainty and run to run inconsistencies, it
seemed prudent to lean more on the ensemble means during the
latter half of the forecast period, although ensemble plots show
enough support amongst various members for either solution.

Northern stream shortwaves will drive a train of low pressure
systems across the northern Plains/Great Lakes region through the
period. The models show better agreement overall on these than in
the more volatile southern stream, but given timing and
interaction with that southern stream, there remains plenty of
uncertainty in the details. Some incorporation of the
deterministic solutions late period helped to bring some added
definition to these systems where the ensemble means may tend to
wash out.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Amplified trough out of the Southwest on Thursday will continue to
threat for heavy rainfall and a significant winter storm to the
north into the Thursday-Friday time period. Ample Gulf moisture
will be drawn northward ahead of the trough and associated surface
cold front resulting in widespread moderate to heavy precipitation
from the lower Mississippi Valley into the Northeast. Best chance
for heavy rainfall extends from the central Gulf Coast on Thursday
into the southern/central Appalachians and interior East. The
overall pattern continues to support a threat for excessive
rainfall/flash flooding. Although plenty of uncertainties in the
details linger, models seem to be better latching onto the
greatest threat from the central Gulf Coast into the Tennessee
Valley where anomalous precipitable water values, lift, and
moderate instability should support several inches of rainfall
across this region.

On there north side, the threat for a significant winter storm
into parts of the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes/interior Northeast will
continue from the short range period. Heavy accumulating snow is
likely, while possible impactful sleet and freezing rain just to
the south within the transition zone between the rain to the south
and snow to the north. Exact amounts of any wintry precipitation
remain highly dependent on the lower-confidence details of
ejecting shortwave energy, frontal waves, and timing of colder
temperatures.

Above average temperatures (generally +10-15F) will spread across
the East Thursday-Friday. Meanwhile, as arctic high pressure dives
into the central U.S. behind the cold front midweek, downright
chilly and much below normal temperatures will spread from the
Central U.S. to the Midwest and eventually the East by the
weekend. Widespread daytime highs (and slightly less extreme
overnight lows) as much as 10-25 degrees below average are likely
with values as much as 30-35 below normal as far south as Oklahoma
and north/central Texas. These temperatures may moderate slightly
as they shift east into the Ohio Valley/Gulf Coast states next
Friday and the East on Saturday. The West Coast states should be
near normal into weekend, trending slightly warmer the rest of the
period owing to amplified ridging across the East Pacific.

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWESTERN
NEBRASKA...

...Synopsis...
A well-defined, progressive mid-level trough will eject into the
northern Plains today, with a belt of 60-80 kt 500 mb flow
overspreading the region by afternoon. At the surface, intense lee
troughing across the Plains states along with boundary-layer mixing
will promote critically dry and windy conditions across parts of the
northern Plains, with dry and occasionally breezy conditions also
likely across parts of the southern High Plains.

...Northern Plains...
By afternoon peak heating, gradient flow associated with the surface
lee trough, along with downward momentum transport of the stronger
flow aloft, will foster widespread 20+ mph sustained westerly
surface winds coinciding with 15-20 percent RH. Given dry fuels
across the region, Critical highlights have been maintained,
particularly where the most favorable surface wind/RH overlap is
expected to last for at least 3 hours.

...Southern High Plains...
Upper support is expected to be weaker compared to points farther
north. Nonetheless, very dry air emanating from the higher terrain
of the southern Rockies, due to downslope flow and some surface lee
troughing, will promote modest conditions for wildfire spread. 15
mph sustained winds may become common across several areas through
the afternoon in addition to 10-20 percent RH, which will overspread
very dry fuels cured by an extreme to exceptional drought.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CST Mon Jan 31 2022

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level longwave trough will further amplify while ejecting into
the Plains states tomorrow/Tuesday, with cooler air and associated
surface high pressure surging southeastward across the Plains.
Overall cool conditions will limit wildfire-spread concerns across
most of the CONUS. South of a surface cold front, some dry downslope
flow is likely across southeast New Mexico into western Texas, with
RH dipping into the 15-25 percent range by afternoon peak heating.
However, guidance consensus suggests that wind speeds will be too
weak to warrant fire weather highlights this outlook.

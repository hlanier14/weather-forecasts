Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1142 AM CDT Fri Apr 09 2021

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NEW MEXICO AND WEST
TEXAS...

The elevated area across western Oklahoma and northwest Texas was
expanded slightly eastward to account for dryline positioning this
afternoon. A slight expansion northward across eastern Colorado and
western Kansas was also implemented for dry and windy post-frontal
conditions. Otherwise, the previous forecast remains valid with only
minor changes based on the latest hi-res guidance.

..Lyons.. 04/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1156 PM CDT Thu Apr 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
Multiple mid-level shortwave troughs will move eastward across the
central/southern Plains today. A belt of enhanced mid-level westerly
winds will also exist across parts of the Southwest and southern
High Plains. At the surface, a low is forecast to remain over
central TX through the day, with a cold front surging southward
across the central/southern Plains. A dryline will extend southward
from the surface low into south-central TX.

...Southern/Central Rockies and Adjacent High Plains...
Boundary-layer mixing is expected to lead to an increase in
strong/gusty surface winds behind the dryline extending across a
broad swath of NM into west TX by early this afternoon. Sustained
west-northwesterly winds of 20-25 mph appear likely from
northwestern/central NM into far west TX and the Edwards Plateau
region. Stronger gusts of 35-45 mph appear possible, especially in
the higher terrain. Diurnal heating and low-level downslope
warming/drying will easily lead to critically lowered RH values
across a broad portion of NM and west TX. RH values will likely
bottom out in the 5-15% range for several hours this afternoon. The
ongoing critical area has been expanded into parts of
northwestern/central/southeastern NM, where a combination of these
strong/gusty winds, reduced RH values, and dry/receptive fuels
appears likely. Confidence has also increased that the dryline will
extend farther eastward into central TX, and the elevated/critical
areas have likewise been expanded eastward into more of this region.

Strong/gusty northerly winds of 20-30 mph also appear likely today
behind the cold front across parts of the central High Plains, the
OK/TX Panhandles, and western OK. Although fuels may be in some form
of green up across the southern High Plains, these enhanced winds
coupled with reduced RH values of 15-25% may foster enough drying of
fine fuels/grasses to support some threat for large fire spread. The
elevated area has therefore been expanded eastward across these
areas to account for this potential.

...Northern Plains...
Strong northerly winds of 15-25 mph will occur behind a cold front
this afternoon across parts of the northern Plains. Even though
temperatures will be relatively cool, RH values should still drop
into the 15-25% range. Latest data indicates fuels remain very dry
across western ND and vicinity. There is some potential for light,
wetting precipitation early this morning. But, most of this should
be no more than 0.10-0.20 inch, and the strong/gusty winds may still
dry fine fuels enough later today to support fire spread. The
elevated area has been adjusted to account for where consensus of
latest guidance shows the best potential overlap of lowered RH
values and strong/gusty winds.

...Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat as well as
additional heavy rainfall possible across parts of the South next
week...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period (Monday-Friday) will feature a fairly
blocky pattern as strong upper level ridging in Canada and a deep
closed low meandering off the Canadian Maritimes inhibits much
movement of features over the lower 48. One upper low should
weaken as it moves slowly across the Great Lakes through much of
next week while the Canadian Maritimes upper low rotates and
retrogrades slowly westward. Meanwhile, energy drops into the
Western U.S. forming a closed low by Tuesday which looks to sit
over the Great Basin area for several days before possibly
beginning to drift eastward next Friday.

Latest model and ensemble guidance shows greater than average
agreement on the overall pattern, but continue to differ on the
details, especially the second half of the period with respect to
multiple low pressure areas across the Great Lakes/Northeast. Out
West, guidance does agree upper low energy should linger much of
the week, but there are questions on how quickly it begins to
shift eastward on day 7. Both the latest runs of the ECMWF/CMC
want to hold back the energy to along the West Coast, while the
GFS is the quickest to eject it eastward (owing mostly to a
weakening of upper ridging to the north). The ensemble means,
although much more subdued, do tend to hold the energy back more
than the GFS (but maybe not as much as the ECMWF).

The WPC medium range product suite leaned heavily on the
deterministic guidance days 3-4 (ECMWF/GFS/CMC) and transitioned
towards majority ensemble means thereafter. Continued smaller
contributions from the ECMWF/CMC for added detail and system
definition. This approach fit well with previous shift continuity.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Northern stream closed low energies over the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes early in the week should keep the threat for showers in the
forecast across the Northeast with wrap back snow possible across
parts of the far northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley. A wavy
trailing front will settle over the South/Gulf Coast region and
offer potential for another round of heavy rainfall from the Lower
Mississippi Valley to parts of the Southeast next week. While
there are differences in exact rainfall amounts, this region has
seen much above normal precipitation over the past few weeks
already, so any additional rainfall could present flood concerns.
Moderate to locally heavy rainfall is also possible farther
upstream into the Southern Plains as uncertain ejecting southern
stream impulses locally focus lift and moisture. Temperatures
across the east will begin slightly above normal before
transitioning to closer to average by later in the week.

An amplifying upper trough/closed low over a cooled West next week
should bring some terrain enhanced precipitation over the Great
Basin, but the greater threat is for prolonged periods of heavy
upslope snow over parts of the Central Rockies/High Plains as
ample Canadian surface high pressure digs and settles southward.
Temperatures within this airmass appear to be 10 to 20 degrees
below normal, especially from eastern Montana to the Central High
Plains.

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 12 2021 - 12Z Fri Apr 16 2021

...Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat as well as
additional heavy rainfall possible across parts of the South next
week...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period (Monday-Friday) will feature a fairly
blocky pattern as strong upper level ridging in Canada and a deep
closed low meandering off the Canadian Maritimes inhibits much
movement of features over the lower 48. One upper low should
weaken as it moves slowly across the Great Lakes through much of
next week while the Canadian Maritimes upper low rotates and
retrogrades slowly westward. Meanwhile, energy drops into the
Western U.S. forming a closed low by Tuesday which looks to sit
over the Great Basin area for several days before possibly
beginning to drift eastward next Friday.

Latest model and ensemble guidance shows greater than average
agreement on the overall pattern, but continue to differ on the
details, especially the second half of the period with respect to
multiple low pressure areas across the Great Lakes/Northeast. Out
West, guidance does agree upper low energy should linger much of
the week, but there are questions on how quickly it begins to
shift eastward on day 7. Both the latest runs of the ECMWF/CMC
want to hold back the energy to along the West Coast, while the
GFS is the quickest to eject it eastward (owing mostly to a
weakening of upper ridging to the north). The ensemble means,
although much more subdued, do tend to hold the energy back more
than the GFS (but maybe not as much as the ECMWF).

The WPC medium range product suite leaned heavily on the
deterministic guidance days 3-4 (ECMWF/GFS/CMC) and transitioned
towards majority ensemble means thereafter. Continued smaller
contributions from the ECMWF/CMC for added detail and system
definition. This approach fit well with previous shift continuity.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Northern stream closed low energies over the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes early in the week should keep the threat for showers in the
forecast across the Northeast with wrap back snow possible across
parts of the far northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley. A wavy
trailing front will settle over the South/Gulf Coast region and
offer potential for another round of heavy rainfall from the Lower
Mississippi Valley to parts of the Southeast next week. While
there are differences in exact rainfall amounts, this region has
seen much above normal precipitation over the past few weeks
already, so any additional rainfall could present flood concerns.
Moderate to locally heavy rainfall is also possible farther
upstream into the Southern Plains as uncertain ejecting southern
stream impulses locally focus lift and moisture. Temperatures
across the east will begin slightly above normal before
transitioning to closer to average by later in the week.

An amplifying upper trough/closed low over a cooled West next week
should bring some terrain enhanced precipitation over the Great
Basin, but the greater threat is for prolonged periods of heavy
upslope snow over parts of the Central Rockies/High Plains as
ample Canadian surface high pressure digs and settles southward.
Temperatures within this airmass appear to be 10 to 20 degrees
below normal, especially from eastern Montana to the Central High
Plains.

FXUS21 KWNC 091806
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 09 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is anticipated to bring below normal
temperatures and potentially hazardous cold over many parts of the central and
eastern lower 48. A stalled frontal boundary forecast across the southeastern
lower 48 early in the period supports the potential for heavy rainfall across
the Gulf of Mexico coastal states. Mid-level high pressure forecast over
western North America is expected to promote unseasonably warm temperatures
for
the western contiguous U.S., and a moderation of temperatures across much of
Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures over much of the central and
eastern CONUS, Fri-Thu, Apr 17-21.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley
and the Southeast, Fri-Sat, Apr 17-19.



DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY APRIL 12 - FRIDAY APRIL 16:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!v8xhZEXR3MUE6QrHh6OC-FuQ-mLzF1SIbMlwoWpjY_nMs2s8lZi3kO48ABdv6He7j9MKRrWH$

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 17 - FRIDAY APRIL 23: There continues to be relatively good
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble mean 500-hPa height anomalies
during week-2, with strong negative height departures over the eastern half of
North America. The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means indicate positive mid-level
height anomalies across the western half of North America, with the ECMWF
anomalies being noticeably higher than the GEFS. As mid-level shortwave
troughing shifts across the eastern CONUS, cold air is anticipated to spill
southward from central Canada into the central CONUS at the beginning of the
period, with the anomalous cold shifting eastward by the middle of the period.
The slight risk of much below normal temperatures remainshighlighted today
across much of the central and eastern CONUS, Apr 17 to 21. This hazard region
covers a broad area where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at
least
a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and
below freezing over the Great Plains and Midwest early in the period, and
expanding into parts of the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee
Valley, mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Southeast by the middle of the period,
where temperatures may fall below the lowest 15th percentile and 40 deg F.
These areas further south are included in the risk due to the heightened
concern for impacts to vulnerable emerging spring vegetation, which may occur
even if temperatures stay slightly above freezing. Both the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles depict a transition to more zonal mid-level flow toward the end of
the week, indicating a shift to milder temperatures. The North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) is forecast to transition from weakly negative to a more
neutral phase during week-2, also supporting a moderation of temperatures
across the central CONUS by the end of the period.



Upstream, anomalous ridging continues to be favored by both the GEFS and ECMWF
across western North America, which is expected to promote unseasonably warm
temperatures for portions of the western CONUS. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools do not show support for widespread maximum temperatures across the
Desert
Southwest exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 Deg F, compared to earlier in
the week, precluding a much above normal temperature hazard from being
designated. These anomalous warm temperatures could still support increased
evapotranspiration, which could worsen soil moisture conditions. This would
especially be of concern for areas currently experiencing severe drought. Both
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools do show at least a 20% chance of exceeding
the 85th percentile and 85 DegF across parts of central California, with the
ECMWF showing the possibility of localized inland areas possibly exceeding 90
Deg F toward the end of the period. Due to significant model guidance
uncertainty regarding the potential of exceeding 90 Deg F, a much above normal
temperature hazard is not depicted at this time.



Although there is good agreement between the ensembles with the mid-level
pattern aloft, there continues to be some differences regarding the potential
for heavy rain between the models across the southern tier of the CONUS. A
stalled frontal boundary is possible early in the period, ahead of the
troughing upstream to the west, and both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict
mean surface low pressure and southerly flow across the Gulf of Mexico which
support enhanced precipitation over the southeastern U.S. The ECMWF reforecast
tool shows a stronger signal compared to yesterday of at least a 20% chance of
3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch along
the Gulf of Mexico Coast and inland across parts of the Southeast. The GEFS
reforecast tool continues to not be as robust with this potential, but its
uncalibrated ensemble guidance shows an increased signal for heavy rain during
the 8 to 10 day period. Thus, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is
maintained for the Gulf of Mexico coastal states for Apr 17 to 19, as
above-normal precipitation across the Southeast is also historically
consistent
with the negative phase of the NAO during April. By the middle of the period,
the frontal boundary is forecast to move offshore with surface high pressure
building in behind it, ending the threat for heavy precipitation.



Across the Alaska region, a transition from positive mid-level positive height
departures at the beginning of the period to near normal by the middle is
anticipated. This pattern favors above normal temperatures for the state
throughout the period. Minimum temperatures are predicted to remain well below
freezing for the majority of Alaska, which would decrease the likelihood for
river ice breakup, which typically begins later in May.



Although this pattern change and the accompanying warmer temperatures is
likely
to help bring an end to the cold spell forecast for much of the state during
early April, attention will turn to any anomalous warm pattern that develops
following the predicted cold pattern over Alaska, which may lead to
accelerated
snowmelt and increase the risk of localized flooding during river ice breakup
season. Based on the latest guidance, the greatest likelihood for above-normal
temperatures during week-2 is across the northern Mainland. However,
temperatures in northern Alaska are expected to remain well below freezing
during week-2, and climatologically, river ice breakup in this region
typically
begins later in May.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 PM CDT Fri Apr 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Central Florida...
Ahead of the shortwave trough across the Mid South, warm and breezy
southwesterly flow is expected to develop across much of the Florida
Peninsula. Temperatures in the upper 80s to near 90 F will support
surface RH of 25-35% with southerly flow of 10 to 15 mph. Little
recent rainfall and 90-95th percentile ERC values across much of
central and northern Florida will likely support elevated fire
weather potential before thunderstorm chances increase later in the
period.

...Northern/Central High Plains...
Considerable uncertainty remains on the longevity of warm, dry, and
breezy conditions in the post frontal downslope regime across
eastern Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas. A period of brief
elevated fire weather potential appears possible before cooling
temperatures result in better RH recoveries. No areas will be added
yet due to limited confidence.

Negligible changes have been made to the rest of the forecast. See
the previous discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 04/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1158 PM CDT Thu Apr 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
One upper trough/low should move eastward from the Plains to the mid
MS Valley on Saturday, while another shortwave trough amplifies over
the northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Moderately enhanced
mid-level west-northwesterly flow will remain over portions of the
Southwest and southern High Plains. At the surface, a low should
deepen over the northern High Plains, with lee troughing becoming
established across the central/southern High Plains by Saturday
afternoon.

...Southwest into the Southern Rockies and Adjacent High Plains...
A broad elevated area has been included for parts of eastern AZ into
much of NM and a small part of far west TX for Saturday. Across this
region, sustained winds of at least 15-20 mph appear likely for a
few hours Saturday afternoon. With ample diurnal heating expected
once again, RH should fall into the 7-15% on a fairly widespread
basis. These forecast meteorological conditions coupled with
continued dry to very fuels will likely foster widespread elevated
to locally critical fire weather conditions. A portion of western
and southern NM may have slightly better potential for 20+ mph
sustained winds in closer proximity to the stronger mid-level flow.
If current model trends continue, this area may need an upgrade to
critical in a subsequent outlook update.

...Northern/Central High Plains...
A cold front is forecast to move southeastward across the northern
High Plains on Saturday. Strong/gusty post-frontal winds will occur,
and RH values may briefly become lowered immediately behind the
front before temperatures quickly cool. Some potential for briefly
elevated fire weather conditions appears possible across parts of
central/eastern MT, but too much uncertainty exists to introduce an
elevated area just yet. Farther south into WY, strong westerly
downslope low-level flow may develop Saturday afternoon, but there
are differences in model guidance regarding the strength of these
winds and related reduction in RH values. Furthermore, fuels appear
either unreceptive or just marginally receptive. Given this
potentially limiting factor, will defer possible inclusion of an
elevated area.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri April 09 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 15 - 19 2021

There is good agreement in the dynamical model guidance among the predicted
500-hPa height and surface mean sea level pressure patterns across North
America for the 6-10 day period. Models agree well in predicting positive
mid-level height anomalies across Alaska and the northwestern CONUS. Negative
500-hPa height anomalies are favored over most of the remainder of the CONUS,
associated with a broad mean trough, with heights becoming near-normal over
parts of the Florida Peninsula.

Above normal temperatures are favored over Alaska and parts of the western
CONUS underneath above-normal 500-hPa heights and sinking air aloft. Colder
air
in Canada is expected to shift southward into the central CONUS to as far
south
as Texas, increasing probabilities of below-normal temperatures across the
Great Plains along with the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, with the
highest probabilities exceeding 80% over the parts of the Central and Southern
Plains. For parts of the Northeast and Southeast, above-normal temperatures
are
favored, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

With mean mid-level troughing and a storm track across the Gulf of Alaska,
above-normal precipitation is favored across parts of northern Mainland
Alaska.
Ridging and positive 500-hPa heights favor below normal precipitation for
parts
of southern Alaska. Below normal precipitation is favored over much of the
West
Coast, Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and eastward across the Upper and Middle
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley, associated with surface high
pressure that is expected to dominate through much of the period. At the base
and ahead of the mean trough over the eastern CONUS, above-normal
precipitation
is favored from the Southern Plains eastward to the Southeast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among models and forecast tools, offset by some disagreement in
the surface and mid-level height fields over Alaska.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 17 - 23 2021

The 500-hPa geopotential height pattern across North America during Week-2
indicates an eastward progression of the pattern from the 6-10 day period.
Today's model solutions agree well with above-normal mid-level heights
predicted across Alaska and most of the western CONUS. Over the eastern half
of
the CONUS, below-normal 500-hPa heights are favored, associated with an
amplified mean trough.

Forecast above normal 500-hPa heights over Alaska and predominant southerly
flow over the Alaska Panhandle enhance probabilities of near to above-normal
temperatures over the entire state. Above-normal temperatures are favored in
the western third of the CONUS, underneath positive mid-level height anomalies
and sinking air aloft. An amplified mean trough over the eastern CONUS and
surface high pressure on its western periphery favor enhanced odds of
below-normal temperatures from the Great Plains to much of the East Coast.
However, above-normal temperatures are likely in northern New England and the
southern  Florida Peninsula consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Mean surface low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska favors below-normal
precipitation in its wake over parts of southern Alaska. Near to above normal
precipitation is favored for parts of northern Mainland Alaska consistent with
the consolidation forecast tool. Ridging aloft and above-normal 500-hPa
heights
favor below-normal precipitation across the western CONUS, Great Basin,
Northern and Central Plains, and eastward to much of the Mississippi,
Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys. Above-normal precipitation is favored for parts
of
the Southern High Plains and Southeast, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement in the modeled temperature and precipitation fields across
North
America, offset by some uncertainty in the mid-level height pattern over the
North Pacific and southern Alaska.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

...Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat as well as
additional heavy rainfall possible across parts of the South next
week...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period (Monday-Friday) will feature a fairly
blocky pattern as strong upper level ridging in Canada and a deep
closed low meandering off the Canadian Maritimes inhibits much
movement of features over the lower 48. One upper low should
weaken as it moves slowly across the Great Lakes through much of
next week while the Canadian Maritimes upper low rotates and
retrogrades slowly westward. Meanwhile, energy drops into the
Western U.S. forming a closed low by Tuesday which looks to sit
over the Great Basin area for several days before possibly
beginning to drift eastward next Friday.

Latest model and ensemble guidance shows greater than average
agreement on the overall pattern, but continue to differ on the
details, especially the second half of the period with respect to
multiple low pressure areas across the Great Lakes/Northeast. Out
West, guidance does agree upper low energy should linger much of
the week, but there are questions on how quickly it begins to
shift eastward on day 7. Both the latest runs of the ECMWF/CMC
want to hold back the energy to along the West Coast, while the
GFS is the quickest to eject it eastward (owing mostly to a
weakening of upper ridging to the north). The ensemble means,
although much more subdued, do tend to hold the energy back more
than the GFS (but maybe not as much as the ECMWF).

The WPC medium range product suite leaned heavily on the
deterministic guidance days 3-4 (ECMWF/GFS/CMC) and transitioned
towards majority ensemble means thereafter. Continued smaller
contributions from the ECMWF/CMC for added detail and system
definition. This approach fit well with previous shift continuity.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Northern stream closed low energies over the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes early in the week should keep the threat for showers in the
forecast across the Northeast with wrap back snow possible across
parts of the far northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley. A wavy
trailing front will settle over the South/Gulf Coast region and
offer potential for another round of heavy rainfall from the Lower
Mississippi Valley to parts of the Southeast next week. While
there are differences in exact rainfall amounts, this region has
seen much above normal precipitation over the past few weeks
already, so any additional rainfall could present flood concerns.
Moderate to locally heavy rainfall is also possible farther
upstream into the Southern Plains as uncertain ejecting southern
stream impulses locally focus lift and moisture. Temperatures
across the east will begin slightly above normal before
transitioning to closer to average by later in the week.

An amplifying upper trough/closed low over a cooled West next week
should bring some terrain enhanced precipitation over the Great
Basin, but the greater threat is for prolonged periods of heavy
upslope snow over parts of the Central Rockies/High Plains as
ample Canadian surface high pressure digs and settles southward.
Temperatures within this airmass appear to be 10 to 20 degrees
below normal, especially from eastern Montana to the Central High
Plains.

...Stormy and unsettled weather pattern throughout the East to
kickoff the weekend; rounds of severe weather and areas of flash
flooding expected across the Deep South...

...Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather remain in place for
the Southwest to Southern High Plains...

...Cooler than normal temperatures and mountain snow in the
Northwest, warmer than normal in the Southwest and Northeast...

A large occluded low pressure system in the Midwest will continue
to generate spotty areas of showers and thunderstorms from the
northern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic coast into Saturday morning.
As this system dissipates and moves into Canada, a new potent
upper level disturbance will strengthen as it tracks into the
Central Plains this afternoon. This results in a deepening area of
low pressure in the South Central U.S. and an increasingly
favorable environment for intense thunderstorm activity in the
Southern Plains and Southeast tonight through Sunday. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Moderate Risk of severe weather
today for portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley with an
expansive Slight Risk area that stretches from eastern Texas and
Oklahoma to southern Georgia. Severe storms will be capable of
producing damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. In addition
to the severe threat, there is also a threat for flash flooding
and a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall has been outlined from
the Arklatex region to central Alabama. Widespread rainfall totals
between 1 to 2 inches are likely with locally higher amounts above
3 inches possible.

The severe weather and flash flood threat advances further east on
Saturday as an intensifying low pressure system and associated
cold front track from the Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes by
evening. Ahead of the front, the Storm Prediction Center has
outlined an Enhanced Risk of severe storms from the Mississippi
Delta east to the western Florida Panhandle and north into
southern Alabama for the potential of significant wind gusts as
well as hail and tornadoes. There is also a Slight Risk for
excessive rainfall with deep, gulf moisture and the potential for
training storms leading to rainfall amounts as high as 4 inches
along the central Gulf Coast. Widespread showers and thunderstorms
are also possible for the Great Lakes south through the Ohio
Valley into the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas with a few storms
potentially becoming severe. The chance for showers and
thunderstorms will overspread most of the East Coast through the
overnight hours Saturday into Sunday as the cold front approaches
from the west. The storm system will move east into the Atlantic
later in the day on Sunday but showers will continue to spread
northeast into New England. Behind this system, a second system
upstream will move into the Northern Plains/upper Midwest bringing
additional rain chances.

Meanwhile in the Southwest, drier conditions combined with breezy
winds, low relative humidity, and favorable fuels continue to
support Critical Fire Weather conditions from west Texas to
central New Mexico through tonight. Elevated Risk areas are also
in place throughout much of the Southern High Plains and southern
Rockies. Fire Weather conditions continue on Saturday with an
Elevated Risk for parts of southern Arizona, much of New Mexico,
and southwestern Texas on Saturday. Depending on the timing of
another cold frontal passage, fire weather conditions may remain
favorable for at least some portions of the Southwest on Sunday.

In the Northwest, below normal temperatures and another round of
valley/coastal rain and mountain snow will continue as another
strong Pacific cold front moves inland late Friday and into
Saturday. Saturday daytime highs throughout the Northwest are
forecast to range between 10 to 20 degrees below normal. The
injection of subfreezing temperatures aloft provides mountain
ranges such as the Cascades, the Bitterroots, and northern Rockies
a chance for accumulating snowfall through Saturday evening. The
heaviest totals are most likely to transpire in the Cascades where
over a foot of snow is expected. While the Northwest turns quite
cool, above normal temperatures will continue for eastern portions
of the Great Lakes region and interior New England, with highs up
to 20 to 25 degrees above normal on Saturday. More seasonable
temperatures will return by Sunday as cooler air moves in from the
north and behind the storm system approaching from the west.
Elsewhere, temperatures will be seasonable ahead of the cold front
along the East Coast, cooler than average throughout portions of
the Plains and Midwest behind the cold front, and hot in the
desert Southwest with highs into the 90s likely.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1252 AM CDT Sat Apr 10 2021

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF WESTERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface cyclone will continue to
move across the eastern CONUS, with ample low-level moisture and
widespread precipitation limiting major wildfire spread concerns
across much of the Mississippi Valley towards the Appalachians.
Another mid-level trough will deepen across the northern Rockies,
promoting dry downslope flow across much of the northern into the
central High Plains. Strong west-northwesterly mid-level flow will
also overspread a dry boundary layer across the southwest U.S,
promoting surface conditions favorable for wildfire spread. Lastly,
dry, occasionally breezy conditions are expected around afternoon
peak heating across portions of the Florida Peninsula, before
isolated to potentially scattered thunderstorms arrive.

...Portions of the Southwest U.S...
By afternoon, adequate diurnal heating will promote RH values
dropping to the 10-20% range across much of central and eastern
Arizona into central New Mexico and Far West Texas. Efficient
downward momentum transport of the mid-level flow is expected to
support widespread 15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds.
Guidance consensus depicts the best overlap of critically low RH and
sustained 20+ mph westerly surface winds across western New Mexico,
where a Critical area has been delineated. Critical conditions are
most likely across lower-terrain areas, where fuels are most
receptive of wildfire spread.

...Florida Peninsula...
By afternoon peak heating, RH is expected to drop into the 25-35%
range across central and eastern portions of the Florida Peninsula.
At the same time, surface lee troughing is expected to encourage a
strong enough surface mass response for a relatively stronger
surface wind field to develop. During this period, and before
thunderstorms develop or move into the area, there is a multi-hour
window of opportunity where 15+ mph sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds may coincide with the aforementioned RH to foster
favorable wildfire-spread conditions. An Elevated area has been
maintained to address this concern given that fuels remain receptive
to fire spread.

...Northern High Plains...
With the approach of an upper trough, downslope flow is expected to
promote 15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds coinciding with
15-25% RH during the afternoon hours. At least locally Elevated
conditions are likely from the Laramie Mountains to the
Montana/North Dakota/Canada border, potentially expanding as far
east as the western Dakotas into the Nebraska Panhandle. At the
moment, the primary mitigating factor for adding an Elevated area is
the lack of stronger surface winds on a more widespread basis.
However, given the receptiveness of fuels (especially in eastern
Montana into western North Dakota), an Elevated area may be added in
the Day 1 update should guidance show any increasing trends for wind
speeds.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

1254 AM CDT Sat Apr 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Synopsis...
A progressive mid-level trough will move eastward across the
northern CONUS and merge with an upper-level cutoff low across
portions of the Ohio Valley tomorrow. At the surface, high pressure
will build across the northern Rockies as a cold front surges across
the central Plains. Meanwhile, modest mid-level flow will overspread
a dry boundary layer across portions of the southwest U.S. into the
southern High Plains, with some dry and breezy conditions expected
during the afternoon hours.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Widespread 10-20% RH is expected across much of the southwest into
the southern High Plains during the afternoon as the boundary layer
mixes. Fuels across much of this region (especially in the lower
terrain) remains receptive to fire spread despite green-up, given
the ongoing extreme to exceptional drought. However, stronger
mid-level flow is expected to be departing the Southwest as diurnal
heating increases. As such, sustained westerly surface winds are
expected to remain within the 15-20 mph range, with an Elevated area
introduced. Locally Critical conditions may occur in
terrain-favoring areas, and Critical highlights may be introduced in
future outlooks should guidance consensus trend windier, especially
across eastern New Mexico, where fuels appear most receptive to fire
spread.

...Central Plains...
Dry and breezy conditions are expected immediately behind the cold
front across eastern Colorado into western/central Nebraska and
northern Kansas tomorrow afternoon. Fuels across the region are at
least modestly receptive to fire spread. However, guidance members
vary widely regarding minimum RH and the exact placement/timing of
the cold front, introducing considerable amounts of uncertainty this
forecast. Fire weather highlights have been withheld this outlook.
However, highlights may be added in future updates if surface
post-frontal conditions trend drier, and when cold frontal positions
can be better ascertained.

...Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat and additional
rains for a soggy central Gulf Coast...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite for days 3-5 (Tuesday-Thursday)
was primarily derived from a composite blend of best clustered
guidance from the 12 UTC GFS/ECMWF/Canadian in a pattern with
above normal predictability. Opted to use a composite blend of the
still compatible 12 UTC GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble means days 6-7
(Friday-next Saturday) amid growing forecast spread. This strategy
maintains good WPC continuity and remains generally in line with
latest 00 UTC guidance, but forecast spread remains less than
stellar at longer time frames.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

An amplifying upper trough/closed low will dig and settle over a
cooled West next week to the lee of an amplified and slow moving
eastern Pacific upper ridge in a blocky pattern. There is some
uncertainty with trough evolution/undercutting of the shifting
ridge later next week as a closed high builds over western Canada.
Expect some deformation and terrain enhanced precipitation over
the Great Basin, but there is a protracted threat for periods of
heavy snows over the Central Rockies/High Plains as enhanced by
upslope as ample Canadian surface high pressure digs and settles
southward in an airmass inherent with generally 10-20F below
normal temperature anomalies next week. Slow system
progression/influence may shift a moderate rain focus over the
central Plains late period, but there is uncertainty at these
longer time frames.

Meanwhile, complex/main northern stream closed low energies over
the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes early next week will struggle to
consolidate and shift downstream to off the Mid-Atlantic coast
late next week, blocked by a closed upper trough/lows slowly
retrograding uncertainly from offshore the Canadian Maritimes
toward New England. Moderate rains will accompany the path of the
main system early next week before losing frontal convergence,
with some wrap-back snows possible for the Upper Midwest. A wavy
trailing front will settle over The South/Gulf of Mexico and
offers potential for some periods with moderate to heavier
downpours next week with a changing multi-day focus over the
Southern Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley and the Gulf
Coast/Florida as uncertain ejecting southern stream impulses focus
lift and moisture.

...Stormy and unsettled weather pattern continues over much of the
East this weekend; severe weather and localized flooding likely in
parts the Southeast today...

...Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather remain in place for
the Southwest and southern High Plains...

...Cooler than normal temperatures and mountain snow in the
Northwest, warmer than normal in the Southwest and Northeast...

Saturday's weather across the Lower 48 is headlined by a
strengthening area of low pressure tracking into the Midwest later
in the day. Potent thunderstorm activity across the Deep South
this morning looks to continue as it approaches the Southeast with
some storms potentially becoming severe. These storms also contain
heavy rainfall with rain rates in excess of 2 inches per hour
possible. An Enhanced area for severe weather is in place for
parts of the central Gulf Coast along with a Slight Risk for
excessive rainfall in the same region. Strong thunderstorms are
also in the forecast as far north as the Great Lakes and extending
east to the Mid-Atlantic coast through this evening as the storm's
cold front marches towards the East Coast. The Middle Mississippi
River Valley will contend with periods of rain on the backside of
the storm, along with gusty winds and abnormally cool
temperatures. By Sunday, the storm fully occludes and its severe
and heavy rainfall threat will not be as notable as Saturday, but
lingering showers and thunderstorms are expected up and down the
East Coast and around the Great Lakes. Some thunderstorms could be
severe and contain excessive rainfall rates across the Florida
Peninsula.

Regarding other weather hazards around the country, fire weather
conditions remain at Elevated to Critical levels in parts of the
southern High Plains and southern Rockies today. There is also an
Elevated risk for fire weather in central Florida. Another day of
Elevated fire weather is on tap for the southern High Plains and
southern Rockies on Sunday with locally Critical conditions
expected.

In the Northwest, an upper level disturbance aiding in the
formation of a new storm system tracking through southern Canada
will send a fresh injection of below normal temperatures into the
Northwest and Northern Rockies this weekend. Some daily record
cold lows may be broken in portions of the Pacific Northwest
Sunday morning. Temperatures will be cold enough to promote
periods of mountain snow from the Cascades and Bitterroots to the
Northern Rockies and Big Horns. Most snowfall accumulations should
remain below 6 inches, with the exceptions being in the highest
elevations of the Cascades and Northern Rockies where higher
amounts are possible. By Sunday, some light snow accumulations are
possible in the northern High Plains. The cold front responsible
for the cool down in the Northwest sweeps through the Great Plains
on Sunday, leading to a much cooler regime engulfing the Heartland
by Monday as cold Canadian high pressure builds in behind the
front. Conversely, above normal temperatures set up shop today
along the East Coast, over the eastern Great Lakes, and throughout
the Desert Southwest today. A few record high temps may be set
today, especially in the eastern Great Lakes. Abnormally mild
conditions persist on Sunday over the Mid-Atlantic and throughout
the Southwest.

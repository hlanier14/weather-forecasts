Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 AM CDT Thu Aug 05 2021

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA...SOUTHEAST
OREGON...

Given recent guidance, the dry thunderstorm area has been adjusted
within the Washington Cascades. Lightning activity in southwestern
Oregon has already increased as the upper low moves inland. The
remainder of the forecast remains valid and was unchanged. Further
details are below.

..Wendt.. 08/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0111 AM CDT Thu Aug 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level wave off the northern California coast will move
onshore over the next 24 hours, resulting in thunderstorm chances
across the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies as well as
wind-driven fire weather concerns across the northwestern Great
Basin and lee of the Cascades. Despite widely scattered
precipitation across these regions in recent days, fuels remain very
dry and will support the fire weather threat.

...Northwest Nevada into central OR/WA...
Confidence remains high in elevated to critical fire weather
conditions this afternoon as a deepening surface low and attendant
cold front move through the region in tandem with the upper-level
trough. Several factors are expected to phase well today and
contribute to the wind/RH-driven fire weather threat, including: an
abrupt wind shift from southerly to westerly associated with the
cold frontal passage, strengthening surface pressure gradient and
boundary-layer winds, and downslope warming/drying off the northern
Sierra. The result will be 20-25 mph sustained winds gusting to
30-35 mph coincident with RH values in the single digits to low
teens. Confidence in these conditions is highest across northwest NV
and southeast OR, but critical wind/RH combinations may occur in
adjacent areas of CA and further east/southeast into southwest ID
and central NV (though fuels here exhibit below-normal ERC values
per recent analyses).

Further north into the Pacific Northwest, the passage of the cold
front and/or increasing gap winds are expected to bring 15-25 mph
westerly winds this afternoon along and east of the Cascades. RH
reductions may be muted due to cloud cover, but the increasing winds
may impact holdover fires from recent lightning activity.

...Pacific Northwest - Dry Lightning...
Recent GOES PWAT estimates show a swath of lingering moisture in
place across the Pacific Northwest. This moisture, combined with
cooling temperatures aloft associated with the upper-level wave,
will support sufficient instability for thunderstorms this
afternoon. Thunderstorms are possible as far west as the south OR
coast this morning with increasing chances to the east/northeast
through the day. Latest ensemble guidance and forecast soundings
suggest the highest potential for dry thunderstorms will reside
across central OR/WA east of the Cascades where deep boundary-layer
mixing, instability, and lift will most favorably overlap.
Convective coverage will likely increase across ID and western MT
late this afternoon and evening, but this region will see the
highest probability for wetting rainfall and has seen swaths of
0.25+ inches of rain in recent days. However, a few dry strikes are
possible and may pose a fire weather concern for locations that
observed low rainfall amounts. Thunderstorms across the region will
also pose a risk of strong to severe outflow winds (see the latest
Day 1 Convective Outlook for details).

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
219 PM EDT Thu Aug 05 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Aug 08 2021 - 12Z Thu Aug 12 2021

...Overview...

Typical late summer pattern expected to evolve over the CONUS
during the middle of next week with building heights aloft. The
main storm tracks will skirt the northern Rockies/Plains into the
Upper Midwest/Great Lakes regions with the rest of the country
likely to see a drier weather regime. Temperatures will side
toward above normal for much of the country with some bouts of
excessive heat likely in the typical August summer pattern.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The 00Z/06Z deterministic models showed fairly good consistency
and agreement with the ensembles. Early on in the period,
shortwave troughing will drop through the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies, opening up as it approaches the Northern Plains
by the middle of the week. Here the 06Z GFS in particular was much
faster with the wave, also flatter, while the ECMWF was slower and
more amplified. The consensus leaned toward the UKMET solution and
that agreed well with continuity as well. For the rest of the
forecast package, the ensembles all point toward weak but general
troughing over the Great Lakes/Upper Midwest by the middle/end of
the next week, but anomalies don't look extreme at this point. As
a result, the latter portions of the forecast largely leaned on
the ECENS/GEFS means, which offered a reasonable solution for now
that transitioned well with continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Rainfall will expand across the Corn Belt and Great Lakes Sunday
as a shortwave lifts toward Wisconsin. Some rainfall could be
locally heavy. As the system lifts into southern Ontario/Quebec,
rainfall coverage and intensity should wane some before perhaps
picking up again next Tue-Thu along the tail-end of the lead
boundary and in advance of another Canadian front, in addition to
afternoon convection over the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys. Another
shortwave pushing into the Northern Rockies on Monday could bring
some locally heavy rainfall to parts of northern/northwest
Montana.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies behind the lead cold front
this weekend into Monday with a moderation thereafter. Ahead of
this cold front, temperatures will be 5 to 15 degrees above normal
over the Plains Sun-Mon and expanding to the East Coast Mon-Thu. A
ridge over the Southeast Monday will maintain temperatures into
the 90s with heat indices into the low 100s as dew points rise
into the 60s and low 70s. Temperatures into the 80s and 90s will
reach into the Northeast/ Mid-Atlantic ahead of the Great Lakes
trough which is about 5-10 degrees above normal.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 05 2021

SYNOPSIS: There continues to be relatively good multi-model agreement
indicating positive mid-level height anomalies for the northeastern lower 4=
8
during week-2, supporting increased chances for excessive heat across the
region, most likely at the beginning of the period. Increasing precipitatio=
n
chances related to mid-level troughing upstream may result in slightly cool=
er
temperatures compared to the late week-1 timeframe, but muggy conditions ar=
e
likely to persist, with little relief expected during the overnight periods=
.
Todays models are more robust relative to yesterday with mid-level high
pressure persisting over the West early in week-2, increasing the excessive
heat risk over some areas. Increased moisture flow along the South Coast of
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle may bring episodes of wet weather to these
regions.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat across portions of the Northern Intermounta=
in
region, Fri-Sat, Aug 13-14.

Slight risk of excessive heat across portions of the Pacific Northwest, Gre=
at
Basin, and California, Fri-Sun, Aug 13-15.

Slight risk of excessive heat across portions of the northeastern CONUS,
Fri-Sun, Aug 13-15.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of southeastern Mainland
Alaska and the northern Panhandle, Fri-Sat, Aug 13-14.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY AUGUST 08 - THURSDAY AUGUST 12:

Q46T0u6dN7X$

FOR FRIDAY AUGUST 13 - THURSDAY AUGUST 19: There continues to be relatively
good agreement in the 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensemble means, which al=
l
depict positive mid-level height anomalies over the northern tier of the CO=
NUS
during week-2, with the highest height anomalies (greater than +30 meters)
indicated over the northwestern and northeastern CONUS early in the period.
Over the northeastern CONUS, these positive height anomalies, combined with
enhanced moisture favored, increase the likelihood for excessive heat acros=
s
the region. A slight risk of excessive heat is posted for parts of the regi=
on,
Aug 13 to 15, where the calibrated GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate=
 at
least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile.
Although actual temperatures in the 80s deg F (northern New England) to 90s
deg
F (mid-Atlantic) are forecast, the increased humidity may push heat index
values above hazards thresholds. Of additional concern is the potential for
minimum temperature anomalies exceeding +10 deg F, resulting in little reli=
ef
from the heat and humidity overnight. Upstream troughing to the west may
promote episodes of convective precipitation across the region, leading to
cooler temperatures in some areas due to increased cloud cover. Due to this
added uncertainty, the moderate risk is discontinued in todays outlook.



Todays models depict a more expansive ridge axis developing in the East
Pacific during week-1 and persisting into week-2, with the ECMWF and Canadi=
an
ensembles indicating week-2 mean positive height anomalies of +60 meters
extending into the Northwestern CONUS. Because of these increasing signals,
and
preexisting dry conditions, a moderate risk for excessive heat is now poste=
d
across parts of the Northern Great Basin for Aug 13 and 14. The ECMWF
reforecast tool is particularly aggressive, indicating at least a 60% chanc=
e
that maximum temperatures exceed the 85th percentile. The GEFS reforecast t=
ool
depicts probabilities in the 40%-60% range, still supportive of a moderate
risk. Concern will be for triple digit temperatures in areas that have been
repeatedly impacted by excessive heat throughout the summer. The slight ris=
k
for excessive heat is expanded through much of the Great Basin, Pacific
Northwest, and California through Aug 15, where both reforecast tools depic=
t
at
least a 20% chance maximum temperatures exceed the 85th percentile (95 deg =
F
across the valleys of the Great Basin, 100 deg F across the California Cent=
ral
Valley). There is more uncertainty further east due to differences in the
surface temperature depiction between the GEFS and the ECMWF ensemble mean
across the Northern and Central Plains, despite a similar synoptic set-up. =
A
greater amplitude upstream ridge in the ECMWF likely favors increased
northwesterly mid-level flow over the Plains resulting in the relatively
cooler
conditions. The GEFS depiction, which shows maximum temperatures near or ab=
ove
100 deg F in some areas, would support a slight risk of excessive heat.
However, the ECMWF ensemble indicates maximum temperatures in the upper 80s=
 to
low 90s deg F, not indicative of a heat hazard for the region. Due to these
differences, a related heat hazard is not posted in todays outlook.



Due to the enhanced phase of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), there is =
an
increased potential for tropical cyclone activity in the East Pacific durin=
g
the period which could promote enhanced moisture and precipitation across
parts
of the Southwest. The National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring a
disturbance off the southern coast of Mexico, which is forecast to further
develop and track west to northwestward across the Eastern Pacific. The
deterministic GFS and its ensembles continue to have a more northward
component
to the track compared to the ECMWF suite, which takes the system on a more
westward track, and at a quicker pace. The GFS solution would likely result=
 in
a moisture surge and increased episodes of heavy precipitation and localize=
d
flash flooding over parts or the Southwest early in the period. However, gi=
ven
the continued lack of support for this realization in the ECMWF, no related
hazards are issued in todays outlook.



Deep troughing is forecast across the Bering Sea late in week-1 along with =
the
aforementioned ridging downstream over the East Pacific. This favors a tigh=
t
mid-level pressure gradient and increased southerly flow across Alaska. The
trough is projected to weaken by the beginning of week-2, although elevated
chances for enhanced precipitation remain early in the period across portio=
ns
of the Mainland, particularly the southeastern coast. The uncalibrated GEFS=
,
ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means depict over three quarters of an inch of
daily precipitation in some areas on days 8 and 9. Heavy precipitation is
forecast to begin late in week-1, and its persistence into the week-2 perio=
d
will likely continue to exacerbate impacts. Therefore, a slight risk for he=
avy
precipitation is highlighted across the southeastern coast of the Mainland =
and
the extreme northern Panhandle on Aug 13 and 14. A more zonal flow pattern =
is
forecast later in the period across Alaska, limiting the chances of hazardo=
us
weather.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu August 05 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 11 - 15 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement that a strong ridge will deve=
lop
south of Alaska during the 6-10 day period, with large positive height
anomalies across the Alaska Panhandle and western half of the CONUS. Upstre=
am
of this ridge, a deep trough is forecast, centered over western Mainland
Alaska
and the Aleutians. In the eastern U.S., ridging is forecast to persist for
much
of the 6-10 day period, and throughout the entire CONUS, above normal 500-h=
Pa
heights are predicted.

Troughing, associated with negative height anomalies, is predicted across
nearly all of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, favoring below normal
temperatures there. Farther south, the Panhandle is expected to be under
positive height anomalies, favoring above normal temperatures there. Strong
ridging centered near the west coast of the CONUS significantly enhances th=
e
likelihood of above normal temperatures for most of the western half of the
CONUS. For most of the eastern half of the CONUS, separate ridging and
positive
height anomalies increase the chances of above normal temperatures for most=
 of
the eastern U.S.

East of the trough predicted near western Mainland Alaska, above normal
precipitation is favored for most of Alaska. The strong ridge near the west=
ern
U.S. is forecast to suppress storm system activity downstream, significantl=
y
increasing the odds of below normal temperatures for the Northwest, norther=
n
Great Basin and Rockies, and North Plains. Conditions are forecast to be
favorable for the monsoon for parts of the Southwest, enhancing chances of
above normal precipitation there. Predicted surface high pressure favors be=
low
normal precipitation for states along the Gulf Coast and parts of the coast=
al
Southeast. A forecast frontal passage and development of a low-level trough
favor above normal precipitation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the dynamical models, offset slightly by some
inconsistencies between the tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 13 - 19 2021

By the week 2 period, the large-scale 500-hPa pattern is forecast to become
less amplified due to increased model spread. This leads to a very similar
temperature forecast to the 6-10 day period, with a few differences. 500-hP=
a
heights are forecast to rise across coastal Mainland Alaska and the Aleutia=
ns,
favoring near normal temperatures there. For regions with favored above nor=
mal
temperatures across the CONUS, probabilities are lower during the week 2 du=
e
to
more uncertainty and smaller 500-hPa anomalies. The precipitation probabili=
ty
forecast is also very similar to the 6-10 day period, with one large scale
difference. The predicted passage of one or more cold fronts is expected to
enhance precipitation across the Gulf Coast states and Southeast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 70% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the dynamical models, offset slightly by some
inconsistencies between the tools.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
309 PM EDT Thu Aug 05 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Aug 08 2021 - 12Z Thu Aug 12 2021

...Overview...

Typical late summer pattern expected to evolve over the CONUS
during the middle of next week with building heights aloft. The
main storm tracks will skirt the northern Rockies/Plains into the
Upper Midwest/Great Lakes regions with the rest of the country
likely to see a drier weather regime. Temperatures will side
toward above normal for much of the country with some bouts of
excessive heat likely in the typical August summer pattern.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The 00Z/06Z deterministic models showed fairly good consistency
and agreement with the ensembles. Early on in the period,
shortwave troughing will drop through the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies, opening up as it approaches the Northern Plains
by the middle of the week. Here the 06Z GFS in particular was much
faster with the wave, also flatter, while the ECMWF was slower and
more amplified. The consensus leaned toward the UKMET solution and
that agreed well with continuity as well. For the rest of the
forecast package, the ensembles all point toward weak but general
troughing over the Great Lakes/Upper Midwest by the middle/end of
the next week, but anomalies don't look extreme at this point. As
a result, the latter portions of the forecast largely leaned on
the ECENS/GEFS means, which offered a reasonable solution for now
that transitioned well with continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Rainfall will expand across the Corn Belt and Great Lakes Sunday
as a shortwave lifts toward Wisconsin. Some rainfall could be
locally heavy. As the system lifts into southern Ontario/Quebec,
rainfall coverage and intensity should wane some before perhaps
picking up again next Tue-Thu along the tail-end of the lead
boundary and in advance of another Canadian front, in addition to
afternoon convection over the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys. Another
shortwave pushing into the Northern Rockies on Monday could bring
some locally heavy rainfall to parts of northern/northwest
Montana.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies behind the lead cold front
this weekend into Monday with a moderation thereafter. Ahead of
this cold front, temperatures will be 5 to 15 degrees above normal
over the Plains Sun-Mon and expanding to the East Coast Mon-Thu. A
ridge over the Southeast Monday will maintain temperatures into
the 90s with heat indices into the low 100s as dew points rise
into the 60s and low 70s. Temperatures into the 80s and 90s will
reach into the Northeast/ Mid-Atlantic ahead of the Great Lakes
trough which is about 5-10 degrees above normal.

Rainfall will expand across the Corn Belt and Great Lakes Sunday
as a shortwave lifts toward Wisconsin. Some rainfall could be
locally heavy. As the system lifts into southern Ontario/Quebec,
rainfall coverage and intensity should wane some before perhaps
picking up again next Tue-Thu along the tail-end of the lead
boundary and in advance of another Canadian front, in addition to
afternoon convection over the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys. Another
shortwave pushing into the Northern Rockies on Monday could bring
some locally heavy rainfall to parts of northern/northwest
Montana.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies behind the lead cold front
this weekend into Monday with a moderation thereafter. Ahead of
this cold front, temperatures will be 5 to 15 degrees above normal
over the Plains Sun-Mon and expanding to the East Coast Mon-Thu. A
ridge over the Southeast Monday will maintain temperatures into
the 90s with heat indices into the low 100s as dew points rise
into the 60s and low 70s. Temperatures into the 80s and 90s will
reach into the Northeast/ Mid-Atlantic ahead of the Great Lakes
trough which is about 5-10 degrees above normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Thu Aug 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

Ahead of the approaching shortwave trough, winds in the lowest 2 km
are expected to remain moderately strong into the afternoon across
western Kansas and southwest/central Nebraska. Surface winds could
reach 20-25 mph during the afternoon along with 15-20% RH. While
recent fuels information shows grasses are dry, observed rainfall of
0.15-0.75 inches has also occurred over the past 24 hours. No
highlights will be added due to fuel status uncertainty, but a local
increase in grassland fire potential is possible tomorrow afternoon.

The forecast otherwise remains valid. See the previous discussion
for greater detail.

..Wendt.. 08/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Thu Aug 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level wave currently off the northern California coast is
forecast to progress over northern/central Rockies through the day
Friday. The resulting lee troughing will drive an increase in
pressure-gradient winds across the central Plains and parts of the
eastern Great Basin that may foster elevated to critical wind/RH
combinations. Additionally, isolated dry thunderstorms will be
possible along the central Rockies.

...Great Basin and central High Plains...
Confidence is reasonably high that a deepening lee trough over the
northern to central High Plains will strengthening winds across the
central High Plains and into the eastern Great Basin. Sustained
winds between 15-25 mph appear likely for both regions, and an
antecedent dry airmass in place over the Great Basin and meager
moisture return over the Plains will support RH reductions into the
teens and 20s. While elevated (to locally critical) wind/RH
combinations are likely, ERC values below seasonal normal will limit
the fire weather risk. Fuel status will be monitored over the next
24 hours to determine if highlights are needed.

...Central Rockies - Dry Thunderstorms...
Dry thunderstorms are probable Friday afternoon from southern WY
into central CO, and may occur as far south as northern NM. A
combination of cooling temperatures aloft and meager mid-level
moisture (PWAT values near 0.6 inches) atop a dry, well-mixed
boundary layer suggests mostly dry thunderstorms are likely. Lift
ahead of the main trough axis will likely support at least isolated
thunderstorm coverage by the mid to late afternoon hours. Despite
the favorable thermodynamic conditions, fuels across the region are
generally unreceptive and will temper the dry lightning threat to
some degree.

...Heavy rainfall and the chance for flooding continues for
portions of the Southeast along a persistent frontal boundary...

...Showers and storms likely for the Northern Rockies and High
Plains on Friday...

...Heavy rainfall possible for the Midwest with severe weather
expected Saturday...

Showers and storms continue this afternoon across parts of Florida
along a persistent, quasi-stationary frontal boundary draped
across the northern half of the Peninsula and just off the East
and Gulf Coasts. This boundary will slowly move back to the north
onshore the coastal Carolinas, Georgia, and Gulf Coast over the
next couple of days. Waves of low pressure along the boundary as
well as an upper-level trough moving east across the Southeast
will help encourage widespread shower and thunderstorms along the
boundary. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall (level 2 of 4)
remains in effect for the Big Bend of Florida through tomorrow
morning for the chance of 3 to 5 more inches of heavy rainfall. A
Marginal Risk (level 1 of 4) is in effect for a broad portion of
Southeast on Friday as well as for portions of the eastern
Carolinas on Saturday as areal average rainfall of 1 to 2 inches
may lead to a few localized instances of flooding, particularly in
places that have already seen heavy rain the past few days.

A upper-level trough from the Pacific will move east over the
Northern Rockies through the day Friday. Showers and storms are
likely for the Northern Rockies and High Plains through the day as
a low pressure system develops in the Lee of the Rockies and a
cold front develops and moves east across the region. A Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall is in effect for Friday as some of the
heavier downpours could lead to localized instances of flash
flooding, particularly across areas of steeper terrain and any
burn scars.

In the Midwest, a pair of upper-level troughs will move across the
area through the period. A cold front will move through the Upper
Great Lakes on Friday with the first trough as the storm system
over the Northern Rockies approaches from the west with the second
trough on Saturday. A Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall is in
effect on Friday for the first round of storms, with locally heavy
rainfall of up to an inch possible. As the second storm system
approaches, a warm front will lift north across the Upper
Mississippi Valley, advecting moist, buoyant air across the region
ahead of a cold front moving in from the west across the Dakotas.
The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2 of
5) for severe weather on Saturday centered around southern
Minnesota and northwestern Iowa. Both supercells and organized
clusters of storms are expected to develop bringing the risk for
hail, wind, as well as a chance for a brief tornado. A Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall is also in effect for Saturday as heavy
rain is possible with these storms, although the greater threat
for heavy rain may be overnight Saturday just after the end of the
current forecast period.

Elsewhere, generally mild conditions are expected. High
temperatures below normal are likely across the Southeast due to
persistent clouds and storms as well as behind the cold front in
the Northwest, with highs near to a bit above normal in the
Northeast. The hottest weather is expected across the Central High
Plains with highs in the upper 90s to 100 degrees forecast.

looks to remain an issue, particularly for portions of the
Northwest, the High Plains, and the Upper Midwest.

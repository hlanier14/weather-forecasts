.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0131 AM CST Mon Feb 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
Multiple mid-level troughs will traverse the northern U.S as upper
ridging builds across the southwest CONUS through the day. Surface
high pressure and overall cooler, moist conditions will prevail
across most of the CONUS, limiting the threat for significant
wildfire growth. Some dry and breezy conditions may accompany
downslope flow along the southern High Plains, as well as with
offshore flow induced by a pressure gradient across southern
California. Nonetheless, fuels across southern California to the
southern High Plains remain poorly receptive to wildfire spread,
with no fire weather highlights added.

...Potential heavy rainfall from the southern Plains to the
Tennessee Valley late this week and early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A general synoptic pattern that features upper trough energies
lifting across the Southwest together with a persistent upper
ridge over the southern Gulf of Mexico will resume during the
medium range period.  The resulting southwesterly flow in between
is likely to lift Gulf moisture across the southern U.S. and into
portions of the eastern U.S., especially by late this week as well
as early next week.  Waves of low pressure developing along a
slow-moving front would provide the focus for some areas of heavy
rainfall across the interior southern U.S. to the Tennessee Valley.

There has been a noticeable trend in the models of ejecting more
upper-level energy from the Southwest into the central Plains
early in the medium range period.  This trend has led to a slower
moving front across the Deep South and a better defined axis of
potentially heavy rainfall across the southern Plains Thursday to
Friday.  The extra upper-level energy is then carried downstream
to promote upper-level troughing and result in a better defined
low pressure system moving across the Great Lakes on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the bulk of the moisture in the South is pushed faster
toward the east and northeast into the East Coast on Saturday
ahead of the developing system with a warm front lifting across
the Southeast.  By late in the weekend into early next week, model
guidance has been quite consistent in setting up an axis of heavy
rain across the Mid-South into the Tennessee Valley and towards
the Appalachians.  Another upper-level trough that gradually digs
down into the Southwest this weekend will then send additional
upper-level energy into the south Plains.  When combining with
broad troughing associated with a cold air mass settling into the
northern tier states, the synoptic pattern will appear to help
sustain the axis of heavy rainfall across Mid-South into early
next week, even though models continue to show some spread
regarding the details of the pattern evolution.

Meanwhile, the Pacific Northwest should experience a couple of
periods of precipitation during the medium-range--first one late
this week followed by the next one Sunday into Monday, with
relatively consistent model timings.

The WPC morning package was derived based on the consensus of the
00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS, and smaller
contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean with more of the ensemble
means on day 6-7 to account for the forecast uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest can expected a few rounds of precipitation
late this week into the first part of the weekend, with higher
elevations of the Cascades and Northern Rockies/Bitterroots likely
to see the most snow.  As that system drops to the Four Corners
region and then pushes into the Southern Plains, several days of
Gulf moisture interacting with frontal boundaries across the South
could result in multiple waves of precipitation.  Details and
totals are less certain but the setup favors potentially heavy
rainfall somewhere from the Arklatex, portions of AL/MS to lower
TN Valley.

Below normal temperatures are forecast predominately across the
Rockies during the period and then in the wake of the late weekend
and early next week system, those below normal readings could
spill into the Plains. Departures of 10F to as much as 20F are
possible. Elsewhere, no significant departures from normal are
forecast during the period.

...Potential heavy rainfall from the southern Plains to the
Tennessee Valley late this week and early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A general synoptic pattern that features upper trough energies
lifting across the Southwest together with a persistent upper
ridge over the southern Gulf of Mexico will resume during the
medium range period.  The resulting southwesterly flow in between
is likely to lift Gulf moisture across the southern U.S. and into
portions of the eastern U.S., especially by late this week as well
as early next week.  Waves of low pressure developing along a
slow-moving front would provide the focus for some areas of heavy
rainfall across the interior southern U.S. to the Tennessee Valley.

There has been a noticeable trend in the models of ejecting more
upper-level energy from the Southwest into the central Plains
early in the medium range period.  This trend has led to a slower
moving front across the Deep South and a better defined axis of
potentially heavy rainfall across the southern Plains Thursday to
Friday.  The extra upper-level energy is then carried downstream
to promote upper-level troughing and result in a better defined
low pressure system moving across the Great Lakes on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the bulk of the moisture in the South is pushed faster
toward the east and northeast into the East Coast on Saturday
ahead of the developing system with a warm front lifting across
the Southeast.  By late in the weekend into early next week, model
guidance has been quite consistent in setting up an axis of heavy
rain across the Mid-South into the Tennessee Valley and towards
the Appalachians.  Another upper-level trough that gradually digs
down into the Southwest this weekend will then send additional
upper-level energy into the south Plains.  When combining with
broad troughing associated with a cold air mass settling into the
northern tier states, the synoptic pattern will appear to help
sustain the axis of heavy rainfall across Mid-South into early
next week, even though models continue to show some spread
regarding the details of the pattern evolution.

Meanwhile, the Pacific Northwest should experience a couple of
periods of precipitation during the medium-range--first one late
this week followed by the next one Sunday into Monday, with
relatively consistent model timings.

The WPC morning package was derived based on the consensus of the
00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS, and smaller
contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean with more of the ensemble
means on day 6-7 to account for the forecast uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest can expected a few rounds of precipitation
late this week into the first part of the weekend, with higher
elevations of the Cascades and Northern Rockies/Bitterroots likely
to see the most snow.  As that system drops to the Four Corners
region and then pushes into the Southern Plains, several days of
Gulf moisture interacting with frontal boundaries across the South
could result in multiple waves of precipitation.  Details and
totals are less certain but the setup favors potentially heavy
rainfall somewhere from the Arklatex, portions of AL/MS to lower
TN Valley.

Below normal temperatures are forecast predominately across the
Rockies during the period and then in the wake of the late weekend
and early next week system, those below normal readings could
spill into the Plains. Departures of 10F to as much as 20F are
possible. Elsewhere, no significant departures from normal are
forecast during the period.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 22 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast to become anchored over the Gulf
of Mexico and Southeast, resulting in a mild start to March across the central
and eastern U.S. Conversely, below normal temperatures are likely to accompany
mid-level low pressure over Alaska. Early next week, a low pressure system may
affect the Northeast. Forecast confidence of precipitation related hazards is
limited due to uncertainty on how the longwave pattern evolves over the West.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the Tennessee Valley and Lower to
Middle
Mississippi Valley, Tue-Thu, Mar 2-4.

Flooding possible for parts of the Tennessee Valley and Lower to Middle
Mississippi Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY FEBRUARY 25 - MONDAY MARCH 01:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!rOhYmpiO5SU_tHlTGr5jqZK4I9xrfqG1L7ReUjEkDuXid-uiaakM8G4MhGYys7n_A7B62Bom$

FOR TUESDAY MARCH 02 - MONDAY MARCH 08: Following a negative phase of the
Arctic Oscillation (AO) since early December, a transition to a positive AO
occurred during mid-February. The 0Z GFS ensemble mean and a majority of its
ensemble members maintain this positive phase into early March. This positive
AO along with anomalous 500-hPa ridging over the southeastern U.S. favors
above
normal temperatures for the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS during week-2.
Although the CPC week-2 outlook features increased chances of below normal
temperatures across the West, these temperatures are not expected to be
hazardous as spring draws closer. The most anomalous cold during early March
is
forecast to be limited to the highest latitudes of western North America,
including Alaska. Although the GFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate that
minimum temperatures have a 40 percent chance, or more, of falling below the
15th percentile of the climatological distribution, minimum temperatures are
not expected to meet hazards criteria and no related temperature hazard is
issued.



A longwave trough forecast upstream through the early part of week-2, along
with at least modest Gulf moisture is a favorable setup for heavy rainfall
across the Middle to Lower Mississippi Valley east to the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys. Although the signal for heavy rainfall begins to weaken by week-2,
the
ECMWF ensemble mean depicts at least  a 20 percent chance of total rainfall
exceeding  1 inch from March 2 to 4 which supports a slight risk of heavy
precipitation for these areas. This is also consistent with a model consensus
showing a shortwave trough ejecting from the West and crossing the central U.S
during that time period. Preceding week-2, WPC indicates an axis of heavy
rainfall (1 to 3 inches) centered on the Tennessee Valley. This predicted
heavy
rainfall, recent snowmelt, and elevated chances of additional heavy rain
result
in the inclusion of a possible flooding hazard across parts of the Lower to
Middle Mississippi Valley along with the Tennessee Valley. After the ongoing
atmospheric river (AR) event affecting the Pacific Northwest, tools are in
excellent agreement and are devoid of any AR events along the West Coast into
early March.



Early next week, model guidance continues to depict a northern stream
shortwave
trough and associated surface low crossing the Northeast. However, model
spread
is large on the strength and timing of the surface low. Since the North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is forecast to remain slightly positive during the
next two weeks, a high impact winter storm event is somewhat minimized and the
low pressure system is expected to track eastward rapidly. The large model
differences and less favorable background state preclude designation of a
heavy
snow hazard for the Northeast.

Fuels readiness across the southern high Plains remains too low to
introduce highlights at this time. See the previous discussion for
more detail.

..Lyons.. 02/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0139 AM CST Mon Feb 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
Up to 50 kt 500 mb flow will develop across the central/southern U.S
as a mid-level trough begins to develop across the Inter-mountain
West. With a dry boundary layer in place across the southern High
Plains, diurnal heating will encourage downslope flow along the
higher terrain to the lee of the Rockies, promoting very breezy/dry
conditions. Latest guidance consensus depicts eastern New Mexico
into the Texas Panhandle as the most likely area to see 15-20% RH
coinciding with 20+ mph sustained westerly winds. While Elevated to
potentially Critical meteorological conditions are expected by
afternoon peak heating across portions of the southern High Plains,
fuel receptiveness to fire spread remains mediocre, with fire
weather highlights withheld.

...A relatively quiet pattern across the Lower 48, absent of heavy
rains or much below average temperatures...

...Much above average temperatures to spread east from the Plains
to the East Coast...

...High winds likely across the Northern High Plains...

...Accumulating snows possible across portion of New England, to
the east of the Lower Lakes and from the Northern Plains into the
Upper Great Lakes...

A relatively tranquil weather pattern expected over the next two
days across the lower 48.  The mid to upper level flow will remain
predominantly out of the west, keeping arctic air absent from the
country.  The much above average temperatures across the Plains
Monday will persist into Tuesday and also spread eastward into the
eastern third of the nation over the next two days.  The largest
departures from normal are expected across portions of the Central
to Southern Plains on Tuesday where high temperatures are expected
15 to 20 degrees warmer than average. By Wednesday, much of the
country to the east of the Mississippi River will be 10+ degrees
warmer than average. Temperatures 10+ degrees warmer than average
also forecast on Wednesday from much of Texas into the desert
southwest and southern California.

Colder than average temperatures will spread southeast from the
Northern Rockies region Tuesday into the Central Rockies and
Central High Plains region by Wednesday as a cold front presses
southeastward across these regions.  In the wake of this front
across the Northern High Plains, high winds are likely with gusts
up to 75 mph possible.  High wind warnings and wind advisories are
in effect across much of Montana, portions of Wyoming and into
western to central portions of North and South Dakota.

Heavy rains will be absent from the lower 48 over the next two
days in this relatively tranquil weather pattern.  The most
significant precipitation will be in the form of snow across
portions of New England into tonight, to the east of Lakes Erie
and Ontario tonight  into Tuesday and from portions of the
Northern Plains into the Upper Great Lakes Tuesday night into
Wednesday.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 28 - MAR 04, 2021

Today's model forecasts are in good agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation
pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day
period. Dynamical models forecast a low amplitude 500-hPa trough over parts of
western North America. The ECMWF ensemble mean predicts a slightly more
amplified trough inland over the western CONUS, while the GEFS ensemble mean
predicts a weaker trough near the Pacific coast of the CONUS. Enhanced
westerly
flow is predicted across the Aleutian Islands and into southwestern Mainland
Alaska, around a negative height anomaly to the north. A high amplitude ridge
is predicted over the eastern CONUS by all recent ensemble means. The manual
height blend depicts negative 500-hPa height anomalies over most of Alaska
except the western Aleutians. Weak negative 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over the western CONUS, and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted across the eastern CONUS.

Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are enhanced across Mainland
Alaska,
under negative 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are likely
across most of the western CONUS, related to the predicted trough over the
region. Above normal temperatures are likely over much of the eastern CONUS,
from southeastern Texas to the eastern Great Lakes region and the East Coast,
under a predicted ridge. Above normal temperatures are also favored for parts
of the Northern Plains, with anomalous southerly flow behind high pressure to
the east.

Above normal precipitation is favored across Alaska, with probabilities
exceeding 50 percent across much of southern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, under enhanced westerly flow. Near to below normal precipitation is
favored for most of the northwestern CONUS from eastern areas of California,
Oregon and Washington into the Northern Plains, with split mid-level flow
around the region. Above normal precipitation is favored from parts of the
Southwest, Southern and Central Plains, and the eastern CONUS excluding the
Gulf Coast region ahead of the troughing over the western CONUS. Chances of
below  normal precipitation are enhanced for parts of the eastern Gulf Coast
and the Florida Peninsula, consistent with dynamical model forecasts.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 10%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and precipitation forecasts, offset
by some differences among model temperature forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 02 - 08 2021

The main features of the predicted circulation pattern for the 6-10 day period
persist into the week 2 period with much greater uncertainty and weaker mean
500-hPa height anomalies. Enhanced westerly flow between a positive height
anomaly to the south and a negative height anomaly to the north persists into
southwestern Alaska. Weak troughing and near normal 500-hPa heights are
depicted over the western CONUS in the week 2 manual blend of model forecasts.
Ridging persists over the eastern CONUS into week 2, although with somewhat
lower positive 500-hPa height anomalies compared to the 6-10 day period
forecast.

The temperature pattern forecast for the week 2 period is also very similar to
the 6-10 day period forecast. Enhanced probabilities of below normal
temperatures are indicated for the Alaska Mainland, under negative 500-hPa
height anomalies. Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures are also
shown for the western CONUS from the Pacific Coast to the Rocky Mountains,
although with weaker probabilities than in the 6-10 day period as the trough
over the west de-amplifies significantly. Above normal temperatures are
favored
over the eastern CONUS, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies, and under
anomalous southerly flow in the Northern Plains. There were considerable
differences among model temperature forecasts for much of the Central and
Southern Plains, so only weak probabilities of above normal temperatures were
indicated for this region, supported by analog forecasts and positive 500-hPa
height anomalies.

Enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation continue over all of
Alaska in week 2, under persistent westerly mid-level flow. The precipitation
pattern forecast over the CONUS in week 2 is generally similar to the 6-10 day
period forecast with greater uncertainty. Below normal precipitation is
favored
over most of the western CONUS, outside climatologically dry areas of the
Southwest. Slightly enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation are
depicted for much of the Central Mississippi Valley into the northeastern
CONUS, with potential storm activity ahead of the remaining troughing over the
Southwest, and to the north of the positive height anomaly center over the
Southeast. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for the Gulf Coast
region and much of the Southeast, supported by most dynamical model forecasts.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 10% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and
10%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and precipitation forecasts, offset
by large differences among model temperature forecasts and increasing
uncertainty.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...Potential heavy rainfall from the southern Plains to the
Tennessee Valley late this week and early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A fast southwesterly flow aloft is expected to evolve over the
CONUS during the period with a couple different shortwaves carving
out troughing over the Interior West and Southwest U.S. while a
downstream ridge remains locked in place over portions of the Gulf
and southern Florida. A quasi-split flow is also expected with a
parade of shortwaves skirting the northern tier of the U.S.,
resulting in a wavy baroclinic zone from portions of the Southern
Plains to the Tennessee Valley late this week into early next
week. This is where the most active sensible weather is forecast
over the period with a multi-day heavy rainfall event possible.

While the latest guidance largely agrees on the synoptic evolution
during the period, there are considerable timing and strength
details in both the southern and northern stream. The first West
Coast to Southwest U.S. shortwave arrives by day 5 then quickly
passes into the Plains as it weakens and becomes absorbed in the
large scale flow. Quick on its heels is another shortwave that
drops through the West Coast. The GFS remains too fast and a bit
flatter with these features as they move through the flow.
Conversely, at times the ECMWF is slower than the rest of the
guidance. An early look at the 00Z guidance shows better agreement
and timing. For the northern stream, the GFS was much more
aggressive/deep as the wave drops through the Great Lakes and this
seems a bit of an outlier at this point compared to consensus.
However, the trend is for a deeper low tracking through the Great
Lakes to New England. Finally by day 7 the next system approaching
the West Coast and Four Corners show fairly good agreement despite
the typical spread and forecast uncertainty.

As a result, the WPC blend favored the deterministic
ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET day 3-4, then incorporated more of the ECENS
and GEFS to handle some of the greater spread east of the Rockies
day 5-7. This resulted in a blend that lied close to continuity.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest to Northern Rockies will see a couple days
of widespread precipitation late this week, with the higher
elevations of the Cascades, Northern Rockies, and Bitterroots
expected to receive heavy snow. That weather system then drops to
the Southwest U.S. and gradually opens up over the Plains. A
favorable setup for a prolonged period of Gulf moisture to
interact with the wavy boundary in place is likely to setup a
period of unsettled, active weather including heavy rainfall for
portions of the Southern Plains to Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians beginning late this week into early next week. The
latest guidance shows the possibility of several inches of rain
totaling over the period.

Below normal temperatures are forecast predominately across the
Rockies during the period and then in the wake of the late weekend
and early next week system. Those below normal readings could
spill into the Plains. Departures of 10F to as much as 20F are
possible. Nighttime lows are forecast to be well above normal (10
to 15F) for much of the central and eastern U.S. Sunday and
Monday, ahead of the frontal boundary draped through the MS River
Valley to Great Lakes.

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow aloft will prevail across much of the CONUS
today, with an embedded mid-level trough pivoting around the
cyclonic flow and traversing the western CONUS while amplifying.
Surface cyclone development is expected to occur during the
afternoon across portions of the southern High Plains in response to
the approaching mid-level trough. Gradient winds and downslope flow
along the lee of the Rockies will contribute to dry and breezy
conditions across the southern High Plains. Widespread 10-20% RH
will likely overlap 20-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds for
multiple hours during the afternoon across much of eastern New
Mexico into western Texas, eastern Colorado and western Kansas.
While these surface meteorological conditions would typically
warrant widespread Elevated to Critical conditions, fuel
receptiveness to fire spread is not particularly robust, especially
across portions of the southern High Plains. As such, fire weather
highlights for widespread significant wildfire-spread potential have
not been delineated, though potential may exist for localized
grass-fire potential with patchy areas of drier fine fuels.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the central Rockies while surface
high pressure overspreads much of the western and central CONUS
tomorrow, Wednesday February 24th. While cool and/or moist
conditions are expected to limit wildfire potential across much of
the CONUS, a localized threat for wildfire spread may develop across
portions of the southwest U.S (mainly southern Arizona and New
Mexico), ahead of a southward approaching cold front. Before
temperatures cool, diurnal mixing may promote 15-20% RH and 15-20
mph sustained westerly winds around afternoon peak heating. However,
fuels remain poorly receptive to fire spread, precluding any fire
weather highlights.

In addition, southward surging high pressure will also support the
development of a strong pressure gradient across southern
California, with dry and breezy offshore conditions likely beginning
on Wednesday evening. Similar to areas farther east, fuel
receptiveness to fire spread remains meager, with no fire weather
delineations made at this time. However, several areas across the
southern Transverse/Peninsular Ranges have been relatively devoid of
meaningful precipitation accumulations for the past two weeks. As
such, an Elevated highlight may be introduced if the driest/windiest
conditions may overlap with diurnal heating, potentially prompting
the finest fuels to become more receptive to fire spread.

...A relatively quiet pattern across the Lower 48...

...Warm air moves from Plains to East Coast as cold air spills out
over the Central/Southern Plains...

...High winds likely across the Northern Plains...

...Accumulating snow from Northern Plains to Great Lakes as well
as in the Northwest...

A calmer weather pattern will feature across the CONUS through
mid-week, before a Gulf system spins up on Thursday. Most
precipitation will remain relegated to the northern tier states
over the next couple of days. A low pressure system will traverse
the Northern Plains and Great Lakes through Thursday while
bringing light to moderate snow to those areas. Between 3-6 inches
of snow is possible for a swath extending from North Dakota to
northern Vermont. Isolated areas, particularly downwind of Lake
Ontario may see higher amounts due to snow associated with a
proceeding frontal boundary. Winds will pick up on the backside of
this system over parts of the Northern Plains today.

Troughing in the Northwest will continue to produce measurable
snowfall for the region's mountains today before quieting down on
Wednesday. A low pressure system will arrive over the Pacific
Northwest on Thursday morning, bringing yet another round of
measurable snow to the mountains. Rain likely over the coast, and
inland lower elevations. Warm air will rise into the Central and
Southern Plains today out ahead of the Northern Plains/Great Lakes
system. High temperatures are likely to be 15-20 degrees above
average with some areas in Kansas seeing more anomalous warmth
today. This warm airmass is forecast to shift eastward into the
East Coast by Wednesday. Cold air will spill out over the
Central/Southern Plains from the Rockies on Wednesday and
Thursday. High temperatures may fall back into the upper 30s,
which would be 20-30 degrees below average, for parts of eastern
New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle.

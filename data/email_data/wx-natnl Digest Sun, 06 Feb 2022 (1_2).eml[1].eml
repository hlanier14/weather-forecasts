...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes were made
with this update. Downslope flow and clear skies over the southern
High Plains will allow temperatures to climb into the upper 40s to
lower 50s across portions of the Texas Panhandle and South Plains
today. This will favor RH reductions into the middle/upper teens by
this afternoon, with southwesterly winds of 15-20 mph along the
southern periphery of surface lee troughing. With that said, recent
measurable precipitation over the area should generally limit the
wildfire-spread threat, precluding highlights with this update. For
additional details, see the previous discussion below.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1231 AM CST Sat Feb 05 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential appears low today due to widespread cool
temperatures and moist fuels across much of the central/eastern
CONUS. Localized, low-end fire weather concerns are possible across
parts of the central and southern High Plains, where breezy
downslope winds will support RH reductions to near 25% amid
marginally dry fuels. Coastal southern CA and adjacent areas of
southwest AZ will see another day of dry conditions with RH values
in the low to mid teens. Breezy conditions are expected this
afternoon, but any stronger gusts will be more localized and
transient compared to Friday due to a weaker regional pressure
gradient. Latest fuel guidance continues to show near seasonal ERC
values for this region, which further mitigates a more robust fire
weather concern.

Fire weather concerns will once again be limited on Sunday as a cold
front sweeps southward through the Plains, ushering in another round
of cool temperatures and only modest RH reductions. Height rises
along the West Coast will help strengthen the mid-level pressure
gradient over southern CA. Improving wind support aloft, combined
with a strengthening surface high over the inter-mountain West, will
yield another day of moderate Santa Ana winds along the southern CA
coast. Wind gusts up to 30-50 mph are possible within the higher
terrain and RH reductions into the low teens are probable. However,
live fuel moisture remains too high to support a more appreciable
fire weather threat. Elevated conditions may evolve across parts of
southwest AZ where 10-hour fuel moisture is between 3-5%, but
confidence in the coverage and duration of such conditions is too
low for highlights.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent deterministic models and ensemble means remain generally in
reasonable agreement with the larger scale upper-pattern through
the first half of the medium range forecast period, with some
minor timing differences noted with the individual shortwaves. A
composite blend of the GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the
National Blend of Models and WPC continuity seems to offer a
reasonable forecast basis for days 3-5 (Tue-Thu). Replaced the
models with the more compatible GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means in the
WPC composite to better maintain WPC continuity later week into
next weekend amid steadily growing forecast spread.

...Pattern Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper flow pattern next week will feature a West Coast ridge
with an anomalous closed upper high. This will couple with a
broadly amplified trough east of the Rockies as part of a positive
PNA pattern. A series of northern stream shortwaves/clipper
systems reinforcing the trough over the next week offer limited
precipitation potential across the northern tier in moderated
flow. The best bet for enhanced wintry weather may hinge on the
complex development of lead coastal lows developing off the East
Coast through Tuesday night. Otherwise, expect mainly dry
conditions for most locations next week.

...Clipper System will produce light snow across the Upper Midwest
through Monday morning...

...A storm off the Southeast Coast will mainly produce rain along
the East Coast...

...A warm-up for the Northern High/Northern Plains into the
Central Plains...

A Clipper System will move from the Upper Mississippi Valley to
the Great Lakes from Saturday evening into Monday. The energy
associated with the Clipper will produce light snow across parts
of the Northern Rockies to the Upper Great Lakes. The snow will
end over the Northern Rockies by Sunday morning. The snow will
continue over the Upper Great Lakes on Sunday into Monday and
expand into parts of the Ohio Valley on Monday.

Meanwhile, low pressure will develop along a front just offshore
of Florida s east coast overnight Saturday into Sunday morning. As
a result, light rain will develop over parts of Florida on
Saturday night into Sunday. On Sunday afternoon, the light rain
will expand into more of the Southeast and move into the Carolinas
on Monday. The rain will expand into the Mid-Atlantic Coast and
Southern New England Coast by Monday evening.

Elsewhere, upper-level energy over Texas will aid in producing
light rain along the Western Gulf Coast overnight Sunday into
Monday. Moreover, a weakening front will move onshore over the
Pacific Northwest on early Monday morning into Monday afternoon,
producing light rain over parts of the Northwest Coast. Lastly,
weak upper-level ridging will aid in warming up the Northern
High/Northern Plains into the Central Plains just above average
for Sunday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat February 05 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1241 AM CST Sun Feb 06 2022

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential will generally remain low today across most
of the CONUS. Breezy conditions are expected across from the plains
of MT into the central and southern Plains this afternoon, and may
support brief periods of elevated wind/RH combinations. Marginal
fuel status and low confidence in sustained elevated RH preclude
highlights. Across southern California, building surface high
pressure over the Intermountain West will drive another day of
offshore winds. Wind gusts up to 30-50 mph are already noted this
morning within the higher terrain of Los Angeles and Ventura
counties, and will likely persist through early Monday. RH
reductions into the teens are expected in the lee of terrain
features, and areas of elevated to critical wind/RH combinations are
probable. While the latest fuel guidance has shown a drying trend in
finer fuels over the past few days, live fuel moisture values remain
too high to support a robust fire weather concern.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
157 AM EST Sun Feb 6 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Feb 9 2022 - 12Z Sun Feb 13 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A rather amplified upper level pattern will be in place for this
forecast period with a synoptic scale ridge centered near the West
Coast and a broad trough over the eastern half of the nation, with
multiple embedded shortwaves/fronts tracking across the Plains and
then to the Great Lakes and Northeast.  There is some hint of a
potential pattern change by next Sunday and beyond as a more
active storm track over the northeast Pacific tries to break down
the western ridge some.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest deterministic model guidance and ensemble means are
generally in reasonable agreement with the overall synoptic scale
pattern through the end of the work week, with some minor timing
differences noted with the individual shortwaves east of the
Rockies and a slightly more amplified solution with the CMC across
the Southwest and the Rio Grande Valley with a southern stream
shortwave.  By next weekend, more noteworthy timing/amplitude
differences exist with a shortwave trough dropping south from
western Canada and across the central U.S., and also with
shortwave energy approaching the Pacific Northwest late next
Sunday.

To account for the increasing uncertainty with shortwave timing
across the central/eastern U.S. for next weekend, a majority of
the ensemble means was used as a starting point in the forecast
process with a little of the deterministic guidance, whereas a
multi-deterministic blend worked well for the middle to end of the
week.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The majority of the continental U.S. will enjoy dry weather and
little in the way of weather related disruptions overall.  There
will likely be some rounds of light snow showers from the Upper
Midwest to the Great Lakes and New England as a couple of clipper
type systems track across the region, but they will probably not
have a significant source of moisture from the Gulf or Atlantic,
thus keeping QPF modest.  Snow showers are also likely across
portions of the Rockies on Wednesday, with accumulations generally
a few inches or less.

Temperatures are expected to generally be above average across
much of the western U.S. and the High Plains, and within 5 degrees
of climatological average for much of the eastern U.S. overall,
despite the upper level trough pattern in place.  Readings across
the central and northern Plains are expected to be about 10-20
degrees above average for the end of the week.  Colder weather
looks to make a return to the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region
by next Sunday with highs running up to 10 degrees below normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 AM CST Sun Feb 06 2022

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Monday's fire weather potential will primarily be confined to the
High Plains of MT and coastal southern CA. However, the threat for
both regions will be dependent on fuel conditions, which currently
do not support fire spread.

...Montana...
Mid-level zonal flow is expected to strengthen over the northern
Rockies through the day Monday. As this occurs, winds gusting to
30-50 mph will likely develop across central MT in the lee of the
terrain. Recent guidance hints that downslope warming/drying may
drive RH reductions into the teens and 20s for many locations, but a
large spread in maximum temperatures is noted in recent ensemble
guidance and deterministic runs, which casts some uncertainty into
the RH forecast. Additionally, fuels across the region are only
modestly dry (ERCs between the 60-80th percentile) after recent
rounds of scattered precipitation. Trends in guidance and fuel
status will be monitored for a more robust fire weather concern.

...Coastal Southern California...
Strong offshore gradients winds are expected through Monday morning
along the southern CA coast. Wind gusts up to 30-50 mph are
probable, but should gradually weaken through the afternoon as the
regional pressure gradient slackens. Downslope drying will likely
support RH reductions into the teens for several locations,
supporting periods of elevated to critical conditions. However, the
duration of these conditions may be limited to the morning hours and
high live fuel moisture will further mitigate the overall fire
weather threat.

The most unsettled weather in the continental U.S. to close out
the weekend and kickoff the upcoming work-week will be across the
Great Lakes and along the East Coast. Today, a weak wave of low
pressure tracking across the Great Lakes will produce light snow
accumulations in the northern tier of the Great Lakes. Off the
Southeast coast, a new area of low pressure is forecast to form
along a quasi-stationary front off today. Spotty showers will be
common from central Florida on north to the Carolina coast today
into Monday. A wintry mix forming Sunday night into Monday could
lead to light ice accumulations in the North and South Carolina
Piedmont and foothills. As the storm begins to move north along
the coast tonight and into Monday, another area of icy wintry mix
may develop from the urban I-95 corridor in the northern
Mid-Atlantic to southern New England, just in time to potentially
lead to treacherous driving conditions for the Monday evening rush
hour. The coastal low is set to deepen off the Mid-Atlantic coast
Monday night and track north and east, leading to a swath of snow
across central and eastern New England Monday night into Tuesday
morning. Interests in New England will want to keep an eye on the
forecast in the coming days with the best chances for snow totals
exceeding 4 inches in the state of Maine. The immediate coastal
areas are most likely to witness more rain than snow.

The remainder of the Lower 48 is expected to see mostly dry
conditions thanks to an expansive area of high pressure throughout
the West. Temperature-wise, parts of the northern and central
Plains get a taste of more March-like temperatures while
seasonally mild conditions persist along the West Coast.
Meanwhile, farther east, a bitterly cold Sunday morning in the
Northeast eventually warms to more seasonal levels by Monday. The
coldest temperature anomalies over the next couple days are
centered in the South where chilly daytime highs will be common.
To the northwest, an upper level disturbance tracking into western
Canada early Monday races south and east into the North Central
U.S. Monday afternoon. This trough will result in a resurgence in
strong winds across Montana, leading to the issuance of High Wind
Watches for parts of the state on Monday.

Canada early Monday races south and east into the North Central
U.S. Monday afternoon. This trough will result in a resurgence in
strong winds across Montana, leading to the issuance of High Wind
Watches for parts of the state on Monday.

...Light snow possible in parts of the Great Lakes today and into
Monday...

...An organizing storm system off the East Coast to bring rain to
the Mid-Atlantic coast, snow and and icy wintry mix to parts of
the Northeast...

...Taste of early Spring in the northern and central Plains, high
winds possible in Montana...

The most unsettled weather in the continental U.S. to close out
the weekend and kickoff the upcoming work-week will be across the
Great Lakes and along the East Coast. Today, a weak wave of low
pressure tracking across the Great Lakes will produce light snow
accumulations in the northern tier of the Great Lakes. Off the
Southeast coast, a new area of low pressure is forecast to form
along a quasi-stationary front off today. Spotty showers will be
common from central Florida on north to the Carolina coast today
into Monday. A wintry mix forming Sunday night into Monday could
lead to light ice accumulations in the North and South Carolina
Piedmont and foothills. As the storm begins to move north along
the coast tonight and into Monday, another area of icy wintry mix
may develop from the urban I-95 corridor in the northern
Mid-Atlantic to southern New England, just in time to potentially
foster treacherous driving conditions for the Monday evening rush
hour. The coastal low is set to deepen off the Mid-Atlantic coast
Monday night and track north and east, leading to a swath of snow
across central and eastern New England Monday night into Tuesday
morning. Interests in New England will want to keep an eye on the
forecast in the coming days with the best chances for snow totals
exceeding 4 inches in the state of Maine. The immediate coastal
areas are most likely to witness more rain than snow.

The remainder of the Lower 48 is expected to see mostly dry
conditions thanks to an expansive area of high pressure throughout
the West. Temperature-wise, parts of the northern and central
Plains get a taste of more March-like temperatures while
seasonally mild conditions persist along the West Coast.
Meanwhile, farther east, a bitterly cold Sunday morning in the
Northeast eventually warms to more seasonal levels by Monday. The
coldest temperature anomalies over the next couple days are
centered in the South where chilly daytime highs will be common.
To the northwest, an upper level disturbance tracking into western
Canada early Monday races south and east into the North Central
U.S. Monday afternoon. This trough will result in a resurgence in
strong winds across Montana, leading to the issuance of High Wind
Watches for parts of the state on Monday.

Monday but any potential flooding is not a concern across the
region at this time.

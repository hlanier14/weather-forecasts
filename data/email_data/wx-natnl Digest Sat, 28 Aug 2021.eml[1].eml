Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1046 AM CDT Fri Aug 27 2021

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

An Elevated fire weather risk area is introduced for portions of the
northern Sacramento Valley. Mid-morning surface observations show
winds throughout the northern portion of the Valley already
sustained at 10-15 mph with gusts into the high teens and low 20s
amid falling RH into the 20-30% range. Recent hi-res guidance
suggests winds will increase to 15-20 mph, gusting to 20-25 mph by
the afternoon through much of the northern Valley. Highlights are
introduced given this increased confidence in coverage of elevated
(to locally critical) fire weather conditions.

The forecast for Wyoming remains on track with only minor
adjustments needed. Elevated wind/RH conditions will likely occur
across parts of central UT, but fuels generally remain unreceptive
at this time.

..Moore.. 08/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1247 AM CDT Fri Aug 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will remain across the northern Rockies today.
Strong mid-level winds will impact parts of southern Idaho into
Wyoming. As the trough moves slowly eastward, surface high pressure
will build into the Northwest.

...Wyoming...
Strong mid-level winds will combine with deepening surface low
pressure in the High Plains to bring 15-20 mph wind across southern
and eastern Wyoming. Fuels are not overly dry in these areas, but
the strength of the surface winds and 10-20% RH will elevate fire
weather concerns during the afternoon.

...Northern California...
The surface high pressure building in the Northwest will drive
downslope winds into parts of the western Sacramento Valley.
Mid-level winds will not be favorably aligned with the Valley.
Locally elevated to near critical fire weather is still possible
from late morning in potentially mid-afternoon. Elevated conditions
are limited in space. No highlights will be added at this time.

...Hurricane Ida will bring a heavy rainfall/flooding threat from
the central Gulf Coast to the Mid-Atlantic through Thursday...

...Tropical Storm Nora, forecast to become a Hurricane, to fuel a
Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat mid-later next week...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest guidance remains reasonably clustered across the board
for days 3-5 so a majority blend of the ECMWF/GFS serves as a good
starting point for the WPC forecast. By the second half of next
week, guidance begins to differ mainly in the details and timing
of digging energy across the Western U.S. and progression of the
leading frontal boundary. The 00z ECMWF is noticeably faster with
that leading shortwave days 6-7 than the GFS, but the ensemble
means are a little more agreeable and give a good middle ground
solution at this this point. Thus, the WPC forecast blend leans
more on the ECENS/GEFS ensemble means by later in the period.

The big story however during this period continues to be impending
hazardous impacts from Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of Mexico and
Tropical Storm Nora, forecast to track up the Gulf of California.
The WPC forecast for these systems closely follows the latest
track guidance from the National Hurricane Center, though the
ECMWF seems to be the best proxy for Ida at least. Please refer to
products from the National Hurricane Center and the local offices
to obtain the latest information regarding both of these dangerous
tropical systems.


...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Hurricane Ida is expected to strengthen further as it moves
steadily towards the northwest with an expected landfall along the
Louisiana coast late Sunday or very early Monday as a major
hurricane. By Monday morning (the start of the extended range),
Ida should be bringing gusty winds and very heavy rainfall to
parts of the central Gulf Coast region with total rainfall
(Sunday-Tuesday) in excess of 6 inches (with locally much higher
amounts) likely from southeast Louisiana into Mississippi. After
Monday, Ida is forecast to make a sharp turn towards the
east-northeast spreading the heavy rainfall threat into the
Tennessee/Lower Ohio Valleys on Tuesday/Wednesday. Considerable
flash, urban, small stream, and riverine flooding is likely
associated with Ida. Moisture feeding increasingly inland with
time may also then interact with a slowing front draped over the
system, offering a lead heavy rainfall focus into parts of the
central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic after Wednesday.

Tropical Storm Nora is also forecast to become a Hurricane with
the current track guidance from NHC bringing it northward into the
Gulf of California and eventually into far northeast Mexico.
Leading deep tropical moisture ahead of Nora will likely fuel a
Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat next week. The guidance continues
to show some uncertainty in the track and certainly a track for
longer over the Gulf waters could bring a more substantial heavy
rainfall threat into the Southwest. By later next week, leading
moisture may also bring moderate to locally heavy, and terrain
enhanced, rains into the central Rockies as well.

Elsewhere, a northern stream upper trough and lower atmospheric
frontal system progression across the Northeast quarter of the
country early next week will support a period with locally
enhanced rain. Additional upper troughing well upstream will
meanwhile dig a wavy but only modestly unsettling/cooling front
down from the Northwest. Subsequent system progressions and
genesis mid-later next week out across the Rockies to the
north-central U.S. will increasingly focus an enhanced
convection/rainfall pattern that could focus locally heavy
convection/rainfall.

241 PM EDT Fri Aug 27 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Aug 30 2021 - 12Z Fri Sep 03 2021

...Hurricane Ida will bring a heavy rainfall/flooding threat from
the central Gulf Coast to the Mid-Atlantic through Thursday...

...Tropical Storm Nora, forecast to become a Hurricane, to fuel a
Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat mid-later next week...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest guidance remains reasonably clustered across the board
for days 3-5 so a majority blend of the ECMWF/GFS serves as a good
starting point for the WPC forecast. By the second half of next
week, guidance begins to differ mainly in the details and timing
of digging energy across the Western U.S. and progression of the
leading frontal boundary. The 00z ECMWF is noticeably faster with
that leading shortwave days 6-7 than the GFS, but the ensemble
means are a little more agreeable and give a good middle ground
solution at this this point. Thus, the WPC forecast blend leans
more on the ECENS/GEFS ensemble means by later in the period.

The big story however during this period continues to be impending
hazardous impacts from Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of Mexico and
Tropical Storm Nora, forecast to track up the Gulf of California.
The WPC forecast for these systems closely follows the latest
track guidance from the National Hurricane Center, though the
ECMWF seems to be the best proxy for Ida at least. Please refer to
products from the National Hurricane Center and the local offices
to obtain the latest information regarding both of these dangerous
tropical systems.


...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Hurricane Ida is expected to strengthen further as it moves
steadily towards the northwest with an expected landfall along the
Louisiana coast late Sunday or very early Monday as a major
hurricane. By Monday morning (the start of the extended range),
Ida should be bringing gusty winds and very heavy rainfall to
parts of the central Gulf Coast region with total rainfall
(Sunday-Tuesday) in excess of 6 inches (with locally much higher
amounts) likely from southeast Louisiana into Mississippi. After
Monday, Ida is forecast to make a sharp turn towards the
east-northeast spreading the heavy rainfall threat into the
Tennessee/Lower Ohio Valleys on Tuesday/Wednesday. Considerable
flash, urban, small stream, and riverine flooding is likely
associated with Ida. Moisture feeding increasingly inland with
time may also then interact with a slowing front draped over the
system, offering a lead heavy rainfall focus into parts of the
central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic after Wednesday.

Tropical Storm Nora is also forecast to become a Hurricane with
the current track guidance from NHC bringing it northward into the
Gulf of California and eventually into far northeast Mexico.
Leading deep tropical moisture ahead of Nora will likely fuel a
Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat next week. The guidance continues
to show some uncertainty in the track and certainly a track for
longer over the Gulf waters could bring a more substantial heavy
rainfall threat into the Southwest. By later next week, leading
moisture may also bring moderate to locally heavy, and terrain
enhanced, rains into the central Rockies as well.

Elsewhere, a northern stream upper trough and lower atmospheric
frontal system progression across the Northeast quarter of the
country early next week will support a period with locally
enhanced rain. Additional upper troughing well upstream will
meanwhile dig a wavy but only modestly unsettling/cooling front
down from the Northwest. Subsequent system progressions and

convection/rainfall pattern that could focus locally heavy
convection/rainfall.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 27 2021

SYNOPSIS: Multiple models generally favor weak mid-level low pressure acros=
s
the North-Central lower 48 and mid-level high pressure across South-Central
and
southwestern parts of the country at the beginning of week-2. This pattern
supports increased chances for much below normal temperatures across the
North-Central contiguous U.S. and excessive heat across the South-Central a=
t
the beginning of week-2. By the middle of the period there is increasing
disagreement among the models regarding the mid-level pattern. The 0Z ECMWF
ensemble mean indicates a more amplified pattern compared to the other mode=
ls,
with mid-level low (high) pressure across the eastern (western)contiguous
U.S.,
while the 0Z GEFS and Canadian ensemble means show weak mid-level high (low=
)
pressure across the eastern (western). Some model ensembles and determinist=
ic
model runs still show the possibility of additional tropical cyclone (TC)
formation near the Yucatan peninsula and Gulf of Mexico later next week,
although it is too early to determine the track of this potential TC. Over
Alaska, mid-level high pressure is generally favored during the period,
supporting primarily above (below) normal temperatures (precipitation) duri=
ng
week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the Northern
Plains, Sat-Mon, Sep 4-6.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Central and Southern Plains =
and
Lower Mississippi Valley, Sat-Mon, Sep 4-6.

-9HNtyzLu3X$

FOR SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 04 - FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 10: The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensemble indicate negative 500-hPa height anomalies across the
North-Central CONUS at the beginning of the period, which may support
anomalously cold temperatures over the region. A slight risk of much below
normal temperatures is continued in today's outlook for the Northern Plains=
,
Sep 4 to 6, based on the ECMWF reforecast tool indicating at least a 20%
chance
of falling to the lowest 15th percentile and less than 40 Deg F. The GEFS
reforecast tool probabilities do not reach 20% with these thresholds. Howev=
er,
based on the good run to run model consistency of the ECMWF, the week-2 mea=
n
temperature skill weighted consolidation tool favoring the ECMWF, and this
potential for this to be the first cold event of the season in the region,
with
temperatures dipping this low, a risk area is depicted.



There is relatively good agreement among the model ensemble means indicatin=
g
amplified mid-level ridging across the South-Central CONUS, bringing
anomalously warm temperatures to the region. Due to good run to run model
consistency and an increased signal for heat in the CPC heat tool, a slight
risk of excessive heat is posted for the Southern Plains and Lower Mississi=
ppi
Valley, Sep 4 to 6. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at le=
ast
a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 D=
eg
F
in the highlighted heat risk area. There is multi-model support of dewpoint=
s
exceeding 70 Deg F in this region, which could support elevated heat index
values. The CPC skill weighted heat index tool indicates at least a 20% cha=
nce
of heat index values exceeding the 90th percentile and 105 Deg F. The tool
shows higher probabilities (greater than 30% to 40%) of exceeding the 90th
percentile across the Central and Southern Plains. Anticipated heat may be
especially of concern across the Lower Mississippi Valley, given the
possibility of power outages associated with the storm track of Hurricane I=
da.



Recent runs of the deterministic GFS continue to indicate the possibility o=
f
surface low formation in the southern Gulf of Mexico or Caribbean Sea durin=
g
week-2, but has trended significantly weaker in recent runs compared to
yesterday. Due to high model uncertainty, no precipitation hazards are post=
ed
at this time.



At the start of week-2, the orientation of thermal low pressure over the Gu=
lf
of California extending northward into parts of the Desert Southwest into
parts
of Southern California may support enhanced moisture to the Four Corners. T=
he
ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitatio=
n
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and half an inch across
southwestern Arizona and parts of New Mexico Sep 4 to 6. The GEFS reforecas=
t
tool, however, does not indicate this enhanced precipitation feature. As of
5:00am PDT, the NHC is monitoring tropical storm Nora (currently located so=
uth
of Mexico), which is forecast to move over the Gulf of California as a
hurricane as early as next week. Impacts from this storm are anticipated to
occur prior to week-2. The deterministic 6Z GFS indicates the possibility o=
f
another surface low forming south of Mexico at the start of week-2, trackin=
g
toward the mouth of the Gulf of California by the latter part of the period=
.
The 0Z deterministic ECMWF, however, forecasts a significantly weaker surfa=
ce
low compared to the GFS, with the track remaining further south. Due to the=
se
significant model differences, no flood or heavy precipitation hazards are
posted for the Four Corners region at this time.



Mid-level ridging predicted over Alaska predominately favors above-normal
temperatures and below-normal precipitation across much of the southern
Mainland and Alaska Panhandle, thus no hazards are posted for the state dur=
ing
week-2.

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Elevated conditions through
the northern Sacramento Valley may linger into early Saturday, but
latest ensemble guidance shows weakening winds through the day.
Elevated conditions may evolve within the Wyoming basin Saturday
afternoon, but mean winds near 15 mph (as suggested by latest
ensembles) suggests these conditions will be localized in nature.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1248 AM CDT Fri Aug 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
Weak, shortwave ridging aloft will occur across the Northwest and
northern Rockies on Saturday. Lack of stronger winds at mid-levels
and at the surface will generally keep fire weather concerns to a
minimum. Early in the period, remaining breezy, northerly winds into
the Sacramento Valley may pose some concern for brief elevated
conditions. Along with the short duration, marginal RH values
preclude highlights.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri August 27 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 02 - 06 2021

Dynamical models remain in good agreement regarding the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America during the 6-10 day period. Trough=
s
are initially favored over the Northwestern and Northeastern CONUS, with
ridging across the central CONUS. A quick transition to a more zonal patter=
n
is
forecast by the middle of the period, with the 0z ECMWF ensemble indicating
broad troughing developing across the eastern and central CONUS by day-10.
Ridging initially predicted across the Alaska Panhandle is forecast to weak=
en
with troughing over the Bering Sea and western Alaska becoming more
influential
over the region. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual blend depicts nea=
r normal 500-hPa heights
across most of the CONUS, except the Northeast where below normal heights a=
re
predicted. Positive height anomalies are favored for much of Mainland Alask=
a
and the Panhandle, with negative height anomalies forecast across the
Aleutians
and Alaska Peninsula.

Near to above normal temperature probabilities are increased over the easte=
rn
and central CONUS underneath predicted mid-level ridging early in the perio=
d.
This ridging is forecast to break down by the middle of the period, and doe=
s
so
faster in the 0z ECMWF ensemble compared to the 0z GEFS. The GEFS persists =
the
ridge longer, and subsequently favors below normal temperatures for the
Northeast associated with northwesterly mid-level flow. However, the more
zonal
flow pattern indicated by the ECMWF favors near to above normal temperature=
s
across the Northeast, although the more robust troughing by the end of the
period would be indicative of a trend toward cooler temperaturestemeprautre=
s.
Additionally, the consolidation forecast tool and analog guidance both favo=
r
below normal temperaturestemeprautres in the Northeast for the period as a
whole, and as a result, a slight tilt toward increased below normal
temperature
probabilities is highlighted over the region. Near to below normal
temperatures
are forecast across the western CONUS as a result of the initial troughing,=
 in
addition to increased soil moisturemoisure over the Southwest due to foreca=
st
antecedent precipitation. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are
increased over nearly all of Alaska, supported by the ECMWF and GEFS
reforecast
tools.

Hurricane Ida, located off the southern coast of Cuba, is forecast to rapid=
ly
strengthen into a major hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico, with direct impa=
cts
to the northern Gulf Coast becoming increasinglyincreasing likely prior to =
the
start of the 6-10 day forecast period. On days 6 and 7, the latest forecast=
s
from the Weather Prediction Center depict the remnant low of Ida tracking
across the TennesseeTennesee Valley and the southern Mid-Atlantic. Both the=
 0z
GEFS and ECMWF ensembles agree on this track, but the ECMWF depicts more
frontal interaction, which would lead to increased precipitation chances
farther to the north over the Northeast, where the GEFS reforecast tool
continues to favor below normal precipitation over the Northeast. Today=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
manual forecast depicts the highest probabilities of above normal
precipitation
across parts of the Tennessee Valley, central Appalachians, and mid-Atlanti=
c,
consistent with where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict the
highest precipitation chances. Near normal precipitation is forecast for th=
e
Northeast due to the increased uncertainty in that region. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are increased in locations farther from the
forecast storm track, across portions of the Southern Plains, southeastern
Georgia, and the Florida Peninsula.

Elsewhere across the U.S., shortwave troughing is forecast to propagate fro=
m
the Pacific Northwest to the north-central CONUS during the first half of t=
he
period. This favors increased precipitation chances downstream across the
Rockies and Northern and Central Plains due to enhanced frontal activity.
Additional moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Nora may also
contribute to elevated precipitation chances across these areas, with a dry=
ing
trend forecast over the Southwest as the system departs. A drier pattern is
forecast on the backside of this trough with increased below normal
precipitation probabilities forecast over the Great Basin and Pacific
Northwest. Elevated near to below above precipitation probabilities are
favored
for most of Alaska as troughing develops over the Bering Sea and western
Mainland imparting more anamolously southerly flow over much of the state.
Below normal precipitation probabilities are increased across the Aleutians
and
extreme western Mainland, behind the mean trough axis, and supported by the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 04 - 10 2021

A generally low amplitude mid-level flow pattern is forecast across North
America during week-2. The 0z ECMWF ensemble continues to be the most robus=
t
regarding broad, mid-level troughing developing over the eastern and centra=
l
CONUS. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 0z GEFS and Canadian ensembles bot=
h indicate the potential
for
troughing as well, but lower in amplitude and centered farther to the west
compared to the ECMWF. Given the uncertainty in the evolution, today=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
manual
blend depicts slightly below normal 500-hPa heights extending from the
Northern
Plains through the Northeast, and near to above normal heights elsewhere
across
the remainder of the CONUS and Alaska, with the highest positive height
anomalies (>30 meters) located along the West Coast of the CONUS and Mainla=
nd
Alaska.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored across most of the CONUS as a
result of the low amplitude mid-level flow pattern forecast. Below normal
temperature probabilities are increased across the Northern Plains, Upper
Mississippi Valley, and Northeast as the aforementioned troughing may promo=
te
anomalous mid-level northwesterly flow advecting a relatively colder air ma=
ss
from Canada into the northern CONUS. There is considerable uncertainty over
the
West, where the ECMWF reforecast guidance depicts increased above normal
temperature probabilities versus increased below normal temperature
probabilities indicated in the GEFS reforecast tool. The consolidation tool
favors the warmer ECMWF guidance, and today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs for=
ecast continues to depict
increased near to slightly above normal temperature probabilities over the
western CONUS, but decreased in magnitude and coverage compared to yesterda=
y.
Both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tool continue to support increased above
normal temperature probabilities for most of Alaska.

Increased chances of above normal precipitation remain favored over much of
the
eastern and central CONUS as a result of predicted intermittent frontal
activity. Near to below normal precipitation probabilities are increased
across
much of the western CONUS, southwestern Mainland Alaska, and the Aleutians,
supported by the reforecast guidance. Probabilities for above normal
preciaition are increased over parts of the northern and eastern Mainland d=
ue
to weak troughing upstream.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted low amplitude mid-level pattern and uncertainty in the surface
pattern evolution.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
404 PM EDT Fri Aug 27 2021

Valid 00Z Sat Aug 28 2021 - 00Z Mon Aug 30 2021

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding will be possible across
parts of the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest through Sunday
morning...

...Parts of the Mid-Atlantic may experience flash flooding and
severe weather this evening...

...Excessive and dangerous heat likely throughout much of the
Southwest over the weekend...

...Hurricane Ida is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane
as it approaches the Central Gulf Coast with landfall likely on
Sunday evening, bringing heavy rain to the region and a Moderate
Risk of Excessive Rainfall...

For a majority of the short-range period one long frontal boundary
is expected to remain quasi-stationary as it drapes over the
Northeast, Great Lakes, Plains, and central Rockies/Great Basin
through Sunday morning. A majority of the activity for the next
couple of days along this boundary will be focused on the Upper
Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. This evening a pair of surface
lows over Nebraska and Minnesota are expected to lift northeast
into the Upper Midwest along with an associated warm front. As
storms develop along the front favorable wind shear and rising
dewpoints are expected to be in place to support some of these
storms becoming severe with the potential to produce high winds,
large hail, and a few tornadoes. Furthermore, high atmospheric
moisture will allow for heavy rain rates that could possibility
lead to flash flooding. As such, the Storm Prediction Center has
issued a Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms for portions of Iowa,
Minnesota, and Wisconsin, while the Weather Prediction Center has
issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for a similar area, but
extended east to include parts of western Michigan. Both issuances
are valid through Saturday morning.

With the help of an upper-level trough an occluded boundary is
forecast to propagate along the quasi-stationary boundary from the
Northern Plains into the Upper Midwest on Saturday. As the upper
trough and occlusion interact with parts of the quasi-stationary
boundary as they move through these regions, heavy rain and severe
weather are expected to impact both the Central Plains and Upper
Midwest. Similar to the previous day, strong surface instability,
high atmospheric moisture values, and favorable wind shear will
create conditions within which flooding, high winds, large hail,
and a few tornadoes will be possible. To account for this the
Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk of Severe
Thunderstorms for portions of southern Minnesota and western
Wisconsin within a larger Slight Risk Area extending from Nebraska
to the Michigan Upper Peninsula, effective Saturday morning
through Sunday morning. Additionally, the Weather Prediction
Center has issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions
of northern Iowa, southern Minnesota, and western Wisconsin, valid
for the same time period.

On top of the activity in the Upper Midwest, severe weather is
also expected this evening ahead of a cold front passing through
the Mid-Atlantic and the aforementioned occluded boundary in the
Northern Plains. In the Mid-Atlantic a well defined Mesoscale
Convective Vortice moving slowly through southwest
Pennsylvania/western Maryland will encounter an unstable surface
layer that will allow for the development of severe thunderstorms
that may produce damaging winds. Additionally, high atmospheric
moisture values fueling heavy rainfall and wet soils due to the
recent passing of Henri earlier this week will make flash flooding
possible. These conditions have prompted the Storm Prediction
Center to issue a Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms and the
Weather Prediction Center to issue a Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall for portions of the Mid-Atlantic through tomorrow
morning. Meanwhile, storms capable of producing high winds and
large hail will also be possible over the Northern Plains due to
modest low-level moisture and strong deep-layer shear, prompting
the issuance of a Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms for portions
of eastern Montana and the western Dakotas through tomorrow
morning. Along the central Gulf Coast, high precipitable water
values will allow showers and thunderstorms that develop due to
shortwave energy at the surface to produce high rain rates with
accumulation totals of 3 to 6 inches in isolated areas. These high
totals have prompted the Weather Prediction Center to issue a
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for parts of eastern Louisiana
and extreme southern Mississippi through tomorrow morning.

Dangerously hot conditions are forecast to persist in the Desert
Southwest throughout the weekend, prompting the issuance of
Excessive Heat Warnings for much of south/western Arizona, extreme
southeast California, and southern Nevada. With temperatures
hitting triple digits and the mid to high 110s in some areas,
residents are urged to take precautions to avoid the onset of
heat-related illness. Such precautions include: drinking plenty of
fluids, staying out of the midday sun, seeking air-conditioned
locations, and avoiding outdoor activities. Heat Advisories are
also in effect for portions of the Middle Mississippi and Western
Ohio Valleys, where high temperatures are forecast to be in the
upper 90s and low 100s on Saturday.

At the end of the period all eyes will be on the Gulf Coast as
Hurricane Ida moves northwestward through the Gulf of Mexico
towards its projected landfall location of Louisiana, intensifying
into a major hurricane along its way. According to the latest
forecast from the National Hurricane Center, Ida is expected to
make landfall Sunday evening, bringing extremely heavy rainfall
and dangerous maximum sustained winds around 120 miles per hour to
coastal Louisiana and the surrounding area. Hurricane and Storm
Surge Watches are currently in effect for much of southern
Louisiana and extreme southern Mississippi.The Weather Prediction
Center has also issued a Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall for
southeast Louisiana and extreme southern Mississippi effective
Sunday morning. Widespread life-threatening flash and urban
flooding will be very likely. For the latest information on
Hurricane Ida, visit https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://nhc.noaa.gov__;!!K5=

...Hurricane Ida will bring a heavy rainfall/flooding threat from
the central Gulf Coast to the Mid-Atlantic through Thursday...

...Tropical Storm Nora, forecast to become a Hurricane, to fuel a
Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat mid-later next week...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest guidance remains reasonably clustered across the board
for days 3-5 so a majority blend of the ECMWF/GFS serves as a good
starting point for the WPC forecast. By the second half of next
week, guidance begins to differ mainly in the details and timing
of digging energy across the Western U.S. and progression of the
leading frontal boundary. The 00z ECMWF is noticeably faster with
that leading shortwave days 6-7 than the GFS, but the ensemble
means are a little more agreeable and give a good middle ground
solution at this this point. Thus, the WPC forecast blend leans
more on the ECENS/GEFS ensemble means by later in the period.

The big story however during this period continues to be impending
hazardous impacts from Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of Mexico and
Tropical Storm Nora, forecast to track up the Gulf of California.
The WPC forecast for these systems closely follows the latest
track guidance from the National Hurricane Center, though the
ECMWF seems to be the best proxy for Ida at least. Please refer to
products from the National Hurricane Center and the local offices
to obtain the latest information regarding both of these dangerous
tropical systems.


...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Hurricane Ida is expected to strengthen further as it moves
steadily towards the northwest with an expected landfall along the
Louisiana coast late Sunday or very early Monday as a major
hurricane. By Monday morning (the start of the extended range),
Ida should be bringing gusty winds and very heavy rainfall to
parts of the central Gulf Coast region with total rainfall
(Sunday-Tuesday) in excess of 6 inches (with locally much higher
amounts) likely from southeast Louisiana into Mississippi. After
Monday, Ida is forecast to make a sharp turn towards the
east-northeast spreading the heavy rainfall threat into the
Tennessee/Lower Ohio Valleys on Tuesday/Wednesday. Considerable
flash, urban, small stream, and riverine flooding is likely
associated with Ida. Moisture feeding increasingly inland with
time may also then interact with a slowing front draped over the
system, offering a lead heavy rainfall focus into parts of the
central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic after Wednesday.

Tropical Storm Nora is also forecast to become a Hurricane with
the current track guidance from NHC bringing it northward into the
Gulf of California and eventually into far northeast Mexico.
Leading deep tropical moisture ahead of Nora will likely fuel a
Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat next week. The guidance continues
to show some uncertainty in the track and certainly a track for
longer over the Gulf waters could bring a more substantial heavy
rainfall threat into the Southwest. By later next week, leading
moisture may also bring moderate to locally heavy, and terrain
enhanced, rains into the central Rockies as well.

Elsewhere, a northern stream upper trough and lower atmospheric
frontal system progression across the Northeast quarter of the
country early next week will support a period with locally
enhanced rain. Additional upper troughing well upstream will
meanwhile dig a wavy but only modestly unsettling/cooling front
down from the Northwest. Subsequent system progressions and
genesis mid-later next week out across the Rockies to the
north-central U.S. will increasingly focus an enhanced
convection/rainfall pattern that could focus locally heavy
convection/rainfall.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move through the northern Rockies towards
the upper Mississippi Valley today. Generally zonal flow will
develop across a sizable portion of the West. At the surface, high
pressure over the Northwest will weaken and shift into the Plains. A
weak boundary will move into the central Plains as the trough moves
east.

...Northern California...
Short-lived dry and windy conditions will exist early in the period
as high pressure will remain in the northern Rockies. Diminishing
flow aloft and at the surface will keep elevated conditions in parts
of the northern Sacramento Valley local and brief.

...Southern Wyoming...
Mid-level winds across Wyoming will be strong, especially in the
morning and early afternoon. These winds will weaken as the trough
moves east through the afternoon and evening. Given the sub-optimal
timing of the trough and uncertainty with the approach of the
boundary from the north, confidence is low on elevated conditions
being more than brief.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0102 AM CDT Sat Aug 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
On Sunday, zonal flow across the Northwest will gradually evolve
into broadly cyclonic flow as far south as the northern Great Basin.
The surface pressure pattern will remain rather diffuse. A modest
increase in mid-level winds across the northern Sierra will likely
promote low-end elevated fire weather conditions during the
afternoon and early evening. Winds of 15-20 mph with 10-15% will
exist. Confidence in the these conditions lasting a few hours is
greatest in the immediate lee of the Sierra. Locally elevated
conditions may extend into parts of northeastern Nevada, but
duration and spatial extent are too uncertain for highlights.

...Major Hurricane Ida to bring a Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat
from the central Gulf Coast to the Mid-Atlantic...

...Potent Nora track into Baja CA/Gulf of CA to fuel a lead
Southwest U.S. Heavy Rain Threat mid-later next week...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The big story continues to be impending hazardous impacts from
Hurricane Ida from the Gulf of Mexico and potent east tropical
Pacific Nora, forecast to track northward up the Gulf of
California. Please refer to products from the National Hurricane
Center and the local offices to obtain the latest information
regarding these dangerous systems.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived in
conjunction with NHC tracks for Ida and Nora along with well
clustered guidance from the 12/00 UTC ECMWF, ECMWF/GEFS ensembles
and WPC continuity that seems to best fit NHC and the overall flow
pattern over the rest of the lower 48 in a pattern with average to
above average predictability.


...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Dangerous Hurricane Ida is expected to strengthen further over the
Gulf of Mexico as it moves steadily towards the northwest with an
expected landfall along the Louisiana coast late Sunday as a major
hurricane. Ida will bring powerful and gusty winds and very heavy
rainfall to the central Gulf Coast region. Gradually weakening but
still very wet Ida is  forecast to make a sharp turn to the
east-northeast spreading the heavy rainfall threat into the
Tennessee/Ohio Valleys into Tuesday/Wednesday. Considerable flash,
urban, small stream, and riverine flooding is likely with Ida.
Deep moisture feeding inland with time will also interact with a
slow moving front draped over the system, offering a lead heavy
rainfall focus into the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic into
Wednesday/Thursday.

Tropical Storm Nora is also forecast to become a Hurricane with
the current track guidance from NHC bringing it northward into the
Gulf of California and eventually into far northwest Mexico.
Leading deep tropical moisture ahead of Nora will likely fuel a
Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat next week. The guidance continues
to show some uncertainty in the track and certainly a track for
longer over the Gulf waters could bring a more substantial heavy
rainfall threat into the Southwest. By later next week, leading
moisture may also bring moderate to locally heavy, and terrain
enhanced, rains into the central Rockies as well.

Elsewhere, ample northern stream upper troughing will meanwhile
dig a wavy but only modestly unsettling/cooling front down from
the Northwest. Subsequent system progressions and genesis
mid-later next week out across the Rockies to the north-central
U.S. will increasingly focus an enhanced convection/rainfall
pattern that could focus locally heavy convection/rainfall as
enhanced by embedded impulses and frontal/wave reinforcements.
Moisture/instability pooling may support some locally strong to
severe convection and heavy downpours.

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms and a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Upper Mississippi
Valley through Sunday morning...

...Hurricane IDA is forecast to intensify while moving toward the
Central Gulf Coast, having amongst other hazards, there will be a
High Risk of excessive rainfall on Sunday into Monday...

...Uncomfortable and potentially dangerous heat throughout much of
the Southwest and parts of the Midwest...

A front extending from the northern Mid-Atlantic westward to the
Great Lakes then into the Great Basin has a wave of low pressure
over South-Central Canada will pull the front northward into
Canada on Sunday.  On Monday, the trailing front will extend from
the Lower Great Lakes westward to another wave of low pressure
over the Northern High Plains. The system will produce showers and
thunderstorms along and near the boundary from the Northern High
Plains to the Great Lakes, as some of the storms will be very
energetic. As a result, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over the Upper Mississippi Valley through
Sunday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes. There is a 10% or greater probability of 65 knots
or greater wind gusts over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley.
Additionally, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through Sunday
morning.

The severe thunderstorm threat decreases to a marginal threat on
Sunday into Monday.  The excessive rainfall threat also diminishes
over the Upper Midwest on Sunday into Monday morning. Over the
Gulf Coast, tropical moisture and upper-level impulses will
produce showers and thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast into the
Southeast on Saturday.

Furthermore, Hurricane IDA is forecast to intensify while moving
toward the Central Gulf Coast, having amongst other hazards, there
will be a High Risk of excessive rainfall on Sunday into Monday.
Ida is currently forecast to make landfall over the Louisiana
Coast on Sunday evening.  Check with the NHC=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs latest bull=
etin
for the most up-to-date track and intensity of IDA.

IDA will produce heavy rain over parts of the Central Gulf Coast
on Sunday.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a High Risk of excessive
rainfall over the Central Gulf Coast on Sunday into Monday.
Severe, widespread flash flooding is expected with IDA. Areas that
normally do not experience flash flooding will flood. Lives and
property are in great danger on Sunday into Monday.

The excessive rainfall threat continues on Monday into Tuesday
with a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley.  There is also a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms with landfalling hurricanes with the main hazard of
a few tornadoes on Sunday into Monday.

Elsewhere, upper-level impulses and diurnal heating will produce
showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Southwest into the
Southern High Plains from the late afternoon into the late evening
on Saturday and Sunday.  Additionally, heat will also produce
hazards. Heat Advisories are posted over parts of the Great Lakes
and the Middle Mississippi Valley, where high temperatures are
forecast in the upper 80s to low 90s. Moreover, many areas of the
Midwest will have the possibility of record high minimum
temperatures on Saturday and Sunday morning. In the Southwest,
highs in the 110s are expected on Saturday, and an Excessive Heat
Warning remains in effect for the area through Saturday evening.

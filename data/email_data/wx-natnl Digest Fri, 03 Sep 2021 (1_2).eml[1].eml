Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1044 AM CDT Thu Sep 02 2021

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

The forecast remains on track with no areas introduced. Patchy
elevated fire weather conditions appear probable across southern NV
where winds are forecast to increase to 15-20 mph ahead of a weak
shortwave trough. RH reductions to near 10% are likely across much
of the region, but the overlap of low RH, sufficient winds, and dry
fuels is expected to remain limited to a narrow corridor roughly
from Indian Springs, NV to Ely, NV. Other forecast concerns remain
valid as outlined in the previous discussion below.

..Moore.. 09/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0101 AM CDT Thu Sep 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough across the Northwest will shift to the east
today. Northerly mid-level winds will be situated in western
Oregon/Washington. Mid-level winds will weaken across the northern
Great Basin. At the surface, weak high pressure will move into the
northern Rockies. A surface boundary in northern Nevada may slowly
sag farther southward into central Nevada during the day.

Locally elevated fire weather may develop near the surface boundary
in Nevada, but conditions will not be widespread and fuels become
less receptive from central Nevada southward.

Locally elevated conditions are also possible within the Willamette
Valley into southwest Oregon as north/northeasterly winds impact the
area. Though RH could fall below 20% in some locations, the general
weakness of the pressure gradient should keep most winds below 15
mph.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 02 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast across the central U.S. early=
 in
week-2 favoring increased chances for anomalously warm temperatures across
portions of the Rockies, Great Plains, and Mississippi Valley. Excessive he=
at
will be a concern across the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley d=
ue
to the increased humidity forecast, with impacts exacerbated by ongoing pow=
er
outages across areas just affected by Hurricane Ida. Dynamical models favor
mid-level low pressure along the west and east coasts of the contiguous U.S=
,
and also over the Bering Sea early in the period. By the second half of the
period, a more zonal mid-level pattern is favored across North America
reducing
the chances of hazardous weather.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
Southern Great Plains, and the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Fri-Mon, Sep 10-13.

Slight risk of heavy rain for parts of southeastern Texas, Fri-Mon, Sep 10-=
13.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, =
and
California, Fri-Sun, Sep 10-12.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Aleutians, Alaska Peninsula, and
extreme southwestern Mainland Alaska, Fri-Sun, Sep 10-12.

FOR FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 10 - THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 16: The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensembles depict anomalous subtropical ridging over the interior
western CONUS late in week-1, shifting east toward the central CONUS early =
in
week-2. This favors increased chances of above normal temperatures across m=
uch
of the western and central CONUS. Surface high pressure forecast near the E=
ast
Coast also favors increased southerly return flow across the region, which
will
favor elevated humidity levels closer to the Gulf of Mexico coast. While it=
 is
becoming increasing harder to reach hazardous heat levels as the Autumn sea=
son
approaches, there are indications that portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley, Southern Great Plains, and the Lower Rio Grande Valley may experien=
ce
heat index values greater than 105 deg F, where a slight risk for excessive
heat is highlighted from Sep 10 to Sep 13. Cooling resources may be limited
across parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley due to ongoing widespread powe=
r
outages in the wake of Hurricane Ida. This may lead to increased risk for h=
eat
related health impacts across the region. High temperatures exceeding 90 de=
g F
are possible along the Front Range of the Rockies. However, heat advisory
criteria is unlikely to be reached across this area precluding the hazard f=
rom
being extended. The evolving mid-level pattern also favors anomalously warm
temperatures to expand into parts of the eastern CONUS by the middle of the
period. While temperatures are likely to be on the warm side by mid-Septemb=
er
standards, excessive heat is not expected in the East.



It is becoming less likely that a tropical system will develop over the Gul=
f
of
Mexico based on the latest forecasts from the National Hurricane Center.
However, increased southerly flow forecast along the western Gulf Coast may
still result in elevated chances for heavy rain across the region during th=
e
early and middle parts of week-2. The GEFS reforecast tool indicates portio=
ns
of southeastern Texas having at least a 20% chance for 3-day precipitation =
to
exceed the 85th climatological percentile and 1-inch, corresponding with a
slight risk for heavy rain for Sep 10 through Sep 13. The ECMWF reforecast
tool
is less robust with this threat compared to the GEFS, although the
uncalibrated
0z ECMWF ensemble depicts 20% probabilities for 3-day rainfall totals of
greater than 1-inch reaching the southeastern Texas Coast, supporting the
slight risk. The 0z Canadian ensemble depicts heavy rain further to the eas=
t
across coastal portions of Louisiana and Mississippi. While this would be o=
f
concern due to these areas still recovering from Hurricane Ida, the lack of
support from the other tools precludes the hazard from being extended at th=
is
time.



Moderate to major river flooding is ongoing across portions of the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Northeast due to heavy rainfall caused by the remnan=
ts
of Hurricane Ida. However, since most river levels are expected to fall int=
o
the minor flood stage or lower across these areas by the beginning of week-=
2,
a
flooding hazard is not depicted on the map. Please refer to local NWS offic=
es
for the latest flooding updates.



Multiple large wildfires continue to burn throughout the West, threatening
life
and property along with reducing air quality over a widespread area. The
Caldor
Fire in the Lake Tahoe basin of northern California has burned over 210,000
acres and is only 25% contained. Upstream of the ridge forecast over the
central CONUS, a mid-level trough is forecast to build into the western U.S=
.,
leading to an increasing chance of gusty winds which would promote further
spread of ongoing wildfires. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs models, part=
icularly the ECMWF
ensemble,
are less amplified with the trough compared to yesterday, which may reduce =
the
potential for high winds. A slight risk of high wind speeds remains in plac=
e
across portions of California, the Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin from =
Sep
10 to Sep 12 to maintain continuity with yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs outlook. This is still
supported by today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs GEFS reforecast tool, which =
depicts at least a 20%
chance
wind speeds exceed the 85th climatological percentile over some of these
areas.
However, if current trends toward a weaker trough continue, the hazard may =
be
removed in subsequent outlooks.



Anomalous troughing is forecast across the Bering Sea early in week-2 favor=
ing
increased chances of unsettled weather across parts of Alaska. The 0z GEFS,
ECMWF, and Canadian ensembles indicate surface low pressure near the west
coast
of Mainland Alaska during this timeframe, which would favor a tight pressur=
e
gradient across the Aleutians and southwestern Mainland as a result of surf=
ace
high pressure forecast over the East Pacific. Both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance wind speeds exceed the 85th
climatological percentile across the Aleutians, Alaska Peninsula, and the
extreme southwestern Mainland, corresponding with a slight risk for high wi=
nds
posted from Sep 10 to Sep 12. Recent runs of the deterministic GFS indicate
the
potential for wind gusts over 40-mph, justifying the slight risk. While
increased precipitation is also possible across western and southern portio=
ns
of the state, there are no indications in the tools that hazards criteria w=
ill
be reached, precluding a related precipitation hazard for Alaska.

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track with low potential for
widespread fire weather concerns. Patchy elevated conditions may
evolve across southern NV over dry fuels, but these conditions will
likely remain localized and transient.

The upper-level trough will shift into the northern Plains on
Friday. Flow aloft will remain weak across areas with the driest
fuels. The surface pressure pattern will also be rather diffuse
across the West and into the Plains. Fire weather concerns are
expected to be minimal across the CONUS.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
238 PM EDT Thu Sep 2 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Sep 5 2021 - 12Z Thu Sep 9 2021

18Z Update:  The 12Z deterministic guidance is in excellent
agreement overall at the beginning of the forecast period Sunday.
By later in the forecast period, the CMC becomes slower with the
trough progression across the Great Lakes and slightly farther
west with the upper ridge axis across the Intermountain West, and
greater overall model spread with the next shortwave trough
approaching the Pacific Northwest.

In terms of rainfall prospects, a much quieter forecast period is
expected compared to recent weeks.  The possible exception to this
may be along the western Gulf coast where moisture from a
potential tropical wave/disturbance may advect deeper moisture
northward by the middle of next week.  Scattered showers and
storms are also expected from the Great Lakes to the Northeast,
but these are expected to be progressive.  The WPC
fronts/pressures forecast was primarily based on a
multi-deterministic model blend through next Tuesday, followed by
some increase in the GEFS and ECENS by Wednesday and Thursday.
The previous discussion follows below. /Hamrick

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue to show fairly good agreement on the
larger scale upper flow pattern through much of the medium range
period for much of the nation, but still struggle with smaller
scale individual features, especially next week. The WPC medium
range product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend
of reasonably well clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS and 12
UTC ECMWF/UKMET along with the compatible 01 UTC National Blend of
Models for days 3-5 (Sunday-Tuesday). This blend has broad
ensemble support despite the lingering small scale variances,
bolstering forecast confidence. Forecast spread grows enough into
days 6/7 (Wednesday/next Thursday) to favor a blend of the
compatible GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and best clustered model
guidance from the 12 UTC ECMWF. This composite builds overall
east-central U.S. upper trough amplitude on the higher side of the
full forecast envelope (GFS less amplified). This seems more
reasonable considering expected upstream ridge building and
growing warmth over much of the the West ahead of Pacific upper
trough translation. This maintains reasonably good WPC continuity
in line with newer 00 UTC guidance. WPC progs also take into
account latest NHC guidance that limits Bay of Campeche to western
Gulf of Mexico tropical system development next week due to
unfavorable upper level winds. Recent Canadian runs have been
especially zealous.

...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A series of energetic northern stream upper troughs will force
several wavy frontal systems into the Northwest and out though the
north-central U.S. and increasingly southward into next week
across the central and eastern U.S. with main upper trough
reinforcement/amplification. Conditions seem best for some locally
enhanced lead system convection from the Great Lakes to the
Mid-South and central Plains Saturday, with more modest potential
downstream more into the southern and eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday. The next trough to move into the north-central U.S. should
bring another chance for organized rainfall across parts of the
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes by next Monday into Tuesday, with
scattered trailing frontal activity then again settling down over
the southern and eastern states through next midweek in response
to planned upper trough amplification.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu September 02 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 08 - 12 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough to the we=
st
of Alaska over the Bering Sea. A short wave trough over the eastern North
Pacific is predicted to progress eastward to the Pacific Coast of the CONUS=
. A
ridge and above normal mid-level heights are predicted over the western CON=
US,
while an amplified trough and below normal heights are predicted over the
eastern CONUS.

Near to above normal temperature probabilities are elevated across Alaska i=
n
association with above normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal temperatures ar=
e
favored for the western and central CONUS due to predicted 500-hPa ridging =
and
above normal heights. A predicted trough over the eastern CONUS favors
enhanced
probabilities of near to below normal temperatures over the eastern Central
Mississippi Valley and parts of the Northeast, while above normal temperatu=
res
are favored over the southern Atlantic Coast region and parts of the Northe=
ast
ahead of the troughing.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over much of western
Mainland Alaska due to forecast westerly surface flow and storm system
development. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over eastern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, in association with above normal
mid-level heights. The short wave trough forecast over the Pacific Coast
supports an increasing likelihood of near to above normal precipitation for
most of the western CONUS. Near to above normal precipitation is likely for
parts of the Northeast ahead of a predicted trough with an active storm tra=
ck.
Below normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the rest of the
CONUS, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool, except for extr=
eme
southern Texas, where above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced
related to potential tropical storm activity.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed

Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by some
differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 10 - 16 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is similar to the
6-10 day period, but generally forecast to shift eastward and deamplify. Th=
e
troughing shifts eastward over the Pacific Coast and a ridge is forecast ov=
er
the central CONUS with a trough moving into the Northeast.

500-hPa troughing forecast to the west of Alaska favors near to above norma=
l
temperatures for the state except for the Alaska Panhandle, where below nor=
mal
temperatures are forecast, associated with the eastward progression of
troughing and potential cloudiness. Near to above normal temperatures are a=
lso
favored across the CONUS, consistent with the consolidation tool.

Troughing over the Bering Sea and Mainland Alaska increases the chances of
above-normal precipitation over southern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians.=
 A
mean frontal boundary and potential tropical moisture lead to enhanced
probabilities of above-normal precipitation across western areas of the
Southwest northward into parts of the central Rockies. Above-normal
precipitation is likely over parts of the Great Lakes, consistent with the
auto
blend forecast tool. Above-normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced
over
extreme southern Texas related to tropical storm activity. Below normal
precipitation is likely across the Great Plains extending across the Lower
Mississippi Valley to the eastern CONUS, consistent with the consolidation
tool.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

...Cooler and drier weather to support ongoing cleanup efforts in
the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic the next couple days...

...Rounds of showers and thunderstorms to drench parts of the
Nation's Heartland, severe weather and flash flooding is possible
in the Central Plains...

...Spotty showers and thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast and in
the southern High Plains; poor air quality due to ongoing bouts of
wildfire smoke to continue; hot and steamy in the South Central
U.S...

In wake of the devastating severe weather and historic flooding in
parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast left behind by Ida, these
regions can expect seasonally cooler temperatures and dry
conditions heading into Labor Day weekend as a dome of high
pressure builds in. This is welcomed news for ongoing cleanup
efforts while no rainfall should help areas of ongoing river and
stream flooding to subside sooner rather than later.

The regions forecast to receive the most active weather to close
out the work-week and kickoff Labor Day Weekend are the central
High Plains and Midwest. A pair of upper level disturbances
inducing waves of low pressure are set to initiate scattered
showers and thunderstorms. There are Slight Risks for Excessive
Rainfall and severe weather in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, and
western Missouri this afternoon and into the overnight hours. In
addition, heavy downpours in West Texas and southeast New Mexico
are anticipated as lingering moisture from former Tropical Cyclone
Nora supports an environment that could lead to areas of flash
flooding. Flash Flood Watches are in effect through this evening.
By Friday, a slowly moving cold front will generate another round
of thunderstorms over the Central Plains that could become severe
and/or produce excessive rainfall rates. A second wave of low
pressure in eastern Wyoming approaching the Black Hills of South
Dakota on Friday will spark additional scattered showers and
thunderstorms. Marginal Risks for flash flooding and severe
weather are in place for these areas on Friday. Saturday features
yet another day of stormy weather from the Southwest to the
mid-Mississippi Valley with thunderstorms potentially becoming
severe and/or leading to localized areas of flash flooding due to
a front taking its time tracking through the nation's mid-section.

Elsewhere, a frontal boundary is expected to stall near the
central Gulf Coast and across northern Florida on Friday and stick
around into Saturday. Look for this front to trigger spotty
showers and thunderstorms that may produce heavy downpours within
the strongest cells. The West Coast figures to remain mostly dry
while Air Quality Alerts persist across parts of the Pacific
Northwest and California and parts of Wyoming and Montana due to
wildfire smoke. There are also Heat Advisories out for parts of
the Southern Plains and the Lower Mississippi Valley where heat
indices range between 105-110 degrees this afternoon. Expect
daytime highs to soar into the mid-upper 90s both Friday and
Saturday in these regions. The Midwest and northern High Plains
will join the Northeast in experiencing a rather cool start to
September. The West Coast begins a gradual warming trend today in
the Pacific Northwest which culminates in a rather hot second half
of the holiday weekend throughout the western third of the country.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
440 PM EDT Thu Sep 02 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Sep 05 2021 - 12Z Thu Sep 09 2021

18Z Update:  The 12Z deterministic guidance is in excellent
agreement overall at the beginning of the forecast period Sunday.
By later in the forecast period, the CMC becomes slower with the
trough progression across the Great Lakes and slightly farther
west with the upper ridge axis across the Intermountain West, and
greater overall model spread with the next shortwave trough
approaching the Pacific Northwest.

In terms of rainfall prospects, a much quieter forecast period is
expected compared to recent weeks.  The possible exception to this
may be along the western Gulf coast where moisture from a
potential tropical wave/disturbance may advect deeper moisture
northward by the middle of next week.  Scattered showers and
storms are also expected from the Great Lakes to the Northeast,
but these are expected to be progressive.  The WPC
fronts/pressures forecast was primarily based on a
multi-deterministic model blend through next Tuesday, followed by
some increase in the GEFS and ECENS by Wednesday and Thursday.
The previous discussion follows below. /Hamrick

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue to show fairly good agreement on the
larger scale upper flow pattern through much of the medium range
period for much of the nation, but still struggle with smaller
scale individual features, especially next week. The WPC medium
range product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend
of reasonably well clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS and 12
UTC ECMWF/UKMET along with the compatible 01 UTC National Blend of
Models for days 3-5 (Sunday-Tuesday). This blend has broad
ensemble support despite the lingering small scale variances,
bolstering forecast confidence. Forecast spread grows enough into
days 6/7 (Wednesday/next Thursday) to favor a blend of the
compatible GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and best clustered model
guidance from the 12 UTC ECMWF. This composite builds overall
east-central U.S. upper trough amplitude on the higher side of the
full forecast envelope (GFS less amplified). This seems more
reasonable considering expected upstream ridge building and
growing warmth over much of the the West ahead of Pacific upper
trough translation. This maintains reasonably good WPC continuity
in line with newer 00 UTC guidance. WPC progs also take into
account latest NHC guidance that limits Bay of Campeche to western
Gulf of Mexico tropical system development next week due to
unfavorable upper level winds. Recent Canadian runs have been
especially zealous.

...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A series of energetic northern stream upper troughs will force
several wavy frontal systems into the Northwest and out though the
north-central U.S. and increasingly southward into next week
across the central and eastern U.S. with main upper trough
reinforcement/amplification. Conditions seem best for some locally
enhanced lead system convection from the Great Lakes to the
Mid-South and central Plains Saturday, with more modest potential
downstream more into the southern and eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday. The next trough to move into the north-central U.S. should
bring another chance for organized rainfall across parts of the
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes by next Monday into Tuesday, with
scattered trailing frontal activity then again settling down over
the southern and eastern states through next midweek in response
to planned upper trough amplification.

...Overview...

Upper ridging will drift out of the Great Basin early next week
toward the southern Plains as troughing moves into the Pacific
Northwest. Troughing in the Northeast on Monday will lift out by
Tuesday but will be quickly replaced by incoming troughing from
southern Canada. That trough should exit the East Coast around the
end of next week, likely keeping Hurricane Larry over the
Atlantic. The pattern is largely quiet and drier than average
after a very active and wet several weeks.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the models and ensembles showed
relatively good clustering through the period, with expected
differences that grew with time. Recent GFS runs were a bit on the
southern side of the spread with low pressure through the Great
Lakes Tue-Wed, but not implausible. Larger differences over the
Pacific translated into the West (particularly the Northwest) due
to system disagreement on existence/timing/track. Ensemble
consensus seemed to favor an area of low pressure approaching the
coast by the end of next week (with its cold front perhaps
onshore) in between the quicker 18Z GFS and 12Z Canadian and the
slower 12Z ECMWF (12Z GFS was also as slow as the ECMWF).
Multi-day ensemble trend has been toward a bit slower and more
amplified trough-ridge-trough pattern over the CONUS, so weighed
the slower ECMWF a bit more than the GFS but with a majority
ensemble mean blend.

Over the Southwest, the movement of the upper high southeastward
may allow for an increase in moisture into the lower CO River
basin late next week. GFS/GEFS were a bit wetter than the
ECMWF/Canadian and their ensembles. Favored a slightly drier
scenario for now. In the Gulf, any limited tropical activity is
forecast to be weak/disorganized, but may spread moisture/rainfall
into the Gulf Coast. Continued to favor the weaker solutions vs
the more robust models.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes Monday in
advance of a system out of the northern Plains, which may promote
some heavier rainfall on Tuesday across Michigan. Rainfall along
the cold front may be lighter and continued southward into the
Southeast in a warmer and more humid environment. Temperatures
will be near to above normal over most areas, especially the West
to the Northern Rockies ahead of the incoming Pacific trough.
Temperatures 5-15 degrees above normal are possible as the area of
warmth moves into the southern Plains late next week. Temperatures
in the Northeast will be near to a bit below normal thanks to
generally northwest flow.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 AM CDT Fri Sep 03 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure is expected to build into the Northwest, as a
mid-level trough ejects into the northern Plains from the northern
Rockies today. With the passing of the upper trough, modest
boundary-layer mixing will promote locally Elevated surface winds/RH
across portions of the northern Rockies, especially in
terrain-favoring areas such as the Snake River Plain in Idaho and
Great Divide Basin in Wyoming. Deep-layer ascent associated with the
upper trough will promote fast-moving, relatively high-based
thunderstorm development across portions of central Wyoming during
afternoon, where a dry strike or two will also be possible. However,
the overall coverage of favorable surface winds/RH or dry lightning
is expected to be too sparse to support fire weather highlights at
this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0127 AM CDT Fri Sep 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure will continue to intensify as upper ridging
builds across the western CONUS through the period
tomorrow/Saturday. However, 30-50 kts of mid-level flow is expected
to pivot around the periphery of the upper ridge. With adequate
boundary-layer mixing beneath this stronger flow aloft, locally
Elevated surface winds/RH are expected to overlap in
terrain-favoring areas from the higher terrain of the Cascades to
the Yellowstone River Valley in Montana/Great Divide Basin in
Wyoming. The patchy, brief nature of the Elevated conditions
precludes any highlights this outlook.

...Much below normal temperatures continuing through Saturday from
the Plains to the East...

...Active weather expected across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies through the period...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Following a very active short range period, the medium range
should finally begin transitioning towards a less amplified/less
active weather regime into early next week. The exception to this
will be in the Pacific Northwest where multiple shortwaves will
keep the weather active with several opportunities for heavy
mountain snow and lower elevation rain.

Synoptically, the latest guidance continues to show very good
agreement through the period, with mainly typical timing and
detail differences needing to still be resolved. In the East, the
CMC/UKMET are faster with the surface low exiting the Northeast on
Friday, while the GFS/ECMWF show better agreement with the
ensemble means for low position. The next system ejecting out of
the Rockies on Sunday also has some minor timing differences, but
a blend of the CMC/ECMWF seems to agree best with the ensemble
means. Given this assessment, the WPC blend relied heavily on the
ECMWF/GFS for days 3-4, replacing the GFS with the CMC thereafter
while also increasing contributions from the ensemble means. This
maintains good continuity with the previous forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Lingering heavy snow across interior and northern New England will
continue through Friday associated with the storm system exiting
the East Coast. The heaviest rainfall will have pushed off the
coast by the start of the period, although some lingering showers
are possible across the Outer Banks and Florida along the trailing
cold front. The West should stay active through the entire period
as multiple fronts pass through the region. These will each bring
the potential for additional focused rainfall along coastal
portions of Washington/Oregon with heavy mountain snow in the
Cascades, Northern Rockies, and Northern California. Precipitation
should begin to break out across the Plains this weekend as a
frontal system moves through, with wintry precipitation possible
on the northern side of the system across the Upper Great Lakes
region.

Temperatures will remain much below normal Friday into Saturday
from much of the Southern Plains to the East, with departures from
normal as much as 20-30F for some areas. By Sunday, temperatures
should finally begin to moderate back close to normal into early
next week. Meanwhile, expect a warming trend across especially the
Southwest and Northern Plains, with above normal temperatures
maybe creeping into parts of the southern/central Plains as well
by next Tuesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 AM CST Tue Feb 16 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
With continued, but weakening, high pressure across areas east of
the Divide, cold temperatures and precipitation are expected to keep
fire weather concerns very low today. Broad upper-level troughing
will continue over most of the U.S. with shortwave trough moving
through this parent trough and into the southern Plains. This
shortwave will keep strong mid-level flow across the Colorado River
Valley. RH in southern Nevada into southwestern Arizona could fall
as low as 15-20%. Localized elevated conditions are possible as
surface winds increase to 15-25 mph in conjunction with a deepening
surface trough in the High Plains to the east. However, sparse,
marginal fuels preclude highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1259 AM CST Tue Feb 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Similar surface and upper-level patterns to Tuesday are again
expected on Wednesday. Cold temperatures and precipitation will
greatly limit fire weather concerns across the U.S. As with Tuesday,
dry and windy conditions are again possible in portions of the lower
Colorado River Valley into southern Arizona. With sparse and
marginal fuels, no highlights will be added.

...Lingering areas of snow and freezing rain to cause travel
concerns from the eastern Great Lakes to New England this
morning...

...Frigid Arctic air and dangerously cold wind chills to persist
in the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley through midweek...

...A new winter storm emerging in the Southern Plains on Tuesday
heads for the Mid-South on Wednesday...

The major winter storm responsible for producing significant snow
and ice accumulations in parts of the central and eastern U.S. is
making a beeline for eastern Canada, but not before it causes
heavy snow and freezing rain in parts of the eastern Great Lakes
and New England. A couple more inches of snow are possible in the
eastern Great Lakes while ice amounts up to a quarter inch are
possible. Farther south, the storm's trailing cold front is
forecast to trigger showers and thunderstorms over South Florida
where Marginal Risks for both severe weather and flash flooding
are in place. In the storm's wake, the same area of Arctic high
pressure that has enveloped the Heartland in record cold
temperatures will spill over towards the East Coast Tuesday
evening and into Wednesday. Temperatures will dip to below normal
levels on Wednesday but not to the bitterly cold levels that
transpired in the Plains and Mississippi Valley in recent days.

Speaking of bitter cold, the Arctic high pressure over the
Heartland will ensure one more day or frigid temperatures east of
the Rockies and west of the Appalachians. Numerous record cold
maximum and minimum temperatures are expected today with the bulk
of them occurring in the South Central U.S. where daily anomalies
range between 35 to 45 degrees below normal. Wind Chill Warnings
and Advisories span a massive area from the US/Canada border to
the US/Mexico border. Where Wind Chill Warnings are in place, wind
chills may plummet to a dangerous 50 degrees below zero at times.
The Arctic air-mass begins to modify on Wednesday with fewer
record cold temperatures expected but still remain well below
normal. Wednesday's low temps are likely to drop below zero from
the Midwest to the Lower Great Lakes.

An upper level trough tracking through the Four Corners region
today is responsible for heavy mountain snow across the
Intermountain West. As the trough ejects into the Southern Plains
this afternoon, periods of snow will breakout across parts of the
Southern Plains with Oklahoma the epicenter for the heaviest
accumulations through Tuesday night. Snowfall accumulations over 6
inches are expected there and extending into Arkansas as the upper
trough marches east on Wednesday. The same upper trough will help
to create a new wave of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico that
becomes the next winter storm to track across the Lower
Mississippi Valley and into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys.
Snowfall accumulations on Wednesday appear to be on the order of 3
to 6 inches in these areas, while significant ice accumulations
take shapes from east Texas to the Mississippi Delta region. Ice
accumulations ranging between a quarter to a half inch are
possible which would make for hazardous travel conditions, induce
more power outages, and cause more tree damage in these areas.
Eventually, this storm system will head for the Mid-Atlantic by
Thursday where accumulating snow and ice will likely lead to more
treacherous travel conditions.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1022 AM CDT Wed Mar 23 2022

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO INTO
WESTERN TEXAS...

While early morning observations show a relatively weak surface wind
field across New Mexico and west Texas, low-level wind gusts should
gradually increase to Elevated and near Critical levels for a few
hours this afternoon. Dry surface conditions and the increasing
winds may support a few hours of fire weather concerns given very
dry fuels. The Critical area was trimmed slightly to better match
ongoing obs and the latest hi-res data. The Elevated area across the
northern Plains was also expanded westward into eastern Wyoming to
cover drier and windy conditions. Elsewhere the forecast remains
largely unchanged. Please see the prior discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 03/23/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0134 AM CDT Wed Mar 23 2022/

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level trough will continue to gradually drift eastward
across the Central U.S., as a surface low tracks northeast across
the Great Lakes today. Gradient surface winds, along with
northwesterly mid-level winds on the back side of the upper trough,
will coincide to support a deep-layer northwesterly flow regime
across the Plains states. Critical/Elevated highlights have been
introduced across eastern New Mexico into western and central Texas,
where 15-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds and 15 percent
RH will overspread very dry fuels to support wildfire-spread
potential. Farther north across the central High Plains, 25 mph
northerly surface winds and 25 percent RH will coincide for at least
a few hours during the afternoon. Elevated highlights have been
introduced given the presence of modestly dry fuels.

SYNOPSIS: Early in the period, forecast mid-level low pressure favors
unseasonably cold, and possibly much below normal temperatures mainly for
portions of the eastern Great Plains, Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valle=
ys,
Great Lakes and the Appalachians. A surface low and accompanying frontal
boundary tracking across the eastern U.S. favors possible heavy precipitati=
on
and enhanced wind speeds over the southeastern lower 48. Over Alaska,
prevailing onshore flow is expected to promote above-normal temperatures an=
d
precipitation mainly throughout the southern Mainland.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the eastern
Great
Plains, Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Great Lakes, and the
Appalachians, Thu-Fri, Mar 31-Apr 1.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Southeast, Tennes=
see
Valley, Appalachians and the Mid-Atlantic, Thu, Mar 31.

Slight risk of high winds across the southeastern CONUS, Thu-Fri, Mar 31-Ap=

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 31 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 06: Analysis of the mean week-2 500=
-
hPa
height field forecasts from the dynamical models reveals more of a negative
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern predominantly taking shape over
eastern North America. While model guidance has been fairly consistent in
favoring anomalous ridging centered over the Davis Strait near Greenland si=
nce
earlier this week, this morning's ensemble runs favor more amplified trough=
ing
over the eastern CONUS with a larger coverage of negative mid-level height
departures extending from the Great Plains eastward to the northern Atlanti=
c.
As a result of this mid-level height trend, there are increased chances for
unseasonably cold temperatures over the northeastern CONUS, as a negative N=
AO
also historically favors above-normal precipitation over the southeastern U=
.S.
entering the boreal spring. For Alaska, anomalous troughing remains favored
over the Bering Strait and the Aleutians as the resultant onshore flow is
expected to bring above-normal temperatures and precipitation for the south=
ern
Mainland.



Early in week-2, there is good agreement between the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF
ensembles featuring amplified troughing over the CONUS east of the Rockies
with
a positively tilted, deep trough axis extending from the Great Lakes into t=
he
Southern Plains. At the surface, a frontal system tied to mean surface low
tracking across the eastern CONUS on day 8 (Mar 31) is favored to bring
anomalously cold air into portions of the Great Plains and Mississippi Vall=
ey
that shifts eastward by day 9. There is good agreement in the reforecast to=
ols
depicting at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 1=
5th
percentile and below freezing during the first few days of the period to
support a slight risk of much below normal temperatures for Mar 31 to Apr 1=
.
Some of the anomalously cold air along the southern periphery of the
highlighted region may negatively impact susceptible spring vegetation that=
 is
emerging over parts of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, and the
Southern Appalachians.

Farther west, the development of anomalous troughing over the northwestern
CONUS continues to be favored in the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles early in the
period. However, the strength of this mid-level feature is not as pronounce=
d
in
the guidance compared to yesterday, leading to lower chances for anomalousl=
y
cold temperatures over the West Coast. This is reflected in the reforecast
tools which no longer support minimum temperatures reaching hazard criteria=
,
and the corresponding temperature hazard is removed over the Central
California
Valley relative to yesterday's outlook.



Tied to the aforementioned surface low tracking across the eastern CONUS,
there
is good model support for the enhancement of precipitation along the fronta=
l
boundary by the outset of the period. The highest daily ensemble mean
precipitation amounts are depicted over the Southeast where southerly retur=
n
flow remains favored to provide ample available moisture. Relative to previ=
ous
guidance, there is better agreement in the reforecast tools indicating at
least
a 20% chance of precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile a=
nd
1
inch over the Southeast, Southern Appalachians and the Mid-Atlantic and a
slight risk of heavy precipitation is continued over the region for Mar 31.=
 A
slight risk of high winds also remains posted over the southeastern CONUS
given
continued support from the reforecast tools and periods of strong pressure
gradients depicted in the deterministic and ensemble mean solutions. With
anomalously cold temperatures favored to be in place, increased snowfall is
possible on the backside of the low. However, model solutions remain variab=
le
on the exact location of the predicted storm track, and there is insufficie=
nt
support that accumulations will exceed regional hazard thresholds, precludi=
ng
a
corresponding snow hazard.



Later in the period, there is growing support in the ensembles for addition=
al
surface low formation in the lee of the Rockies tied to anomalous troughing
propagating eastward from the western CONUS. The 0z ECMWF is the most robus=
t
with this development, resulting in another round of potentially heavy
precipitation over the southeastern CONUS during the middle of the period.
Although this is supported in the ECMWF reforecast tool, the uncalibrated G=
EFS
and GEFS reforecast tool is less onboard with this potential, and no
additional
precipitation related hazards are issued at this time. This situation will
continue to be monitored and addressed in the upcoming outlooks later this
week.



Over Alaska, ensembles continue to favor onshore flow during week-2, which =
is
expected to lead to above-normal temperatures and precipitation. Both the G=
EFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day
precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile along the souther=
n
Mainland, however amounts are not expected to reach hazard criteria. While
there are increasing chances that maximum daytime temperatures will rise ab=
ove
freezing in the lower elevations of the southern Mainland during week-2, it=
 is
worth noting that the persistence of anomalously warmer and wetter conditio=
ns
over the state bears close monitoring later in April as this may accelerate
river ice breakup which raises concern for ice jams and potential river
flooding.

...Overview...

Deep troughing over the eastern U.S. this weekend will favor
seasonably cool temperatures from the Great Lakes to the
Northeast. A few embedded shortwaves will reinforce the cool
regime and bring blustery conditions and mostly light
precipitation. Meanwhile, a ridge anchored over the West will
break down as a large scale trough approaches and brings unsettled
and active weather to the Northwest and eventually much of the
West. As that aforementioned ridge moves into the Plains,
temperatures soar to much above normal values which could bring
record highs to the Intermountain West to the High Plains.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The synoptic setup at the start of the period /Saturday/ shows
good model agreement and predictability with a western U.S. ridge
and eastern trough. A few embedded shortwaves will move through
the cyclonic flow this weekend over the Great Lakes with one
particular Clipper helping to induce cyclogenesis off the New
England coast Sunday into Monday. Here, model differences are
fairly minimal now and a near equal blend of the latest available
deterministic guidance was used.

The larger model differences are to the west tied to the
progression and amplitude of an eastern Pacific trough,
particularly the southern piece of that energy. As the positively
tilted trough axis reaches the western U.S., some guidance favors
closing off a upper low well offshore southern California (i.e.
00Z ECMWF) while others are closer to the coast/inland or more
progressive (GFS/CMC). The trend has been for a slower solution
that may close off, but perhaps not to the degree the 00Z ECMWF
(and its previous runs) suggest. It largely depends on how much
phasing or lack of with the northern stream - the ECMWF favors
more separation and allows the northern stream energy to race out
faster compared to the more phased GFS solution, especially by day
6/7. Either way, the models do show that the troughing reaches the
Rockies into the Plains by the end of the period where a strong
surface low may materialize. It's a lower confidence forecast,
especially from day 5 onward as the energy reaches the
Intermountain West. For now, the WPC blend for day 5-7 favored a
compromise of the ECMWF/GFS while including higher weights of the
ECENS/GEFS means to maintain continuity some while addressing the
uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The shortwave energy progression and strong cyclonic flow over the
Great Lakes will produce mainly light precipitation across the
Great Lakes into portions of the central to northern Appalachians
and Northeast this weekend. The exception looks to be for the
favored high terrain and upslope flow areas of West Virginia where
late season snowfall accumulations could total several inches per
the latest Winter Weather Outlook probabilities. As the next
system moves into the western U.S. this weekend into early next
week, unsettled and active weather is expected on Day 4 /Sunday/
for the Northwest then Day 5-6 /Monday-Tuesday/ for much of
California, bringing beneficial and welcome rains to the valleys
with the higher elevation areas of the Sierra likely to see
several inches or more of snow. As that system moves into the
Plains and Midwest, enough cold air on the northern fringe of the
precipitation shield could allow for a wintry mix but details are
lacking that far out in time.

Unseasonably warm temperatures will build and expand underneath
upper ridging from the western U.S. into the Plains. Highs that
are 10-25F above normal will be common over the weekend from the
West Coast across the Great Basin and Southwest to the Plains, and
several daily record high temperatures could be set or tied. As
the ridge axis shifts eastward, warm anomalies of 15-25F are
likely for the High Plains Monday while the West Coast moderates
closer to normal. Warmer than normal temperatures remain forecast
in the south-central U.S. on Tuesday but may moderate Wednesday
while pushing into the Southeast. Meanwhile the East should see
near to below average temperatures given mean upper troughing,
with coolest temperatures of 10-20F below normal in the Great
Lakes and central Appalachians for the weekend and spreading into
the Northeast early next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed March 23 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 29 - APR 02, 2022

The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensembles are all in good agreement regard=
ing
a transient and weakly amplified 500-hPa geopotential height pattern across
North America. There is a strong blocking signal across the western Atlanti=
c,
with anomalous ridging near Greenland, and troughing to the south across th=
e
northeastern CONUS and northwest Atlantic. This setup is indicative of a
negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), although both the G=
EFS
and ECMWF ensembles begin to weaken this signal toward the end of the perio=
d.
Across the remainder of the CONUS, oscillating troughs and ridges are
forecast,
with troughing becoming more dominant across the west-central CONUS by the
middle of the period. For the period as a whole, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDs manual blend
depicts
near normal 500-hPa heights across the western CONUS, and negative height
anomalies across much of the eastern CONUS, with the largest negative
departures over the Northeast. Anomalous ridging forecast to develop south =
of
Alaska favors above normal mid-level heights over much of the state, with
troughing upstream over the Bering Sea favoring below normal heights across
the
far western Aleutians.

Increased probabilities of below normal temperatures are favored for portio=
ns
of the Middle and Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,
Northeast, and northern mid-Atlantic, consistent with the forecast negative
phase of the NAO and supported by teleconnection analysis with the negative
height anomaly center near Nova Scotia. Daily temperature departures of -10=
 to
-15 deg F are possible, especially early in the period, with some areas lik=
ely
experiencing a hard freeze during the final days of March. Probabilities fo=
r
near to above normal temperatures are increased across much of the western =
and
south-central CONUS and Southeast due to a more zonal flow pattern and
relatively higher mid-level heights, although a trend toward cooler
temperatures is possible toward the end of the period as additional troughi=
ng
begins to move across the CONUS. Near to above normal temperatures are favo=
red
across much of Alaska due to forecast ridging to the south of the state. Th=
e
exception is over parts of the northern Mainland, where increased
probabilities
for below normal temperatures are favored, supported by the uncalibrated EC=
MWF
and GEFS ensembles.

Enhanced probabilities for near to above normal precipitation are indicated
for
much of the CONUS east of the Rockies during the period. There is now good
agreement among the ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian models regarding cyclogenesis
across the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley, potentially increasing
precipitation chances across parts of the east-central CONUS early in the
period. A second system may again enhance precipitation chances by day-10 o=
ver
the same area. Below normal precipitation probabilities remain increased
across
southern Texas, consistent with the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools, and al=
so
for parts of the West, as troughing is forecast to move further inland over
the
CONUS, with the mid-level flow turning more northwesterly along the West
Coast.
Southwesterly flow across Alaska ahead of troughing over the Bering Sea fav=
ors
a tilt toward increased near to above normal precipitation probabilities
across
nearly all of Alaska. Below normal precipitation probabilities are increase=
d
across the extreme northern Mainland coast, supported by the consolidated
forecast tool and weaker mid-level flow.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by increasing uncertainty associated with a less
amplified pattern.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 31 - APR 06, 2022

A transient 500-hPa geopotential height pattern is favored across North
America
during week-2, reducing the overall confidence in the forecast. There is st=
ill
a negative NAO signal across eastern North America, although it is weaker t=
han
in the 6-10 day period, and heights are relatively higher in the East.
Enhanced
troughing is favored to propagate across the CONUS, with a mean zonal flow
pattern favored for the period as a whole. Near to slightly below normal
heights are indicated in the manual blend over much of the western and cent=
ral
CONUS and the Southeast, with larger below normal height anomalies over the
Northeast. A more amplified 500-hPa pattern is forecast to persist across t=
he
North Pacific, with troughing over the Bering Sea and weak ridging over the
Northeast Pacific. This supports a continuation of near to above normal
mid-level heights across much of Alaska, with the exception of the far west=
ern
coast of the Mainland and the Aleutians where below normal heights are
favored.

Given the predicted troughing forecast to propagate across the CONUS, along
with a continuing negative NAO signature, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecas=
t
tools have trended toward colder solutions across the central and eastern
CONUS
compared to yesterday, and this is reflected in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDs forecast, which
shows
increased probabilities of near to below normal temperatures across most of
the
CONUS. Both reforecast tools continue to depict increased probabilities for
above normal temperatures across the West, and there is some support from t=
he
analog guidance as well given that the anomalous troughing is predicted to
propagate further inland. However, due to the colder uncalibrated guidance =
and
near to slightly below normal heights forecast, a tilt towards increased be=
low
normal temperature probabilities continues to be indicated over the western
CONUS. Above normal temperature probabilities are increased across parts of
the
Southeast, with the highest probabilities across southern Florida, supporte=
d
by
the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools. Elevated probabilities for near to abo=
ve
normal temperatures remain favored for most of Alaska, due to persistent
southwesterly mid-level flow ahead of troughing forecast over the Bering Se=
a.

Increased chances for near to above normal precipitation are favored for mo=
st
areas from the Rockies to the East Coast due to troughing forecast to
propagate
across the CONUS, along with increased potential for surface low developmen=
t
and frontal activity. The ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensembles indicate the
potential for a storm system to bring enhanced precipitation chances to the
eastern U.S. early in week-2, with perhaps an additional system later in th=
e
period. Both reforecast tools support enhanced below normal precipitation
probabilities across parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley, Southern Plains=
,
and Desert Southwest, farther displaced from the mean mid-level moisture fl=
ow
and storm track. Increased chances for below normal precipitation are
indicated
for parts of the West as troughing shifts further inland across the CONUS
allowing a more northwesterly flow along the West Coast. Continued enhanced
southwesterly flow ahead of troughing over the Bering Sea favors increased
chances for near to above normal precipitation across Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
improved model agreement regarding shortwave features compared to yesterday=
,
offset by a weakly amplified, transient mid-level pattern and some differen=
ces
in the calibrated and uncalibrated temperature tools.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

0211 PM CDT Wed Mar 23 2022

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS...

The overall forecast remains valid with minor changes. Across deep
south Texas, low-level flow maybe somewhat slow to ramp up through
the afternoon. But, at least a few hours of Elevated to near
Critical wind gusts will be possible along with widespread RH below
15%. Given the volatile nature of fuels, elevated to critical fire
weather concerns will remain possible mainly across the western half
of deep south Texas. See the prior discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 03/23/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CDT Wed Mar 23 2022/

...Synopsis...
Strong, dry northwesterly surface winds will persist across the
central and southern Plains as a relatively dry boundary layer is
overspread by a mid-level wind maximum from the departing upper
trough tomorrow/Thursday. By afternoon peak heating, boundary-layer
mixing will support 15-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds
amid 15-20 percent RH for much of the southern High Plains into
southern Texas, with Elevated highlights introduced. Critical
highlights were also added to Deep-South Texas, where 20 mph
sustained northwesterly winds will overlap 15 percent RH atop very
dry fuels (i.e. 98th percentile forecast ERCs). While the surface
winds may struggle to reach Critical criteria, the very dry
air/fuels should compensate for the marginal surface wind field to
support significant wildfire-spread potential.

320 PM EDT Wed Mar 23 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Mar 26 2022 - 12Z Wed Mar 30 2022

...Overview...

Deep troughing over the eastern U.S. this weekend will favor
seasonably cool temperatures from the Great Lakes to the
Northeast. A few embedded shortwaves will reinforce the cool
regime and bring blustery conditions and mostly light
precipitation. Meanwhile, a ridge anchored over the West will
break down as a large scale trough approaches and brings unsettled
and active weather to the Northwest and eventually much of the
West. As that aforementioned ridge moves into the Plains,
temperatures soar to much above normal values which could bring
record highs to the Intermountain West to the High Plains.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The synoptic setup at the start of the period /Saturday/ shows
good model agreement and predictability with a western U.S. ridge
and eastern trough. A few embedded shortwaves will move through
the cyclonic flow this weekend over the Great Lakes with one
particular Clipper helping to induce cyclogenesis off the New
England coast Sunday into Monday. Here, model differences are
fairly minimal now and a near equal blend of the latest available
deterministic guidance was used.

The larger model differences are to the west tied to the
progression and amplitude of an eastern Pacific trough,
particularly the southern piece of that energy. As the positively
tilted trough axis reaches the western U.S., some guidance favors
closing off a upper low well offshore southern California (i.e.
00Z ECMWF) while others are closer to the coast/inland or more
progressive (GFS/CMC). The trend has been for a slower solution
that may close off, but perhaps not to the degree the 00Z ECMWF
(and its previous runs) suggest. It largely depends on how much
phasing or lack of with the northern stream - the ECMWF favors
more separation and allows the northern stream energy to race out
faster compared to the more phased GFS solution, especially by day
6/7. Either way, the models do show that the troughing reaches the
Rockies into the Plains by the end of the period where a strong
surface low may materialize. It's a lower confidence forecast,
especially from day 5 onward as the energy reaches the
Intermountain West. For now, the WPC blend for day 5-7 favored a
compromise of the ECMWF/GFS while including higher weights of the
ECENS/GEFS means to maintain continuity some while addressing the
uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The shortwave energy progression and strong cyclonic flow over the
Great Lakes will produce mainly light precipitation across the
Great Lakes into portions of the central to northern Appalachians
and Northeast this weekend. The exception looks to be for the
favored high terrain and upslope flow areas of West Virginia where
late season snowfall accumulations could total several inches per
the latest Winter Weather Outlook probabilities. As the next
system moves into the western U.S. this weekend into early next
week, unsettled and active weather is expected on Day 4 /Sunday/
for the Northwest then Day 5-6 /Monday-Tuesday/ for much of
California, bringing beneficial and welcome rains to the valleys
with the higher elevation areas of the Sierra likely to see
several inches or more of snow. As that system moves into the
Plains and Midwest, enough cold air on the northern fringe of the
precipitation shield could allow for a wintry mix but details are
lacking that far out in time.

Unseasonably warm temperatures will build and expand underneath
upper ridging from the western U.S. into the Plains. Highs that
are 10-25F above normal will be common over the weekend from the
West Coast across the Great Basin and Southwest to the Plains, and
several daily record high temperatures could be set or tied. As
the ridge axis shifts eastward, warm anomalies of 15-25F are
likely for the High Plains Monday while the West Coast moderates
closer to normal. Warmer than normal temperatures remain forecast
in the south-central U.S. on Tuesday but may moderate Wednesday
while pushing into the Southeast. Meanwhile the East should see
near to below average temperatures given mean upper troughing,
with coolest temperatures of 10-20F below normal in the Great
Lakes and central Appalachians for the weekend and spreading into
the Northeast early next week.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
320 PM EDT Wed Mar 23 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Mar 26 2022 - 12Z Wed Mar 30 2022

...Overview...

Deep troughing over the eastern U.S. this weekend will favor
seasonably cool temperatures from the Great Lakes to the
Northeast. A few embedded shortwaves will reinforce the cool
regime and bring blustery conditions and mostly light
precipitation. Meanwhile, a ridge anchored over the West will
break down as a large scale trough approaches and brings unsettled
and active weather to the Northwest and eventually much of the
West. As that aforementioned ridge moves into the Plains,
temperatures soar to much above normal values which could bring
record highs to the Intermountain West to the High Plains.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The synoptic setup at the start of the period /Saturday/ shows
good model agreement and predictability with a western U.S. ridge
and eastern trough. A few embedded shortwaves will move through
the cyclonic flow this weekend over the Great Lakes with one
particular Clipper helping to induce cyclogenesis off the New
England coast Sunday into Monday. Here, model differences are
fairly minimal now and a near equal blend of the latest available
deterministic guidance was used.

The larger model differences are to the west tied to the
progression and amplitude of an eastern Pacific trough,
particularly the southern piece of that energy. As the positively
tilted trough axis reaches the western U.S., some guidance favors
closing off a upper low well offshore southern California (i.e.
00Z ECMWF) while others are closer to the coast/inland or more
progressive (GFS/CMC). The trend has been for a slower solution
that may close off, but perhaps not to the degree the 00Z ECMWF
(and its previous runs) suggest. It largely depends on how much
phasing or lack of with the northern stream - the ECMWF favors
more separation and allows the northern stream energy to race out
faster compared to the more phased GFS solution, especially by day
6/7. Either way, the models do show that the troughing reaches the
Rockies into the Plains by the end of the period where a strong
surface low may materialize. It's a lower confidence forecast,
especially from day 5 onward as the energy reaches the
Intermountain West. For now, the WPC blend for day 5-7 favored a
compromise of the ECMWF/GFS while including higher weights of the
ECENS/GEFS means to maintain continuity some while addressing the
uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The shortwave energy progression and strong cyclonic flow over the
Great Lakes will produce mainly light precipitation across the
Great Lakes into portions of the central to northern Appalachians
and Northeast this weekend. The exception looks to be for the
favored high terrain and upslope flow areas of West Virginia where
late season snowfall accumulations could total several inches per
the latest Winter Weather Outlook probabilities. As the next
system moves into the western U.S. this weekend into early next
week, unsettled and active weather is expected on Day 4 /Sunday/
for the Northwest then Day 5-6 /Monday-Tuesday/ for much of
California, bringing beneficial and welcome rains to the valleys
with the higher elevation areas of the Sierra likely to see
several inches or more of snow. As that system moves into the
Plains and Midwest, enough cold air on the northern fringe of the
precipitation shield could allow for a wintry mix but details are
lacking that far out in time.

Unseasonably warm temperatures will build and expand underneath
upper ridging from the western U.S. into the Plains. Highs that
are 10-25F above normal will be common over the weekend from the
West Coast across the Great Basin and Southwest to the Plains, and
several daily record high temperatures could be set or tied. As
the ridge axis shifts eastward, warm anomalies of 15-25F are
likely for the High Plains Monday while the West Coast moderates
closer to normal. Warmer than normal temperatures remain forecast
in the south-central U.S. on Tuesday but may moderate Wednesday
while pushing into the Southeast. Meanwhile the East should see
near to below average temperatures given mean upper troughing,
with coolest temperatures of 10-20F below normal in the Great
Lakes and central Appalachians for the weekend and spreading into
the Northeast early next week.

...A lessening threat for severe weather and flash flooding will
persist over the Southeast and Midwest today...

...Some snow and ice accumulations continue into today for
northern parts of the Great Lakes, before shifting into interior
New England...

...Critical fire weather threat for parts of the Southern Plains,
with record warmth through this weekend across the West...

The same storm system which brought widespread severe weather and
heavy rainfall the past couple of days across the Deep South will
continue into the Eastern U.S. today, although the severe and
flash flood threat should wane somewhat as the environment becomes
less favorable. Even still, heavy rainfall is possible along the
front across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic today. WPC maintains a
broad Marginal risk (threat level 1/4) of excessive rainfall
across portions of the Mid-Atlantic into the Southeast, with an
embedded focused Slight Risk area (threat level 2/4) over the
eastern Florida Panhandle. SPC is also monitoring two areas for
organized severe weather today over the Ohio River Valley and
Georgia/Carolina Piedmont, both under a Slight Risk (threat level
2/5) for the threat of a couple tornadoes, severe wind, and hail.
Over the last hour, Severe Thunderstorm and Tornado watches were
issued over these regions as thunderstorm development is underway.
Northwest of the low, modest snow and ice accumulations are
anticipated through tonight across portions of the Northern Tier
and Upper Peninsula, with up to 2 inches of snowfall and a glazing
of ice possible. The threat of wintry weather is then expected to
shift over interior New England this evening, where up to an inch
of snow and a tenth of an inch of ice could fall. In advance of
the impending wintry weather, Winter Weather Advisories are in
effect through tomorrow for Northeast New York into Northern
Maine. In the wake of this expansive and dynamic system, a colder
air mass should settle in, with cool northwesterly flow supporting
a cooler than average pattern across the eastern half of the U.S.
through this weekend.

Elsewhere, gusty winds and dry conditions will continue an
Elevated to Critical fire (threat revels 1/3 and 2/3,
respectively) weather threat across western to central/southern
Plains through Friday, per SPC. A weak front into the West will
bring some light rain and mountain snow to parts of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies, but there shouldn't be much
precipitation to accompany the front as it moves east into the
interior West and northern Plains. Some rain or wintry weather may
develop with the front into the Upper Great Lakes on Friday, with
another period of gusty winds possible.

A strong and expansive upper level ridge parked over the Western
U.S. will bring much above normal temperatures to much of the
western half of the country through at least the remainder of the
work week. Daytime highs for parts of California and the Great
Basin could be 10 to 20 degrees above normal. Numerous daily
record high temperatures are possible through this weekend west
over the Great Basin and Southwest.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A long-wave trough will traverse the Mississippi Valley today, with
strong northwesterly flow overspreading a mixed boundary layer
across the central U.S. Dry and breezy conditions will develop
across the Plains as stronger flow aloft mixes down toward the
surface. Widespread 15+ mph sustained northwesterly surface winds
will develop across the central High Plains into southern Texas,
coinciding with 10-20 percent RH atop very dry fuels that are quite
receptive to fire spread, hence Elevated highlights. Critical
highlights also remain in place across Deep South Texas. The primary
driver for the Critical highlights is the extreme receptiveness of
the fuels, with forecast ERCs exceeding the 95th percentile. While
winds may struggle to sustain at 20 mph for lengthy periods of time,
the 15 percent RH and extremely dry fuels should compensate to
support conditions favorable for significant wildfire spread.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL SOUTH DAKOTA
INTO NORTHERN NEBRASKA...

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will build across the Desert Southwest, with a
well-defined mid-level trough cresting the ridge and traversing the
northern and central Plains tomorrow/Friday. A dry boundary layer
will develop during the afternoon and encourage downward mixing of
the stronger flow aloft to support dry and windy conditions
conducive to fire spread. Widespread 15-25 mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds will overlap with 15-25 percent RH from
the northern High Plains southeastward into eastern Nebraska and
South Dakota. Critical highlights have been introduced where RH may
dip to 15 percent by afternoon peak heating, and where fuels are
critically dry (i.e., observed ERCs exceeding the 90th percentile
and forecast 10-hour fuel moisture dropping below 10 percent).
Portions of eastern Nebraska may also experience Critical
meteorological conditions, but recent appreciable precipitation
accumulations may dampen the robustness of the wildfire-spread
threat to a degree.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Thu Mar 24 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 27 2022 - 12Z Thu Mar 31 2022

...Overview...

Next week an upper trough with a likely embedded low is forecast
to move from the eastern Pacific into the West and then into the
central U.S. by around midweek. This pattern will lead to
increasing precipitation chances in the West early in the week
before a deepening low in the Plains spreads rain and
thunderstorms to the south-central U.S. and possible springtime
snow to the northern tier. An upper ridge initially over the West
causing warm weather for the West Coast to Plains will be shunted
east by the trough, with moderating temperatures. Meanwhile mean
troughing and coastal low pressure systems in the East should
bring cool temperatures and light precipitation early in the week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Fortunately, model guidance from the 12/18Z yesterday cycle shows
better agreement overall compared to the past couple of days,
particularly with the upper trough moving through the
western/central U.S. Models continue to show good consensus with
the ridge axis over the Rockies and troughing across the East at
the start of the period Sunday, with the deeper trough/low across
the eastern Pacific. After several days of waffling with timing of
the trough partially related to phasing or stream separation
between an upper low within the trough and a northern stream
shortwave, guidance is now better aligned with showing more
phasing or at least connection between the two features
Monday/Tuesday. This favors a moderately progressive trough
without leaving a southern stream low behind like earlier ECMWF
runs did. The ridge axis should be flattened and pushed eastward
somewhat by the trough while the eastern trough should lift, and
models are fairly persistent with those features.

By around Wednesday, more differences in the trough axis do arise
as 12/18Z and the newer 00Z GFS runs maintain a closed low in the
central U.S. within a neutral trough axis. ECMWF and CMC runs show
more phasing by Wednesday (though perhaps with some separation
again on Thursday) within a slightly positively tilted trough.
These issues stem at least partly from strength and timing of the
northern stream shortwaves, and these differences may take some
time to be ironed out. But at least the overall pattern is coming
into shape, and agreement for a surface low strengthening in the
central Plains Tuesday is good, but with some differences in track
after that.

Thus the WPC forecast began with a multi-model deterministic blend
of the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET. Phased in the GEFS
and EC ensemble means to about half by the end of the period to
address the uncertainty in the details of the pattern.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Light precipitation could linger across the Great Lakes region and
Northeast early next week given strong cyclonic flow and coastal
low pressure systems. As the next system moves into the western
U.S. early next week, unsettled and active weather is expected for
the West Coast states Sunday, which could bring mostly beneficial
and welcome rains to the valleys, with the higher elevation areas
of the Sierra could see see several inches or more of snow.
Current model guidance shows the heaviest rain totals for southern
California Sunday and Monday especially enhanced by higher
terrain, which could cause flooding issues if heavy rain falls
over burn scar areas. Rain and higher elevation snow will spread
across the Intermountain West and Rockies Monday and Tuesday. As
surface low pressure strengthens in the Plains and tracks east,
more widespread rain and thunderstorms are likely for the
south-central U.S. Tuesday and Wednesday. Meanwhile on the
northern side of the precipitation shield, wintry mix and snow are
possible for the north-central U.S. and potentially into the
Northeast, but details are lacking that far out in time.

Unseasonably warm temperatures are likely underneath upper ridging
from the western U.S. into the Plains early next week, and
temperatures of 10-25F above normal will be common. Though much of
the record-breaking warmth may have phased into the short range
period, some record highs and high minimum temperatures could be
set or tied Sunday and Monday. Temperatures in the West will
moderate closer to normal as the trough approaches, while warmer
than average temperatures should push into the southeastern U.S.
and moderate as the week progresses. Meanwhile the East should see
below average temperatures given mean upper troughing, with highs
of 10-25F and lows of 10-15F below normal over the Great Lakes and
central Appalachians for the weekend and spreading into the
Northeast early next week. These areas are forecast to warm nearer
to normal around midweek.

300 AM EDT Thu Mar 24 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 27 2022 - 12Z Thu Mar 31 2022

...Overview...

Next week an upper trough with a likely embedded low is forecast
to move from the eastern Pacific into the West and then into the
central U.S. by around midweek. This pattern will lead to
increasing precipitation chances in the West early in the week
before a deepening low in the Plains spreads rain and
thunderstorms to the south-central U.S. and possible springtime
snow to the northern tier. An upper ridge initially over the West
causing warm weather for the West Coast to Plains will be shunted
east by the trough, with moderating temperatures. Meanwhile mean
troughing and coastal low pressure systems in the East should
bring cool temperatures and light precipitation early in the week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Fortunately, model guidance from the 12/18Z yesterday cycle shows
better agreement overall compared to the past couple of days,
particularly with the upper trough moving through the
western/central U.S. Models continue to show good consensus with
the ridge axis over the Rockies and troughing across the East at
the start of the period Sunday, with the deeper trough/low across
the eastern Pacific. After several days of waffling with timing of
the trough partially related to phasing or stream separation
between an upper low within the trough and a northern stream
shortwave, guidance is now better aligned with showing more
phasing or at least connection between the two features
Monday/Tuesday. This favors a moderately progressive trough
without leaving a southern stream low behind like earlier ECMWF
runs did. The ridge axis should be flattened and pushed eastward
somewhat by the trough while the eastern trough should lift, and
models are fairly persistent with those features.

By around Wednesday, more differences in the trough axis do arise
as 12/18Z and the newer 00Z GFS runs maintain a closed low in the
central U.S. within a neutral trough axis. ECMWF and CMC runs show
more phasing by Wednesday (though perhaps with some separation
again on Thursday) within a slightly positively tilted trough.
These issues stem at least partly from strength and timing of the
northern stream shortwaves, and these differences may take some
time to be ironed out. But at least the overall pattern is coming
into shape, and agreement for a surface low strengthening in the
central Plains Tuesday is good, but with some differences in track
after that.

Thus the WPC forecast began with a multi-model deterministic blend
of the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET. Phased in the GEFS
and EC ensemble means to about half by the end of the period to
address the uncertainty in the details of the pattern.

...Showers and thunderstorms exiting the East Coast on Thursday,
with some light ice and snow accumulations possible across parts
of New England...

...Critical fire weather threats for parts of south Texas on
Thursday, and the north-central Plains on Friday...

...Record warmth likely across parts of the West into this
weekend...


The same storm system which brought widespread severe weather and
heavy rainfall the past couple of days across the Deep South and
into the East will finally exit the East Coast today. Rain and
storms, some locally heavy, will still be possible along mainly
coastal regions and into Florida this morning. Rain and/or a
wintry mix may linger across parts of New England into Friday
though as a secondary low develops and lifts up the coast. Some
light ice accumulations are possible across mainly the higher
terrain, with minor snow accumulations in far northern Maine. In
the wake of this system, cool northwesterly flow will support a
cooler than average air mass across the eastern half of the U.S.
into this weekend.

A clipper system out of central Canada moving into the Great Lakes
region on Friday should have only light precipitation associated
with it across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. Some snow or a
rain/snow mix may be possible for northern areas of the upper
Great Lakes. Cold high pressure surging in behind this front will
bring much below normal temperatures from the Upper Midwest to
Ohio Valley by Saturday.

Gusty winds and warm/dry conditions will continue an elevated to
critical fire weather threat across the High Plains on Thursday,
with red flag warnings in effect across South Texas. On Friday,
the fire weather threat shifts north into the northern/central
Plains where another critical area is highlighted across central
South Dakota and northern Nebraska.

A strong and expansive upper level ridge parked over the Western
U.S. will bring much above normal temperatures to the western half
of the country through this weekend. Daytime highs for much of the
West and into the southern Plains could be as much as 10 to 20
degrees above normal. Numerous daily record high temperatures are
forecast through Saturday across California, the Great Basin, and
the Southwest.

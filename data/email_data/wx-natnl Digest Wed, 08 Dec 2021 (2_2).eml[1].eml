Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
152 AM EST Wed Dec 08 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Dec 11 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 15 2021

...Locally heavy rain is possible particularly in the southern
Appalachians Saturday with record-breaking warmth along the
Eastern Seaboard ahead of a strong cold front...

...An atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast
this weekend into early next week bringing coastal rain and heavy
mountain snow...

...Overview...

A generally progressive and active weather pattern is forecast to
occur through the weekend, as a mid-upper trough pushes from the
central U.S. Saturday toward the East by Sunday, while a surface
low and potent cold front track ahead of it. Record-setting warm
temperatures and moderate to locally heavy precipitation are
likely in the East ahead of the cold front. Meanwhile, a
slow-moving and reloading trough in the eastern Pacific will
direct a persistent and moist inflow (atmospheric river) to the
West Coast, with heavy coastal rain and mountain snows likely that
should spread southward with time. The overall pattern is expected
to stagnate Monday and Tuesday with upper ridging building into
much of the lower 48 to the east of the Pacific trough, before the
trough begins to make its way eastward around midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance for the 12/18Z yesterday cycle continues to show
very good agreement through much of the period with the pattern
described above. After some previous waffling, guidance has been
consistent for a couple of cycles now showing a more phased (no
northern/southern stream separation) trough in the East over the
weekend, causing a faster track of the trough and associated cold
front, so this trend was maintained in the WPC forecast. Farther
west, there remain some model differences with the eastern Pacific
trough regarding the distribution of energy and the potential for
a closed low to develop (especially with GFS runs) within it. But
overall guidance agrees in a slow track of the trough axis
southward bringing persistent moist southwesterly flow into the
West Coast. There are increasing timing differences among
deterministic and ensemble guidance with the trough eventually
pushing eastward Tuesday and Wednesday, along with distribution of
shortwaves within it. The WPC forecast utilized a multi-model
deterministic blend of the 12/18Z guidance early in the period,
and was able to hold onto a majority deterministic models blend
through much of the period, but with increasing incorporation of
the ensemble means especially by day 7 to mitigate individual
model differences especially with the Western trough differences.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A strong cold front will track through the eastern third of the
U.S. on Saturday into Sunday and spread widespread rain with
embedded thunderstorms along and ahead of it. There is potential
for heavy rain amounts with quick-hitting high rainfall rates for
portions of the Southeast, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and
Appalachians, which could cause flooding/flash flooding issues
especially in the more sensitive terrain of the southern
Appalachians. With a quicker upper trough and cold frontal track,
moisture will likely clear out of the Eastern Seaboard by Sunday,
and with high pressure in its wake, dry conditions are likely in
the central and eastern U.S. for the first part of next week other
than some possibility of increasing showers in the south-central
U.S. and Great Lakes by Monday and Tuesday. Meanwhile, persistent
moist onshore flow with a weak atmospheric river is likely
initially in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies Saturday,
and then will track south into California by early next week.
Enhanced totals are likely along favored terrain, with heavy
mountain snow in the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and northern
Rockies, and spreading to the central Great Basin and Arizona by
Tuesday.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast for the eastern third of the U.S. on Saturday. Dozens of
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures could be set
from the central Gulf Coast to Northeast with temperatures 20-30F
above normal. Temperatures should moderate to near normal behind,
but by early next week as ridging builds, temperatures are
expected to warm to 10-20F above normal on Sunday in the central
U.S., with warmth expanding into the eastern U.S. as the workweek
begins, and warming further to possibly 30+F above average in
central parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley by next
Wednesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 AM CST Wed Dec 08 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude southern stream shortwave trough and attendant
midlevel speed maximum will advance eastward from the Desert
Southwest and overspread the southern Rockies and adjacent High
Plains by this evening. Surface lee troughing is already established
across the High Plains, and the emergence of the southwesterly
midlevel speed maximum will aid in enhancing the surface pressure
gradient over portions of eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle
vicinity.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated to perhaps spotty Critical fire-weather conditions are
expected across parts of eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle
this afternoon. Here, downslope trajectories off the southern
Rockies will support RH reductions into the upper teens to lower 20s
amid breezy west-southwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph with
higher gusts. While increasing mid/high-level cloud coverage
preceding the shortwave trough may limit diurnal RH reductions to an
extent, high-resolution model guidance continues to depict the
development of critically low RH in response to adiabatic
warming/drying across the region.

...Central High Plains...
A brief period of locally Elevated fire-weather conditions may
develop this afternoon, as enhanced midlevel flow peripheral to the
previously mentioned speed maximum glances parts of southeastern
Wyoming, northeastern Colorado, and the Nebraska Panhandle. With
that said, continued disagreement amongst the short-range model
guidance regarding a favorable overlap of low RH and breezy surface
winds precludes highlights at this time, though trends will be
monitored.

significant snow of the season across parts of the Sierra Nevada,
Intermountain West, Central Rockies, and central High Plains on
Thursday and Friday...

...Light snow possible across the Northeast today and Upper Great
Lakes on Thursday...

...Potentially record-breaking warm temperatures to build across
the south-central United States...

The most widespread and impactful system to affect the Nation
through the end of the week will be located between the
Intermountain West and central High Plains as a potent upper-level
trough and cold front enter the region later today. Moderate snow
is expected out breakout tonight into early Thursday across
portions of the Sierra Nevada and Intermountain West, with snow
also falling into the lower elevations and potentially impacting
the Thursday AM commute in central/northern Nevada. Throughout the
day on Thursday, snow is forecast to steadily spread eastward and
into the Central Rockies before reaching parts of the central High
Plains by Thursday night. Snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches
are likely across the Sierra Nevada and higher terrain of the
Intermountain West, with 3-6 inches likely across the lower
terrain. Over a foot of snow is expected across the Central
Rockies of Utah, western Colorado, and far southern Wyoming.
Meanwhile, heavy snow is also forecast to create hazardous driving
conditions throughout southeast Wyoming and western Nebraska into
Friday morning, where widespread 6-12 inches of snow is possible.
Residents in these locations are advised to plan ahead as
difficult travel conditions are increasingly likely with this
first significant snow of the season. Winter Weather Advisories
and Winter Storm Watches have been issued. Periods of heavy snow
are also possible across the Cascades and Northern Rockies, thanks
to a persistent onshore flow ushering in Pacific moisture to the
region. Over a foot of snow is forecast through Friday morning
across the Cascades, Olympics, and mountainous terrain of northern
Idaho and northwest Montana. Winter Weather Advisories and Winter
Storm Warnings have been issued here. Finally, it is worth noting
that this active weather pattern along the West Coast will likely
lead to much-needed rainfall spreading into central and southern
California on Thursday, but amounts are currently expected to
remain under a quarter of an inch.

For the eastern U.S., an area of low pressure located along a
stalled frontal boundary draped across the Southeast is expected
to move northeast and rapidly strengthen off the New England
coastline tonight. While this system is forecast to remain well
offshore, light snow is still possible across parts of the
Northeast and New England. Snow showers are also a possibility
throughout the northern Mid-Atlantic, with little-to-no
accumulation expected. Farther south, a cold front exiting the
Southeast by this afternoon may spark a few thunderstorms over
southern Georgia and the eastern Carolinas. Light precipitation is
also expected to sweep into the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes on
Thursday in the form of snow as a warm front lifts near the
region. A few inches of snow could fall across the U.P. of
Michigan.

Elsewhere, a warming trend is on the way for the central United
States as anomalous upper-level ridging builds downstream of the
western trough. Highs are expected to reach into the 70s and 80s
by Thursday, with 60s extending into the middle Mississippi
Valley. Daily high temperature records are likely to be topped
through Oklahoma and Texas on Thursday, with even more December
warmth on the way to end the week.

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced midlevel west-southwesterly downslope flow will
remain in place over the southern Rockies on Thursday, maintaining a
tight surface pressure gradient over the southern High Plains. As a
lee surface low deepens over the northern Plains, low-level
west-southwesterly flow will strengthen across the southern High
Plains in response.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated to locally Critical fire-weather conditions are anticipated
across portions of the southern High Plains on Thursday afternoon,
as low/mid-level west-southwesterly downslope flow strengthens
across the region. Similar to Wednesday, substantial mid/high-level
clouds may limit diurnal RH reductions to an extent. However,
high-resolution model guidance continues to depict a few hours of RH
in the 15-25 percent range, coincident with breezy surface winds of
15-25 mph and higher gusts.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1133 AM CDT Tue Sep 07 2021

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustment for
the latest guidance. The elevated area over the northern High Plains
was moved slightly westward toward lower observed humidity values.
The elevated area across central California was extended northward
for gusty winds and low humidity along the lee of the central
coastal ranges. See the previous forecast for additional
information.

..Lyons.. 09/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0126 AM CDT Tue Sep 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough across the northern Plains will continue to
amplify while advancing towards the Mississippi Valley today. Still,
a wide corridor of 50+ kt 500 mb northwesterly flow will trail the
departing mid-level trough and overspread the northern High Plains
during the afternoon. Dry and breezy conditions supporting some
wildfire-spread potential are expected. Meanwhile, an upper
ridge/anticyclone will persist across the Interior West, with a
second mid-level trough pivoting around the ridge and grazing the
California coast by late afternoon. The surface mass response will
be downslope flow along the lee of the central Coast Ranges, with
dry and breezy surface conditions promoting modest wildfire-spread
potential.

...Northern High Plains...
Boundary-layer mixing of the stronger mid-level flow aloft will
promote widespread 20-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds
amid 20-25% RH per latest guidance consensus. Elevated highlights
were introduced given forecast fuel ERCs above 80%. Some of the
highlighted areas have seen over an inch of rain within the past
week. However, multiple preceding days of dry and windy conditions
have likely compensated by priming fuels to some degree to support
wildfire spread.

...Portions of central California...
By late afternoon and early evening, upper support associated with
the glancing mid-level trough will overspread the central Coast
Ranges, inducing dry downslope flow in proximity to the Bay Area and
portions of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. Guidance
consensus continues to portray 15-20 mph sustained
west-northwesterly winds coinciding with 15-20% RH over critically
dry fuels for at least a few hours, warranting the maintenance of
Elevated highlights.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
151 PM EDT Tue Sep 07 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Sep 10 2021 - 12Z Tue Sep 14 2021

...Overview...

The CONUS weather pattern by this weekend and into next week will
feature quasi-zonal flow as the upper high over the Great Basin is
suppressed southeast to the southern Rockies where it weakens and
eastern troughing will be more focused over eastern Canada than
over the Great Lakes as current. The pattern is rather dry on the
whole, with a notable exception of the western Gulf Coast next
week, with generally normal temperatures for the central and
southern parts of the CONUS.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles showed decent longwave agreement with
continued spread in the shorter wavelength features. The ECMWF
remains more consistent than the GFS or Canadian/UKMET, but even
it has wavered in the strength and timing of the main trough that
crosses the Northwest early next week. Thus, continued to favor a
blended solution of the recent deterministic guidance to start,
with increasing weight to the ensemble means (06Z GEFS and 00Z
ECENS) staring this weekend as uncertainty grows. The trend with
the trough in the Northwest/northern Rockies early next week is
back to less amplified, but the east-west (fast-slow) spread
continues, with the GFS quickest and Canadian slowest. This left
the ECMWF closes to the ensemble means.

A tropical system is still likely to form in the East Pacific over
the next day or so but is forecast to track offshore/west of Baja
California. In the Gulf of Mexico, tropical development remains
uncertain but while part of the energy could track into the
Atlantic, a trough looks to develop and linger over the western
Gulf of Mexico. The GFS remains the strongest with this trough and
the 12Z run even develops a surface low near the lower Rio Grande
Valley by Monday. Please see the NHC outlooks for the latest
information.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Lingering rainfall will remain focused along and ahead of a cold
front over north Florida Friday night into Saturday. Daily
showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to the
south of the boundary as it washes out into early next week.
Moisture will lift northward on the backside of the western upper
high and converge on a frontal boundary over the northern Rockies
Friday night and Saturday with steady and perhaps locally heavy
rain. Precip weakens with this frontal system across the northern
Plains Sunday, but the additional of Gulf-sourced moisture bring
moderate rain chances to the Great Lakes Monday night/Tuesday.
Tropical moisture looks to spread some organized and lingering
locally heavy rain toward western parts of the Gulf Coast with the
GFS continuing to be the heaviest solution, particularly over
south Texas/the lower Rio Grande Valley.

Temperatures will be above normal under the ridge that is
suppressed south over the Rockies this weekend and ahead of the
following cold front that tracks across the northern tier. Friday
high temperatures along the central High Plains to the Front Range
will be 15 to 20 degrees above normal where several high
temperature records will be challenged. This area of warmth
weakens as it moves into the southern/central Plains over the
weekend and toward the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys next
week, with few if any high temperature records challenged.
Temperatures in the northern Plains quickly shift below normal
from Friday to Saturday which shifts east over the Great
Lakes/Northeast behind the aforementioned cold front.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
151 PM EDT Tue Sep 07 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Sep 10 2021 - 12Z Tue Sep 14 2021

...Overview...

The CONUS weather pattern by this weekend and into next week will
feature quasi-zonal flow as the upper high over the Great Basin is
suppressed southeast to the southern Rockies where it weakens and
eastern troughing will be more focused over eastern Canada than
over the Great Lakes as current. The pattern is rather dry on the
whole, with a notable exception of the western Gulf Coast next
week, with generally normal temperatures for the central and
southern parts of the CONUS.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles showed decent longwave agreement with
continued spread in the shorter wavelength features. The ECMWF
remains more consistent than the GFS or Canadian/UKMET, but even
it has wavered in the strength and timing of the main trough that
crosses the Northwest early next week. Thus, continued to favor a
blended solution of the recent deterministic guidance to start,
with increasing weight to the ensemble means (06Z GEFS and 00Z
ECENS) staring this weekend as uncertainty grows. The trend with
the trough in the Northwest/northern Rockies early next week is
back to less amplified, but the east-west (fast-slow) spread
continues, with the GFS quickest and Canadian slowest. This left
the ECMWF closes to the ensemble means.

A tropical system is still likely to form in the East Pacific over
the next day or so but is forecast to track offshore/west of Baja
California. In the Gulf of Mexico, tropical development remains
uncertain but while part of the energy could track into the
Atlantic, a trough looks to develop and linger over the western
Gulf of Mexico. The GFS remains the strongest with this trough and
the 12Z run even develops a surface low near the lower Rio Grande
Valley by Monday. Please see the NHC outlooks for the latest
information.

Lingering rainfall will remain focused along and ahead of a cold
front over north Florida Friday night into Saturday. Daily
showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to the

7aSAfssBc-a$

FOR WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 15 - TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 21: A mainly zonal mid-level
flow pattern is forecast for week-2 over the CONUS, with anomalously warm
temperatures predicted across most areas under weakly positive 500-hPa heig=
ht
anomalies. Shortwave troughing is predicted to progress across the eastern
U.S.
early in the period. Ahead of this trough, the ECMWF and GEFS ensembles
indicate positive 850-hPa temperature anomalies of around +10 deg F across =
the
eastern U.S. on day-8 (9/15) favoring unseasonably warm surface temperature=
s.
The highest temperatures are forecast across southern parts of the mid-
Atlantic
and Southeast where daytime highs may top 90 deg F. However, humidity value=
s
are generally forecast to be on the lower side, which would prevent many ar=
eas
from reaching excessive heat criteria, despite the anomalously warm
temperatures. With relatively cooler temperatures forecast behind the mean
trough axis, excessive heat is no longer indicated for portions of the
Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley, with the ECMWF reforecast tool depicti=
ng
probabilities of less than 20% for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
climatological percentile. Additionally, heat risk guidance now depicts
reduced
probabilities compared to yesterday for heat indices exceeding 105 deg F
across
these regions. Heat indices in the upper 90s to 100 deg F remain possible
across portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley where many populations are
still experiencing power outages due to Hurricane Ida. This may exacerbate
impacts for sensitive groups due to the lack of available cooling resources=
 in
some areas.



As this initial troughing moves through the East early in week-2, frontally
enhanced rainfall is possible. The greatest precipitation signals are acros=
s
the interior Northeast and New England where 24-hour rainfall totals exceed=
ing
a half inch are possible. Since the system looks to be transient with littl=
e
impact expected, a related precipitation hazard is not designated over the
northeastern CONUS. Surface high pressure is predicted to become establishe=
d
over the eastern CONUS in the wake of the trough. As a result, southerly
return
flow is forecast along the western Gulf of Mexico Coast, increasing the
chances
of heavy rain over parts of the Southern Great Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley. There is also elevated potential for tropical cyclone development,
which could further enhance rainfall if an organized system reaches the Gul=
f
Coast. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools and the uncalibrated 0z ECM=
WF
ensemble highlight parts of southeastern Texas and southern Louisiana havin=
g
at
least a 20% chance for 3-day precipitation totals exceeding 1-inch, support=
ive
of a slight risk for heavy rain over these areas from Sep 15 to Sep 19.
Although the ECMWF tools expand this area eastward through the Florida
Panhandle by the middle of the period, the GEFS and Canadian ensembles keep
most of the rain over the western Gulf Coast precluding an extension of the
precipitation hazard.



Anomalous troughing is forecast across the Bering Sea and western Mainland
Alaska during week-2. The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensembles continue t=
o
indicate surface low pressure tracking across southern Alaska during the
period, which would increase chances for high winds and heavy precipitation
from the Aleutians eastward to the Panhandle. A slight risk of high wind
speeds
is highlighted across the Aleutians, Alaska Peninsula, coastal southern
Mainland, and the Panhandle for all of week-2 due to the favorable synoptic
set-up, and where there is also support from the ECMWF reforecast tool
depicting at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th
climatological percentile over parts of the highlighted region. The enhance=
d
southwesterly flow ahead of the trough axis also favors increased
precipitation
chances across southeastern Alaska. Both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tool=
s
depict probabilities of at least 20% for 3-day precipitation exceeding 2-
inches
across coastal portions of the southern Mainland and the Alaska Panhandle,
supporting the continuation of the slight risk of heavy precipitation for t=
he
entire period. Deterministic solutions also indicate increased signals for
heavy snow over the higher elevations of the southern Mainland and Panhandl=
e.
There are indications that some of this heavy precipitation may extend into
the
northwestern CONUS later in week-2, but there is not enough confidence to
expand the precipitation hazard at this time.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue September 07 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 13 - 17 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ensemble mean solutions from the ECMWF, G=
EFS, and CMC generally
depict
low amplitude 500-hPa flow across much of the forecast domain. The main
westerlies are forecast near the Canadian border with weak troughs progress=
ing
across the northern CONUS within weakly cyclonic flow. Subtropical ridging =
is
forecast over much of the southern two-thirds of the CONUS, with the strong=
est
positive height anomalies focused over the western CONUS and parts of the E=
ast
Coast.  Models have trended toward lowering heights over the north-central
CONUS, which is consistent with composites from the current phase of the MJ=
O.
Agreement is good across Alaska as models predict a strong mid-level trough
over the western Mainland. Some models, such as the 0z ECMWF Ensemble mean,
indicate the potential for shortwave energy to progress eastward over the G=
ulf
of Alaska as time progresses. The 500-hPa manual height blend, based primar=
ily
on the dynamical model ensemble mean solutions, depicts near to above norma=
l
heights across most of the western CONUS, Eastern Seaboard, and the Central
Plains with and below normal heights favored across most of Alaska, parts o=
f
the Northern Plains, and the Western Gulf Coast Region.

With low amplitude flow expected across much of North America, above normal
temperatures are favored across most of the CONUS. The highest probabilitie=
s
(exceeding 70 percent) for above normal temperatures are indicated near the
Four Corners Region. However, due to the trend toward lower heights across =
the
north-central CONUS during the 6-10 day period, enhanced above normal
temperature probabilities are absent for parts of the Upper Mississippi
Valley,
Great Lakes, and Northern Plains. Similarly, slightly enhanced probabilitie=
s
of
near to below normal temperatures are indicated for the northwestern CONUS,
where there is the potential for a weak trough in the vicinity. Troughing a=
nd
below normal heights are expected across much of Alaska, leading to enhance=
d
probabilities of below normal temperatures. However, above normal temperatu=
res
are slightly favored for the Aleutians due to above normal SSTs in adjacent
waters. Milder than normal conditions are also favored for northeastern
Mainland Alaska ahead of the trough forecast over the western Mainland.

With a mean trough forecast over the western Mainland and the potential for
shortwave troughs progressing eastward over the Gulf of Alaska, an active
pattern is anticipated for much of Alaska. Therefore, above normal
precipitation is favored across most of the state with the greatest likelih=
ood
across the Panhandle and the southeastern Mainland. Near to above normal
precipitation is also favored for much of the northern tier of the CONUS fr=
om
the Plains eastward due to the potential progression of shortwave troughs
within the mean westerlies. Chances of above normal precipitation are eleva=
ted
for the western Gulf Coast region due to the potential influxes of Gulf
moisture. With the potential for increased troughing over the north-central
CONUS, elevated chances of above normal precipitation extend across most of
the
east-central CONUS. Predicted surface high pressure early in the period lea=
ds
to slightly favored drier than normal conditions across parts of the coasta=
l
Southeast. Below normal precipitation is also favored for the Southwest
Monsoon
Region as the mean position of the 500-hPa ridge axis is forecast to be
located
near the CONUS/Mexico border. Dynamical model guidance generally favors bel=
ow
normal precipitation for the northwestern CONUS. However, below normal
precipitation probabilities were kept low for parts of the Pacific Northwes=
t
as
enhanced Pacific flow may begin to affect the region late in the period.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
fairly
good agreement among the ensemble mean solutions, offset by discrepancies
among
the individual deterministic model runs from the GFS and ECMWF.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 15 - 21 2021

During the week-2 period, generally low amplitude, weakly cyclonic 500-hPa
flow
is forecast to persist across much of the CONUS. Weak troughs are generally
forecast to progress within the westerlies across the Northeast early in th=
e
period and over the Pacific Northwest later in the period. An active patter=
n
is
expected to continue across much of Alaska with short-wave troughs predicte=
d
over western Mainland Alaska as well as over the Gulf of Alaska. The 500-hP=
a
manual height blend, based entirely on the model ensemble mean solutions,
depicts near to above normal heights across most of the CONUS. A small regi=
on
of mean below normal heights is indicated near the western Gulf Coast Regio=
n,
associated with a potential tropical disturbance over the Gulf of Mexico.
Below
normal heights are forecast across most of Alaska, underneath a mean mid-le=
vel
trough.

Above normal temperatures are likely for most of the CONUS due to predicted
low
amplitude flow and the mean westerlies confined to near the CONUS/Canada
border. The greatest likelihood for above normal temperatures is indicated =
for
the west-central CONUS, where subtropical ridging is predicted to be fairly
persistent. Near to below normal temperatures are generally favored for the
northwestern CONUS as increased troughing is possible later in week-2.
Persistent troughing leads to increased odds for below normal temperatures
across much of Alaska. However, above normal SSTs leads to elevated chances=
 of
above normal temperatures for the Aleutians.

The potential for advection of tropical moisture leads to increased odds of
above normal precipitation for the Gulf of Mexico Region. Above normal
precipitation is also favored for much of the eastern CONUS, as shortwave
energy and the potential for associated frontal boundaries progress along t=
he
mean westerlies early in the period. Below normal precipitation is likely f=
or
the west-central CONUS due to predicted mean ridging. Conversely, an active
pattern is forecast to persist for much of Alaska, leading to enhanced
probabilities of above normal precipitation for southern coastal regions fr=
om
the eastern Aleutians to the Panhandle. As enhanced Pacific flow pushes
southward, chances of above normal precipitation are forecast to increase f=
or
parts of the northwestern CONUS. Drier than normal conditions are favored
across northern Mainland Alaska, as the mean storm track is predicted to be
mostly to the south of the region.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0235 PM CDT Tue Sep 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHWESTERN MONTANA
AND NORTHEASTERN IDAHO...

...Southwestern Montana and northeastern Idaho...
Ahead of a fast moving shortwave trough lifting into southern
Canada, mid-level low will increase to 40-50 kts across a narrow
swath of the northern Rockies. Enhanced mixing and strong surface
heating will bolster low-level wind fields to 20-35 mph during the
afternoon. With a very warm/dry airmass(surface RH below 15%) and
critical fuels in place along the northern periphery of the upper
ridge, widespread elevated to critical fire weather conditions
appear likely.

...Lee of the Cascades...
Increasing west/southwesterly flow is forecast to overspread the
mountains Wednesday supporting gusty gap winds along the Cascades.
Localized pockets of 20-25 mph winds may briefly overlap with
surface humidity below 30% supporting locally elevated fire weather
conditions.

Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains valid with only minor
adjustments for the latest model guidance.

..Lyons.. 09/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0127 AM CDT Tue Sep 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will remain in place through tomorrow/Wednesday across
the Interior West, with multiple mid-level impulses cresting the
upper ridge axis over the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies
through the day. Dry and breezy conditions are expected to manifest
across the higher terrain over portions of the Pacific Northwest
into the northern Rockies, promoting at least modest wildfire-spread
potential.

...Pacific Northwest into the Northern Rockies...
As 30-50 kts of mid-level flow overspread the southern Cascades in
Oregon and the Sawtooth Range/Salmon River Mountains in Idaho, 15-20
mph sustained westerly downslope flow is expected to overlap with
15-20% surface RH during the afternoon. While some questions remain
regarding the coverage of 15-20 mph sustained surface winds, fuels
remain critically dry on a widespread basis across parts of the
Pacific Northwest towards the Northern Rockies. Elevated highlights
were added where the most persistent downslope flow is expected
based on guidance consensus.

Valid 00Z Wed Sep 08 2021 - 00Z Fri Sep 10 2021



...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Great Lakes through Wednesday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Northeast from Wednesday into Thursday morning...

...A heatwave will encompass much of the West with record high
temperatures possible...

A front extending from the Great Lakes to the Southern High Plains
will slowly move eastward off the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Coast
by Thursday evening.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along
and ahead of the front over the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley that will
move into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday. Upper-level
dynamics have led the SPC to issue a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Great Lakes through Wednesday
morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.  The severe thunderstorm threat continues on
Wednesday into Thursday morning over parts of the Northeast.

In addition, the showers and thunderstorms will develop over parts
of the Northeast that recently had heavy rain from IDA. Therefore,
the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms on Wednesday into Thursday.  The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable from
Wednesday through Thursday morning.  Showers and thunderstorms
will also develop over parts of the Southeast on Wednesday into
Thursday.

Elsewhere, an upper-level high over the Great Basin will aid in
producing record high temperatures over the Western States through
Thursday.  Furthermore, the dry weather associated with the
upper-level high will and gusty winds has led to an increase in
the fire weather threat over parts of the Upper Midwest and
California, with Red Flag Warnings over parts of the Northwest
into the Northern Rockies. In addition, excessive Heat Warnings
are posted over Southeastern California, while Heat Advisories are
also posted over most of the state. However, Air Quality Alerts
have also been published over parts of the Pacific Northwest,
Idaho, Wyoming, and Colorado due to wildfire smoke.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
459 PM EDT Tue Sep 07 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Sep 10 2021 - 12Z Tue Sep 14 2021

...Overview...

The CONUS weather pattern by this weekend and into next week will
feature quasi-zonal flow as the upper high over the Great Basin is
suppressed southeast to the southern Rockies where it weakens and
eastern troughing will be more focused over eastern Canada than
over the Great Lakes as current. The pattern is rather dry on the
whole, with a notable exception of the western Gulf Coast next
week, with generally normal temperatures for the central and
southern parts of the CONUS.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles showed decent longwave agreement with
continued spread in the shorter wavelength features. The ECMWF
remains more consistent than the GFS or Canadian/UKMET, but even
it has wavered in the strength and timing of the main trough that
crosses the Northwest early next week. Thus, continued to favor a
blended solution of the recent deterministic guidance to start,
with increasing weight to the ensemble means (06Z GEFS and 00Z
ECENS) staring this weekend as uncertainty grows. The trend with
the trough in the Northwest/northern Rockies early next week is
back to less amplified, but the east-west (fast-slow) spread
continues, with the GFS quickest and Canadian slowest. This left
the ECMWF closes to the ensemble means.

A tropical system is still likely to form in the East Pacific over
the next day or so but is forecast to track offshore/west of Baja
California. In the Gulf of Mexico, tropical development remains
uncertain but while part of the energy could track into the
Atlantic, a trough looks to develop and linger over the western
Gulf of Mexico. The GFS remains the strongest with this trough and
the 12Z run even develops a surface low near the lower Rio Grande
Valley by Monday. Please see the NHC outlooks for the latest
information.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Lingering rainfall will remain focused along and ahead of a cold
front over north Florida Friday night into Saturday. Daily
showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to the
south of the boundary as it washes out into early next week.
Moisture will lift northward on the backside of the western upper
high and converge on a frontal boundary over the northern Rockies
Friday night and Saturday with steady and perhaps locally heavy
rain. Precip weakens with this frontal system across the northern
Plains Sunday, but the additional of Gulf-sourced moisture bring
moderate rain chances to the Great Lakes Monday night/Tuesday.
Tropical moisture looks to spread some organized and lingering
locally heavy rain toward western parts of the Gulf Coast with the
GFS continuing to be the heaviest solution, particularly over
south Texas/the lower Rio Grande Valley.

Temperatures will be above normal under the ridge that is
suppressed south over the Rockies this weekend and ahead of the
following cold front that tracks across the northern tier. Friday
high temperatures along the central High Plains to the Front Range
will be 15 to 20 degrees above normal where several high
temperature records will be challenged. This area of warmth
weakens as it moves into the southern/central Plains over the
weekend and toward the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys next
week, with few if any high temperature records challenged.
Temperatures in the northern Plains quickly shift below normal
from Friday to Saturday which shifts east over the Great
Lakes/Northeast behind the aforementioned cold front.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
226 AM EDT Wed Sep 08 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Sep 11 2021 - 12Z Wed Sep 15 2021

...Overview...

Quasi-zonal flow over the CONUS next week amid a mostly dry
pattern should spell a relatively quiet period, but with
uncertainty in system details. The western Gulf/south Texas has
the best chance for appreciable rainfall depending on how much
moisture a possible tropical wave brings to the area. Temperatures
will be near to below normal along the U.S./Canadian border and
near the Gulf, but warmer than normal in between.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles showed decent longwave agreement with
continued spread in the shorter wavelength features. Continued to
favor a blended solution of the recent deterministic guidance to
start, minus the UKMET which was quite slow into the Northwest
this weekend, with increasing weight to the ensemble means (18Z
GEFS and 12Z ECENS) Mon-Wed as uncertainty grows.
Unclear/inconsistent trends or shifts in the guidance (not unusual
in lower amplitude flow) have made it difficult to favor one
solution over another.

In the Gulf of Mexico, the GFS remained the strongest with any
tropical entity (though likely just a weak surface reflection) and
thus rainfall. Favored a more modest depiction and subsequent QPF.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Daily showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to
the south of the boundary as it washes out early next week.
Frontal boundary over the northern tier will likely only support
light rainfall for the High Plains before a modest injection of
moisture from the south may promote more scattered showers across
the Great Lakes Monday night/Tuesday. This should slide into the
Northeast next Tuesday into Wednesday per current timing. Will
continue to adjust rainfall forecasts for the western Gulf,
particularly over south Texas/the lower Rio Grande Valley pending
any organization of favorable ingredients.

Temperatures will be above normal under the ridge and south of the
surface boundary this weekend from the southern Plains eastward.
High temperatures may be 5 to 15 degrees above normal where
several high temperature records will be challenged. This area of
warmth will temper a bit as it moves toward the Middle Mississippi
and Ohio Valleys next week and then to the Mid-Atlantic.
Temperatures along the Canadian border will linger near to below
normal through the period. Areas around the Gulf will see typical
mid-September temperatures in the upper 80s to around 90F.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1124 AM CDT Thu Jun 24 2021

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments. Locally
elevated conditions are possible in southeastern Oregon as a weak
surface trough develops this afternoon. With the recent lightning
activity, some increase in fire activity could occur.

..Wendt.. 06/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Thu Jun 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
The persistent upper low near the West Coast will stall and
retrograde west slightly through the day, as mid-level flow over the
eastern and central CONUS becomes mostly zonal. Deep moisture
advecting into the Southwest and Great Basin will result in
widespread showers and thunderstorms. Isolated dry thunderstorms
will be possible over dry fuels. Elsewhere, little overlap between
warm, dry, and windy surface conditions will limit significant fire
weather potential.

..Dry Thunder...
Widespread cloud cover and showers are expected at the beginning of
the period across much of the Great Basin and Southwest. As lift
from the stalled upper low over the West Coast overspreads the
region, a few storms are expected to form by mid morning. PWAT
values have continued to climb over the last several days, with many
western US 00z RAOBS recording values near 0.75 inches. Widespread
cloud debris and precipitation will likely inhibit diurnal heating
across a large are of the southern Great Basin and Southwest.
Despite the more conditional threat, localized pockets of clearing
and heating should result in sufficient instability for additional
storm development through the afternoon. A wetter storm mode
associated with the increasing moisture content will further
decrease the likelihood of dry strikes through the forecast period.
However, given the expected storm coverage and localized pockets of
better buoyancy, at least isolated lightning coverage over dry fuels
appears plausible. The highest probability for isolated dry
thunderstorms will exist in parts of western Utah, into northern
Nevada, and northern California.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 24 2021

SYNOPSIS: Excessive heat is likely to be ongoing across much of the western
contiguous U.S. associated with anomalous mid-level high pressure over the
region. This feature is forecast to weaken by the middle of the period,
possibly bringing some respite to heat concerns, although there are
indications
that heat may build across the north-central U.S. by the end of week-2. A cold
front may stall across the Lower Mississippi Valley region early in the
period,
becoming a focal point for heavy rain across parts of the Deep South and
Tennessee Valley. Mid-level low pressure over the Bering Sea is forecast to
lead to elevated chances for below normal temperatures across Alaska due in
part due to increased cloud cover and rainfall, especially along the southern
Mainland coast.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Great Basin, Northern
Rockies, and Northern High Plains, Fri-Sat, July 2-3.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Pacific Northwest,
Northern
California, Great Basin, Northern and Central Rockies, and Northern Plains,
Fri-Sun, July 2-4.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the West and portions of the
Northern
and Central Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley, Fri-Thu, July 2-8.

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Southern Plains, Lower
Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast, Fri-Sun, July 2-4.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY JUNE 27 - THURSDAY JULY 01:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!sAmFQB1_6viZtolqJ8KjwcC4kKFJ6degcjmnZjPr0ydoFWeDYQgoFvcLFe78WE8bQXA4OSip$

FOR FRIDAY JULY 02 - THURSDAY JULY 08: The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensembles consistently show 500-hPa height anomalies of 120-180 meters over
the
Northern Rockies near the Canadian border at the beginning of week-2, in line
with ongoing excessive heat. A high risk of excessive heat is continued for
parts of the Northern Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Northern High Plains
on July 2nd and 3rd where reforecast tool guidance supports at least a 60%
chance of daily high temperatures exceeding the 85th climatological
percentile.
The high risk region also aligns well with the National Blend of Models
forecast anticipating daily highs approaching or surpassing record
temperatures
on these dates. Across lower elevations within the high risk area, daytime
highs are likely to be in the triple digits, while higher elevations could
still experience temperatures reaching the mid 90s. A moderate risk of
excessive heat is highlighted for areas east of the Pacific Intercoastal range
from the Olympic Peninsula southward through northern California, and extends
eastward through parts of the Northern and Central Rockies and Northern Plains
on July 2-4. The moderate risk area coincides with where the ECMWF reforecast
tool shows at least a 40% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
climatological percentile. The GEFS reforecast tool indicates probabilities
greater than 40% over the Great Basin, with 20-40% probabilities across the
Northern Plains. However, given the exceptional drought across portions of the
Northern Plains, the moderate risk was kept in place despite less support from
the GEFS.



By the middle of week-2, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict a lowering
of
the 500-hPa heights across the western CONUS as the ridging breaks down.
Despite this, the reforecast tools maintain at least a 20% chance that maximum
temperatures exceed the 85th climatological percentile across much of the West
for all of week-2, justifying the continued slight risk. After Independence
Day, record heat appears less likely across the West, although above normal
temperatures remain forecast. Later in week-2, the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
depict additional ridging developing across the central CONUS, with increasing
positive height anomalies by the end of the period. This translates to
increased chances for excessive heat redeveloping across the Northern and
Central Plains and extending into the Upper Mississippi Valley, and these
areas
remain included in the slight risk. Heat-driven impacts are expected to
include: persistence and worsening of ongoing drought over the West, continued
emergence of flash drought over the Northern Plains, locally elevated fire
weather conditions amidst the hot and dry air mass for much of the West, and
direct health risks for people, pets and livestock across the highlighted
regions. Heat remains the top weather-related killer in the U.S., so consider
reviewing the National Weather Service's heat safety page to help beat the
heat:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat__;!!DZ3fjg!sAmFQB1_6viZtolqJ8KjwcC4kKFJ6degcjmnZjPr0ydoFWeDYQgoFvcLFe78WE8bQRvrGOXR$ .



Mid-level heights show a weakness across the southeastern quarter of the
CONUS,
potentially opening up the south-central and eastern portions of the Lower-48
to heavy rain concerns. The Weather Prediction Center surface analysis on
day-7
(July 1) shows a cold front extending from the Ohio Valley though the Lower
Mississippi Valley. Model guidance shows the potential for the southern
portion
of this cold front to stall across the Lower Mississippi Valley and interact
with Gulf moisture during the early part of week-2. As a result, a slight risk
for heavy rain is posted across parts of the Southern Plains, Lower
Mississippi
Valley, Tennessee Valley, and the Southeast on July 2-4. The GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools both indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals
exceeding the 85th climatological percentile across much of the highlighted
region, and over 2 inches in the uncalibrated ECMWF guidance. Soil moisture
observations for this region are generally in the 70th through 90th historical
percentile, so localized flooding could occur but is not anticipated to be
widespread enough to include a possible flood risk. There are also some modest
heavy rain signals with the northern portion of the cold front, but this
portion of the boundary appears more progressive so no heavy rain is indicated
outside of the South.



Tropical cyclone activity over the East Pacific has been conditioning the
monsoonal region for what is hopefully a robust southwest monsoon year to help
with the ongoing drought. Tropical storm Dolores brought some moisture to the
region last week, while model guidance suggests a possible moisture surge up
the Gulf of California during week-2 associated with the disturbance currently
being monitored for cyclogenesis off the southern Coast of Mexico. Some
consideration was given to a flooding possible hazard, but ensemble mean
rainfall totals over 3-day periods are generally under a half inch.



At the onset of week-2, the ECMWF and GEFS ensembles depict mid-level
troughing
across the Bering Sea and ridging over the western CONUS extending through the
Yukon. The progression of the trough further inland across Alaska and the
subsequent weakening of the ridge favors increased cloud cover and anomalously
cool conditions overspreading much of western Alaska. Enhanced southerly flow
may bring increased rain chances to the southern Mainland coast, especially
early in the period, but there are no indications of precipitation reaching
pre-defined hazards criteria.

...Historic and Dangerous Heat Wave with monthly/all-time record
temperatures possible over the Northwest/West...
...Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Rockies/Plains to
Ohio Valley...

18Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite maintains good overall
continuity with the previous medium range WPC forecast with a
blocky upper level pattern, with a large upper high/ridge
remaining anchored in place over the northern Rockies, and another
ridge over the western Atlantic.  This leaves a quasi-stationary
trough over the central Plains and Midwest along with a frontal
boundary with multiple perturbations along with, fueling rounds of
MCS activity that will likely produce episodes of heavy rain from
western Texas to the Ohio Valley.  There was a slight downward
trend in magnitude of rainfall across the Midwest and Ohio Valley,
whilst higher totals are favored across portions of northern Texas
and into Oklahoma.  The historic heatwave over the northwestern
U.S. will likely challenge some monthly June records and
potentially all-time record highs!  The most impressive readings
should be across interior portions of Oregon and Washington with
some 110s possible for the lower elevations of the Columbia River
Basin.  The previous discussion is appended below. /Hamrick

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean,
12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF/ECENS means and the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models in an overall pattern with above average predictability
days 3-5 (Sunday-Tuesday). Shifted blend focus toward the still
compatible ensemble means by days 6/7 amid gradually increasing
forecast spread. Recent Canadian had been quicker to suppress the
hot Intermountain West upper ridge and stronger/farther east with
the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley trough and heavy rainfall focus.
However, the 00 UTC Canadian has shifted more in line with the
rest of guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest this weekend and the heat wave will expand over the West
into next week. Temperatures will soar to 20-30 degrees above
normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great Basin/Rockies.
Numerous daily to some monthly records are likely from the Pacific
Northwest and interior California to the north/central Great Basin
and Northern Rockies, with temperatures peaking over 100F to 110+F
for interior sections of the West. Little rainfall is expected to
ease this excessive heat this forecast period in a pattern with
growing drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a robust upper trough will dig and settle into the
north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and slow
moving front to stretch from the south-central to northeastern
U.S. this period. This will invite deep moisture return and
pooling. Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the
front with an elongated and focused zone from the Southern
Rockies/Plains northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio
Valley and the Northeast. Episodes of cell training and flooding
are likely across some of these areas with overall progression
slowed as broadly sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a
strong western Atlantic ridge to the east. Also, there is also
some signal for tropical moisture to feed into southern Florida to
fuel convection early-mid next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu June 24 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 30 - JUL 04, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical model solutions forecast an amplified circulation
pattern with a trough and negative 500-hPa height anomalies over the North
Pacific, centered over the Aleutians, and a ridge and positive 500-hPa height
anomalies over the eastern North Pacific and western North America.
Downstream,
a trough is predicted over the east-central CONUS, and positive 500-hPa height
anomalies are predicted over the Northeast. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean is
slightly more amplified than the GEFS and Canadian models.

Near to below normal temperatures are favored over much of western and central
Mainland Alaska, due to the predicted trough over the Aleutians and associated
potential storm system development and increased cloud cover. Predicted
southwesterly flow favors above normal temperatures for parts of eastern
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle. A predicted trough over the east-central
CONUS and near zero 500-hPa height anomalies favor enhanced probabilities of
below normal temperatures for eastern areas of the Southwest, the Central and
Southern Plains, most of the Mississippi Valley, and the Southeast. Above
normal temperatures are likely over the western CONUS, the Northern Plains,
and
the Northeast, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies and consistent with the
ERF consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the Aleutians and anomalous southerly flow enhance
probabilities of above normal precipitation over the eastern Aleutians,
southwestern Mainland Alaska, and along the south coast. Below normal
precipitation is favored for eastern interior areas of Mainland Alaska and the
Alaska Panhandle, under a predicted ridge. A predicted ridge and anomalous
northerly flow increase probabilities of below normal precipitation for the
Pacific Northwest, the Northern Plains, and the western Great Lakes region. A
predicted trough over the east-central CONUS and anomalous southerly surface
flow around high pressure over the Atlantic favor above normal precipitation
from the Southern Plains northeastward across most of the eastern CONUS,
excluding the Florida Peninsula, consistent with the ERF consolidation
forecast
tool. An enhanced southwestern monsoon and associated above normal
precipitation are favored for much of the Southwest, supported by dynamical
model forecasts. The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means are in agreement on a
robust
monsoon precipitation signal, resulting in probabilities exceeding 60 percent
for above normal precipitation in some areas.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to good agreement among the model circulation forecasts, and among the
temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 02 - 08 2021

During the week 2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist but somewhat deamplify, as ensemble spread and uncertainty
increase.
In particular the trough over the Aleutians deamplifies and shifts
northeastward to be centered over the Bering Sea during the week 2 period.

Below normal temperatures are favored for a larger area of southwestern
Mainland Alaska, associated with the trough over the Bering Sea and potential
development of storm systems leading to increased cloud cover. Above normal
temperatures remain likely for the southern Alaska Panhandle, as well as the
western CONUS, the Northern Plains, northern areas of the Great Lakes region,
and the Northeast, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
temperatures are favored over most of the remainder of the CONUS, from eastern
areas of the Southwest monsoon region across the Southern Plains and Central
and Lower Mississippi Valley into the Southeast region, under the predicted
trough and near zero 500-hPa height anomalies. Above normal temperatures are
favored for the southern Florida Peninsula, supported by dynamical model
forecasts.

Probabilities of above normal precipitation are enhanced over southwestern
Mainland Alaska due to the predicted trough over the Bering Sea. Below normal
precipitation is likely for  the southern Alaska Panhandle, the Pacific
Northwest, Northern Plains, and western Great Lakes region, associated with
the
predicted ridge over the eastern North Pacific and western North America.
Above
normal precipitation is favored from the Southern Plains and western Gulf
Coast
northeastward across much of the eastern CONUS, consistent with the ERF
consolidation tool and troughing over the east-central CONUS. The Florida
Peninsula is likely to be drier and warmer in the week 2 period relative to
the
6-10 day period. An active monsoon and associated above normal precipitation
are favored in week 2 across most of the Southwest, supported by dynamical
model forecasts. The GEFS reforecast tool predicts a stronger above normal
precipitation signal across the monsoon region in week 2 compared to the
ECMWF.
The GEFS reforecast-calibrated precipitation forecast has higher recent skill
at this time of the seasonal cycle and was given greater weight in the ERF
consolidation tool and in the precipitation outlook.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 45% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts and temperature forecast
tools, offset by increasing uncertainty and differences among the
precipitation
forecast tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Historic and Dangerous Heat Wave with monthly/all-time record
temperatures possible over the Northwest/West...
...Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Rockies/Plains to
Ohio Valley...

18Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite maintains good overall
continuity with the previous medium range WPC forecast with a
blocky upper level pattern, with a large upper high/ridge
remaining anchored in place over the northern Rockies, and another
ridge over the western Atlantic.  This leaves a quasi-stationary
trough over the central Plains and Midwest along with a frontal
boundary with multiple perturbations along with, fueling rounds of
MCS activity that will likely produce episodes of heavy rain from
western Texas to the Ohio Valley.  There was a slight downward
trend in magnitude of rainfall across the Midwest and Ohio Valley,
whilst higher totals are favored across portions of northern Texas
and into Oklahoma.  The historic heatwave over the northwestern
U.S. will likely challenge some monthly June records and
potentially all-time record highs!  The most impressive readings
should be across interior portions of Oregon and Washington with
some 110s possible for the lower elevations of the Columbia River
Basin.  The previous discussion is appended below. /Hamrick

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean,
12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF/ECENS means and the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models in an overall pattern with above average predictability
days 3-5 (Sunday-Tuesday). Shifted blend focus toward the still
compatible ensemble means by days 6/7 amid gradually increasing
forecast spread. Recent Canadian had been quicker to suppress the
hot Intermountain West upper ridge and stronger/farther east with
the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley trough and heavy rainfall focus.
However, the 00 UTC Canadian has shifted more in line with the
rest of guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest this weekend and the heat wave will expand over the West
into next week. Temperatures will soar to 20-30 degrees above
normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great Basin/Rockies.
Numerous daily to some monthly records are likely from the Pacific
Northwest and interior California to the north/central Great Basin
and Northern Rockies, with temperatures peaking over 100F to 110+F
for interior sections of the West. Little rainfall is expected to
ease this excessive heat this forecast period in a pattern with
growing drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a robust upper trough will dig and settle into the
north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and slow
moving front to stretch from the south-central to northeastern
U.S. this period. This will invite deep moisture return and
pooling. Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the
front with an elongated and focused zone from the Southern
Rockies/Plains northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio
Valley and the Northeast. Episodes of cell training and flooding
are likely across some of these areas with overall progression
slowed as broadly sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a
strong western Atlantic ridge to the east. Also, there is also
some signal for tropical moisture to feed into southern Florida to
fuel convection early-mid next week.

...Dangerous, record breaking heat likely over the Pacific
Northwest beginning this weekend...

...Heavy rain and severe weather to impact the Central Plains and
Midwest through the weekend...

...Minor fire weather concerns in the Great Basin today...

On the heels of historic heat in the Southwest U.S., additional
record breaking hot weather is forecast over the Pacific Northwest
into the Sacramento Valley beginning this weekend, before
spreading east by midweek beneath a strong dome of high pressure
aloft. Forecast high-temperatures on Saturday in cities such as
Portland and Seattle will approach 110 degrees, which would break
previously held all time high-temperature records for these
locations. By Sunday, the extreme heat is forecast to drift east
toward Idaho and Montana, with some locations potentially hitting
highs of 110 degrees. Moreover, little relief is expected from the
heat at night as low temperatures will remain in the mid-low 70's
through early next week. Excessive Heat watches and warnings
blanket the region through Wednesday; residents are advised to
limit outdoor activity, drink plenty of fluids, and stay in an air
conditioned room if possible.

Further south in the Great Basin and Northern California today,
dry thunderstorms with isolated lightning strikes are possible
overlapping areas with dry fuels. Red Flag warnings are in effect
through this evening, but by tomorrow fire weather conditions are
expected to abate.

Over the Central U.S., a slow moving cold front is expected to
stall overnight through Friday before pushing South this weekend.
The front will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms over the
Upper Midwest through Saturday. A Moderate Risk of Excessive
Rainfall remains in effect today and tomorrow for portions of
Northeast Kansas and Central Missouri. The associated heavy rain
will create numerous areas of flash flooding, many streams may
flood, potentially affecting larger rivers through Sunday morning.
By early Saturday, the flash flood threat shifts southward into
the Southern Plains and Great Lakes, where a Slight Risk remains
in effect. An Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms overlaps much
of a similar area in Kansas and Missouri today, while also
extending into Illinois and Minnesota. All modes of severe weather
are possible today, including tornadoes, wind and hail. A Slight
Risk of severe weather remains in the Central U.S while extending
into the Southern Plains and Central Illinois for all modes of
severe. A Marginal Risk of severe weather extends along the cold
front Sunday morning from the Southern Plains into the Upper
Midwest.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CDT Fri Jun 25 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
An amplified upper ridge will build along the West Coast today,
bringing extremely warm conditions to much of the West. To the east,
a weak trough will transit the Rockies and central High Plains.
Lingering moisture will support shower and thunderstorm activity
across the Great Basin, while locally elevated fire weather
conditions develop across New Mexico.

...Eastern New Mexico...
A belt of stronger mid-level westerlies near the base of the central
Rockies trough will overspread New Mexico and far west Texas through
the day. Momentum transfer to the surface from deep vertical mixing
will bolster surface winds to 15-20 mph. Warm temperatures in the
90s F will support widespread surface relative humidity values below
15%. Fuels across the area are not overly dry, suggesting only
locally elevated/critical fire weather conditions may develop across
portions of eastern New Mexico.

...Great Basin...
Similar to the last several days, diurnal thunderstorm activity is
expected across much of the Southwest and Great Basin. PWAT values
near 0.75 inches and slow storm speeds will favor wet storms with
limited potential for dry strikes. However, fuels in the region
remain volatile, and any lightning may result in ignitions. As such,
a few dry strikes appear possible. However, the coverage of dry
thunder will likely be below the threshold needed for an isolated
dry thunder delineation.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Fri Jun 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong blocking ridge will envelop the West Coast to start the
weekend, bringing record hot and dry conditions to much of the West.
The hot, dry, and unstable environment will support plume-dominated
fire conditions where recent lightning activity has occurred.
Mid-level troughing across the center of the country will support
widespread precipitation, limiting the potential for widespread
critical fire weather activity.

...Northern West Coast...
Beneath a 594 dm ridge, surface temperatures will soar to near
record values from the Pacific Northwest to northern California.
Daytime highs in excess of 100F will be common, supporting very dry
and unstable conditions across much of the West. Plume-dominated
fire activity appears likely given unstable surface conditions and a
deep and well mixed boundary layer. A thermally induced surface
pressure trough may also enhance surface winds to near 15 mph,
supporting locally elevated/critical fire weather conditions through
the forecast period.

...Historic and Dangerous Heat Wave with monthly/all-time record
temperatures possible over the Northwest/West...

Ohio Valley...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensemble continue to advertise a highly anomalous upper
ridge to reach peak intensity over the Pacific Northwest early
next week while a compact upper low in the Pacific is forecast to
move toward the northern coast of California.  The ECMWF and the
CMC are similar in terms of keeping the compact upper low closer
to the coast and slower to lift northward than the GFS and GEFS
solutions.  The proximity of this upper low would appear to keep
the heat in the central California valleys at bay as in the ECMWF
and CMC solutions.  All models agree that the upper ridge will
then gradually weaken toward the latter half of next week as the
compact upper low lifts northward and edges into the Pacific
Northwest.

Meanwhile, global models continue to indicate a broad upper ridge
will remain the dominating synoptic feature over the eastern U.S.
well into next week while a positively-tilted trough drifts across
the northern Plains into the Great Lakes.  A broad and persistent
southerly flow will direct tropical moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico northward through the Deep South and interact with a
slow-moving frontal boundary across the mid-section of the
country.  This will increase the chance for  heavy rain to develop
from the southern Plains to the Ohio Valley through much of next
week.  In addition, models show some signal for a tropical
wave/low to move westward from south of Bermuda to reach the
southeast U.S. coast during the early part of next week.

The WPC medium range product suite was derived from a composite of
best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 12 UTC
ECMWF/ECENS means and the 12 UTC CMC/CMC mean in an overall
pattern with above average predictability days 3-5
(Monday-Wednesday), followed by shifting blend focus toward the
still compatible ensemble means by days 6/7 amid gradually
increasing forecast spread.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge is forecast to reach peak intensity
over the Northwest early next week before showing signs of
weakening later next week.  Temperatures will soar to 20-30
degrees above normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great
Basin/Rockies.  Numerous daily to some monthly records are likely
to be tied or broken from the Pacific Northwest and interior
California to the north/central Great Basin and northern Rockies,
where temperatures peaking over 100F to 110+F are forecast for the
lower elevations.  Little rainfall is expected to ease this
excessive heat in a pattern with growing drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough will dig and settle
into the north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and
slow moving front to stretch from the south-central to
northeastern U.S. through the medium-range period.  This will
invite deep moisture to return from the Gulf of Mexico.  Well
organized showers and storms will significantly increase rainfall
and runoff potential along and ahead of the front with an
elongated and focused zone from the southern Rockies/Plains
northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the
Northeast.  Episodes of cell training and flooding are likely
across some of these areas with overall progression slowed by the
blocky synoptic pattern sandwiched between the heat wave out West
and a strong western Atlantic ridge to the east.  Last but not
least, tropical moisture may feed into southern Florida from the
Atlantic to fuel convection early-mid next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensemble continue to advertise a highly anomalous upper
ridge to reach peak intensity over the Pacific Northwest early
next week while a compact upper low in the Pacific is forecast to
move toward the northern coast of California.  The ECMWF and the
CMC are similar in terms of keeping the compact upper low closer
to the coast and slower to lift northward than the GFS and GEFS
solutions.  The proximity of this upper low would appear to keep
the heat in the central California valleys at bay as in the ECMWF
and CMC solutions.  All models agree that the upper ridge will
then gradually weaken toward the latter half of next week as the
compact upper low lifts northward and edges into the Pacific
Northwest.

Meanwhile, global models continue to indicate a broad upper ridge
will remain the dominating synoptic feature over the eastern U.S.
well into next week while a positively-tilted trough drifts across
the northern Plains into the Great Lakes.  A broad and persistent
southerly flow will direct tropical moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico northward through the Deep South and interact with a

the heat in the central California valleys at bay as in the ECMWF
and CMC solutions.  All models agree that the upper ridge will
then gradually weaken toward the latter half of next week as the
compact upper low lifts northward and edges into the Pacific
Northwest as an open wave.

Meanwhile, global models continue to indicate a broad upper ridge
will remain the dominating synoptic feature over the eastern U.S.
well into next week while a positively-tilted trough drifts across
the northern Plains into the Great Lakes.  A broad and persistent
southerly flow will direct tropical moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico northward through the Deep South and interact with a
slow-moving frontal boundary across the mid-section of the
country.  This will increase the chance for  heavy rain to develop
from the southern Plains to the Ohio Valley through much of next
week.  In addition, models show some signal for a tropical
wave/low to move westward from south of Bermuda to reach the
southeast U.S. coast during the early part of next week.

The WPC medium range product suite was derived from a composite of
best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 12 UTC
ECMWF/ECENS means and the 12 UTC CMC/CMC mean in an overall
pattern with above average predictability days 3-5
(Monday-Wednesday), followed by shifting blend focus toward the
still compatible ensemble means by days 6/7 amid gradually
increasing forecast spread.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge is forecast to reach peak intensity
over the Northwest early next week before showing signs of
weakening later next week.  Temperatures will soar to 20-30
degrees above normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great
Basin/Rockies.  Numerous daily to some monthly records are likely
to be tied or broken from the Pacific Northwest and interior
California to the north/central Great Basin and northern Rockies,
where temperatures peaking over 100F to 110+F are forecast for the
lower elevations.  Little rainfall is expected to ease this
excessive heat in a pattern with growing drought and fire threats.
 Meanwhile, a heat wave appears to develop and persist from the
Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic where afternoon temperatures are
forecast to peak well into the 90s away from the immediate coasts
during next week.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough will dig and settle
into the north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and
slow moving front to stretch from the south-central to
northeastern U.S. through the medium-range period.  This will
invite deep moisture to return from the Gulf of Mexico.  Well
organized showers and storms will significantly increase rainfall
and runoff potential along and ahead of the front with an
elongated and focused zone from the southern Rockies/Plains
northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the
Northeast.  Episodes of cell training and flooding are likely
across some of these areas with overall progression slowed by the
blocky synoptic pattern sandwiched between the heat wave out West
and a strong western Atlantic ridge to the east.  Last but not
least, tropical moisture may feed into southern Florida from the
Atlantic to fuel convection early-mid next week.

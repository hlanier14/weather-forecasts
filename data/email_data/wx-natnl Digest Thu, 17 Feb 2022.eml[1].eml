...Developing heavy rainfall threat across portions of the South
next week...


...Overview...

As next week begins, quasi-zonal flow across much of the U.S. will
be transitioning to a more amplified pattern as upper-level energy
spills into the West to create deep troughing, while ridging
builds in the East. The trough will slowly track eastward along
with a strong frontal system, behind which arctic high pressure
should produce well below normal temperatures in the central U.S.,
with warmer than average temperatures in the East. Light to
moderate precipitation is likely in the West underneath the trough
and spreading into the central and eastern U.S., with the
possibility of northern tier snow and southern U.S. rain and
thunderstorms. A multi-day rainy period for parts of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys could lead to flooding and flash
flooding there.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance shows fairly good agreement with the large
scale pattern through the middle of next week, though with plenty
of uncertainty in the smaller scale details, like individual
shortwaves as well as the main trough's track and timing. There
remains good agreement for a compact upper low likely west of Baja
California to begin the period Sunday and weakening as it moves
eastward, as well as good consensus on the large scale for energy
to spill into the West east of an amplified eastern Pacific ridge
by next Sunday-Monday, gradually deepening and shifting slowly
eastward. For the 12/18Z model cycle, each model suite mainly
stayed within their own camps, as shown by the spaghetti plots of
individual ensemble members and cluster analysis. For the most
part, the ECMWF suite including the deterministic, the ensemble
mean, and the bulk of ensemble members showed a slower and deeper
solution first with the small Baja upper low and more prominently
with the larger scale trough forming and broadening in the West.
The CMC and GFS suites were more progressive with these features.
These differences are most evident by Wednesday-Thursday, with one
reason for the differences in the trough track being additional
energy spilling southward near the West Coast--stronger in the GFS
runs with less phasing with the initial trough. The evolution of
upstream energy is rather uncertain stemming from high latitudes
and rounding the Pacific ridge, leading to low confidence in the
specifics of the embedded energies within the main trough and its
eventual movement. Given these differences, and considering common
model biases, the WPC forecast strove for a middle ground solution
with the pattern, not discounting the slower EC or the faster
CMC/GFS solutions but leaning in between. The incoming 00Z
deterministic ECMWF appears to have sped up somewhat compared to
the 12Z run and is fortunately somewhat in line with the WPC
forecast trough axis. The forecast blend was based on the 12/18Z
(newest available at the time) deterministic model suite through
days 3-5, phasing in and increasing the proportion of the GEFS and
EC ensemble means by the later days rather than keying on any
particular model.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Precipitation will be increasing in the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies over the weekend with the upper trough coming in.
Coastal and valley rain and mountain snow are likely over the
Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the Great Basin, and
the Rockies and persisting there into the middle of next week.
Snow could also spread farther east into the northern High Plains
Sunday and into the rest of the northern tier states as the first
half of the week progresses. The confidence in the axis of
heaviest snow and snowfall amounts remains somewhat low. Farther
south, moist inflow is forecast to return to the south-central and
southeastern U.S., with increasing chances for heavy to possibly
excessive rainfall. Models seem to be converging on portions of
the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valley states as the greatest
threat for heavy rainfall next Monday-Wednesday. Multiple rounds
of rain and storms over the same area could increase the potential
for flooding and flash flooding. There remain plenty of
uncertainty in the details which likely are going to take another
few days to resolve, but regardless, the pattern itself would
support some sort of heavy rainfall and possibly severe weather
with thunderstorms for the first half of the week.

Temperatures as next week begins are expected to be above normal
for parts of the West into the Plains, with the largest anomalies
of highs 20+ degrees above average over Nebraska. As the pattern
amplifies, the south-central U.S. to the East Coast will further
warm through the first half of next week, with widespread highs
10-20F and lows 20-30F above normal. Meanwhile, a cold Arctic high
is forecast to expand across the north-central U.S., leading to
well below average temperatures initially across the northern High
Plains and spreading southward (as far south as Texas) through
midweek. Temperatures in some places could be 30 or more degrees
below normal, and highs in the single digits to even below 0F are
expected for Montana, the Dakotas, and northern Minnesota Monday
and Tuesday with cold temperatures lingering through Wednesday and
Thursday as well.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low across the CONUS for Friday.
Widespread precipitation is expected to overspread parts of the
southern Plains into the MS River Valley and East Coast over the
next 48 hours. Additionally, a polar air mass will remain entrenched
across the north-central U.S., with surface high pressure building
across the inter-mountain West. These factors will largely limit the
fire weather potential. One region worth monitoring is southwest NE
into northwest KS where 15-20 mph winds may coincide with 25% RH
within a modest downslope flow regime. However, confidence in such
conditions is low and ongoing light snowfall may moisten fine fuels.

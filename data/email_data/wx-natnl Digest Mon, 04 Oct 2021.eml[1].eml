Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1128 AM CDT Sun Oct 03 2021

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Latest guidance consensus suggests that at least locally dry and
breezy conditions are still likely by afternoon peak heating across
terrain favoring areas of the central/northern Rockies.
Consideration was given to adding Elevated highlights across
portions of northern into central Montana. However, questions remain
regarding spatial and temporal coverage of 15+ mph sustained
westerly surface winds overlapping with near-critical to critically
low RH, precluding the addition of Elevated highlights.

..Squitieri.. 10/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1250 AM CDT Sun Oct 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge positioned over the West will amplify
throughout the day. Enhanced mid-level flow will remain largely
confined to portions of southern Canada, with far northern portions
of the northern tier of states residing on the southern periphery of
these winds. Consequently, fire-weather concerns remain low for most
areas today. Perhaps localized elevated fire-weather conditions are
possible across portions of north-central Montana, as well as
portions of south-central Wyoming, where westerly surface winds near
15 mph and RH values into the low 20s should reside amid dry and
receptive fuels.

...Southeast/Southern Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic Heavy Rain
Threat...


...Overview...

The flow pattern amplifies for the coming week as an upper low
closes off over the east-central U.S. and an upper ridge/high
builds over the northern tier states and southern Canada. A
leading front and closed upper trough/low support will spread an
enhanced rainfall threat across the eastern third of the country.
Meanwhile, an eastern Pacific upper trough should steadily amplify
and become more elongated/split through this period, pushing a
wavy cold front into the West and north-central U.S. along with
increasing chances for moderate precipitation. A leading shortwave
originating from offshore of southern California will also push
northeastward ahead of the main upper trough and produce some
midweek precipitation over the central Great Basin/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The latest suite of guidance continues to offer fairly good
agreement on the large scale, with variability in individual
features and details. The upper low across the Southeast into the
Ohio Valley is showing much better agreement than in previous days
and so a general model blend works well for this feature. Out
West, amplified troughing along the coast may split with northern
stream energy driving a cold front into the Northwest U.S. and the
central U.S., and southern stream energy dropping south and
eventually moving into the Southwest. It's with the detail of
additional energy rotating around the larger scale trough and into
the southern stream feature that models struggle, especially the
second half of the period. The ensemble means at this point seem
to offer a reasonable and more agreeable starting point.

The WPC forecast was based on a blend of the deterministic
guidance for days 3-5, with increasing contributions from the
ensemble means (blended with the GFS and ECMWF) to help smooth out
the details by day 6 and 7. This approach maintains good
continuity with the previous shift.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany a
frontal system as it slows across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic this
week, with enhanced focus as a closed upper low rotates over the
region. This should keep rainfall over parts of the Southeast/East
for several days, with a gradual focus from the Southeast into the
Mid-Atlantic. Guidance continues to signal that some locations
could see some significant local totals, whether from an episode
of heavy rain and/or a multi-day accumulation due to persistence
of the pattern. Guidance variability and spread up to this point
keep confidence in specifics fairly low, but one area to monitor
for a threat of runoff issues will be the Southern Appalachians
where terrain enhancement will also be a factor. Lighter precip
should also eventually work its way into the Great Lakes and the
Northeast next weekend.

Northeastward ejection of a lead upper trough is expected to
generate modest precipitation into midweek for the central Great
Basin/Rockies. A subsequent and wavy cold front digging slowly but
robustly into the West will spread areas of rain gradually
southeastward mid-later week and into the weekend, eventually
working into the north-central states. Most activity should be in
the light-moderate range, along with some snow at higher
elevations. The West should trend cooler with time as the upper
trough approaches and the cold front makes its way through the
region. Daytime highs by later next week could be 5-15 degrees
below normal for some locations. Downstream upper ridging
traversing the north-central U.S. will support warmer than average
temperatures across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week
with some plus 10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper
70s and 80s. Above normal temps should also expand into the
southern Plains and Midwest by the weekend. Persistence of clouds
and areas of rain with the emerging closed upper low/trough and
lead frontal system over the Southeast/East should keep daytime
temperatures near normal, but also maintain decent coverage of
plus 10F and greater anomalies for morning lows.

The latest suite of guidance continues to offer fairly good
agreement on the large scale, with variability in individual
features and details. The upper low across the Southeast into the
Ohio Valley is showing much better agreement than in previous days
and so a general model blend works well for this feature. Out
West, amplified troughing along the coast may split with northern
stream energy driving a cold front into the Northwest U.S. and the
central U.S., and southern stream energy dropping south and
eventually moving into the Southwest. It's with the detail of
additional energy rotating around the larger scale trough and into
the southern stream feature that models struggle, especially the
second half of the period. The ensemble means at this point seem
to offer a reasonable and more agreeable starting point.

The WPC forecast was based on a blend of the deterministic
guidance for days 3-5, with increasing contributions from the
ensemble means (blended with the GFS and ECMWF) to help smooth out
the details by day 6 and 7. This approach maintains good
continuity with the previous shift.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany a
frontal system as it slows across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic this
week, with enhanced focus as a closed upper low rotates over the
region. This should keep rainfall over parts of the Southeast/East
for several days, with a gradual focus from the Southeast into the
Mid-Atlantic. Guidance continues to signal that some locations
could see some significant local totals, whether from an episode
of heavy rain and/or a multi-day accumulation due to persistence
of the pattern. Guidance variability and spread up to this point
keep confidence in specifics fairly low, but one area to monitor
for a threat of runoff issues will be the Southern Appalachians
where terrain enhancement will also be a factor. Lighter precip
should also eventually work its way into the Great Lakes and the
Northeast next weekend.

Northeastward ejection of a lead upper trough is expected to
generate modest precipitation into midweek for the central Great
Basin/Rockies. A subsequent and wavy cold front digging slowly but
robustly into the West will spread areas of rain gradually
southeastward mid-later week and into the weekend, eventually
working into the north-central states. Most activity should be in
the light-moderate range, along with some snow at higher
elevations. The West should trend cooler with time as the upper
trough approaches and the cold front makes its way through the
region. Daytime highs by later next week could be 5-15 degrees
below normal for some locations. Downstream upper ridging
traversing the north-central U.S. will support warmer than average
temperatures across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week
with some plus 10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper
70s and 80s. Above normal temps should also expand into the
southern Plains and Midwest by the weekend. Persistence of clouds
and areas of rain with the emerging closed upper low/trough and
lead frontal system over the Southeast/East should keep daytime
temperatures near normal, but also maintain decent coverage of
plus 10F and greater anomalies for morning lows.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun October 03 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0236 PM CDT Sun Oct 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

An Elevated area has been added to portions of the northern Great
Basin as the latest high-resolution model guidance consensus has
depicted more widespread 15 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds overlapping 15-20% RH. Fuels across this region remain at
least modestly receptive to fire spread, and forecast ERCs are
expected to be within the 80-95% range by tomorrow afternoon,
warranting the addition of Elevated highlights.

The Elevated area across the northern High Plains has been expanded
both north and south, as a more widespread region of 15+ mph
sustained southerly surface flow is expected to develop by afternoon
peak heating. Questions remain if Elevated surface winds/RH can
overlap for periods exceeding 3 hours given the overall expected
weak surface wind field. Nonetheless, fuels are at least critically
dry across portions of the northern High Plains, serving as the
primary motivating factor for the expansion of fire weather
highlights in this region.

..Squitieri.. 10/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CDT Sun Oct 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will enter portions of the Pacific Northwest, and
a closed upper-level low is forecast to enter portions of Southern
California. These features will setup broad troughing across the
West and northern Rockies, with a highly amplifying/elongating ridge
overspreading much of the central/northern Plains. In addition, a
mid-level short-wave trough should propagate through portions of the
northern Rockies amid modestly enhanced flow.

...Eastern Montana and Northeast Wyoming...
Light southerly return flow should develop at the surface across
eastern Montana, northeast Wyoming, and vicinity, where sustained
winds should approach 15 mph during the afternoon. Meanwhile, strong
insolation/surface heating should lead to large dew point
depressions and RH values falling into the teens (with isolated
single digits). Given these conditions, a small area delineating
potential for elevated fire-weather conditions has been introduced
for the region, confined to the most likely overlap of conducive
winds/RH/fuels.

...Northern Great Basin...
Localized elevated fire-weather conditions are possible across
portions of southern Idaho, northern Nevada, and southeast Oregon.
Surface winds may approach 15 mph during the afternoon amid warm/dry
conditions (RH values into the teens) and fuels that appear at least
marginally receptive to large-fire spread.

...Unsettled weather is moving into the eastern U.S. with a wet
pattern setting up for the interior Southeast...

...Moisture will move into the Desert Southwest as well as the
Pacific Northwest coast Monday night into Tuesday...

...Air Quality Alerts over the San Joaquin Valley through Monday...

A slow-moving weather pattern is in store for much of the eastern
U.S. where unsettled weather is forecast to linger as we head into
the new week.  A cold front currently extending along the length
of the Mississippi Valley down into Texas will move rather slowly
eastward before stalling across the Ohio Valley and down into the
central Gulf Coast by about Tuesday.  Scattered showers and
thunderstorms can be expected across a wide area ahead of this
front for the next few days.  Although widespread heavy rainfall
is not expected, some embedded heavy downpours are forecast to
accompany some of the stronger thunderstorm clusters.  The
rain/storms will stay mainly between the Mississippi Valley and
the Appalachians through tonight; but they will begin to edge into
the Appalachians on Monday before moving into the East Coast by
Tuesday.   The southern half of New England will see a steady rain
developing into this evening behind a back door cold front.  The
rain is forecast to expand and become heavier on Monday as a low
pressure wave track along the front to the south.  A drying
trending is expected on Tuesday for much of New England as a high
pressure system builds southward from eastern Canada.

Meanwhile, the threat of heavy rainfall will increase later on
Tuesday across the interior section of the Southeast and the
frontal boundary becomes stationary and moisture from the eastern
Gulf of Mexico continues to stream onshore, with a slight  risk of
excessive rainfall in the forecast.

Over the Desert Southwest, moisture is forecast to increase Monday
night into Tuesday as an upper-level low pushes onshore across
southern California.  The moisture will result in showers and
thunderstorms over parts of Southern California and the Southwest
overnight Monday into Tuesday.

Furthermore, the smoke from wildfires will lead to poor air
quality over the San Joaquin Valley of California, where Air
Quality Alerts are in effect through Monday.  Additionally, an
upper-level ridge will develop over parts of the Rockies as
temperatures will become 10 to 20 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern High Plains.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1227 AM CDT Mon Oct 04 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will enter portions of the Pacific Northwest,
allowing broad southwesterly mid-level flow to overspread adjacent
areas of the northern Great Basin, northern Rockies, and northern
High Plains. Despite somewhat marginal flow aloft, afternoon
heating/mixing should allow for enough vertical momentum transfer to
produce wind/RH combos sufficient for elevated fire-weather concerns
across portions of the aforementioned regions.

...Northern High Plains...
Southerly winds approaching sustained values of 15 mph should
develop by mid afternoon over the region. Meanwhile, temperatures
should warm into the 80s F while dew point temperatures remain in
the 20s F, allowing for large dew point depressions and RH values
into the teens and single digits. This will result in elevated
fire-weather conditions amid fuels which remain receptive to
large-fire spread.

...Northern Great Basin...
Southwesterly sustained winds near 15 mph should develop during the
afternoon while RH values fall into the 10%-20% range. Fuels remain
critically dry across the region. Thus, elevated fire-weather
highlights have been maintained, with a small expansion into
portions of central Oregon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1228 AM CDT Mon Oct 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will continue to move onshore and overspread
portions of the Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, a closed upper-level
low over Southern California will lift northeast and merge with the
aforementioned trough over portions of the central Rockies. A broad
zone of moderate to modest mid-level southwesterly flow will be
present over much of the West.

...Northern High Plains...
Conditions will be similar to those forecast on D1/Monday, albeit
with southwesterly oriented surface winds. Warm/dry conditions will
prevail, and sustained winds approaching 15 mph developing for a few
hours during the afternoon, resulting in elevated fire-weather
conditions.

...Pacific Northwest...
With the approaching trough, enhanced southwesterly mid-level flow
near 50-60 kt will overspread the region. This will help foster
sustained surface winds near 20 mph across the region, while RH
values fall into the low 20s, during the afternoon. Critically dry
fuels remain present across the region, supporting the introduction
of an elevated fire-weather designation.

...Southeast/Southern Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic Heavy Rain
Threat...


...Overview...

Guidance overall agrees that the upper flow amplifies this week as
an upper low closes off over the east-central U.S. and an upper
ridge builds over the north-central states and southern Canada. A
leading front and upper support will spread an enhanced rainfall
threat across the eastern third of the country. Meanwhile, an
eastern Pacific upper trough will amplify and become more
elongated/split and work inland through this period, pushing a
wavy cold front over the West and across the Rockies into the
north-central U.S. along with moderate precipitation chances.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance continues to offer fairly good agreement on the large
scale, bolstering forecast confidence, albeit with continued
variability in individual features and details. There is improving
forecast clustering with the difficult upper low meadering over
the east-central U.S. into later this week and out West, amplified
troughing along the coast splits with northern stream energy
driving a cold front over the Northwest/West then central U.S. as
southern stream energy energy ejects over the Southwest and over
the southern Rockies to the Southern Plains late period.

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a
composite blend of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, the 12 UTC
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean/Canadian and the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models. This maintains max WPC continuity. Latest and
compatible 00 UTC models and ensembles overall remain in line with
the aforementioned composite blend.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany a
frontal system as it slows across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic this
week, with enhanced focus as a closed upper low rotates over the
region. This should keep rainfall over parts of the Southeast/East
for several days, with a gradual focus from the Southeast into the
Mid-Atlantic. Guidance continues to signal that some locations
could see some heavier local totals, whether from an episode of
heavy rain and/or a multi-day accumulation due to persistence of
the pattern. One area to monitor for a threat of runoff issues in
particular will be the Southern Appalachians where terrain
enhancement will also be a factor. Lighter precip should also
eventually work its way into the Great Lakes and the Northeast by
the weekend.

A wavy cold front digging slowly but robustly across the West will
spread areas of rain gradually southeastward mid-later week and
the weekend, eventually working across the Rockies into the
north-central states. Most activity should be in the
light-moderate range, along with snow at higher elevations. The
West should trend cooler with time as the upper trough approaches
and the cold front makes its way through the region. Daytime highs
by later next week could be 5-15 degrees below normal for some
locations. Downstream upper ridging traversing the north-central
U.S. will support warmer than average temperatures across the
Northern Plains and vicinity next week with some plus 10-20F
anomalies that equate to highs in the upper 70s and 80s.
Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the emerging closed
upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the Southeast/East
should keep daytime temperatures near normal, but also maintain
decent coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies for morning
lows.

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Lower Great Lake into parts of the Northeast and from the
Central Gulf Coast to the Southeast/Southern Appalachians through
Tuesday morning...

...Air Quality Alerts over the San Joaquin Valley through Monday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern/Central High Plains...

A quasi-stationary front extending from the Northeast to the Great
Lakes then southwestward to the Lower Mississippi Valley will
remain primarily stationary as a low develops over parts of the
Lower Mississippi Valley by Wednesday.  Moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico will stream northward over the Central Gulf Coast to the
Great Lakes and Northeast.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop
along and near the boundary. Some storms produce heavy rain from
the Central Gulf Coast to the Southeast/Southern Appalachians and
over Lower Great Lakes into the Northeast.  Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Lower Great Lake into parts of the Northeast and from the Central
Gulf Coast to the Southeast/Southern Appalachians through Tuesday
morning.  The associated heavy rain will create localized areas of
flash flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with
heavy rain.   The threat of excessive rainfall will increase to a
Slight Risk over the Central Gulf Coast, Southeast, and Southern
Appalachians on Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Rain will continue
over the Northeast through Tuesday evening. The showers and
thunderstorms will slowly expand into parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast on Monday.

Meanwhile, moisture will stream into Southern California and the
Southwest as upper-level energy begins to move over Southern
California.  The moisture and energy will produce showers and
thunderstorms over parts of Southern California and the Southwest
overnight Monday into Tuesday. Additionally, a front will move
into Pacific Northwest on Tuesday, producing light rain over parts
of the Northwest into Northern California

Furthermore, the smoke from wildfires will lead to poor air
quality over the San Joaquin Valley of California, where Air
Quality Alerts are in effect through Monday.  Additionally, an
upper-level ridge will develop over parts of the Rockies as
temperatures will become 10 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern/Central High Plains.

issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast.  The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through
Tuesday morning.

The threat of excessive rainfall will continue, however increasing
in areal coverage over the Central Gulf Coast, Southeast, and
Southern Appalachians on Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Rain will
continue over the Northeast through Tuesday evening. The showers
and thunderstorms will slowly expand into parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast today.

Meanwhile, moisture will stream into Southern California and the

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Fri May 06 2022

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments. The
Elevated area across portions of the southern Great Basin was
expanded slightly northward to where higher confidence in sustained
15 mph surface winds and lower surface RH exists. Otherwise, see the
prior discussions for additional information.

..Lyons.. 05/06/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Fri May 06 2022/

...Synopsis...
Stronger mid-level flow will gradually overspread the Rockies today
as a mid-level trough amplifies across the Interior West. Gradient
winds from a surface lee trough across the northern Rockies, along
with downslope flow across the Southwest, will promote dry and
breezy conditions supporting modest potential for wildfire spread.

...Northern Rockies...
Gradient surface flow will increase through the afternoon,
particularly across northern Montana, where a well-mixed boundary
layer will support RH at or just below 25 percent amid 20-30 mph
sustained westerly surface winds. Some of the latest forecast fuel
guidance suggests that regional ERCs may approach the 90th
percentile in spots. The dry and windy conditions atop fuels
receptive to fire spread warrant the introduction of Elevated
highlights this outlook. While precipitation is expected later in
the evening, an isolated thunderstorm could develop during the
afternoon. Any lightning strikes that occur away from storm cores,
in windy conditions, and within a drier fuel bed may easily support
wildfire ignitions.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Downslope flow amid a well-mixed boundary layer will encourage
patches of 15 mph sustained west-northwesterly surface winds across
portions of the Southwest. While the overall surface wind field is
expected to marginally support wildfire spread, RH is expected to
drop into the single digits on a near widespread basis, and where
fuels are critically dry. As such, an Elevated area was introduced
where surface winds will most likely exceed 15 mph on a more
frequent basis.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 06 2022

SYNOPSIS: Anomalous heat is forecast to persist over the south-central U.S.
during mid-May and could eventually affect the Southwest later in week-2. O=
n
May 14 and 15, a low pressure system and trailing cold front are forecast t=
o
progress eastward across the central U.S. A low pressure system is expected=
 to
linger near the East Coast through next week. A strong area of mid-level lo=
w
pressure favors below-normal temperatures and also increases the chances of
late season snowfall across Mainland Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat expanding westward from the western Gulf Coas=
t
to
the southern Great Plains and Rio Grande Valley, Sat-Fri, May 14-20.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the northern Great Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley, Sat-Sun, May 14-15.

Slight risk of high winds for the Great Plains and parts of the Southwest,
Sat-Sun, May 14-15.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast,
Sat-Sun, May 14-15.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the coastal Mid-Atlantic and Southea=
st,
Sat-Sun, May 14-15.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible for parts of central and eastern Mainland Alaska.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MAY 09 - FRIDAY MAY 13:

FOR SATURDAY MAY 14 - FRIDAY MAY 20: An early season heatwave, affecting th=
e
south-central U.S., is forecast to peak prior to week-2. However, according=
 to
the National Blend of Models, daily record highs (well into the 90s) could
persist across central and eastern Texas through at least May 15. Later in
week-2, ensemble means depict the 500-hPa ridge axis becoming centered acro=
ss
the high Plains which would focus the most anomalous heat across western Te=
xas
and eastern New Mexico. Due to uncertainty on timing within week-2, a broad
area of the south-central CONUS is highlighted with a slight risk of excess=
ive
heat. Although heat index values or maximum temperatures may not meet crite=
ria
for heat advisories, this heat hazard is included due to how anomalous this
heat is likely to be for mid-May. Based on the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools,
there is more than a 20 percent chance of maximum temperatures exceeding 95
degrees F across most of the hazard area. These above-normal temperatures a=
re
likely to intensify drought conditions across the southern Great Plains.
Multiple large wildfires are burning throughout New Mexico and the return o=
f
above-normal temperatures is likely to maintain elevated wildfire danger. A=
s
of
May 6, the Calf Canyon fire, east of Santa Fe, has burned 168,000 acres mak=
ing
it the 2nd largest wildfire on record for New Mexico.



A 500-hPa trough is forecast to progress eastward from the western to the
central late in week-1 to the beginning of week-2. Due to the expansive and
anomalous 500-hPa ridging downstream, the resultant storm track is likely t=
o
be
shifted north from its climatological position for mid-May. Therefore, the
most
likely area for thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall is expected to be
focused across the northern Great Plains east to the upper Mississippi Vall=
ey.
The 500-hPa trough and predicted surface low development supports a slight
risk
of high winds across parts of the Southwest and Great Plains. Blowing dust =
may
accompany the gusty winds over the high Plains due to the ongoing drought.



Model solutions remain in good agreement and consistent that a mid-level
trough
separates from the westerlies and becomes a cut-off low near the East Coast
next week. Colder temperatures aloft, associated with this cut-off low, may
promote diurnal convection with locally heavy rain across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. In addition, upslope flow may enhance rainfall
amounts across the Central to Southern Appalachians. Therefore, a slight ri=
sk
of heavy precipitation (May 14-15) is posted for parts of the eastern U.S. =
A
slight risk of high winds is also designated for the coastal Mid-Atlantic a=
nd
Southeast due to persistent, onshore flow continuing through early week-2. =
The
multi-day enhanced onshore winds increase the chances of large swells, beac=
h
erosion, and coastal flooding for the coastal Carolinas.



Flooding may persist throughout week-2 in the Red River Valley of the North=
,
and extend into part of the James River basin, due to recent snowmelt and
heavy
precipitation. Despite cooler-than-normal temperatures likely slowing the r=
ate
of snowmelt during week-2, the flooding possible hazard is maintained for
Alaska. Although the 500-hPa pattern continues to favor late season snowfal=
l
for parts of Mainland Alaska, uncertainty on the most likely location
precludes
inclusion of a heavy snow hazard.

...Blocky pattern next week to support record heat over the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest along
with episodes of north-central U.S. convection and northern Great
Basin/Rockies snow...

...Overview...

The first part of the week will feature a pattern close to an
Omega-style block, with an amplified western mean trough, a strong
ridge extending from Mexico into southeastern Canada, and an upper
low just off the East Coast. With time the central/southern part
of the ridge should weaken while the northern part may ultimately
connect with a retrograding Atlantic ridge that should push the
upper low toward the Southeast coast. Within the western trough, a
leading shortwave will eject from the northern High Plains and
then upstream energy should sharpen into midweek before ejecting
northeastward (possibly leading to strong low pressure). Another
system may reach the Northwest late in the week.  This pattern
will lead to very warm to hot weather over the
central/east-central U.S., chilly and unsettled weather over the
West, and periods of rain/thunderstorms between these two regimes.
The retrograding upper low may also bring some moisture into the
East late in the week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

In general, the guidance continues to show good agreement on the
large scale pattern, but with some variance for the details and
timing, especially the second half of the period. The most
significant forecast uncertainty during the period continues to
involve details of the western U.S. mean trough specifically how
energy that sharpens into midweek ejects out of the West in
response to an upstream northeastern Pacific system that may
contain a fairly deep closed low. Guidance is trending better with
the deep closed low, but continue to vary significantly with the
leading ejecting shortwave out of the Rockies. The latest runs of
the GFS and CMC (including todays new 12z run) are much faster
than the ECMWF with that shortwave/surface low. Latest ensembles
support something more in the middle (slower than the GFS/faster
than the EC). In the East, guidance shows some variance with
placement of a retrograding closed low near the Southeast late in
the week, but differences are well within the normal realm for
uncertainties given the time frame and seem to be handled well
with an ensemble mean blend.

The WPC forecast for today used a general model blend for days 3-5
amidst above average agreement. For 6-7, the forecast trended
quickly towards the ensemble means (with smaller parts GFS/ECMWF)
which gave a decent starting point, with some added manual
adjustments to the ejecting West shortwave. This approach fit well
with previous WPC continuity as well.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Strong upper ridging will lead to persistent much above normal
temperatures over the central-southern Plains and most of the
Mississippi Valley through the week, with some of this warmth
gradually expanding through the Great Lakes and Northeast as well.
Expect a broad area of highs/morning lows 10-20F above normal with
some localized areas reaching higher than that. Numerous daily
records are likely through the week over the southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley, and may also extend into the central
Plains/Midwest around Tuesday/Wednesday. Highest heat index values
will be over southern Texas early in the week but the combination
of heat and humidity may still produce maximum heat index values
over 100F at some southern locations into late week. Excessive
heat, gusty winds, and dry conditions should lead to an elevated
fire weather threat across parts of the southern High Plains
through at least mid-week.

In contrast, the West will see unseasonably cool and unsettled
conditions next week. Coldest anomalies should be early in the
week when highs will likely be 10-20F or so below normal. Best
potential for some daily records for cold highs will be on Monday.
Temperatures may approach normal over southern areas by next
Friday but locations farther north should remain at least
moderately below normal. Periods of rain and higher elevation snow
will tend to be light to moderate, but there could be a period of
enhanced activity along and inland from the West Coast late in the
week depending on details of an arriving northeastern Pacific
system.

Between these two regimes, the central U.S. will see periods of
rain and thunderstorms as ejecting western shortwaves produce
multiple lows, along with a Rockies to Upper Midwest front that
ultimately stalls and then lifts northward ahead of another system
that brings a cold front into the Plains late in the week.
Deceleration of the leading front and then the late week system
may produce areas of significant rainfall that would be a runoff
threat over northern tier areas that already have very wet soil.
The Storm Prediction Center highlights a concern for severe
weather over parts of the northeastern Plains/Upper Midwest early
in the week, while the late-week system could merit watching for
strong convection as well.

Most rainfall with the system off the East Coast should stay just
offshore early in the week, but is likely to expand back to the
west late in the week as the vertically stacked low retrogrades
back toward the Southeast coast.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri May 06 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 12 - 16 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs dynamical model solutions remain in good =
agreement in predicting an
amplified 500-hPa height pattern across North America at the start of the 6=
-10
day period, with troughing (ridging) predicted over the western (eastern)
CONUS. These features are forecast to weaken considerably by the end of the
period, with a more progressive flow pattern emerging across the CONUS by
day-10. The high amplitude ridge in the East is forecast to result in a cut=
-
off
mid-level low retrograding off the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast coasts early =
in
the period, favoring near to slightly below normal heights over those areas
for
the period as a whole, and keeping the highest positive height anomalies ov=
er
the Northeast and Great Lakes. Models are in good agreement in maintaining
mean
troughing over western Canada and eastern Alaska, ahead of a strong ridge
forecast over the Aleutians. Generally, above normal mid-level heights are
forecast over southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, with near to
below normal heights favored across northern and eastern portions of the
Mainland and the Panhandle.

Summer-like temperatures are forecast for much of the central and eastern
CONUS
as anomalous ridging expands over the region, with many areas likely to hav=
e
daytime high temperatures at least 10 deg F above normal during the period.
Increased probabilities of above normal temperatures are indicated across m=
uch
of the CONUS east of the Rockies, with the highest probabilities (>80 perce=
nt)
indicated over parts of the Upper Midwest and Northeast. The National Blend=
 of
Models indicates the potential for record high temperatures (above 90 deg F=
)
across portions of the Central and Southern Plains and Middle and Lower
Mississippi Valley, and also over parts of New England where high temperatu=
res
may top 80 deg F. Anomalous onshore flow along with the potential for
increased
cloud cover and precipitation, associated with a retrograding cut-off low,
favor increased chances for near to below normal temperatures along the
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast coasts, including the Florida Peninsula. Increas=
ed
probabilities of below normal temperatures are forecast across most of the
western CONUS due to predicted initial troughing over the region, with some
moderation likely later in the period as this troughing lifts out, especial=
ly
over the Southwest and California. Below normal temperature probabilities a=
re
enhanced for much of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, due to troughing
forecast across most of the state, with near normal temperatures forecast o=
ver
the Aleutians and extreme southwestern Mainland Alaska, closer to the
anomalous
ridging.

Troughing forecast over the western CONUS at the outset of the period favor=
s
increased precipitation chances across much of the north-central CONUS
associated with a potential surface low forecast to track northward over th=
e
Great Plains. The orientation of the troughing upstream over Alaska favors
increased chances for above normal precipitation over the Pacific Northwest
continuing after initial trough over the western CONUS lifts out. Near to
below
normal precipitation probabilities are increased over parts of California, =
the
Four Corners Region, and Southern Plains due to the forecast weakening and
northeastward progression of the trough into the Plains by the middle of th=
e
period. Strong ridging over eastern North America favors elevated chances o=
f
below normal precipitation for much of the Northeast and eastern Great Lake=
s
region. Increased probabilities for above normal precipitation are depicted
for
the parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, with the GEFS now supporting t=
he
wetter ECMWF guidance, favoring a system that tracks closer to the mid-
Atlantic
coast. Near to above normal precipitation is favored for most of Mainland
Alaska and the Panhandle due to mean troughing. Conversely, below normal
precipitation is most likely for much of the Aleutians, Alaska Peninsula, a=
nd
extreme southwestern Mainland Alaska due to predicted ridging.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on an amplified pattern initially, with some uncertain=
ty
emerging later in the period as the amplification weakens.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 14 - 20 2022

A more progressive mid-level flow pattern is forecast to emerge across the
CONUS in week-2 compared to the 6-10 day period. At the outset of the perio=
d,
moderately strong ridging is still favored over the Northeast, with troughi=
ng
over the High Plains, and weak ridging near the West Coast. By the middle o=
f
the period, the overall pattern is favored to continue to shift eastward wi=
th
some ridging becoming established over the interior western CONUS, and low
amplitude troughing downstream over the east-central CONUS. Due to the
transient pattern, near to slightly above normal heights are forecast acros=
s
the CONUS for the period as a whole, with the highest positive height
anomalies
(60 meters) predicted over the Northeast due to the relatively stronger
ridging
early in the period. Mean troughing is likely to persist over Mainland Alas=
ka
throughout the period favoring near to below normal heights for much of the
Mainland and the Panhandle. Positive height anomalies are predicted across =
the
Aleutians and extreme southwestern Mainland Alaska as above normal heights =
are
forecast in association with the mean ridging upstream.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are elevated for most of the CON=
US
east of the Rockies, with the highest probabilities across parts of the
Northeast and the Southern Plains (>60 percent). As the initial troughing o=
ver
the West lifts out, and ridging moves into the region, a trend toward warme=
r
temperatures is likely, particularly over the Southwest and California wher=
e
increased above normal temperature probabilities are also favored for the
period as a whole. Increased chances of below normal temperatures are favor=
ed
for parts of the northwestern CONUS due to continued onshore flow, and
consistent with the uncalibrated ECMWF and GEFS ensembles. Cut-off mid-leve=
l
low pressure may result in closer to normal temperatures across parts of th=
e
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast at the outset of the period, but this feature is
forecast to quickly weaken, allowing the above normal temperatures forecast
upstream to expand into the region. Persistent troughing favors elevated
chances of near to below normal temperatures across Alaska.

As troughing over the West progresses northeastward and weakens, a relative=
ly
drier pattern is forecast for much of the West, as well as over the Central
and
Southern Plains, where below normal precipitation probabilities are elevate=
d.
The exception is over parts of the Pacific Northwest where continuing onsho=
re
flow favors increased probabilities of above normal precipitation. Frontal
activity early in the period results in slightly increased above normal
precipitation probabilities across parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley an=
d
Great Lakes. Above normal precipitation probabilities are also increased ov=
er
parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic due to the aforementioned cut-off
mid-level low forecast across the region, and consistent with the GEFS and
ECMWF reforecast tools. There is some uncertainty in whether or not some of
this moisture is drawn into the frontal system upstream, resulting in a bro=
ad
region of enhanced near normal precipitation chances forecast across much o=
f
the Midwest, Ohio Valley, and the interior Northeast. Below normal
precipitation is favored for coastal parts of New England, in association w=
ith
anomalous ridging predicted over the Northeast early in the period. Above
normal precipitation is favored for most of Mainland Alaska and the Panhand=
le,
as troughing is forecast to persist ahead of mean ridging forecast over the
Aleutians. Below normal precipitation is most likely for much of the Aleuti=
ans
and Alaska Peninsula due to predicted ridging upstream.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a trend toward a less amplified, transient pattern with increased uncertain=
ty
in the precipitation forecast over the eastern CONUS.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...Front Range and southeastern Colorado...
Recent guidance has trended drier and windier across much of eastern
CO and the Front range behind a strengthening lee low and
accompanying surface trough. Hi-Res and ensemble guidance now
suggest widespread winds of 20-25 mph and RH below 15% are likely
into the lee of the central Rockies. Despite some concerns with
recent rainfall and greening fuels over this area, ongoing seasonal
moisture deficits suggest fuels overall remain receptive to fire
starts/spread. The potential for critical fire weather conditions
appears likely enough to warrant an extension of the Critical area
northward across much of eastern/southeastern CO.

Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains valid with only minor
adjustments for the latest High-Res guidance. Please see the
previous discussion for more information.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will further amplify while traversing the
southern Rockies tomorrow/Saturday, with stronger mid-level flow
overspreading a dry boundary layer across the Southwest into the
southern High Plains. The surface mass response will be cyclone
development across the central High Plains, leading to widespread
20+ mph sustained west-southwesterly winds across much of Arizona
into New Mexico, eastern Colorado, and western Texas, delineated by
Elevated highlights. Critical highlights have also been introduced
where confidence is highest in stronger winds coinciding with
single-digit RH for several hours atop critically dry fuels.
Expansion of Critical highlights may be needed in later outlooks
across Texas and southeast Colorado if stronger surface winds become
evident in future guidance.

...Storm system to bring the threat of severe thunderstorms across
the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic into this evening, while heavy rain
and flash flood chances continue over central Appalachians and
northern Mid-Atlantic into Saturday...

An area of low pressure currently located over the Ohio Valley
will continue to spread showers and thunderstorms across much of
the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic tonight before reforming near the
southern tip of the Delmarva Peninsula on Saturday. An associated
cold front and lifting warm front over the southern Mid-Atlantic
will combine to create ripe conditions for some thunderstorms to
turn severe. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced
Risk (level 3/5) of severe weather through tonight from the
southern Mid-Atlantic to the Florida Panhandle. Tornado Watches
have also been issued for much of this area to highlight the
potential for thunderstorms to produce tornadoes, along with
damaging wind gusts and large hail. The severe weather threat will
drastically diminish on Saturday as the cold front pushes off the
East Coast. Meanwhile, numerous rounds of heavy rain north of the
warm front and eventually northwest of the developing coastal low
will likely lead to scattered instances of flash flooding
overnight from the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians into the
northern Mid-Atlantic. Showers will linger over the Mid-Atlantic
and southern New England on Saturday, making for a dreary start to
Mother's Day Weekend. Gusty east-northeasterly winds will also
lead to potential coastal hazards, such as coastal flooding and
rip currents, from New Jersey to Delaware. Due to the combination
of thick cloud cover, rain, and gusty northeast winds, much of the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic will experience a chilly weekend with
well below average temperatures and highs only into the 50s.

Elsewhere, a deepening upper-level trough and embedded shortwaves
entering the Northwest will bring colder air and unsettled weather
into the northern Great Basin/northern Rockies. Heavy snow is
possible across the Cascades and mountainous terrain of Idaho and
southwest Montana, where over 6 inches of snow is likely. Moderate
to locally heavy rainfall is possible along coastal sections of
the Northwest. Eventually, as the system emerges into the northern
Plains, showers and thunderstorms may develop. Isolated storms may
produce damaging wind gusts and large hail, as well as the chance
for isolated flash flooding over the eastern Dakotas into central
Nebraska. High winds may also lead to dangerous travel conditions
for high profile vehicles over the northern High Plains this
evening as the aforementioned system ejects out of the northern
Rockies. High Wind Warnings have been issued across north-central
Montana. Gusty winds may also be experienced across parts of the
central Great Basin and central/northern Sierra Nevada through
Saturday morning.

As the previously mentioned upper-level trough deepens over the
West Coast, a downstream ridge will build over the central U.S.
and lead to summer-like heat over parts of the southern Plains
before intensifying later this weekend. Highs will soar into the
upper 90s and triple digits throughout the southern High Plains
and much of Texas. Highs into the 90s will expand into the central
Plains and lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday. Meanwhile, heat
indices will approach 110 degrees across South Texas. This
early-season heat will potentially break several daily high
temperature records and could be dangerous for residents if proper
heat safety is not followed. Overnight temperatures will offer
some relief as lows dip into the 70s.

The other aspect of the warm temperatures will be fire weather
danger. For much of the Southwest, southern Rockies, and southern
High Plains, gusty winds and extremely low relative humidity will
create conditions for wildfires to start easily and spread
uncontrollably. Red Flag Warnings have been issued and expand from
the Mojave Desert of California and Nevada to West Texas and
southeast Colorado.

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
The first in a series of active fire weather days is expected to
unfold across the Southwest into the southern High Plains today. A
broad upper trough will gradually amplify across the western CONUS,
and surface low development will occur over the central High Plains
this afternoon. Gradient flow and downward momentum transport
support widespread 20+ mph sustained westerly surface winds, from
the Nevada/Arizona border into the southern High Plains. 5-15
percent RH will coincide with this strong wind field for several
hours during the afternoon, warranting the introduction of fire
weather highlights. Critical highlights are in place where the
aforementioned surface winds/RH will overlap with critically dry
fuels (i.e. forecast ERCs approaching or exceeding the 90th
percentile).

...Blocky pattern next week to support record heat over the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest along
with episodes of central U.S. convection...

...Overview...

Guidance continues to show a blocky pattern during the period.
Mean ridging aloft will support a prolonged period of well above
normal temperatures (challenging daily records over some areas)
over the Mississippi Valley/central-southern Plains extending into
New England. At the same time mean troughing containing a couple
separate features will produce chilly and unsettled weather over
the West, with waves/fronts and a dry line promoting episodes of
rain and thunderstorms between these two regimes. Meanwhile a
retrograding upper ridge over the Atlantic will likely push an
initial western Atlantic upper low back toward the southern part
of the East Coast, bringing an increase of moisture to central and
southern portions of the East late week into the weekend.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Once again the most pronounced guidance differences in the
forecast involve the features within the western mean trough, with
significantly varying ideas for the combination of a fairly sharp
trough/embedded low along or just inland from the West Coast
through midweek and trailing northeastern Pacific energy that
should reach the Northwest after midweek. Even with some
differences in handling of the trailing energy among recent runs,
the GFS/CMC have consistently been on the faster side of the
envelope with ejection of the leading system. ECMWF runs have been
slower but the 12Z run was a bit faster than the prior 00Z version
due to trending faster with the trailing flow. The 12Z UKMET and
to some degree the new 00Z run are slower to bring in the upstream
troughing, leading to slow progression of the leading feature and
a rather far south track of the upper low in the new run by late
Thursday. Preference continues to be for an intermediate timing
until solutions gravitate more to one side of the spread. The new
00Z ECMWF has adjusted noticeably faster, to a timing just ahead
of the favored compromise. By day 7 Saturday there has also been
quite a bit of variability in the models for how amplified the
trailing energy becomes as it crosses the West, with a blend/mean
approach providing a reasonable starting point. Teleconnections
relative to the core of positive height anomalies over
southeastern Canada by late in the period support the residual
western troughing.

The upper low retrograding back to the East Coast, along with
associated surface low and warm front, exhibit typical detail
differences in the guidance, with a consensus approach among
latest models/means offering a reasonable starting point and
decent continuity. The 12Z GFS appeared to be a little quick to
lift it northwestward and open it up late in the period though. If
anything, latest trends seem to be nudging the upper low center a
little farther south.

The updated forecast started with a 12Z/18Z operational model
blend on Tuesday but then phased out the UKMET due to question
marks with its northeastern Pacific pattern and its eventual
effect on the West, followed by the CMC by Thursday due to its
overall faster progression. 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF mean weight
steadily increased mid-late period while varying parts of the 12Z
ECMWF and 18Z/12Z GFS (with some manual edits) helped center the
western/central U.S. evolution.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Strong upper ridging will lead to persistent much above normal
temperatures over the central-southern Plains and most of the
Mississippi Valley through the week, with some of this warmth also
expanding through the Great Lakes and Northeast. Expect a broad
area of highs/morning lows 10-20F above normal with some localized
areas reaching higher than that. Numerous daily records are likely
through the week over the southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley, and may also extend into the central Plains/Midwest
especially around Tuesday/Wednesday. Temperatures could also
challenge record highs over a few places in the Northeast late in
the week. Highest heat index values will be over southern Texas on
Tuesday but the combination of heat and humidity may still produce
maximum heat index values over 100F at some locations just inland
from the western Gulf Coast through at least Friday. Excessive
heat, gusty winds, and dry conditions should lead to an elevated
fire weather threat across parts of the southern High Plains
through at least mid-week.

The West will see unseasonably cool and unsettled conditions next
week, albeit with a gradual moderating trend as upper troughing
becomes less amplified. Coldest anomalies will be on
Tuesday/Wednesday over California and the western Great Basin with
highs 10-20F or so below normal. Temperatures may rebound to
moderately above normal levels over California and the Southwest
by next Saturday while locations farther north may be see only
single-digit negative anomalies for highs. Periods of rain and
higher elevation snow will tend to be light to moderate, but a
system arriving late in the week may enhance totals somewhat over
favored terrain in the Northwest. Details of this system are still
somewhat uncertain though.

Between these two regimes, the central U.S. will see periods of
rain and thunderstorms. A leading front should stall between the
Upper Midwest and central Plains, lifting back was a warm front
ahead of a ejecting from the West after midweek. This system will
then push a north-south front into the Plains, with timing and
wave details of the front dependent on specifics of trailing
dynamics flowing through the West. These fronts and the ejecting
western system may produce at least localized areas of significant
rainfall that would be a runoff threat over northern tier areas
that already have very wet soil. The late-week system requires
monitoring for strong convection, with details becoming more
evident in coming days.

Most rainfall with the system off the East Coast should stay just
offshore early in the week, but is likely to expand back to the
west late in the week as the vertically stacked low and warm front
to the north of the surface low retrograde back toward the coast
and possibly a little inland by next Saturday.

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
The next and perhaps more potent round in a series of significant
fire weather days will take place tomorrow/Sunday across the
Southwest into the southern High Plains as the western U.S. upper
trough further amplifies and overspreads the Southwest with 60-80 kt
mid-level flow. The surface mass response will be the development of
another cyclone across the southern High Plains, with widespread
25-35 mph sustained westerly surface winds (and higher gusts)
coinciding with 5-15 percent RH tomorrow afternoon. Critical
highlights have been introduced across much of New Mexico into the
southern High Plains, where the very dry/windy conditions will
overlap with critically dry fuels. Given the anomalously dry fuels
amid an exceptional drought and the very strong winds/gusts, at
least locally Extremely Critical conditions are expected. The
Critical highlights introduced this outlook are considered high-end.
An Extremely Critical area may be delineated in future outlooks if a
coherent area of overlapping 30+ mph winds, under 10 percent RH, and
the driest fuels becomes evident.

...Wet and dreary weather will be slow to move off the eastern
U.S. this weekend...

...Colder and unsettled weather will overspread the Northwest,
northern Great Basin, and northern Rockies...

...Early-season heat wave forecast to persist over the southern
Plains and lower Mississippi Valley through the weekend...

...An extended period of Critical Fire Weather anticipated over
the southern Rockies and southern High Plains beginning this
weekend...

A low pressure system responsible for the inclement weather across
the eastern U.S. will be slow to move off the East Coast this
weekend and is forecast to linger just offshore into next week.
Moderate to heavy rain associated with this system will continue
to impact the upper Ohio Valley, the central Appalachians and into
the northern Mid-Atlantic states today as the system slides
generally eastward to reach the Mid-Atlantic coast by this
evening.  Rounds of heavy rain north of the storm center will
likely lead to scattered instances of flash flooding early today
into the afternoon, but should begin to taper off gradually by the
evening as the storm center reaches the coast.  This system is
forecast to slow down and then linger just off the East Coast for
the rest of the Mother's Day Weekend and beyond, making for an
extended period of dreary, windy, and showery weather for the
Eastern Seaboard.  Gusty east-northeasterly winds will also lead
to potential coastal hazards, such as coastal flooding and rip
currents, from New Jersey to Delaware.  Due to the combination of
thick cloud cover, rain, and gusty northeast winds, much of the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic will experience a chilly weekend with
well below average temperatures and highs only into the 50s.

Elsewhere, a deepening upper-level trough and embedded shortwaves
entering the Northwest will bring colder air together with
unsettled weather into the northern Great Basin/northern Rockies.
Heavy snow is possible across the Cascades and mountainous terrain
of Idaho and southwest Montana, where over 6 inches of snow is
likely.  Moderate to locally heavy rainfall is possible along
coastal sections of the Northwest. Eventually, as the system
emerges into the northern Plains, showers and thunderstorms may
develop.  Isolated storms may produce damaging wind gusts and
large hail, as well as the chance for isolated flash flooding over
the eastern Dakotas into central Nebraska.  Meanwhile, strong and
gusty winds are expected to develop across the interior southern
half of the western U.S. behind a cold front.

As the previously mentioned upper-level trough deepens over the
West Coast, a downstream ridge will build over the central U.S.
and lead to summer-like heat over parts of the southern Plains
before intensifying later this weekend. Highs will soar into the
upper 90s and triple digits throughout the southern High Plains
and much of Texas. Highs into the 90s will expand into the central
Plains and lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday. Meanwhile, heat
indices will approach 110 degrees across South Texas. This
early-season heat will potentially break several daily high
temperature records and could be dangerous for residents if proper
heat safety is not followed. Overnight temperatures will offer
some relief as lows dip into the 70s.

The other aspect of the warm temperatures will be fire weather
danger. For much of the Southwest, southern Rockies, and southern
High Plains, gusty winds and extremely low relative humidity will
create conditions for wildfires to start easily and spread
uncontrollably. Red Flag Warnings have been issued and expand from
the Mojave Desert of California and Nevada to West Texas and
southeast Colorado.

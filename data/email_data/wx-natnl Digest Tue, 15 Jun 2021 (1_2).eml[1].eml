Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1158 AM CDT Mon Jun 14 2021

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

The ongoing forecast is on track as dewpoints are in the teens
within the critical delineation and winds are currently 10 to 20 mph
with further increase expected. Expanded the elevated area slightly
southeast based on stronger surface winds from morning guidance. In
addition, made a slight expansion southwestward to the isolated dry
thunderstorm area. The highest thunderstorm probabilities from the
morning HREF are across southeast Arizona, so wanted to ensure
enough space was given in this region to cover the potential for
lightning induced fire starts.

..Bentley.. 06/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0111 AM CDT Mon Jun 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will persist over the southern CONUS today as
mid and upper-level flow strengthen along the West Coast. Mostly
clear skies across the Southwest and Great Basin will promote near
record high temperatures and the diurnal deepening of a thermal
trough. Increasing winds in the vicinity of the trough axis, aided
by deep boundary-layer mixing and strong mid-level flow, will
introduce a robust fire weather threat to the Great Basin and
thunderstorm chances across parts of New Mexico and southeast
Arizona. The increasing pressure gradient across the West Coast may
also support fire weather concerns for parts of coastal southern
California where ERC values have been increasing.

...Great Basin...
Recent guidance continues to show high probability for a broad swath
of 15-25 mph sustained winds within the Great Basin this afternoon
as the surface trough deepens. 25-35 mph winds in the 750 to 650 mb
layer will likely manifest at the surface as frequent wind gusts
given deep boundary-layer mixing and a nearly uni-direction
low-level wind profile. Little to no moisture recovery over the next
24 hours will support another afternoon of single digit RH values.
Fuels across the region remain receptive after a day of hot, dry,
and windy conditions on Sunday, which will support widespread
elevated to critical fire weather conditions.

...New Mexico...
Regional 00Z soundings show mid-level moisture remains in place
across southern to central NM. Early morning surface observations
show dewpoints increasing over the past 4 hours across
southern/southwest NM, suggesting sufficient moisture to support
convection may reach as far west as southeast AZ. Despite the
increase in low-level moisture, very hot temperatures will drive
deep mixing with boundary-layer RH values near or below 20% while
supporting 100-500 J/kg MUCAPE. As such, isolated convection with
dry lightning appears possible this afternoon from southeast AZ into
central NM.

...Southern California...
Early morning surface observations show Sundowner winds increasing
to 30-40 mph across southern Santa Barbara county associated with a
-4 mb KSMX/KSBA pressure gradient. While winds may abate today, the
deepening of the surface trough across the southern CO River Valley
coupled with increasing pressure across northern CA will support
another night of similar (if not slightly stronger) gradient winds
late tonight into early Tuesday. Increasing temperatures over the
next 24 hours and downslope warming/drying will help reduce RH
values into the upper teens, which should support at least elevated
fire weather concerns (and potentially local critical conditions
where RH values are sufficiently low).

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through the week across
much of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California through the end of
the week...

...Tropical system may bring heavy rainfall to Central Gulf Coast
later this week and weekend...


...Overview...

The anomalously strong upper ridge over the Four Corners region
this week will fuel the dangerous and record heat wave for much of
the Southwest to Interior West while downstream over the East
Coast, a brief period of troughing and cyclonic flow allows for
some drier and slightly cooler air to filter in. By this weekend,
the aforementioned ridge begins to break down as large scale
troughing sets up over the central U.S. and attention turns to the
potential tropical system that could bring heavy rainfall hazards
to portions of the central Gulf Coast. The National Hurricane
Center is now advertising a high likelihood for increased
development and organization of that system. Farther north, an
area of low pressure ejecting out into the Plains Sunday and
Monday will interact with a wavy stationary boundary in place and
could be the focus for increased/enhanced rounds of thunderstorms.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

For the tropical system in the Gulf, the most notable change from
the previous model cycle was a faster trend as the system is
influenced by deepening troughing over the central U.S. which
helps draw it further to the north. Most of the available
deterministic guidance trended this way and the early look at the
latest 12Z guidance suggests this trend continues. There remains
some west/east spread with the CMC being on the eastern envelope,
and was largely discounted for this cycle. A consensus of the
latest ECMWF and GFS with some influence toward the ensemble means
was used for the forecast including QPF per WPC/NHC coordination.

Outside of the tropical system, there is relatively good model
consensus in the upper level pattern which provided a reasonable
starting point for depicting the main synoptic features. The
shortwave and associated low pressure coming out of the central
Canada is expected to lay down a front across the Great Lakes to
Ohio Valley. There is still some spread in how far south this sets
up and will likely be dictated by prior convective outflows.
Subsequently, its north/south waviness and later interaction with
another low pressure system early next week in the Plains remains
elusive. As a result, the WPC blend, which started mainly
deterministic between the ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET evolved into mostly
a consensus of the ECENS/GEFS means by day 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Dangerous and record breaking heat wave for much of the western
U.S. will continue through this week with some of the most extreme
temperatures over the Southwest. Daily temperatures 15F to 20F
above normal are expected with afternoon readings well into the
100s and 110s for the Southwest, California Central Valley, and
portions of the Interior West. Further north, readings in the 90s
are expected. The combination of extreme daily temperatures and
duration, as well as being rather early in the season for such an
event, will make this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups.
Excessive heat warnings/watches are in place for many areas of the
Southwest and the California Central Valley. The Central Plains
region should experience some of the heat on Thursday as well with
highs 10-20F above normal.  After Thursday the front over the
central/eastern U.S. will bring temperatures down toward normal
with perhaps a few pockets a little below normal depending on the
day.  The East will be on the cool side late this week before
rebounding toward normal, though clouds/rain reaching parts of the
South may lead to below-normal highs late in the period.

A potential tropical system in the Bay of Campeche is forecast to
drift northward later this week and approach the central Gulf
Coast by Friday into this weekend. The National Hurricane Center
is monitoring for increased organization and development but
regardless, the system will be capable of producing heavy rainfall
over portions of the Central Gulf Coast and this could spread
inland over the Southeast this weekend. Further north,
interactions along a stationary front and another low pressure
moving into the Plains/Upper Midwest could bring locally heavy
rain to areas from the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, or Upper Midwest.
Details in convective complexes and potential interactions from
the tropical system to the south lowers forecast confidence quite
a bit so it may take a few days to resolve any potential heavy
rain threat there.

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through the week across
much of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California through the end of
the week...

...Tropical system may bring heavy rainfall to Central Gulf Coast
later this week and weekend...


...Overview...

The anomalously strong upper ridge over the Four Corners region
this week will fuel the dangerous and record heat wave for much of
the Southwest to Interior West while downstream over the East
Coast, a brief period of troughing and cyclonic flow allows for
some drier and slightly cooler air to filter in. By this weekend,
the aforementioned ridge begins to break down as large scale
troughing sets up over the central U.S. and attention turns to the
potential tropical system that could bring heavy rainfall hazards
to portions of the central Gulf Coast. The National Hurricane
Center is now advertising a high likelihood for increased
development and organization of that system. Farther north, an
area of low pressure ejecting out into the Plains Sunday and

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 14 2021

SYNOPSIS: A trend toward a less amplified mid-level height pattern is favored
across the contiguous U.S. during week-2. Lingering heat is possible early in
the period across portions of the western and central lower-48 states, but
temperatures are forecast to moderate with time as mid-level high pressure
retrogrades over the Northeast Pacific, bringing positive height anomalies
over
Alaska by the second half of the period. A tropical disturbance is forecast to
impact the Gulf of Mexico coastal states later in week-1, and slowly progress
inland across the Tennessee Valley by the start of week-2. The remnants of
this
disturbance, combined with a frontal system, may bring increased chances for
heavy rain to portions of the East early in week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the interior Pacific
Northwest,
Great Basin, and Northern Rockies, Tue, Jun 22.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the western CONUS, and the
central and southern High Plains, Tue-Thu, Jun 22-24.

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast, Tue-
Wed,
Jun 22-23.

Flooding possible for portions of eastern Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY JUNE 17 - MONDAY JUNE 21:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!rGGBkJrpkDzhEhypegRI7EyYbatHcr97hcpKWi2xsJQ6UOB2D4mv9JOlWZRR8YggjoI8ZtD7$

FOR TUESDAY JUNE 22 - MONDAY JUNE 28: The 500-hPa height pattern across the
CONUS is favored to become more zonal during week-2, resulting in lower
probabilities for hazardous temperatures compared to the more robust forecasts
last week. This should allow for a relief from the heat in the western CONUS
by
the middle of the period, with the highest positive height anomalies forecast
to build over the Northeast Pacific and Alaska. The 0z ECMWF ensemble still
maintains above normal heights over portions of the West early in the period,
with corresponding guidance from the ECMWF reforecast tool indicating a 40-60%
chance for maximum temperatures to exceed the 85th percentile on day 8 (6/22),
and a 20-40% chance on day 9 (6/23). The GEFS reforecast tool also maintains a
20-40% chance that maximum temperatures exceed the 85th percentile over parts
of the region early in week-2. Given stronger signals in the ECMWF guidance, a
moderate risk for excessive heat is posted over portions of the interior
Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, and Northern Rockies for 6/22. The primary
concern is for maximum temperatures exceeding 90 deg F in some of the valleys,
although these temperatures are still forecast to be lower than those forecast
during week-1, and the National Blend of Models is no longer indicating record
high temperatures over the highlighted areas. A slight risk for excessive heat
is posted for much of the western CONUS extending into the Central and
Southern
High Plains through the 24th, given continued support from the reforecast
tools. Particular emphasis is given to the Central and Southern High Plains
and
southwestern Texas where increased dew points related to an influx of tropical
moisture may result in heat indices greater than 100 deg F in some areas.
Although the heat signals remain elevated in the West later in the period, the
zonal height pattern forecast reduces confidence in the outcome, and the
hazard
is not extended further out in time.



The National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring a tropical disturbance,
currently over the Bay of Campeche, which is forecast to move northward toward
the central Gulf Coast states. Currently, this system has a 70% chance to
develop into a tropical cyclone in the next 5 days. Regardless of its
development, heavy rain is likely across the Gulf Coast later in week-1, with
the Weather Prediction Center indicating 3-5 inches of rain over southeastern
Louisiana and southern Mississippi on days 6 and 7. By the start of week-2,
the
remnants of this tropical system are forecast to move into the Tennessee
Valley, with moisture being drawn into an approaching cold front. The 0z ECMWF
depicts a wetter solution over the eastern CONUS compared to the 0z and 6z
GEFS
as it indicates a stronger upper-level low over the Great Lakes allowing for
increased frontogenetic forcing over the region. The uncalibrated 0z ECMWF
ensemble depicts at least a 20% for rainfall exceeding 1 inch on day 8 (6/22)
across the Tennessee Valley and adjacent areas. Given the frontal system is
likely to extend from the Lower Mississippi Valley through the Tennessee and
Ohio Valleys, and ultimately move eastward through the Appalachians,
mid-Atlantic, and Southeast by day 9 (6/23), a slight risk for heavy rain is
highlighted across all of these areas on 6/22 and 6/23. This hazard area
aligns
well with the region of elevated probabilities (>20%) for 3-day precipitation
exceeding the 85th percentile in the ECMWF reforecast tool. Antecedent heavy
rainfall related to the tropical disturbance combined with high soil moistures
also supports the continuation of flooding possible area highlighted over
portions of eastern Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the western
Florida Panhandle.



Alaska is forecast to experience anomalous 500-hPa ridging, resulting in a
tilt
toward near to above-normal temperatures being favored statewide. A drying
trend is favored across the eastern part of the state, especially later in the
period as high pressure becomes more established. However, any convection that
develops could be a concern given the associated lightning potential and the
forecast period coinciding with the climatological peak of fire season.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon June 14 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 20 - 24 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a broad trough over
the North Pacific, centered south of the western Aleutians, and ridging and
positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the Gulf of Alaska, the
eastern Aleutians, Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, extending over
parts of the Pacific Northwest coast. A trough is forecast over the
east-central CONUS. Weak positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over
the southern CONUS and eastern coast.

The predicted troughing over the western Aleutians and associated southerly to
southwesterly flow favor relatively warm conditions for much of Mainland
Alaska
and the eastern Aleutians as well as the Alaska Panhandle. A predicted trough
over the east-central CONUS favors enhanced probabilities of near to below
normal temperatures across most of the central and eastern CONUS, except for
the east coast where above normal temperatures are indicated due predicted
weak
positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Above normal temperatures are also likely
over the western CONUS and parts of the Southern Plains, consistent with the
ERF consolidation forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered over the western Aleutians favors above-normal
precipitation over the Aleutians and western Mainland Alaska. Anomalous
ridging
and northerly flow increase chances of below-normal precipitation across much
of the western CONUS. Predicted troughing over the east-central CONUS favors
near to above normal precipitation across most of the eastern CONUS except for
southern Florida , where below normal precipitation is indicated, consistent
with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 22 - 28 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, becoming more zonal
over much of the CONUS but remaining amplified over the Pacific Ocean, while
ensemble spread and uncertainty increases. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend
weights the ECMWF ensemble mean greater than the NCEP GEFS and Canadian
ensemble means, due to recent model skill.

The temperature pattern forecast over the CONUS for the week 2 period is
similar to the 6-10 day outlook period. Above-normal temperatures are favored
for much of Mainland Alaska and the eastern Aleutians as well as the Alaska
Panhandle, associated with mean southerly flow ahead of a mean trough over the
western Aleutians and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Near to above-normal
temperatures are likely over most of the east coast, western CONUS and parts
of
the Southern Plains, under near to above normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal
temperatures are most favored over the south-central CONUS, as a trough and
storm systems are predicted to traverse the region.

The week-2 precipitation probability forecast is also similar to the 6-10 day
forecast. Forecast troughing over the western Aleutians favors mean southerly
flow and above normal precipitation over the Aleutians and western Mainland
Alaska. Below-normal precipitation odds are increased for southeastern
Mainland
Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle and the western CONUS, associated with mean
ridging over the Gulf of Alaska and anomalous northerly flow. Near to above
normal precipitation is favored across the central and eastern CONUS,
consistent with the ERF consolidation and operational autoblend forecast
tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Thunderstorms could be severe in the Mid-Atlantic into this
evening...

...Heat will continue across the interior West into the northern
High Plains with record-breaking temperatures and fire danger in
some areas...

An upper-level trough combining with multiple frontal boundaries
pushing into the Great Lakes region into the Northeast will
provide the ingredients for the thunderstorms to become severe
across the Mid-Atlantic region for the remainder of this afternoon
into tonight.  Thunderstorms that organize into a squall line
would increase the chance for high winds and heavy downpours in
its track, where isolated flash flooding is also possible. The
chance of severe storms should decrease on Tuesday but widely
scattered thunderstorms will again be possible by Tuesday
afternoon as the final reinforcing shot of cooler air pushes
across the central Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic.  The cool
air mass will then dominate the Northeast on Wednesday as it
continues push southward through the rest of the East Coast.

Farther south, scattered thunderstorms will be the rule over the
next couple of days near the Gulf Coast into much of the Florida
peninsula locally heavy downpours and isolated flash flooding are
possible into this evening. Some thunderstorms over west-central
Texas could result in locally heavy downpours into this evening as
well.

Meanwhile, a strong upper-level ridge across western and central
parts of the U.S. will sustain a heat wave for the next several
days. Temperatures well into the 110s are forecast for the next
few days in the Desert Southwest, and temperatures exceeding 100
as far north as Montana especially tomorrow will be 25+ degrees
above average. Dozens (possibly hundreds) of daily record high
maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be set over the
next few days in California, the Intermountain West, Desert
Southwest, Rockies, and High Plains. Excessive Heat Warnings and
Watches as well as Heat Advisories are in effect. Given the heat,
dry conditions, and gusty winds, Elevated to Critical Risks of
fire weather are in place across the Great Basin and portions of
southern California through at least Tuesday. The exception to the
Western heat will be in the Pacific Northwest, where a cold front
is expected to cause cooler temperatures and rain chances that
could shift into the Northern Great Basin as well by Tuesday.

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHWEST INTO SOUTH-CENTRAL
MONTANA...

Expanded the elevated delineation northeastward into north-central
Montana and into north-central Wyoming. Very deep mixing is expected
amid strengthening deep-layer flow. A wind shift is also forecast
across northern Montana during the afternoon. This will cool surface
temperatures somewhat, but winds expected to increase substantially
and thus could lead to rapidly changing conditions near any ongoing
fires.

In addition, added a small critical area from southwest Montana into
south-central Montana. This is where the strongest mid-level winds
(50-60 mph) are expected to overspread the well-mixed airmass.
Multiple fires are also ongoing in this region which will likely be
impacted by these strong winds.

..Bentley.. 06/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0203 AM CDT Mon Jun 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough, currently residing off the West Coast, is
forecast to translate across the Pacific Northwest through the day
Tuesday. Resulting surface pressure falls ahead of this wave will
help consolidate a surface low over the northern Rockies with a
trailing trough across the Great Basin. This will help strengthen
pressure-gradient winds again Tuesday afternoon across the broader
West, with the strongest winds expected over parts of the Great
Basin under a mid-level flow maximum. Building high pressure behind
the main synoptic wave will augment pressure-gradient winds across
parts of southern California, resulting in increased fire weather
concerns.

...Great Basin...
Little to no moisture recovery will yield another day of single
digit RH values across much of the Great Basin. Fuels are largely
receptive across most of the region, and may experience further
curing after Monday's hot/dry conditions. Surface winds are forecast
to increase through the day to 15-25 mph across a large swath of the
Great Basin and northern Rockies within the synoptic trough. A belt
of stronger mid-level flow is forecast to reside over the Great
Basin, which will likely mix down to the surface and support 25-35
mph wind gusts thanks to deep boundary-layer mixing. This corridor
will see the highest potential for sustained critical conditions
with elevated conditions likely as far north as north-central MT
(though fuels across central/northern MT may not be as receptive as
compared to locations farther south).

...Southern California...
Building high pressure over northern CA Tuesday will help drive a -4
to -5 mb KSMX/KSBA pressure gradient. Northerly Sundowner winds to
30-40 mph (and perhaps locally stronger) are expected Tuesday into
Tuesday night across the coastal foothills of Santa Barbara county.
Warm temperatures and downslope warming/drying will aid in RH
reductions into the teens, and perhaps single digits for a few
locations. With ERC values increasing due to limited rainfall in
recent weeks, elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
appear likely.

...Arizona into New Mexico...
Mid-level moisture is forecast to gradually shift west within the
weak easterly flow regime on the southern periphery of an
upper-level high over the Four Corners. Thermodynamic profiles are
forecast to be supportive of a few dry thunderstorms with deep
boundary-layer mixing and limited, but sufficient, instability.
Recent ensemble guidance has a stronger QPF signal compared to
previous days, indicating that at least a mixture of wet and dry
storms is possible. However, fuels across this area are receptive to
dry lightning strikes with several large fires noted across the
AZ/NM region.

In addition to the dry lightning threat, southeasterly winds will
likely increase to 15-20 mph by late afternoon across southeast
AZ/southwest NM as the southern extension of the main synoptic
trough diurnally deepens amid very warm temperatures. Relative
humidity values in the single digits to low teens are expected,
which will support elevated fire weather conditions.

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through the week across
much of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California through the end of
the week...

...Tropical system may bring heavy rainfall to Central Gulf Coast
later this week and weekend...


...Overview...

The anomalously strong upper ridge over the Four Corners region
this week will fuel the dangerous and record heat wave for much of
the Southwest to Interior West while downstream over the East
Coast, a brief period of troughing and cyclonic flow allows for
some drier and slightly cooler air to filter in. By this weekend,
the aforementioned ridge begins to break down as large scale
troughing sets up over the central U.S. and attention turns to the
potential tropical system that could bring heavy rainfall hazards
to portions of the central Gulf Coast. The National Hurricane
Center is now advertising a high likelihood for increased
development and organization of that system. Farther north, an
area of low pressure ejecting out into the Plains Sunday and
Monday will interact with a wavy stationary boundary in place and
could be the focus for increased/enhanced rounds of thunderstorms.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

For the tropical system in the Gulf, the most notable change from
the previous model cycle was a faster trend as the system is
influenced by deepening troughing over the central U.S. which
helps draw it further to the north. Most of the available
deterministic guidance trended this way and the early look at the
latest 12Z guidance suggests this trend continues. There remains
some west/east spread with the CMC being on the eastern envelope,
and was largely discounted for this cycle. A consensus of the
latest ECMWF and GFS with some influence toward the ensemble means
was used for the forecast including QPF per WPC/NHC coordination.

Outside of the tropical system, there is relatively good model
consensus in the upper level pattern which provided a reasonable
starting point for depicting the main synoptic features. The
shortwave and associated low pressure coming out of the central
Canada is expected to lay down a front across the Great Lakes to
Ohio Valley. There is still some spread in how far south this sets
up and will likely be dictated by prior convective outflows.
Subsequently, its north/south waviness and later interaction with
another low pressure system early next week in the Plains remains
elusive. As a result, the WPC blend, which started mainly
deterministic between the ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET evolved into mostly
a consensus of the ECENS/GEFS means by day 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Dangerous and record breaking heat wave for much of the western
U.S. will continue through this week with some of the most extreme
temperatures over the Southwest. Daily temperatures 15F to 20F
above normal are expected with afternoon readings well into the
100s and 110s for the Southwest, California Central Valley, and
portions of the Interior West. Further north, readings in the 90s
are expected. The combination of extreme daily temperatures and
duration, as well as being rather early in the season for such an
event, will make this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups.
Excessive heat warnings/watches are in place for many areas of the
Southwest and the California Central Valley. The Central Plains
region should experience some of the heat on Thursday as well with
highs 10-20F above normal.  After Thursday the front over the
central/eastern U.S. will bring temperatures down toward normal
with perhaps a few pockets a little below normal depending on the
day.  The East will be on the cool side late this week before
rebounding toward normal, though clouds/rain reaching parts of the
South may lead to below-normal highs late in the period.

A potential tropical system in the Bay of Campeche is forecast to
drift northward later this week and approach the central Gulf
Coast by Friday into this weekend. The National Hurricane Center
is monitoring for increased organization and development but
regardless, the system will be capable of producing heavy rainfall
over portions of the Central Gulf Coast and this could spread
inland over the Southeast this weekend. Further north,
interactions along a stationary front and another low pressure
moving into the Plains/Upper Midwest could bring locally heavy
rain to areas from the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, or Upper Midwest.
Details in convective complexes and potential interactions from
the tropical system to the south lowers forecast confidence quite
a bit so it may take a few days to resolve any potential heavy
rain threat there.

development and organization of that system. Farther north, an
area of low pressure ejecting out into the Plains Sunday and
Monday will interact with a wavy stationary boundary in place and
could be the focus for increased/enhanced rounds of thunderstorms.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

For the tropical system in the Gulf, the most notable change from
the previous model cycle was a faster trend as the system is
influenced by deepening troughing over the central U.S. which
helps draw it further to the north. Most of the available
deterministic guidance trended this way and the early look at the
latest 12Z guidance suggests this trend continues. There remains
some west/east spread with the CMC being on the eastern envelope,
and was largely discounted for this cycle. A consensus of the
latest ECMWF and GFS with some influence toward the ensemble means
was used for the forecast including QPF per WPC/NHC coordination.

Outside of the tropical system, there is relatively good model
consensus in the upper level pattern which provided a reasonable
starting point for depicting the main synoptic features. The
shortwave and associated low pressure coming out of the central
Canada is expected to lay down a front across the Great Lakes to
Ohio Valley. There is still some spread in how far south this sets
up and will likely be dictated by prior convective outflows.
Subsequently, its north/south waviness and later interaction with
another low pressure system early next week in the Plains remains
elusive. As a result, the WPC blend, which started mainly
deterministic between the ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET evolved into mostly
a consensus of the ECENS/GEFS means by day 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Dangerous and record breaking heat wave for much of the western
U.S. will continue through this week with some of the most extreme
temperatures over the Southwest. Daily temperatures 15F to 20F
above normal are expected with afternoon readings well into the
100s and 110s for the Southwest, California Central Valley, and
portions of the Interior West. Further north, readings in the 90s
are expected. The combination of extreme daily temperatures and
duration, as well as being rather early in the season for such an
event, will make this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups.
Excessive heat warnings/watches are in place for many areas of the
Southwest and the California Central Valley. The Central Plains
region should experience some of the heat on Thursday as well with
highs 10-20F above normal.  After Thursday the front over the
central/eastern U.S. will bring temperatures down toward normal
with perhaps a few pockets a little below normal depending on the
day.  The East will be on the cool side late this week before
rebounding toward normal, though clouds/rain reaching parts of the
South may lead to below-normal highs late in the period.

A potential tropical system in the Bay of Campeche is forecast to
drift northward later this week and approach the central Gulf
Coast by Friday into this weekend. The National Hurricane Center
is monitoring for increased organization and development but
regardless, the system will be capable of producing heavy rainfall
over portions of the Central Gulf Coast and this could spread
inland over the Southeast this weekend. Further north,
interactions along a stationary front and another low pressure
moving into the Plains/Upper Midwest could bring locally heavy
rain to areas from the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, or Upper Midwest.
Details in convective complexes and potential interactions from
the tropical system to the south lowers forecast confidence quite
a bit so it may take a few days to resolve any potential heavy
rain threat there.

0124 AM CDT Tue Jun 15 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN TO SOUTH-CENTRAL
MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
A partial upper-level ridge breakdown is forecast to begin over the
next 24 hours across the central Rockies. Early morning water-vapor
imagery shows a high-amplitude ridge extending from the Four Corners
into southwest Canada with an approaching shortwave trough beginning
to move onshore across northern California. The progression of this
trough to the northeast will consolidate and deepen a surface low
over the northern Rockies by this afternoon with a trailing trough
extending southward into the Great Basin. The combination of
increasing surface pressure-gradient winds and the placement of a
belt of stronger mid-level flow over the region will introduce
robust fire weather threats to parts of the Great Basin and northern
Rockies. This synoptic pattern will also introduce regional concerns
to parts of California and the Arizona/New Mexico region.

...Northern Rockies and Great Basin...
Dry conditions persist across the region with early-morning RH
values only recovering into the teens and low 20s. Very hot
conditions are expected again today with widespread temperatures in
the 90s to low 100s, making single digit RH values near or below 5%
likely. Sustained winds are forecast to increase to 15-25 mph across
a broad swath of the Great Basin and northern Rockies. Portions of
eastern NV/western UT and southern to south-central MT appear to
have the highest probability for sustained critical conditions as
30-40 mph mid-level flow coincides with peak daytime heating and
maximum boundary-layer mixing over these regions. However, periodic
critical conditions will be possible within the broader elevated
risk area. A dry Pacific front is forecast to sweep eastward across
northern MT mid to late afternoon, bringing slight temperature
reductions a breezy west to northwesterly wind shift.

...California...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are expected
across Santa Barbara county in southern California as well as within
the San Joaquin basin in California's Central Valley. Sundowner
winds are already noted early this morning with 40-50 mph wind gusts
reported along the coastal hills of southern Santa Barbara county.
These are being driven by a 4-5 mb pressure gradient across the
county, which is forecast to remain in place through the day and
into tonight as high pressure builds to the north. Downslope effects
have reduced RH along the coast to 30-50% with additional reductions
expected this afternoon amid hot temperatures. Given dry fuels in
the region, elevated conditions appear likely with periods of
critical conditions possible as RH values fall this afternoon.

Further north, northerly winds through the Central Valley are
forecast to increase to near 15 mph by this afternoon.
Boundary-layer mixing and warm temperatures will aid in RH
reductions to 10-20%. ERC values across the Valley are seasonally
high, indicating that fuels should support fire spread. As such,
elevated fire weather conditions appear likely - especially within
the San Joaquin Basin where the probability for sustained 15 mph
winds is highest.

...Arizona/New Mexico...
Convection across southwest NM and southeast AZ over the past 24
hours has resulted in numerous lightning strikes with only pockets
of wetting rainfall. 00Z soundings still show thermodynamic profiles
conducive for dry thunderstorms as mid-level moisture remains in
place across the region. Strong daytime heating and upslope flow
along the terrain of the Southern Rockies will likely support
another day of scattered convection, and PWAT values between 0.5 to
0.8 inches suggest isolated dry lightning is possible.

Additionally, increasing southeasterly winds across southeast
AZ/southwest NM will support elevated to transient critical
conditions this afternoon as RH values fall into the single digits
and low teens. Ongoing fire activity in the area indicates fuels
remain receptive despite a marginal increase in low-level moisture
over the past 48 hours. Furthermore, this area saw several dry
lightning strikes Monday afternoon, which may become active in the
dry/windy conditions later today.

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through the week across
much of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California through the end of
the week...

...Tropical system may bring heavy rainfall to Central Gulf Coast
later this week and weekend...


...Overview...

The anomalously strong upper ridge over the Four Corners region
will continue the dangerous and record heat wave for much of the
Southwest to Interior West into the end of the week while on
Friday the East will be in the latter part of a brief period of
drier/cooler air as an upper trough moves over the western
Atlantic. The Four Corners ridge will then steadily weaken and
drift southward while mean troughing sets up over the central U.S.
As this trough deepens expect low pressure to track through and
northeastward from the Plains Sunday onward. This low pressure and
trailing front as well as a leading wavy stationary/warm front
should produce increasing coverage and intensity of rain and
thunderstorms. Meanwhile a potential tropical system could bring
heavy rainfall hazards to portions of the central Gulf Coast and
nearby areas from Friday through the weekend. The National
Hurricane Center is now advertising a high likelihood for
increased development and organization of that system over the
next few days.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The full envelope of surface low tracks for the possible tropical
system is still broader than desired.  The average of GFS/ECMWF
runs is still a bit faster than 24-36 hours ago, but the past two
CMC runs have been much slower than their predecessors and the
UKMET continues to be on the southwestern side of the spread. Over
the past day the GEFS mean has gained some definition, suggesting
a little improvement in clustering, while its track now more
closely mimics the operational run that is somewhat on the eastern
side of the envelope. Thus far the last couple ECMWF runs are on
their own in maintaining as strong of a system as they show after
landfall. After Sunday the progression of any remaining surface
reflection will become increasingly dependent on the details of
northern stream flow. Given the ongoing spread and varying trends
over the past few days, the updated forecast made only modest
nudges from continuity for strength and track.

Away from the tropical system, there is decent agreement with the
general evolution of the upper pattern but various differences
with details. A blend approach resolves continued shortwave
discrepancies for the southern Canada into northern tier U.S.
shortwave that pushes a front through the northeastern quadrant of
the lower 48 with the western part stalling over the
Plains/Rockies. Convective outflows still provide some uncertainty
over precise frontal position. Then there are typical differences
with how incoming energy amplifies into the developing central
U.S. mean trough aloft Sunday-Tuesday. Recent GFS/ECMWF runs have
trended deeper with the core of this trough, leading to a deeper
and more northeastward surface low that will interact with the
leading central/eastern U.S. front.

Guidance comparisons for the Gulf system as well as flow to the
north ultimately led to a starting blend incorporating the 18Z-12Z
GFS/18Z GEFS mean and 12Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean through the period.
More weight went to the operational runs early and slightly more
to the means late, while awaiting more continuity to gain
confidence in the operational ECMWF/GFS solutions at that time
frame. Also the blend removed the 12Z GFS by day 7 Tuesday as its
northern tier trough began to differ more from consensus.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Dangerous and record breaking heat wave for much of the western
U.S. will continue through this week with some of the most extreme
temperatures over the Southwest. Expect daily temperatures 15F to
20F above normal with afternoon readings well into the 100s and
110s for the Southwest, California Central Valley, and portions of
the Interior West. To the north readings will be in the 90s. The
combination of extreme daily temperatures and duration, as well as
being rather early in the season for such an event, will make this
a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups. Excessive heat
warnings/watches are in place for many areas of the Southwest and
the California Central Valley. Temperatures over most of
California and the Southeast will gradually moderate with time
into early next week but areas from the northern Great Basin into
the Northwest should continue to see highs 10-20F above normal
into next week--but any daily records should be fairly isolated.
Some areas from the central/south-central Plains into the Midwest
should see highs up to 10-15F above normal on Friday before
trending cooler with frontal passage. The central U.S. should see
a broadening area of modestly below normal readings early next
week under an amplifying upper trough. The East will start out on
the cool side Friday morning and then rebound to or a bit above
normal, though clouds/rain reaching parts of the South may lead to
below-normal highs during the weekend.

A potential tropical system is forecast to drift northward from
the Bay of Campeche later this week and approach the central Gulf
Coast by Friday into this weekend. The National Hurricane Center
is monitoring for increased organization and development but
regardless, the system will be capable of producing heavy rainfall
over portions of the Central Gulf Coast and this could spread
inland over the Southeast this weekend. Farther north, a leading
front crossing the northeast quadrant of the lower 48 followed by
a system expected to track through the Plains/Upper Great Lakes
may serve to focus multiple areas of locally heavy rain within a
broad area from Plains/Midwest into the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes.
Details in convective complexes and potential interactions from
the tropical system to the south lower forecast confidence quite a
bit so it may take a few days to resolve any potential heavy rain
threat there.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CDT Tue Jun 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough, currently noted moving onshore across
northern California, is forecast to translate across the
international border through the day Wednesday. This will place a
belt of stronger mid-level flow over the northern Rockies and
northern High Plains, which will introduce some fire weather
concerns. Building high pressure across the West Coast will
generally weaken winds compared to previous days, though areas of
stronger flow will support some fire weather threat.

...Northern Rockies/High Plains...
Westerly winds will start breezy at 20-25 mph behind a Pacific cold
front but gradually decrease by the afternoon as the front/trough
shift into the Plains through the day. An influx of cooler air will
limit RH reductions to 20-30%, but the temporal overlap of breezy
conditions and low RH may be limited. However, the proximity of the
upper-level trough will support 25-35 mph mid-level flow over the
region, which should mix down to the surface as frequent wind gusts
by mid to late afternoon as boundary-layer mixing deepens. This will
allow for elevated, to perhaps locally critical fire weather
conditions from north-central MT into western ND.

...Great Basin...
Mostly clear skies over the greater Four Corners region will allow
for strong diurnal heating across the Great Basin and into the
Southwest. This will help deepen a thermal low over the Four Corners
and augment the regional pressure gradient. As a result, 15-20 mph
winds are possible across parts of the Great Basin where conditions
have been hot and dry. Elevated conditions appear likely, but the
lack of stronger flow aloft may limit the duration and coverage of
any critical wind speeds.

...Four Corners...
Mid-level moisture is expected to linger from southern AZ/NM into
central CO within a weak, but persistent easterly flow regime.
Combined with hot boundary-layer temperatures, 0.3-0.6 inch PWAT
values will contribute to enough instability to support convection.
Orographic lift along the terrain of the central and southern
Rockies will act as forcing for ascent, resulting in isolated to
scattered thunderstorms by mid to late afternoon. With dry fuels
noted across much of the region, dry-lightning starts are possible.

...Southern California...
The building surface high over the West Coast should help maintain a
north-south pressure gradient across southern California through
early Wednesday morning. Elevated fire weather conditions may be
ongoing early Wednesday as Sundowner winds drive downslope
warming/drying across southern Santa Barbara county. Forecast
guidance depicts a weakening of this pressure gradient through the
day, and an influx of marine moisture may also reduce the fire
weather concern by the afternoon, though trends will be monitored.

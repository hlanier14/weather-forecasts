...Excessive Southwestern Heat Persists into Next Week...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave under upper ridging will continue for the
Great Basin to CA and the Southwest into early next week with
temperatures 10-20F above normal through Tuesday. Several daily
high temperature records are likely through Tuesday in these
areas. The model consensus is leading to gradually lowering
heights with a developing modest northwest US trough, with the
highest heights drifting south into southern CA/AZ.

With high along over the southeast, another area with above normal
temperatures will be the mid Atlantic to the lower Great Lakes/NY.
This includes the Washington, DC to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and
New York City corridor.

The forecast indicates potential for showers/thunderstorms over
the Southwest/Southern Rockies with pockets of enhanced 700 mb
relative humidity in place to support diurnal activity with
instability peaking each afternoon/evening.

Locally heavy rainfall may occur along a slow moving front in the
Midwest to the lower MS Valley on Sunday as fueled by
return/pooling Gulf Moisture and instability. A break develops
with the front decaying afterward.  The next frontal wave brings
heavy rainfall potential into Iowa and Missouri Wed and Thu 15
July, possibly developing into the adjacent Midwest and Ohio
Valley by the end of next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of guidance from the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS, 12 UTC operational
ECMWF/Canadian global. The guidance is in better than average
agreement in the anticyclone over the southwest and southeast.
The primary differences are the timing/amplitude of the 700-500 mb
trough over the Northwest coming into the mean upper Midwest and
then Great Lakes trough. An equally weighted solution among the
12z ECMWF/12z Canadian/18z GFS/18z GEFS Mean was used to mitigate
the differences.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1218 AM CDT Fri Jul 09 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST IDAHO...SOUTHERN
WYOMING...NORTHEAST UTAH...NORTHWEST COLORADO...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave will progress out of the Northwest and into
parts of the northern Rockies today. An upper-level ridge will
remain anchored in the Four Corners. At the surface, a modest lee
cyclone will develop in the central Plains.

...Northeastern Great Basin into southern Wyoming...
A combination of moderate to strong mid-level flow and surface low
development east of the Divide will promote 15-25 mph winds across
southern Idaho and Wyoming into northern Utah and northwest
Colorado. Afternoon RH will range from 10-20%. Sustained critical
conditions are most likely from eastern portions of the Snake River
Plain into southwestern Wyoming.

...Portions of Colorado Western Slope...
Mid-level moisture within the Four Corners ridge will again support
thunderstorm development across parts of western Colorado. PWAT
values will range from 0.4-0.6 inches in this area. Though storm
motions will not be overly quick, dry boundary layer conditions will
keep most storms dry. Fuels remain critically dry in most locations,
though they become more marginal near the Divide.

...Western Montana...
With the approach of the shortwave trough, elevated thunderstorms
are possible early in the forecast period. These storms will be fast
moving with relatively dry air beneath them. Dry fuels will support
a threat for lightning ignitions. Towards the afternoon, additional
thunderstorms may develop along the higher terrain and move
eastward. These storms may initially be a mix of wet and dry modes
before transitioning to primarily wet as they move into better
moisture.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0120 AM CDT Fri Jul 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
The Four Corners upper-level ridge will intensify and retrograde
westward on Saturday. The mid-level trough in the northern Rockies
will move eastward before dropping southward, around the ridge, into
the central Plains. At the surface, cooler air will move southward
into the northern/central Rockies and adjacent Plains.

Locally elevated conditions are possible in portions of the West.
Strong heating in the Columbia Basin will drive gap winds through
the Cascades amid dry surface conditions. In the northern Great
Basin, modest mid-level winds may mix to the surface, but the
surface pattern will be quite weak. Isolated thunderstorms are
possible  in parts of the Sierra as well as western Colorado. With
the upper-level ridge intensifying, the overall coverage of dry
storms appears too low for highlights.

...Central/Eastern Utah and adjacent western Colorado...
The greatest potential for sustained elevated fire weather
conditions will exist in parts of the eastern Great Basin. Modest
mid-level winds will combine with an enhanced surface pressure
gradient behind the passing front to bring 15-20 mph northerly winds
to the region. RH could fall into the single digits, though most
areas will see 10-20% by the afternoon.

...Tropical Storm Elsa to produce gusty winds, heavy rain, and
coastal flooding for the Northeast states...

...Flooding and strong storms possible for the Texas Gulf Coast
and portions of the Midwest...

...Dangerous heat for much of the West and peaking this the
weekend...


Tropical Storm Elsa continues to make steady progress
northeastward across the Mid-Atlantic coast and will accelerate in
forward progress as it crosses coastal portions of New England on
Friday.  This will bring a swath of heavy from New Jersey to
eastern Maine through Friday evening before exiting over
southeastern Canada, with the potential for 2-4 inch rainfall
totals with locally higher amounts possible.  Gusty winds in
excess of 40 mph will be possible with any convection that
develops in association with Elsa, especially east of the storm
track.  Some coastal flooding at times of high tide can also be
expected.  The National Hurricane Center has the latest
information regarding Tropical Storm Elsa.

Heavy rainfall will also be making weather headlines across the
Midwest and portions of the Texas Gulf Coast.  A slow moving
frontal boundary is expected to exist between the Ohio Valley and
Central Plains through at least Saturday night along with an upper
level disturbance approaching from the Northern Plains.  This will
aid in the development of multiple mesoscale convective systems
that could repeatedly affect the same general areas, particularly
from Iowa to Indiana where several inches of rainfall will be
possible along with numerous strong to severe storms.  Farther
south across southeast Texas, more tropical downpours are expected
during the day on Friday with moisture laden onshore flow in
association with a weak mid-level disturbance.  Severe flooding
has already been an issue here, and the additional slow moving
showers/storms will only aggravate the potential for more flooding
on Friday.  The good news is that there should be an abatement in
the coverage of rainfall and intensity by Friday night and beyond
for the Texas Gulf Coast.

In the temperature department, excessive heat will continue across
much of the Western U.S. as daytime highs soar well above normal
with highs well into the 90s for much of the Great Basin and
widespread 100+ degree readings for valley locations, with the
heat worsening across the Southwest by this weekend.  Numerous
daily high temperature records could be in jeopardy of being
broken, particularly for California and Nevada.  Highs could
approach 115-120 degrees for the lower elevations of Arizona and
eastern California this weekend!  Much above normal temperatures
will also be present across the Rockies and Central Plains on
Friday, with some daily record high readings possible.  For parts
of the Great Basin and Northern/Central Rockies, the combined hot
and dry conditions may lead to a critical risk for fire weather
through the end of the week, particularly where Red Flag Warnings
remain in effect between northern California and Wyoming.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA...

No changes. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 09/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Mon Sep 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the wake of an upper-level trough moving across the northern
Rockies this morning, strong northwesterly flow aloft will extend
from the Pacific Northwest into the central Great Basin.  In
response at the surface, high pressure will build into the northern
Intermountain West increasing the pressure gradient across
California.

...Northern California...
Low-level northerly winds have increased across the region this
morning per VAD wind profiles, indicating wind speeds over 40 mph
around 1 kft above the ground.  While the low-level winds will
weaken and become more easterly through the afternoon, the surface
pressure gradient will continue to increase through the morning,
resulting in sustained surface winds over 20 mph.  As heating and
mixing commence at sunrise, RH values will fall below critical
values by mid morning, resulting in a few hours of overlapping
critical winds and RH values.

...Southern California...
Locally elevated fire weather conditions are possible across Los
Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties as the surface pressure
gradient supports offshore flow resulting in dry and breezy
conditions in terrain-favored locations.

...Heavy rainfall expected to continue pushing through the
Northeast U.S. Friday into Saturday...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The longwave trough that is currently crossing the Great Plains is
forecast to evolve into a closed upper low over the Midwest on
Wednesday before lifting north into Ontario as it interacts with a
potent wave or low approaching from the Canadian Prairies. These
interacting systems over/north of the Great Lakes causes the cold
front to slow over the Northeast, potentially struggling to clear
Maine this weekend. West of the Great Lakes trough/low is an
amplifying ridge with an axis over the Intermountain West/northern
Rockies by Saturday. An upper low gets trapped under the ridge
near the southern California coast Friday well into the weekend
that should direct Pacific moisture northeastward across portions
of the Desert Southwest.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Substantial model uncertainty continues with the evolving upper
low over the Great Lakes/Ontario Thursday into this weekend,
particularly in how it interacts with the approaching wave from
the Canadian Prairies Thursday night into Friday. Given the
disparate solutions in depth/timing/whether or not the systems
phase maintains a below average forecast confidence for much of
the northeastern CONUS while near to above average for the
remainder of the CONUS. The 06Z GFS continues to be the most
progressive solution, with the most aggressive northward push from
the Midwest Thursday night which results in nearly no phasing and
a stronger resultant low over the Great Lakes with a much faster
cold frontal progression through the Northeast. The 00Z
UKMET/ECMWF/CMC are considerably slower in lifting the low from
the Midwest Thursday night while the 00Z ECMWF is the farthest
north with the approaching central Canadian trough/low. None of
the guidance fully phases the two lows, but the strong trough from
the ECMWF and deeper low from the CMC make for a slow cold frontal
solution with the UKMET focusing a low Friday night just north of
Lake Superior makes for a cold front with timing between the much
faster GFS and slower ECMWF/CMC. Therefore, as a bridge to the
previous WPC forecast that included some of the GFS (which was not
as progressive as the 06Z solution), the preferred model blend for
the fronts/pressures leans heavily on the 00Z UKMET through Day 5
before going exclusively with an even blend of the 06Z GEFS and
00Z CMCE/ECENS which are in acceptable agreement with the large
scale wave pattern of the trough over the West Coast, ridge over
the central CONUS, and troughing in the east.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread moderate to heavy-at-times rain looks to slow in its
progression through the Northeast Friday, lingering over much of
New England on Saturday, and over Down East Maine on Sunday as the
cold front intercepts a deep plume of moisture. The potential
remains for widespread 1-2 inch rainfall totals with isolated
amounts up to 3 inches possible Thursday night through Friday
night east from the Hudson Valley. There may be some instances of
flooding if higher rainfall rates repeatedly affect the same areas
and for the pockets of areas with recent heavy rain. There may be
some strong thunderstorms as well, but the overall severe
potential appears limited for now.

In terms of temperatures, it will feel fall-like behind the cold
front across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic through Friday with
dry conditions and temperatures 5 to 10 degrees below normal. The
opposite will hold true across much of the western U.S. as a
warming trend is likely to commence by Friday in response to a
building upper level ridge, with highs expected to be on the order
of 10 to 20 degrees above normal across the northern High Plains
Sunday, expanding southeastward to the southern Plains and Midwest
for Monday. Meanwhile, temperatures should return to seasonal
averages for the eastern third of the nation Sunday into Monday.

...Heavy rainfall expected to continue pushing through the
Northeast U.S. Friday into Saturday...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The longwave trough that is currently crossing the Great Plains is
forecast to evolve into a closed upper low over the Midwest on
Wednesday before lifting north into Ontario as it interacts with a
potent wave or low approaching from the Canadian Prairies. These
interacting systems over/north of the Great Lakes causes the cold
front to slow over the Northeast, potentially struggling to clear
Maine this weekend. West of the Great Lakes trough/low is an
amplifying ridge with an axis over the Intermountain West/northern
Rockies by Saturday. An upper low gets trapped under the ridge
near the southern California coast Friday well into the weekend
that should direct Pacific moisture northeastward across portions
of the Desert Southwest.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Substantial model uncertainty continues with the evolving upper
low over the Great Lakes/Ontario Thursday into this weekend,
particularly in how it interacts with the approaching wave from
the Canadian Prairies Thursday night into Friday. Given the
disparate solutions in depth/timing/whether or not the systems
phase maintains a below average forecast confidence for much of
the northeastern CONUS while near to above average for the
remainder of the CONUS. The 06Z GFS continues to be the most
progressive solution, with the most aggressive northward push from
the Midwest Thursday night which results in nearly no phasing and
a stronger resultant low over the Great Lakes with a much faster
cold frontal progression through the Northeast. The 00Z
UKMET/ECMWF/CMC are considerably slower in lifting the low from
the Midwest Thursday night while the 00Z ECMWF is the farthest
north with the approaching central Canadian trough/low. None of
the guidance fully phases the two lows, but the strong trough from
the ECMWF and deeper low from the CMC make for a slow cold frontal
solution with the UKMET focusing a low Friday night just north of
Lake Superior makes for a cold front with timing between the much
faster GFS and slower ECMWF/CMC. Therefore, as a bridge to the
previous WPC forecast that included some of the GFS (which was not
as progressive as the 06Z solution), the preferred model blend for
the fronts/pressures leans heavily on the 00Z UKMET through Day 5
before going exclusively with an even blend of the 06Z GEFS and
00Z CMCE/ECENS which are in acceptable agreement with the large
scale wave pattern of the trough over the West Coast, ridge over
the central CONUS, and troughing in the east.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread moderate to heavy-at-times rain looks to slow in its
progression through the Northeast Friday, lingering over much of
New England on Saturday, and over Down East Maine on Sunday as the
cold front intercepts a deep plume of moisture. The potential
remains for widespread 1-2 inch rainfall totals with isolated
amounts up to 3 inches possible Thursday night through Friday
night east from the Hudson Valley. There may be some instances of
flooding if higher rainfall rates repeatedly affect the same areas
and for the pockets of areas with recent heavy rain. There may be
some strong thunderstorms as well, but the overall severe
potential appears limited for now.

In terms of temperatures, it will feel fall-like behind the cold
front across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic through Friday with
dry conditions and temperatures 5 to 10 degrees below normal. The
opposite will hold true across much of the western U.S. as a
warming trend is likely to commence by Friday in response to a
building upper level ridge, with highs expected to be on the order
of 10 to 20 degrees above normal across the northern High Plains
Sunday, expanding southeastward to the southern Plains and Midwest
for Monday. Meanwhile, temperatures should return to seasonal
averages for the eastern third of the nation Sunday into Monday.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 20 2021

SYNOPSIS: A broad area of mid-level high pressure is forecast to persist over
much of the lower 48 states which is likely to result in anomalously warm
temperatures across the central U.S. Conversely, below normal temperatures are
favored for much of Mainland Alaska due to the presence of mid-level low
pressure. Although periods of light to moderate precipitation are expected for
the Alaska Panhandle during week-2, heavy precipitation is unlikely.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures for the Great Plains, Tue-Sat,
Sep 28-Oct 2.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of Mainland Alaska,
Tue-Thu, Sep 28-30.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 23 - MONDAY SEPTEMBER 27:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!o_2GuW8jX-ukp4Et8b2W3v-HVTutEiX5bU_QyU0yffxAH8nR7cd1ecC2LSYGBPhKvKJNnU0M$

FOR TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 28 - MONDAY OCTOBER 04: Excellent model agreement and
continuity continues regarding a high amplitude ridge centered over the Great
Plains, beginning by early next week and likely persisting through the start
of
October. Ensemble means depict 500-hPa height departures of +30 to +120 meters
from the Great Plains east to the Mississippi Valley. Although maximum
temperatures and heat index values are forecast to remain below heat advisory
criteria, given the time of year, a slight risk of much above normal
temperatures is posted for the Great Plains since the anomalous warmth is
likely to be noteworthy and may lead to intensifying and developing drought.
Based on the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools, a slight risk of much above
normal temperatures (Sep 28 to Oct 2) is posted for much of the Great Plains
where there is a 20 to 40 percent chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the
85th percentile of the climatological distribution. Maximum temperatures are
expected to range from the 70s across the Dakotas to the low to mid 90s across
the southern Great Plains. The rapidly drying fuels may also result in
elevated
wildfire danger, especially across the southern Great Plains and Ozarks
region,
during the next two weeks.



An amplified 500-hPa trough favors below normal temperatures throughout
Alaska.
Due to its better skill recently, the GEFS reforecast was preferred in
outlining the slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of
Mainland Alaska early in week-2. The outlined area includes where the GEFS
reforecast tool indicates that minimum temperatures have at least a 20 percent
chance of falling into the lowest 15th percentile of the climatological
distribution and below 20 degrees F. The ECMWF reforecast tool is the coldest
model solution and shows around a 20 percent chance of subzero lows across the
North Slope of Alaska.



Tropical Storms Peter and Rose recently developed in the Main Development
Region (MDR) of the Atlantic, but both are forecast to weaken this week due to
increased vertical wind shear. As of 2pm EDT on Sep 20, the  National
Hurricane
Center states that there is an 80 percent chance of tropical cyclone (TC)
development across the eastern tropical Atlantic during the next five days.
GFS
ensemble members depict this potential TC turning northward before reaching 70
degrees W longitude, but the potential exists that it could move close to the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. During early October, TC development
typically shifts from the MDR of the Atlantic to the Caribbean Sea.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon September 20 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 26 - 30 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
Arctic region and stretches from northern Alaska to the Gulf of Alaska.
Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over most Mainland Alaska and
Alaska Panhandle, while positive 500-hPa height anomalies are favored over the
Aleutians. A ridge and associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over much of the western and central CONUS. A trough is predicted
over the eastern CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights anticipated across
the
East coast.

Above normal temperatures are favored for most of the western and central
CONUS due to the persistent ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights over
the region and also consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. A
predicted trough over the eastern CONUS leads to enhanced probabilities of
near to below normal temperatures over the region except for the Maine, where
above normal temperatures are indicated. Below normal temperature
probabilities
are elevated over Alaska underneath predicted trouging and below normal 500-
hPa
heights.

Near to above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the western
CONUS due to a forecast trough over the Gulf of Alaska and potential storm
system development. Below normal precipitation is likely for most of the
central and eastern underneath forecast ridging and above normal 500-hPa
heights. A predicted trough over the northeastern CONUS enhanced probabilities
of above normal precipitation over the Maine. Troughing and associated surface
low pressure over the Gulf of Alaska increases the odds of above normal
precipitation over parts of southeastern Alaska and the Panhandle due to
increased southerly flow. Below normal precipitation probabilities are
increased over western Mainland Alaska due to being farther displaced from the
forecast surface low pressure.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 28 - OCT 04, 2021

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement with a
somewhat amplified 500-hPa circulation pattern continuing over North America
for the week-2 period. Anomalous ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights are
forecast over the western Aleutians, while a trough and below normal 500-hPa
heights are predicted over Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, and the Gulf
of Alaska. Forecast riding and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast
over much of CONUS except for the Gulf Coast where weak negative height
anomalies are indicated.

Anomalous ridging with above normal 500-hPa heights increases chances of above
normal temperatures over most of the western and central CONUS as well as
Maine. Below normal temperatures are favored over Florida under below normal
500-hPa heights. Near normal temperatures are likely over parts of the eastern
CONUS, consistent with the ERF operational autoblend forecast tool. Predicted
troughing across Alaska and associated north to northwesterly mid-level flow
favor increased probabilities of below normal temperatures across most of the
state, while above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over the
western Aleutians, under above normal 500-hPa heights.

Near to above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the western
CONUS due to a forecast trough over the Gulf of Alaska. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored across most of the central and eastern CONUS, under
the broad ridging and positive 500-hPa heights. The eastward progression of
the
trough over the Gulf of Alaska toward the west coast of British Columbia
favors
increased chances for above normal precipitation across the Panhandle. Near to
below normal precipitation probabilities are increased for the remainder of
the
state, on the backside of the trough.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Mon Sep 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to deepen as it moves across the
central Plains on Tuesday while an upper-level ridge moves eastward
across the Great Basin.  At the surface, a cold front will progress
eastward across the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys as high pressure
builds into the central Plains.

...Southern California...
The surface pressure gradient will continue to support offshore dry
and breezy winds on Tuesday across Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa
Barbara Counties, promoting locally elevated fire weather
conditions.  As the surface high pressure moves eastward toward the
central Plains, the pressure gradient will relax late on Tuesday
resulting in weakening offshore flow.

...Southern Plains...
Although northerly winds are likely to exceed 20 mph on Tuesday
across portions of southern Oklahoma and northern Texas in the wake
of the cold front, RH values are expected to stay above critical
thresholds given the relatively cool temperatures behind the front,
limiting the fire weather concerns.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southeast, Tennessee Valley, and the Southern Appalachians through
Tuesday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley through Tuesday morning...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of Northern
California through Tuesday morning...

Upper-level energy over the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio
Valleys and abundant moisture over the Southeast/Tennessee Valley
into parts of the Ohio Valley will produce showers and
thunderstorms over the region. Some of the thunderstorms will
produce heavy rain. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Southeast, Tennessee Valley,
and the Southern Appalachians through Tuesday morning.  The
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable. The excessive rainfall threat continues over parts of
the Southeast and Southern Appalachians on Tuesday into Wednesday
morning.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Upper Midwest roughly
southwestward to the Southern Rockies will move eastward to the
Lower Great Lakes and the Eastern Gulf Coast by Wednesday evening.
 Showers and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the
boundary over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great
Lakes, moving into the Great Lakes to Middle Mississippi Valley by
Tuesday morning.  Some of the thunderstorms will become severe.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley
through Tuesday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

On Tuesday, the severe thunderstorm threat decreasing, while the
threat of excessive rainfall develops over parts of the Great
Lakes and Ohio Valley. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable on
Tuesday into Wednesday morning. As the boundary moves eastward,
the excessive rainfall threat moves into the Lower Great
Lakes/Ohio Valley and the Central Appalachians on Wednesday.

Elsewhere, gusty winds and lowering humidity over parts of
Northern California have increased the threat of fire weather over
the area.  Therefore, the SPC has issued a Critical Risk of fire
weather over parts of Northern California through Tuesday morning.
As a result, Red Flag Warnings are over parts of Northern
California.  Additionally, Freeze watches are over parts of the
Northern/Central Rockies.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1235 AM CDT Tue Sep 21 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
A surface cold front will continue to push south and east across the
southern Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley today as an
upper-level trough continues to deepen over the south-central CONUS.
Dry air advecting in behind this front, combined with breezy
pressure-gradient winds, should support at least low-end fire
weather concerns over the southern Plains. Elsewhere, recent
rainfall and/or a weak flow pattern will mitigate additional fire
weather concerns.

...Southern Plains...
Early morning surface observations show breezy conditions ongoing
across much of OK and northern TX behind a southward-sagging cold
front. Building surface high pressure over the central High Plains
will maintain the pressure gradient and breezy conditions through
the day. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph appear likely, and gusts
up to 25-30 mph are probable. Surface observations also show dry air
advecting southward out of western KS where dewpoints are in the low
40s. Despite much cooler temperatures, this unseasonably dry air may
support RH reductions into the 20-30% range. Areas of elevated
conditions are likely this afternoon across northwest TX and
southwest OK where ERC values are in the 80-85th percentile and
wetting rainfall has not occurred for around 30 days for some
locations.

...Heavy rainfall expected to continue pushing through the
Northeast and New England Friday into Saturday...

...Weather Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...
A closed upper level low evolving over the Great Lakes and
Northeast later this week will lift northward into Hudson Bay
region as another shortwave trough is forecast to drop south over
the Great Lakes this weekend into early next week then closing
off. Overall, troughing over the central/eastern U.S. and ridging
over the Southwest U.S. is expected to be the main upper level
pattern through the period. There is substantial model uncertainty
with respect to the evolution of the closed upper low over the
Great Lakes on Day 3/4 and how the next system evolves this
weekend as well. The 18Z GFS was a considerable outlier with its
flatter 500 mb pattern and subsequent faster/progressive solution.
This wasn't supported by the ensemble means or other deterministic
guidance which favors a slower solution with a deeper/pronounced
closed upper low on day 3. As a result, much of the 18Z GFS wasn't
included in the WPC blend preference. An early look at the 00Z
suggests some improvement in agreement toward the a solution for
later this week and weekend however. The slower solution does
favor a stubbornly slow cold front passage across the
Northeast/New England which allows for additional moisture to lift
northward ahead of the front. Combined with the favorable forcing
for ascent, streaks of heavier precipitation will be likely on day
3/4 across portions of New England. The secondary upper level low
that approaches late in the weekend will likely keep unsettled
weather in place.

Elsewhere, model agreement is average to above average with just
minor timing differences and model biases seen with an approaching
system for the Pacific Northwest days 6/7. A cutoff low over
southern California has some model differences again where the GFS
is a bit too fast. Its impacts on potential precipitation for the
Southwest U.S. are notable where the GFS is much drier compared to
the slower ECMWF/CMC which allows for moisture to be drawn
northward longer. The WPC blend preference was mainly a non-GFS
blend, favoring the 12Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and followed later in the
periods with mostly ECENS/NAEFS ensemble means. This favored well
with continuity while adjusting toward the latest trends in the
guidance.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Expect lingering rain, some of which could be locally heavy, along
and ahead of the slow moving cold front across the Northeast and
New England on Friday into Saturday. The second system in its wake
will bring additional showers and possibly thunderstorms to the
Great Lakes region through the weekend. Meanwhile, a
stationary/stalled frontal boundary draped across central/south
Florida will bring daily chances of diurnally driven
thunderstorms. Much of the rest of the country will be relatively
dry, minus for potential showers and storms across California and
Nevada associated with the weak closed upper level low late this
weekend into early next week.

Cooler, fall-like temperatures will prevail across the
central/eastern U.S. Friday into weekend in the wake of the cold
front passages. Highs 5-10 below normal are expected while
nighttime lows up to 10F below normal are likely, particularly
across the Gulf Coast region. Meanwhile, upper level ridging will
promote above normal readings for the western U.S. with highs/lows
5F to as much as 10F above normal.

...Heavy rainfall expected to continue pushing through the
Northeast and New England Friday into Saturday...

...Weather Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...
A closed upper level low evolving over the Great Lakes and
Northeast later this week will lift northward into Hudson Bay
region as another shortwave trough is forecast to drop south over
the Great Lakes this weekend into early next week then closing
off. Overall, troughing over the central/eastern U.S. and ridging
over the Southwest U.S. is expected to be the main upper level
pattern through the period. There is substantial model uncertainty
with respect to the evolution of the closed upper low over the
Great Lakes on Day 3/4 and how the next system evolves this
weekend as well. The 18Z GFS was a considerable outlier with its
flatter 500 mb pattern and subsequent faster/progressive solution.
This wasn't supported by the ensemble means or other deterministic
guidance which favors a slower solution with a deeper/pronounced
closed upper low on day 3. As a result, much of the 18Z GFS wasn't
included in the WPC blend preference. An early look at the 00Z
suggests some improvement in agreement toward the a solution for
later this week and weekend however. The slower solution does
favor a stubbornly slow cold front passage across the
Northeast/New England which allows for additional moisture to lift
northward ahead of the front. Combined with the favorable forcing
for ascent, streaks of heavier precipitation will be likely on day
3/4 across portions of New England. The secondary upper level low
that approaches late in the weekend will likely keep unsettled
weather in place.

Elsewhere, model agreement is average to above average with just
minor timing differences and model biases seen with an approaching
system for the Pacific Northwest days 6/7. A cutoff low over
southern California has some model differences again where the GFS
is a bit too fast. Its impacts on potential precipitation for the
Southwest U.S. are notable where the GFS is much drier compared to
the slower ECMWF/CMC which allows for moisture to be drawn
northward longer. The WPC blend preference was mainly a non-GFS
blend, favoring the 12Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and followed later in the
periods with mostly ECENS/NAEFS ensemble means. This favored well
with continuity while adjusting toward the latest trends in the
guidance.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Expect lingering rain, some of which could be locally heavy, along
and ahead of the slow moving cold front across the Northeast and
New England on Friday into Saturday. The second system in its wake
will bring additional showers and possibly thunderstorms to the
Great Lakes region through the weekend. Meanwhile, a
stationary/stalled frontal boundary draped across central/south
Florida will bring daily chances of diurnally driven
thunderstorms. Much of the rest of the country will be relatively
dry, minus for potential showers and storms across California and
Nevada associated with the weak closed upper level low late this
weekend into early next week.

Cooler, fall-like temperatures will prevail across the
central/eastern U.S. Friday into weekend in the wake of the cold
front passages. Highs 5-10 below normal are expected while
nighttime lows up to 10F below normal are likely, particularly
across the Gulf Coast region. Meanwhile, upper level ridging will
promote above normal readings for the western U.S. with highs/lows
5F to as much as 10F above normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0135 AM CDT Tue Sep 21 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper-level trough is expected to move through the
Pacific Northwest on Wednesday, resulting in increasing low and
mid-level winds. Despite recent rainfall over the western CONUS,
parts of the northern Sierra/northwest Great Basin and northern
Rockies/High Plains remain dry and may see elevated fire weather
conditions evolve as winds increase through the day.

...Northwest Nevada...
Zonal mid-level flow is forecast to increase with the approach and
passage of a progressive shortwave trough. This will result in
strengthening downslope flow off the northern Sierra into northwest
NV. High-res and ensemble guidance suggests winds between 15-20 mph
are probable and will be coincident with RH reductions into the
teens. Although ERC values have fallen in recent days, many
locations report values above the 50th percentile, which will
support at least a low-end fire weather concern. Elevated conditions
may extend as far east as northeast NV, but confidence in this
scenario is low.

...Northern Montana...
A deepening surface low over the Canadian Prairies will augment west
to southwesterly pressure-gradient winds over northern MT through
the day. Sustained winds in the upper teens are expected, and some
degree of downslope warming/drying will support RH values in the
15-25% range. While some locations have seen recent rainfall, fuels
remain dry within the precipitation gaps, and may be receptive to
fire spread given the expected wind/RH combinations. Locally
critical conditions are possible in the immediate lee of the terrain
of western MT, but widespread critical conditions are not
anticipated.

...Slow-moving cold front to bring heavy rains to portions of the
Great Lakes, Ohio and Tennessee valleys on Tuesday...

...Additional heavy rains likely from the coastal Carolinas to the
southern Appalachians on Tuesday...

...Developing area of low pressure to bring heavy rains and breezy
conditions to portions of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley on
Wednesday...

A strong cold front will continue to slowly push east today,
providing a focus for showers thunderstorms from the Great Lakes
to southern Texas.  While severe thunderstorms are not expected,
heavy rainfall is likely, with scattered flash flooding possible,
especially from the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys northeastward
across Lower Michigan.

An area of low pressure moving north along the front is expected
to strengthen as it tracks through the Ohio Valley into the Great
Lakes Wednesday into early Thursday -- producing breezy conditions
and additional heavy rains.  Heavy rainfall accumulations are
likely, with scattered flash flooding possible from Lower Michigan
and northern Ohio into the upper Ohio Valley and along the central
Appalachians.

Meanwhile, moist onshore winds north of a stalled frontal boundary
over the Southeast will support additional heavy rains, with
scattered flash flooding possible across portions of the Carolinas
and the southern Appalachians on Tuesday.  Heaviest rainfall
amounts on Tuesday are expected to occur along the South Carolina
and southeastern North Carolina coasts, as well as along the
southern Blue Ridge Mountains.  Additional heavy rains are
expected across the mountains as the front moves through on
Wednesday, before drying out as the front pushes east of the
region on Thursday.

Elsewhere, high pressure and dry conditions can be expected
through midweek across much of the Great Plains and western U.S.
Above-normal temperatures along the West Coast on Tuesday are
forecast to spread east, with much of the western half of the
country expected to see seasonal to above-normal temperatures on
Wednesday.  One exception will be the Pacific Northwest, where a
cold front will drop through, bringing cooler temperatures into
the region on Wednesday.

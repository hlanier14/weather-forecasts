Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1018 AM CST Sun Feb 13 2022

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

The overall forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments. The
elevated area across the central High Plains was expanded to account
for dry and windy conditions across southeastern WY, western NE and
northern CO. Lingering snow cover should limit the southward extent
of available fuels in CO, but elevated fire weather conditions
appear likely given gusty downslope winds and low humidity. Across
southern California, surface pressure gradients should continue to
weaken through the day. While winds will decrease, very dry and warm
conditions will support elevated fire weather concerns through the
afternoon. For more information please see the previous discussion.

..Lyons.. 02/13/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0130 AM CST Sun Feb 13 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will linger across portions of coastal
southern California, and will likely develop across parts of the
central Plains. Elevated conditions are possible across parts of the
Southeast, but modest fuels will limit the overall threat.
Elsewhere, cool conditions and recent precipitation will mitigate
additional fire weather concerns.

...Southern California...
Winds across the higher terrain of coastal southern CA have been
diminishing over the past 12-24 hours, and this trend is expected to
continue for today as the regional pressure gradient weakens.
However, wind gusts into the 20-30 mph range are being reported this
morning and will likely continue into the early afternoon -
especially for wind prone locations along the southern CA coast. As
winds become more easterly through mid day, stronger downslope winds
will primarily become focused across Orange and San Diego counties.
Persistent downslope flow and record warm temperatures over the past
few days has maintained low RH in the teens/low 20s and helped dry
fine fuels. Despite the slowly diminishing winds, areas of elevated
conditions appear likely for the first half of the day.

...Central High Plains...
Lee troughing is forecast to persist through the day along the
northern to central High Plains. Winds are forecast to increase into
the 15-25 mph range, and gusts up to 30-40 mph are possible. Morning
dewpoint observations show a pocket of drier conditions across
central WY, and this air mass will likely shift into the central
High Plains this afternoon. RH reductions into the low 20s are
possible given the downslope trajectories, and fuels across much of
this region are unseasonably dry outside of areas with recent
snowfall. As such, fire weather conditions appear probable for at
least a few hours this afternoon.

...Southeast...
Dry post-frontal winds are expected to increase to around 15 mph
this afternoon across southeast AL into central GA. Mostly clear
skies and modest boundary-layer mixing should allow RH values to
fall into the 25-35% range for a few hours this afternoon. While
elevated fire weather conditions are possible, recent 10 and
100-hour fuel moisture analyses suggest fuels are not overly
supportive of fire spread, which precludes a risk highlight.

...Mid-late week system to bring potential for heavy rain and
severe weather from the south-central to eastern U.S. and wintry
weather from the Midwest through Great Lakes and interior
Northeast...

...Overview...

An upper trough/low that is likely to be centered near the Four
Corners early Wednesday and then phase with a Plains/east-central
U.S. mean trough as it continues eastward will be produce the most
active weather over the lower 48 during the forecast period. The
ejecting upper system will lead to surface cyclogenesis and strong
frontal systems in the central U.S., drawing moisture northward
from the Gulf of Mexico and producing notable precipitation from
the Plains eastward next Wednesday and Thursday. Expect rain and
thunderstorms in southern areas, while snow and wintry weather are
likely on the northern and western side of the precipitation
shield across the central Rockies/Plains and through the Midwest,
Great Lakes, and interior Northeast. There is still uncertainty in
the precise axis of meaningful snow though. By Friday-Saturday
expect a clipper system tracking near the Canadian border to bring
a cold front into the northern tier and some snow into the Great
Lakes while a steadily weakening (but initially quite strong)
eastern Pacific upper ridge drifts toward the West Coast. Another
Pacific upper trough with leading frontal system may reach the
West Coast by Sunday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The agreement in the overall pattern and the forecast philosophy
in response to guidance behavior remains fairly consistent. The
multi-day trend has been weaker/faster for the Plains through
eastern Great Lakes evolution of the system affecting the
central/eastern U.S. mid-late week, but with good continuity for
intensification from the eastern Great Lakes onward in response to
northern stream dynamics. CMC runs have been persistently
different from the majority cluster--tending to be weaker and more
sheared but lately showing improved definition for low pressure
over the eastern half of the country albeit with a more southern
track. The GFS has actually trended a bit stronger with its
surface low over the past 12 hours of runs through the 12Z cycle
and the consensus average has nudged a fraction west with its
precip shield versus previous cycle. Thus it is hoped that
guidance may be starting to stabilize better around a midpoint
even with some shuffling of individual runs in response to
lingering differences in details of northern stream flow and
energy reaching the western U.S. A composite of the 06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF/UKMET continued to provide the best template for the
evolution of this system, with only modest nudges from continuity.

As for the rest of the forecast, clustering still looks better
than average for the system expected to track near the Canadian
border around Friday-Saturday in response to strong western Canada
flow settling into the east-central North America mean trough.
Spread/variability with exact amplitude of the resulting upper
trough lead to some differences with the timing and southward
extent of the trailing front reaching into the central and eastern
U.S. Noticeable differences exist for the Pacific trough
approaching the West Coast. GFS runs have varied within the middle
to slower part of the envelope, with the new 12Z run being one of
the slower versions. ECMWF runs have been fairly stable in the
middle so far, while the 00Z CMC was a bit fast but adjusted back
some in the 12Z cycle. Latest GEFS means are slower than the 00Z
ECMWF mean but not as slow as the 12Z GFS. Some of the spread for
this trough may be due to uncertainty over how much if any energy
may separate from the southern part of the feature farther
upstream (as seen in 00Z and new 12Z ECMWF differences). A weak
shortwave that may drop into the West ahead of this trough is
rather small in scale and has below average predictability, with
low confidence in a specific solution.

This cycle's forecast considerations led to a starting blend
consisting of the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF/12Z UKMET for the first half
of the period, followed by some inclusion of the 06Z GEFS/00Z
ECMWF means along with the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Showers and thunderstorms will become widespread over the central
U.S. on Wednesday into Thursday as surface low pressure
consolidates in the High Plains and advects substantial moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the Plains,
Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, and eventually the
Appalachians and Eastern Seaboard. Strong storms are possible,
with the Storm Prediction Center outlook showing some severe
threat for parts of the southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi
and Tennessee Valleys and vicinity on Wednesday and Thursday.
There could also be flash flooding concerns where heavy rainfall
occurs, possibly in similar regions and spreading toward much of
the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday and Thursday night. Current
forecasts show the Southern Appalachians could see particularly
high rainfall totals given terrain enhancement there. Continue to
monitor forecasts as uncertain details of these potential threats
become better refined. At the same time, expect a band of snow in
the colder air on the northwestern periphery of the system. The
best potential for meaningful accumulations currently extends from
central parts of the Plains and Midwest/Middle Mississippi Valley
into the Great Lakes region and interior New England, while mixed
precipitation/ice cannot be ruled out in the transition zone
between the snow and rain. Totals/location of any snow will be
very sensitive to precise strength and track of the system given
that wintry weather could be within a fairly narrow band.
Probabilistic forecasts of 0.25 inch liquid in the form of snow
reflect the uncertainty in this aspect of the forecast, with
values generally below 50 percent for any particular location but
with a decent signal that there should be a band of enhanced snow
somewhere within the favored zone. Gusty winds are possible with
the system as well, and at this point appear most likely near the
Northeast coast on Thursday night in strong southerly flow ahead
of the quickly strengthening surface low.

Dry conditions should prevail over much of the lower 48 behind
this system. By Friday or Saturday the system along the Canadian
border may bring some snow into the Upper Great Lakes while light
precipitation may reach the northern Pacific Northwest/Rockies by
Friday, with light to locally moderate precipitation spreading
southeastward farther into the West by Sunday. Some moisture may
linger over the far Southeast/Florida. Confidence in coverage and
intensity of rainfall is still on the lower side but helped by a
lighter trend in recent GFS runs which had been a heavy extreme.

The change and progression of the overall pattern will be evident
in temperatures over the course of next week, as warmer than
average temperatures push eastward ahead of the trough/frontal
system and cooler temperatures spread behind the cold front. Highs
of 10-20F above average and lows 15-30F above normal will be
shunted from the southern half of the Plains into the Mississippi
and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys Wednesday into the Eastern Seaboard on
Thursday. Daily records could be set for some locations,
especially for warm lows in the East on Thursday, while a few
record high maxima could be challenged as well. On the backside of
the front, temperatures should flip to near or below average, with
some 10-20F below average readings possible over parts of the
central/east-central U.S. mid-late week and then moderating closer
to the East Coast. Coldest anomalies should be over/near Minnesota
around Thursday with some places 20-30F below normal. An
increasing portion of the West and eventually the northern/central
Plains should warm up to above average once again by the end of
the week into the weekend. Parts of the Great Basin and vicinity
could see highs at least 10F above normal, while central parts of
the Plains could even reach 20F above average with temperatures in
the 60s by Sunday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0106 PM CST Sun Feb 13 2022

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Southern Plains...
Forecast guidance has trended drier and windier over the last
several cycles with regard to the first day of return flow across
central TX and the southern Plains. With deep moisture return
expected to be delayed by the previous frontal intrusion, surface RH
below 25% is expected given strong surface heating of the dry
airmass. A strengthening lee low should also support southerly winds
of 15-20 mph through the afternoon. Fuels remain very dry and as
such, elevated fire weather conditions appear likely across parts of
central and north TX where an elevated area has been added. See the
prior discussion for additional information.

..Lyons.. 02/13/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Sun Feb 13 2022/

...Synopsis...
Increasing zonal flow across the northern Rockies will augment a lee
trough draped along the northern to central High Plains. As a
result, southerly winds will increase through the Plains and advect
warmer temperatures northward. Regional elevated fire weather
concerns may develop in the lee of the central Rockies as well as
across parts of the southern Plains, but will remain low across the
rest of the CONUS.

...Eastern Wyoming...
Westerly downslope winds are expected again Monday afternoon on the
western periphery of the surface trough. Winds will likely be weaker
Monday afternoon as compared to Sunday, but should be sustained
between 15-20 mph for many locations. The weaker downslope flow will
also limit the potential for widespread RH reductions into the
20-25% range. A few locations may see elevated fire weather
conditions, but this threat appears too spatially limited for
highlights at this time.

...Southern Plains...
Despite increasing southerly flow across TX and OK, moisture return
will be limited into the southern Plains thanks to the recent
frontal intrusion into the northwestern Gulf. This will maintain dry
conditions for Monday afternoon, and RH values may fall into the low
to mid 20s. With stronger surface pressure falls/mass response
displaced to the north, winds will generally be between 10-15 mph
for much of the day. This may support patchy elevated fire weather
conditions from central TX to far southern OK - especially where
winds can occasionally gust up to 20 mph.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun February 13 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1233 AM CST Mon Feb 14 2022

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will largely be limited to the Plains as a lee
trough becomes established through the day. While dry conditions
will persist across parts of the Southwest and Southeast, recent
precipitation and/or weak winds will mitigate additional concerns.

...Southern Plains...
Elevated fire weather conditions are probable this afternoon across
parts of central TX and perhaps as far north as southern OK. Winds
have gradually turned more southerly over the region since 00 UTC
Monday, but any onshore flow along the TX Gulf Coast is introducing
meager moisture due to trajectories emanating from southern LA. As a
result, little, if any, moisture return is expected into the
southern Plains today. Current dewpoints and RH values are already
near the 10th percentile, which supports recent ensemble guidance
that depicts high probabilities for RH values in the teens to low
20s. Surface pressure falls are noted across the Pacific Northwest
and will overspread the central Rockies by this afternoon. Although
the stronger mass response will be displaced to the north, winds
should generally increase to 10-15 mph with gusts between 20-25 mph.
As a result, areas of elevated fire weather conditions appear
likely. The current risk area depicts where confidence in favorable
overlap of breezy winds, low RH, and receptive fuels is highest, but
elevated conditions may develop as far north as the Red River
Valley.

...Central High Plains...
Downslope flow is expected to develop again this afternoon along the
central to northern High Plains. Winds between 15-20 mph appear
likely and gusts up to 30 mph are possible. A downslope regime on
Sunday produced RH values in the low 20s for much of southeast WY
and adjacent areas of NE/CO, but a weaker pressure gradient today
will limit winds and subsequent downslope warming/drying. As such,
elevation conditions will likely be more localized and confined to
locations in the immediate lee of the higher terrain features of
east/southeast WY. Elevated conditions may also develop across parts
of western NE within a southerly flow regime, but confidence in the
overlap of strong winds and sufficiently dry RH is low.

...Mid-late week system to bring potential for heavy rain and
severe weather from the south-central to eastern U.S. and wintry
weather from the Midwest through Great Lakes and interior
Northeast...

...Overview...

Northern and southern stream upper-level troughs will be in the
process of phasing in the central U.S. as the medium range period
begins Thursday, which will shift eastward through the end of the
week. At the surface, low pressure is forecast to strengthen as it
tracks quickly northeast and the associated strong cold front will
push ahead of the trough axis, drawing moisture northward from the
Gulf of Mexico and producing notable precipitation across the
eastern third of the U.S. on Thursday. Expect rain and
thunderstorms in southern areas, including the possibility of
flash flooding and severe weather, while snow and wintry weather
are likely on the northern and western side of the precipitation
shield across the Middle Mississippi Valley and Midwest, Great
Lakes, and possibly the interior Northeast. There is still
uncertainty in the precise axis of meaningful snow though. By
Friday-Saturday expect a clipper system tracking near the Canadian
border to bring a cold front into the northern tier and some snow
into the Great Lakes, while a weakening ridge making its way into
the West Coast will be overcome by additional troughing entering
the West early next week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The overall pattern shows fairly good agreement to start the
period Thursday-Friday. Model guidance seems to have come to a
"happy medium" midpoint solution with the timing and track of the
trough and surface low/front and thus the precipitation
shield--faster and initially weaker than what was forecast a few
days ago but trending slightly stronger and slower over the past
day or so. Good continuity remains that the surface low will
intensify quickly as it tracks northeast Thursday into Friday.
After a few days of the CMC being out of tolerance with other
solutions, the 12Z run seemed more in line especially with its
upper pattern. The early part of the medium range WPC forecast was
based on a composite of the 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF, UKMET, and
CMC runs, with only modest nudges from continuity.

Upstream of the initial trough, considerable vorticity/energy
drops into central Canada and shifts toward the Great Lakes for
the end of the week, and recent models show better than average
agreement with the associated surface low/clipper track and
strength through early Saturday, until some differences arise with
the exact amplitude of the resulting upper trough and thus
variability with the trailing front into the East. A more
uncertain feature is a compact shortwave rounding the ridge in the
eastern Pacific that could enter the Pacific Northwest around
Friday night and move eastward, but with differences in the timing
and placement, which may not be resolved for a while given the
small scale of this feature. The larger scale trough making its
way toward the West early next week demonstrates notable
differences as energy spills in from the low predictability high
latitudes. GFS runs have been on the stronger and slower side with
the trough, especially the 12Z run but the 18Z and 00Z runs are
somewhat slow compared to consensus as well. The ECMWF runs have
been fairly stable in the middle so far, while the CMC has been
slightly faster. Thus for the latter part of the forecast period,
the WPC forecast favored the ECMWF in terms of the deterministic
models, and gradually phased in some of the more agreeable GEFS
and EC ensemble means to about half by the end of the period to
temper individual model differences.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

On Thursday, showers and thunderstorms will be widespread from the
Lower Mississippi Valley north and eastward across the
Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, Appalachians, and Eastern Seaboard as a
surface low/frontal system advects substantial moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico northward. Strong storms are possible, with the
Storm Prediction Center outlook showing some severe threat for the
Mid-South. There could also be flash flooding concerns where heavy
rainfall occurs in similar regions and spreading toward much of
the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday and Thursday night. Current
forecasts show the Southern Appalachians could see particularly
high rainfall totals given terrain enhancement there. Continue to
monitor forecasts as uncertain details of these potential threats
become better refined. At the same time, expect a band of snow in
the colder air on the northwestern periphery of the system. The
best potential for meaningful accumulations on Thursday into
Thursday night currently extends from the Middle Mississippi
Valley into the Midwest/Great Lakes region and interior New
England, while mixed precipitation/ice cannot be ruled out in the
transition zone between the snow and rain. Totals/location of the
snow axis will be very sensitive to precise strength and track of
the system given that wintry weather could be within a fairly
narrow band. Gusty winds are possible with the system as well, and
at this point appear most likely near the Northeast coast on
Thursday night/Friday morning in strong southerly flow ahead of
the quickly strengthening surface low.

Dry conditions should prevail over much of the lower 48 behind
this system, with a few exceptions. The clipper system along the
Canadian border may bring some snow into the Great Lakes region by
Friday and Saturday. Meanwhile, some rain showers could persist in
Florida with lingering moisture there, but rainfall amounts remain
uncertain. Light precipitation could also make its way into the
Northwest by Friday, with amounts increasing to locally moderate
and spreading south and eastward across the West over the weekend
as the upper trough comes in.

Ahead of the cold front pushing across the eastern U.S. late in
the workweek, warmer than average temperatures by 10-25F will be
widespread across the eastern third of the U.S. on Thursday, and
daily records could be set for some locations, especially for warm
lows, while a few record high maxima could be challenged as well.
On the backside of the front, temperatures should flip to near or
below average, with some 10-20F below average readings possible
over parts of the central/east-central U.S. on Thursday and then
moderating closer to the East Coast Friday and Saturday. Coldest
anomalies should be over/near Minnesota around Thursday with some
places 20-30F below normal. An increasing portion of the West and
eventually the northern/central Plains should warm up to above
average once again by the end of the week into the weekend. Parts
of the Great Basin and vicinity could see highs at least 10F above
normal, while central parts of the Plains could even reach 20F
above average with temperatures in the 60s by Sunday.

...Unsettled weather to enter the Pacific Northwest today, before
a burst of light-to-moderate snow spreads across the Intermountain
West and Rockies through midweek...

...Critical fire weather conditions forecast throughout the
southern High Plains...

Active weather is set to return to the western U.S. as a potent
upper-level low and associated strong cold front swings into the
Pacific Northwest today. Coastal/lower elevation rain showers will
accompany the system in western Oregon and Washington, with
moderate snowfall possible in the Cascades. By tonight and into
early Tuesday, the aforementioned cold front may spread a burst of
snow into the Intermountain West and Northern Rockies. Outside of
the tallest mountain ranges, snowfall amounts should generally
remain under 4 inches. This system will also bring a long-awaited
reprieve from the recent warmth throughout much of California.
Highs will remain above average today before cooler air rushes
into the region by Tuesday. Additionally, gusty winds are possible
for much of the central Great Basin and High Desert region of
southern Nevada beginning tonight, as well as adjacent parts of
California and northwest Arizona. Winds could gust up to 50 mph
and lead to blowing dust, isolated tree damage, and a few power
outages.

Ahead of the approaching western U.S. trough, warm southerly flow
is expected to rush into the Southern Plains and lead to
widespread high temperatures into the 60s and 70s both today and
Tuesday. Highs on Tuesday are expected to reach up to around 15 to
25 degrees above average compared to normal mid-February
conditions. The combination of low relative humidity and gusty
winds are forecast to result in critical fire weather for much of
the southern High Plains beginning on Tuesday. Fire Weather
Watches have been issued from southwest Kansas to West Texas.

Elsewhere, building high pressure over the East will create mostly
tranquil conditions for the eastern half of the Nation through
Wednesday. Scattered lake effect snow showers will remain a
possibility through Tuesday, with light snow possibly skimming far
northern sections of the Upper Midwest on Tuesday as well.
Meanwhile, a frigid airmass in place from the Upper Mississippi
Valley to the Northeast will begin to retreat by midweek as high
pressure slips off the East Coast. Low temperatures this morning
throughout the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast will
start in the single digits or teens for most places. By Wednesday
morning, above average temperatures are expected to surge into the
Midwest and Ohio Valley, with single digits and subzero cold
confined to northern New England.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS INTO THE
SOUTHWEST...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level wave, currently noted off the southwestern Canadian
coast, is forecast to deepen as it shifts southward into the
Southwest over the next 48 hours. As this occurs, southwesterly mid
and upper-level winds will increase over the southern Rockies and
southern/central Plains, inducing strong lee troughing along the
High Plains in the process. The combined effects of strong mid-level
flow and a robust surface mass response will strengthen winds from
the Southwest into the Plains and support widespread fire weather
concerns.

...Southern High Plains...
The fire weather concern will be greatest west of a tightening
surface trough/dryline across portions of eastern NM, west TX, and
the OK/TX Panhandles. Here, a strong downslope regime emanating off
the southern Rockies will support temperatures climbing into the
low/mid 70s (near record values for mid February) and widespread RH
reductions into the 15-20% range with 20-25 mph winds. While the
strongest mid-level wind response will be to the east of the surface
trough/dryline, 30-40 mph winds between 850-700 mb will likely mix
to the surface as frequent gusts amid deep boundary-layer mixing.
Fuels across much of the region have been slowly curing after little
precipitation over the past 7 days. Latest fuel analyses and
forecast suggests ERC values between the 75th to 90th percentile
will be common across far eastern NM and into west TX/western OK.
This combination of dry/windy conditions and receptive fuels should
support critical fire weather conditions. Fire weather concerns may
develop well into central KS and northern OK, but moisture return
into the region through the day limits confidence on sufficiently
dry conditions. However, given receptive fuels a wind-driven fire
weather concern appears possible.

...Southern Arizona and New Mexico...
Dewpoints across southeast AZ and southern NM are currently within
the 10-25th percentile for mid February. With little moisture influx
expected into the region, dry conditions will prevail into Tuesday
afternoon with diurnal RH reductions near/below 15% likely. 30-40
mph flow within the boundary layer, coupled with a tightening
regional pressure gradient, will help support 20-25 mph sustained
winds. Critical to elevated fire weather conditions will likely be
pervasive across most of the eastern half of AZ and much of NM, but
highlights are limited to southern portions of the region where
fuels are most receptive to fire spread (10-hour fuel moisture at 5%
or less per latest analyses).

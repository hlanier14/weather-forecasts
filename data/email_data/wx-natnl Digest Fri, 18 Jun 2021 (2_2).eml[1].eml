Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Fri Jun 18 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN UTAH INTO SOUTHERN
COLORADO...

...Synopsis...
Widespread dry thunderstorms are expected today as mid-level
moisture seeps around the edges of an upper-level high anchored over
the Four Corners. Elevated and locally critical fire weather
conditions will be possible across the northern Rockies and upper
Midwest through the day ahead of increasing westerly flow aloft.

...Great Basin and Four Corners Dry Thunder...
Monsoonal flow around the periphery of the ridge across the
Southwest will support thunderstorm development from the Great Basin
eastward to the Four Corners and Colorado/New Mexico. Record heat
ongoing across the region will continue, with widespread surface
temperatures of 95-100+ F expected through the afternoon. The very
warm temperatures and dry surface conditions, RH less than 15%, will
increase evaporation potential, limiting precipitation from
thunderstorms. Dry thunderstorms appear likely, with the greatest
concentration expected along the higher terrain from eastern Utah
into western Colorado. While forcing for ascent will be relatively
weak, scattered storm coverage appears likely given robust buoyancy
profiles and abundant heating across the higher terrain. Fuels are
extremely susceptible to lightning starts given ongoing drought and
record heat. Critical dry thunderstorm probabilities will be
maintained through the forecast period.

...Colorado/Wyoming...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions appear likely
across portions of the Red Desert and northern Colorado this
afternoon and evening. Dry surface conditions with RH of 10-20% will
be in place within a very warm arimass with temperatures of 90-100+
F. While surface flow will be somewhat weak, west-southwesterly
surface winds of 10-15 mph, enhanced by thunderstorm outflow, will
be common through the afternoon. Given very dry fuel conditions and
the favorable meteorological circumstances, elevated to
near-critical fire weather conditions are likely.

...Western Minnesota...
A dry airmass will be advected into portions of the upper Midwest
tomorrow afternoon behind a departing cold front. While slightly
cooler than the preceding days, temperatures in the 80s F, with
decreasing surface moisture content, will favor dry boundary-layer
profiles supporting RH values near 25%. Northwest surface flow of
10-15 mph will be adequate for locally elevated fire weather
conditions through the afternoon, given widespread dry fuels.

...High Heat over the West spreads to the Plains next week...
...Wet remnants of "Three" exits Carolinas Monday to lift off East
Coast...
...Trailing frontal heavy rains across the South to the East early
next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Recent GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble mean runs for days 3-7
are mainly well clustered and along with the overall
representative National Blend of Models seem to act as a
reasonable forecast base in a pattern with above normal forecast
predictability.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Ongoing record-breaking and dangerous heat over the
Southwest/California may slowly moderate next week, but it will
still be hot. High heat is also expected for the Northwest and
Great Basin and will also spread into the Plains.

Potential Tropical Cyclone "Three" is forecast by the NHC to
develop and reach the central Gulf Coast Saturday and track across
the South/Southeast this weekend. By Monday, the moist remnant
system and heavy rains are subsequently expected to move offshore
the Carolinas before lifting off the East Coast as mainly a
maritime threat. Early next week upper support, frontal approach
and Gulf moisture/instability return in the wake of "Three" will
support periods of strong convection with heavy downpours across
the already wet South that would lead to additional runoff issues,
especially with lead training. Generally progressive frontal
focusing rains will meanwhile also spread through the Ohio Valley,
Appalachians and the Eastern Seaboard, lingering over the
Southeast/Florida midweek with the trailing front.

Upstream, additional digging upper energies and return frontal
support may combine to favor a moderate convective rain focus from
the eastern Plains and north-central Mid-Mississippi
Valley/Midwest later next week.

and Gulf moisture/instability return in the wake of "Three" will
support periods of strong convection with heavy downpours across
the already wet South that would lead to additional runoff issues,
especially with lead training. Generally progressive frontal
focusing rains will meanwhile also spread through the Ohio Valley,
Appalachians and the Eastern Seaboard, lingering over the
Southeast/Florida midweek with the trailing front.

Upstream, additional digging upper energies and return frontal
support may combine to favor a moderate convective rain focus from
the eastern Plains and north-central Mid-Mississippi
Valley/Midwest later next week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 AM CDT Fri Jun 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE FOUR CORNERS AND WESTERN
SLOPE...

...Synopsis...
Stagnant high pressure across the Four Corners will remain in place
as increasing mid-level flow ahead of shortwave trough passes
through the northern Rockies. Widespread dry thunderstorms are
expected across the Great Basin and Southwest beneath the ridge,
where very warm and dry surface conditions are forecast. Elevated to
near-critical fire weather potential will exist across Idaho and
into Montana/Wyoming, where gusty winds and low humidity are
expected.

...The Four Corners into the eastern Great Basin...
Around the periphery of the upper ridge, mid-level moisture will
support thunderstorm development by early Afternoon from eastern
Nevada into portion of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. A
very warm and well-mixed boundary layer, with temperatures near or
exceeding 100 F, will limit precipitation potential across much of
the Southwest. Isolated dry thunderstorms will be possible across
much of the region atop very dry and receptive fuels.

The most likely corridor for widespread dry thunderstorms will be
from the high terrain of western New Mexico, through the Four
Corners, and into western Colorado and eastern Utah. Here, very
dry/warm surface conditions will coexist with sufficient mid-level
moisture (PWATs 0.45-0.6 inches) for scattered thunderstorm
development. Model soundings depict an environment highly favorable
for charge separation and lightning development, with 500-1000 J/kg
of MUCAPE concentrated above the 0C layer. High-resolution guidance
shows several clusters of storms developing off the higher terrain
and tracking slowly east by mid afternoon. High confidence exists in
scattered dry storm development over fuels very susceptible to
lightning starts.

...Snake River Valley...
Ahead of the increasing northwest flow aloft, dry westerly flow of
10-20 mph is forecast to develop down the Snake River valley
Day2/Saturday overlapping with RH of 15-20%. Lower and mid-elevation
fuels drier than average support fire spread suggesting
elevated/locally critical fire weather conditions are possible.

...Wyoming and Montana...
To the north of the mid-level ridge, stronger northwesterly flow
aloft is forecast to develop through Day2/Saturday ahead of a
shortwave trough. Westerly flow will move downslope across central
and eastern Wyoming supporting dry surface conditions with RH neat
20%. Warm temperatures, dry surface conditions and gusty winds
suggest elevated fire weather conditions are likely.

Farther to the north across Montana, lee troughing will intensify
during the day ahead of a dry cold front sweeping through the
northern Rockies. Increasing west-east surface pressure gradients
will enhance northwesterly surface winds across much of southeastern
Montana through the evening. Downslope trajectories and warm surface
temperatures should result in a dry airmass with RH below 20%. The
overlap of gusty surface winds near 20 mph and a dry boundary layer
will support elevated to near critical fire weather conditions.

...Severe thunderstorms and heavy rain producing flash flooding
are possible throughout the Ohio Valley on Friday...

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat will continue across a large
portion of the western U.S. and the central Plains...

...Tropical rains and an increasing threat for flash flooding are
expected along the Central Gulf Coast beginning Friday...

Heatwave continues. Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories
remain in effect across much of California, Nevada, Arizona, and
Utah.
Temperatures are expected to once again reach record-breaking
highs across much of the region, with several records likely to
fall on Friday and Saturday as well.

Additionally, Heat Advisories are also in effect for portions of
the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley on Friday.
Well-above normal temperatures are expected across the region,
with record-breaking highs expected from Kansas to Iowa and
Missouri.  While a front dropping into the region is expected to
offer some relief, temperatures are forecast to remain well-above
average on Friday and into Saturday.

Severe thunderstorms will develop across portions of the Middle
Mississippi/Ohio Valleys.  The Storm Prediction Center has issued
an Enhanced Risk for severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley
through Saturday morning.  The main hazards with these storms are
frequent lightning,  severe thunderstorm wind gust, large hail,
and a few tornadoes.  There is a 10% or greater probability of
wind gust of 65 knots or greater over parts of the Ohio Valley.

Furthermore, heavy rain associated with the thunderstorms will
produce areas of flooding. Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms. The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers through Saturday morning. On Saturday, the
severe thunderstorms and the excessive rainfall threat will
decrease. However, showers and thunderstorms will occur along and
near the front on Saturday into Sunday.

Heavy rainfall and windy conditions are expected to develop along
the Central Gulf Coast on Friday before spreading over the
Southeast on Saturday and Sunday.  Abroad area of low pressure
over the Gulf of Mexico continues to become better organized. This
system is expected to move generally to the north, and a tropical
depression is likely to form over the west-central Gulf of Mexico
on early Friday. As a result, the National Hurricane Center has
indicated a Tropical Storm Warning across portions of the Central
Gulf Coast.

Furthermore, heavy rain will develop over the area on Friday and
Saturday. As a result, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over the Central Gulf Coast. The heavy rain
will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban
areas, roads, and small streams are the most vulnerable through
Saturday morning. Then on Saturday, the WPC has increased the
excessive rainfall threat to a Moderate Risk through Sunday
morning.  The associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of
flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers on Saturday into Sunday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1135 AM CDT Sun Apr 10 2022

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS AND SOUTHWEST...

Minimal changes to the Elevated area in south-central
Nebraska/northwest Kansas. A pocket of very dry air is situated in
southeastern Wyoming and adjacent Colorado. This should advect
eastward today as the surface low shifts northeast. A few hours of
Elevated conditions appear more likely in these areas as a result.
The remainder of the forecast is on track.

..Wendt.. 04/10/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Sun Apr 10 2022/

...Synopsis...
A low amplitude shortwave trough across the central Rockies is
forecast to move eastward across the Great Plains and reach the
Upper Midwest late this evening. Two areas of low pressure, with the
latter in the lee of the southern Rockies, will intensify,
supporting strong westerly winds across the Rockies and southern
High Plains. Dry surface conditions and the strong winds beneath the
trough will support Critical fire weather conditions across the
central and southern High Plains.

...Central and southern High Plains...
As the mid-level trough ejects eastward out of the central Rockies
this morning strong mid-level flow will overspread the central and
southern High Plains. A sub 1000 mb lee low will shift southeastward
across CO and into the OK/TX Panhandles. Strong west to east
pressure gradients bolstered by the mid-level flow at the base of
the trough will support robust downslope winds of 25-30 mph across
much of the Plains. Locally strong winds are expected beneath the
trough and behind a cold front moving south from the central Rockies
into the High Plains where a late season downslope winds storm is
expected to develop.

Warm temperatures and adiabatic downslope flow will support an
extremely dry airmass with widespread RH values below 10%. Hi-res
guidance suggests that locally stronger flow in the immediate lee of
the southern Rockies and beneath a pronounced thermal ridge may also
allow for local RH values to fall below 5% in spots. The combination
of strong surface winds and extremely dry conditions will support
widespread Critical fire weather conditions from eastern NM, along
the front range of CO, into western portions of TX and OK. Volatile
fuels remain in place with ERC values in the 90th+ percentile for
nearly all of the southern/central High Plains. With preceding days
showing above normal fire activity, widespread Critical fire weather
conditions are expected.

...South Florida...
A dry post frontal airmass is expected to remain in place this
afternoon across the southern Florida Peninsula where fuels remain
quite dry. Beneath surface high pressure winds are forecast to
remain relatively light but occasional gusts of 10+ mph may support
a few hours of near Elevated fire conditions given dry surface
conditions and available fuels.

...Potent storm system to bring heavy snow/blizzard conditions
across the Northern Plains with heavy rainfall and severe weather
from the Gulf Coast to the Mid/Upper Mississippi Valley...

...Overview...

An impressive springtime low pressure system will slowly move
through the Upper Midwest mid to late week, bringing heavy snow
and possible blizzard conditions on its northwest side across the
Northern Plains into northern Minnesota. Meanwhile in the warm
sector, widespread rain and thunderstorms will track ahead of the
cold front, with severe weather and heavy to excessive rainfall in
much of the Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee Valley. After
that, the overall pattern looks to deamplify somewhat, but a round
of weaker troughing could come into the West for the latter half
of the week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance still shows a significant surface low in the
Midwest as the period begins Wednesday that should slowly lift
northeastward through late week. This is in conjunction with a
developing upper low that the GFS/UKMET continue to close off by
early Wednesday, earlier than the ECMWF and CMC. The 00Z ECMWF
appears to be a south outlier at this point with the surface low
position at 12Z Wednesday, but the 12Z ECMWF seems to show better
clustering with other guidance and the 00Z EC mean. Despite all
this, model guidance is certainly in better agreement with the
timing of the system compared to a couple of days ago--models have
converged on a solution in between the slowest and fastest
guidance, but perhaps more toward the faster GFS compared to the
slowest runs of the ECMWF over the past few days. Regardless, some
differences in the low track and frontal position remain, along
with some differences in the eventual ejection and possible
shearing of some energy of the upper low toward the northeast into
Canada by late week, but generally within typical model spread for
the medium range period. The WPC forecast favored an operational
model blend for these features for an intermediate solution.

Farther upstream, additional energy looks to spill southward
across the northeastern Pacific into the Pacific Northwest
beginning Wednesday, with the bulk of recent guidance generally
indicating at least a small upper low pivoting there Thursday with
a minor shift east by Friday. The details of energy embedded
within the upper low/trough become murkier Friday and beyond, with
potential for some energy to shift eastward while some helps dig
troughing in the West Saturday and moving eastward Sunday. The
trough may produce low pressure in the Southern Plains over the
weekend. This seems like the most likely solution at this point
given deterministic models coming into slightly better agreement,
but ensemble spread remains high so there is still considerable
uncertainty. A blend of the 06Z GFS and GEFS mean and 00Z ECMWF,
EC mean, and CMC by the end of the period worked for the medium
range forecast for now, but further adjustments are likely in
upcoming days with frontal position, precipitation, etc. forecasts.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

By Wednesday a well developed low pressure system should be
tracking across the northern Plains/Upper Midwest with a
significant snow storm likely to the north and west of the surface
low across the Dakotas and northwest Minnesota. Heavy snowfall,
possibly exceeding a foot in some locations, combined with gusty
winds could create blizzard conditions leading to hazardous travel
and power outages in many areas. Meanwhile in the warm sector,
there will be increasing coverage and intensity of rain and
thunderstorms ahead of the attendant cold front given persistent
Gulf moisture and instability. The Storm Prediction Center's
extended outlook indicates severe potential across much of the
Mississippi Valley on Wednesday and possibly spreading farther
east into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Southeast late Wednesday
into Thursday. The heaviest rainfall that could cause flash
flooding may focus on the southern side across the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valley, but farther north, dynamics
wrapping around the low and even some instability reaching that
far north could support an additional area of modest rainfall
across the Upper Mississippi Valley. This may cause localized
flooding and flash flooding issues there as well particularly if
rain falls over frozen or snow covered ground. Rainfall may linger
across the Southeast through Friday into the weekend as the
western part of the boundary stalls across the region.

Out West, moderate to heavy rain/mountain snows are possible
across parts of California/Oregon with the next low pressure
system moving in mid- to late week. Moisture looks to spread east
into the Intermountain West as well, but with more uncertainty by
next Sunday regarding precipitation into the Plains.

Below normal temperatures are forecast to cover the western half
of the U.S. as the period begins Wednesday. The biggest
temperature anomalies are forecast for the interior West into the
northern High Plains, with lows 20+ degrees below average and
highs 25-35 degrees below average, and a few record low minimum
and maximum temperatures are possible. Some moderation is likely
by later in the week across the West, though still below normal
with additional troughing moving in. But the chilly temperatures
will last in the northern Plains and spread into the Upper Midwest
into next weekend. Meanwhile, ahead of the cold front with the big
storm, expect temperatures from the south-central U.S. to the East
to be above normal, but trending back towards normal following
passage of the cold front.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun April 10 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
20010328 - 19610415 - 19520326 - 19990419 - 20080412


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 7 day periods centered on the following dates:

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0210 PM CDT Sun Apr 10 2022

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL
HIGH PLAINS INTO THE SOUTHWEST...

The primary change to the outlook was to shift Elevated/Critical
areas northward into more of the central High Plains. Given the very
dry air currently present in the Nebraska Panhandle vicinity, its
seems probable that this air will return northward through the
region tomorrow as the weak surface high shifts eastward. This would
suggest that drier model guidance should be given more weight.

..Wendt.. 04/10/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0209 AM CDT Sun Apr 10 2022/

...Synopsis...
Initially zonal mid-level flow will gradually become more meridional
as a powerful Pacific jet deepens an approaching shortwave trough.
As the jet and trough dig across the Four Corners Monday, a deep
surface low will move eastward toward the southern High Plains. In
response to the strengthening flow aloft and strong surface cyclone,
surface southwesterly winds will increase substantially within an
already dry airmass. Volatile fuels and the strong winds/low
humidity will combine to support widespread high-end Critical fire
weather conditions across the southern High Plains.

...Southern Plains...
As the mid-level trough deepens in response to the advancing Pacific
jet, mid-level westerlies will gradually intensify over the
Southwest and southern High Plains. Deep mixing, enhanced by
orographic turbulence will aide in bolstering strong low-level
southwesterly winds from AZ eastward, across NM and into western
TX/OK. Ensemble and deterministic model soundings support high
confidence in widespread boundary-layer winds of 25-30 mph through
much of Monday afternoon. Stronger gusts may develop across western
portions of the Critical area as the main core of the upper jet
begins to overspread the High Plains later in the period. High
confidence also exists in very dry surface conditions given
downslope trajectories and a warm/well-mixed boundary layer. Minimum
RH values below 10% are expected to be widespread with local values
below 5% possible in the lee of the higher terrain where downsloping
will be maximized. With extremely dry fuels and ongoing drought
exacerbated by several preceding dry and windy days, high-end
Critical fire weather conditions appear likely across much of the
southern High Plains. Localized Extremely Critical conditions may
also materialize later in the period as strong wind gusts develop
beneath the stronger jet aloft. However, uncertainty remains
relatively high on the overlap of sustained 35+ mph winds and sub
10% RH within the areas of driest fuels.

...Central High Plains...
Similar to the southern High Plains, widespread strong winds and dry
surface conditions are expected beneath the deepening Great Basin
trough Monday. However, more southerly trajectories will likely
result in gradual moisture transport across the central High Plains
ahead of the deepening surface low. This may impact diurnal RH
somewhat casting some uncertainty on the coverage of sustained
Critical conditions. However, wind fields remain quite strong,
suggesting at least some fire weather threat is possible within dry
fuels. Elevated highlights will be maintained with the possibility
of an upgrade to Critical conditions in subsequent outlooks.

...There is an elevated to critical threat for fire weather over a
large portion of the Southwest and the Central and Southern High
Plains into next week...

...A major late-season winter storm will begin to impact the West
by Monday night with strong winds, heavy rain, and heavy mountain
snow...

...Severe weather is expected to begin impacting areas of the
Southern Plains and the lower-to-middle Mississippi Valley by
Monday...

A strong low pressure developing near the Pacific Northwest coast
is forecast to track inland and drag a cold front with it. This
potent system will usher in strong winds, heavy rain and mountain
snows across the Intermountain West Sunday night into Monday.
Abundant moisture will be directed onshore within the strong
onshore flow which will help increase precipitation intensity and
coverage of the rain across the Coastal Ranges of Oregon and
northwest California and switching to heavy, wet snow for the
Cascades. The cold airmass pushing in behind this front and the
abundant moisture will overspread the Great Basin and the Northern
Rockies through Monday. As the system exits the Rockies and enters
the High Plains it will deepen further becoming a potent late
season winter storm for the Rockies and the Plains. Some of the
highest terrain will have accumulations of 1 to 2+ feet, with the
higher amounts likely over the Oregon Cascades. Heavy wet snow is
expected to spread from eastern Montana to western North Dakota by
Tuesday where accumulations of a foot or more will be possible.
Numerous Winter Storm Watches and Winter Weather Advisories are in
effect from Washington, Oregon, California eastward to Minnesota.

The Central and Southern High Plains, and parts of the Southwest,
have been and will continue to have low humidity and gusty winds.
Critical conditions for the spread of wildfires have been
identified by SPC into early next week. A vast area from southern
Arizona to Nebraska and south to South Texas have Red Flag
Warnings and High Wind Warnings in effect. This threat will
continue until the strong storm system in the West ejects out into
the Plains midweek.

In contrast, much the central and eastern states will be
relatively calm weatherwise, but there will be a cold front
crossing the Midwest and the Great Lakes region late Sunday
through Monday. This features will bring a threat of rain and
perhaps a little wet snow to areas of the Upper Midwest. Showers
and thunderstorms are expected to develop across the Central and
Southern Plains ahead of the approaching front. Some of the storms
may become severe per SPC who has a Slight Risk highlighted for
Monday. The coverage and intensity of these storms are expected to
impact more of the Lower/Mid Mississippi Valley on Tuesday. These
storms will be capable of producing large hail, damaging winds,
and a couple of tornadoes.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CDT Mon Apr 11 2022

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL
HIGH PLAINS....

...Synopsis...
An initial low-amplitude shortwave trough within westerly flow over
Coastal California will begin to rapidly deepen this morning ahead
of a potent 90 kt upstream jet streak. As heights aloft fall in
response to strong DCVA, a surface low will quickly deepen over the
Great Basin and western slopes of the central Rockies before it
shifts eastward onto the Plains late tonight. Breezy surface flow
over the Southwest and southern/central High Plains will overlap
with a very dry airmass and supportive fuels. Critical fire weather
potential appears likely.

...Southern High Plains...
Intensifying mid-level westerlies will gradually become more
southwesterly with time this morning as the upstream shortwave
trough deepens. Regional model soundings show deep inverted-v
profiles owing to strong diurnal mixing intersecting with 40 kt 500
mb flow. As the boundary layer deepens through the day, surface
winds will increase in response to downward momentum transport from
aloft. At the same time, the westerly flow will enhance lee
troughing bolstering west to east surface pressure gradients through
the afternoon. Hi-res guidance and model soundings show
high-confidence in sustained boundary-layer winds of 20-30 mph with
the potential for higher gusts, especially with western extent. With
a strong westerly component, downsloping trajectories will support
widespread RH below 15%. Fuels remain very receptive to fire spread
suggesting high confidence in Critical fire weather conditions this
afternoon. Some threat may linger overnight as the main trough and
jet eject eastward onto the Plains. Poor overnight recoveries are
expected, and while winds will likely slacken after dark, areas in
proximity to the higher terrain may retain near critical winds
overnight.

...Central High Plains...
Unlike areas farther south, low-level surface flow across the
central Plains will be dominated by tightening surface pressure
gradients ahead of the western surface low. Regardless, gusty
southeasterly surface winds are likely to develop by mid-morning in
response to the approaching low. Ahead of the surging Gulf moisture,
dry surface conditions with RH of 15-20% should be more than
sufficient for widespread Elevated and Critical fire weather
conditions as far north as NE. Surface RH may begin to increase
through the afternoon and in the evening on the eastern fringes of
the Elevated and Critical areas as moisture advection increases east
of the fast moving low. However, low-level flow is forecast to
remain quite strong suggesting some fire weather potential may
linger overnight given the exceptionally dry nature of area fuels.

...Overview...

A strong springtime low pressure system will be exiting the Upper
Midwest as the period begins Thursday, as its attendant cold front
slides through the East. After Thursday/day 3, the pattern finally
appears to deamplify somewhat as a weaker shortwave/trough moves
into the West around Friday-Saturday. Guidance shows this trough
moving eastward with time eventually into the central Plains where
it could induce another low pressure system across the Midwest
next Monday. This could bring another round of precipitation into
the northern and eastern part of the country early next week,
although there's still plenty of uncertainty with respect to the
details.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest models and ensembles finally seem to show some decent
agreement on the large scale evolution of the departing deep upper
low into Eastern Canada Thursday-Friday, which looks to
meander/weaken there as it gets blocked by amplified western
Atlantic ridging. Models show varying degrees of uncertainty
regarding shortwave energy rounding the base of this through the
Southeast, with secondary low pressure developing along the cold
front off the Northeast Coast next Friday. The ECMWF has both been
most consistent and strongest with this, which of course has
implications for how much precipitation lingers across the
Southeast/East Coast into next weekend. A general deterministic
model blend (with slight weighting towards the ECMWF for
continuity reasons) seemed to provide a good starting point for
days 3-4.

Out West, the models continue to show a lot of uncertainty
surrounding the next trough through the region. There's good
agreement on low pressure present near the coast on day 3, but
after that questions begin to arise regarding strength and timing
of the main trough axis through the Northwest. The ECMWF and UKMET
are strongest/most amplified with this trough and also downstream
ridging across the north-central U.S.. By day 6, the latest runs
of the ECMWF and GFS show pretty good agreement on timing of the
wave into the Central U.S., but poor run to run continuity on this
feature which tempers confidence quite a bit. The CMC is entirely
too weak/flat with this system and was not included in the blend
after day 4. The ECMWF continues to be notably stronger with the
wave into the Midwest on Monday/day 7, indicating a deep closed
low and well defined low pressure system at the surface. Prefer a
blend towards the better agreeable (and weaker) ensemble means for
the latter periods to help mitigate the harder to resolve
differences.



...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Some lingering snows are possible across the Upper Midwest at the
start of Thursday, but the heaviest should be rapidly coming to an
end as the deep low departs into Canada. Gusty winds are likely to
continue into Friday though creating blowing and drifting of snow
and possible hazardous travel conditions. Moderate to locally
heavy rainfall should be moving through the East ahead of the
attendant cold front on Thursday into Friday, with the best chance
for heavier totals across parts of the Southeast where the better
moisture and instability will be present. Rainfall across the
Southeast could linger into the weekend as the western edge of the
boundary tries to lift north as a warm front and weaken across the
Southeast. Out West, moderate to heavy rain/mountain snows are
possible across parts of California/Oregon with the next low
pressure system Thursday-Friday. Moisture should spread east into
the Intermountain West and northern Plains next weekend.
Significant uncertainty regarding low pressure into the Midwest
next week, but the latest guidance suggests decent probability for
another round of precipitation to affect the northern and eastern
states early next week.

The core of the below normal temperatures are likely across the
northern High Plains into early next week, with daytime highs
around 20-30 degrees below normal possible. Out West, below normal
temperatures should moderate back towards normal later in the
period as ridging tries to build over the region. Above normal
temperatures along the Eastern Seaboard initially should trend
back towards normal next weekend. Below normal temperatures will
spread south and east next Sunday-Monday into the Midwest with
some readings 10-20F possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Mon Apr 11 2022

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF WESTERN TEXAS
AND OKLAHOMA INTO SOUTHWESTERN KANSAS....
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A potent shortwave trough and 80-90 kt mid-level jet streak will
quickly eject eastward out of the Rockies and over the Plains
Tuesday. As the trough takes on a prominent negative tilt, a sub-990
mb lee low will move quickly northeast across the central Plains
toward the upper Midwest. Trailing the low, a sharp dryline will
bisect the warm sector with hot and dry surface conditions expected
to its west. Within this zone, the overlap of strong unidirectional
flow through out the column will support widespread sustained winds
of 30-40 mph and frequent gusts to 50+ mph. Ongoing extreme drought
and exceptionally dry fuels will support Extremely Critical fire
weather conditions and the potential for a dangerous fire weather
outbreak.

...A significant fire weather outbreak is possible across the
southern and central High Plains Tuesday....

...Southern/Central High Plains...
As the upper trough ejects eastward over the central and northern
Plains Tuesday, very strong mid-level flow (80-90 kt) will
overspread an increasing warm and dry boundary layer west of the
dryline across the southern and central High Plains. Strong daytime
heating and subsidence beneath the ribbon of strong momentum aloft
will aid in the development of a prominent low-level thermal ridge
with temperatures reaching the low to mid 90s F from central KS
southwestward across western OK/TX. Coincident with the thermal
ridge, deep vertical mixing and the hot temperatures will support
very dry surface conditions with widespread surface RH below 10%. An
overlapping southwesterly low-level jet of 40-60 kts will bolster
flow already enhanced by the strong surface pressure trough/dryline
across western KS, TX and OK. Widespread sustained surface winds of
30-40 mph are expected with frequent gusts to 50-60 mph possible.

Conditions farther north into the central Plains may take somewhat
longer to develop Tuesday morning owing to lingering mid-level cloud
cover and a more diffuse moisture gradient. Closer to the surface
low, low-level mass response should be quite strong supporting
widespread winds of 25-40 mph within the drying airmass. Fuels are
less volatile with northern extent, but remain overall favorable for
large fire development/spread. High-end critical conditions appear
likely into eastern Nebraska with Elevated conditions possible
farther west where humidity is forecast to be higher.

Fuels across the Plains remain highly receptive to fire
starts/spread owing to severe drought and several preceding days of
Critically dry and windy conditions. ERC values in the 90-95th
percentile are ubiquitous across the southern High Plains setting
the stage for exceptionally volatile fire weather conditions. High
confidence exists in several hours of Extremely Critical fire
weather conditions developing beneath the 850-700 mb jet core from
west TX, through the Panhandles, western OK, and into western KS
where high-end parameter space for both meteorological conditions
and fuel states exists.

Short Range Forecast Discussion

...There is a critical to extreme threat for fire weather over a
large portion of the Southwest and the Central/Southern High
Plains into next week...

...A major late-season winter storm will begin to impact the West
by tonight with strong winds, heavy rain, and heavy mountain
snow...

...Severe weather and Flash Flooding are expected to begin
impacting areas of the Southern Plains and the lower-to-middle
Mississippi Valley by this afternoon...

A deep area of low pressure will move into the Pacific Northwest
today, bringing with it a substantial plume of Pacific moisture.
Rain showers and isolated thunderstorms are expected along the
coast and inland low-lying areas over the next couple of days. A
few feet of snow will blanket the Oregon Cascades as well. This
system will deepen as it moves farther inland, setting the stage
for an intense late season winter storm to impact the Rockies and
Northern Plains. Heavy snow and high winds are forecast to spread
into the Rockies and Northern Plains this evening. Over a foot of
snow is likely to accumulate between eastern Montana and central
North Dakota on Tuesday. Blizzard-like conditions are possible for
this area due to strong winds coupling with high snow rates. Power
outages and difficult travel conditions are likely. Winter Storm
Watches, Warnings and Advisories are in effect for the southern
Cascades, Rockies and the Northern Plains.

Downstream of this winter storm, a weaker storm system will impact
the Mississippi Valley, Midwest and Northeast today. Rain and
scattered to isolated thunderstorms will focus along a cold front
moving through the aforementioned areas. This slow moving cold
front may cause rain rates to be high enough over parts of the
Tennessee/Middle Mississippi Valley that isolated instances of
flash flooding occur. Heightened instability clashing with the
weak cold front over the Southern Plains and Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley will be conducive to the development of
isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms through this evening.
The Storm Prediction Center issued a Slight and an embedded
Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms from northeast Texas to the
Mid-South for today.

The winter storm will continue to deepen and become more dynamic
as it enters into the Great Plains on Tuesday. Rain and
thunderstorms are expected to expand across the Plains and
Mississippi Valley Tuesday evening through Wednesday morning.
Thunderstorms are possible over much of this area where the Storm
Prediction Center has issued another Slight and embedded Enhanced
Risk of severe thunderstorms. Heavy rainfall may focus around
Louisiana and the greater Lower Mississippi Valley on Tuesday
where a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in effect. Dry
conditions beneath this low pressure system will exacerbate an
ongoing extreme drought over the Southwest and Southern/Central
Plains. This, combined with high winds and warmer than normal
temperatures, will contribute to a Critical Risk of Fire Weather
through midweek. There is an Extreme Risk of Fires for parts of
the Texas/Oklahoma panhandle and into southern Kansas on Tuesday
due to the potential for 30-40 mph sustained winds, 50+ mph gusts
and unusually warm/dry conditions. A dangerous fire weather
outbreak is possible as a result.

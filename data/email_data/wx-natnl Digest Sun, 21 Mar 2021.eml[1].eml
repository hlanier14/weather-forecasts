Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1128 AM CDT Sat Mar 20 2021

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions
made. Locally Critical conditions still appear possible across
portions of central New Mexico. However, the brief and localized
nature of the Critical conditions as well as the conditional
receptiveness of fuels to fire spread preclude Critical highlights.

..Squitieri.. 03/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0113 AM CDT Sat Mar 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A positive tilt, long-wave trough will emerge across the
Intermountain West and northern High Plains over the course of the
forecast period.  This wave will encourage lee troughing and
strengthening of low-level wind fields from the Texas/New Mexico
High Plains north-northeastward to the Upper Midwest.  Despite
trajectories that would ordinarily favor moisture advection, dry air
remaining in the wake of the prior system will allow for areas of
elevated fire-weather conditions to develop especially across the
southern Rockies/Plains and portions of the upper Midwest.

...Southern Rockies/Plains...
Steepening surface pressure gradient associated with lee troughing
will allow for several areas of 15-25 mph surface winds across broad
areas of New Mexico and southeastern Colorado.  This flow will occur
within a dry airmass, with areas of critically low RH values
developing for a few hours during peak heating, though most areas
should only flirt with 15% RH values based on latest model progs.
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions are possible where
fuels are dry, though some areas in the High Plains have experienced
wetting precipitation recently that may render fuel states
unfavorable for large fires.

...Iowa, Wisconsin, and eastern Minnesota...
This region will reside on the eastern extent of stronger wind
fields across the northern/central Plains.  Nevertheless, areas of
15-25 mph surface winds (strongest in Iowa) are expected to develop
over the course of the afternoon and RH values fall into the 20-30%
range.  Where fuels are dry, elevated fire weather is expected.

...Midweek heavy rain threat over parts of the South, most likely
from the central Gulf Coast into southern Appalachians...

...Overview...

Expect a large scale mean trough aloft to persist over the
Plains/west-central U.S., between a ridge over the eastern Pacific
and a strengthening Cuba/Bahamas ridge whose influence will extend
into parts of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Shortwaves within
the trough will spread areas of rain and mountain snow from the
Pacific Northwest through much of the Rockies, and with the help
of Gulf moisture generate a broad area of rainfall over the
eastern half of the country. The greatest potential for heavy rain
currently exists from the central Gulf Coast into the southern
Appalachians. Models and ensembles still agree on the overall
pattern while gradually attempting to come close together or
stabilize for important timing and detail aspects of significant
features.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The primary systems of interest will be a fairly vigorous low
tracking northeast from the central Plains Tuesday onward,
upstream energy digging into the West/Rockies into early Wednesday
then ejecting eastward/northeastward (with east-central U.S. wave
tracking into eastern Canada), and finally another shortwave
settling over the Interior West/Rockies late in the week
(associated low pressure reaching the Plains by Friday-Saturday).

For the midweek Plains/Midwest storm, a slower trend by the
GFS/GEFS mean over the past day has narrowed the timing spread
somewhat. However new 12Z guidance does not improve confidence as
the GFS has actually nudged a bit faster again while the CMC leans
slower and the UKMET continues to hold its position on the slow
side of the spread. The 12Z ECMWF maintains its intermediate
continuity. Consensus continues to show the core of the upstream
shortwave reaching a little south of the Four Corners by early
Wednesday. Through the 00Z-06Z cycles the timing spread was
becoming a little less dramatic compared to prior days. A
compromise 70 percent toward the 00Z ECMWF/06Z GFS and their means
relative to the somewhat slower 00Z CMC/06Z parallel GFS (GFSP)
maintained continuity well and reflected the relative balance of
00Z-06Z guidance. The average of new 12Z solutions has adjusted a
little slower. Meanwhile the late week shortwave reaching the West
still shows better than average clustering and continuity in the
guidance though the 00Z ECMWF could start to get a little fast by
day 7 Saturday (slower in the new 12Z run). Models/means are
making gradual adjustments with specifics of associated low
pressure reaching the Plains late in the period.

The operational model blend employed for the first half of the
forecast excluded the 00Z UKMET as it was slow with upstream
features in addition to the Midwest storm. Favorable comparison of
an average among GFS/GFSP/ECMWF/CMC runs with the 06Z GEFS/00Z
ECMWF means allowed for a somewhat higher model-to-mean weight
than would typically be the case by late in the period.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Locally moderate to heavy precipitation may accompany the system
tracking northeast from the central Plains Tuesday onward. Much of
this activity should be in the form of rain but the northwest
fringe of the precip shield may contain some snow. Best potential
for any snow that occurs would extend from near central Nebraska
into northern Minnesota. The interaction of Gulf inflow with the
trailing front--which should decelerate and possibly stall for a
time while awaiting ejection of upstream dynamics from the
West--is likely to produce heavy rainfall over parts of the South
around midweek. Locations from the central Gulf Coast region into
the southern Appalachians currently have the best potential to see
the highest rainfall totals with this event. There is still enough
uncertainty that nearby areas will need to monitor forecasts as
well. Expect the aforementioned western energy to generate a wave
tracking west of the Appalachians Thursday into Friday. This
system will spread areas of moderate to heavy rain through more of
the East late in the week, with somewhat lower totals than over
the South due to faster progression/shorter duration. Another area
of rain may develop over the South next weekend as a warm front
returns northward ahead of the next upper trough reaching the
West. The two systems affecting the West will bring rain and
mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest eastward-southeastward
into much of the Rockies, with highest totals over favored terrain
in the Olympics, northern Cascades, and northern-central Rockies.


The large scale pattern from Tuesday into the weekend will tend to
favor above normal temperatures over the eastern half of the lower
48 and below normal readings from the West into the Rockies and
parts of the High Plains. Expect the highest warm anomalies of
plus 10-25F to extend from the Upper Midwest/western Great Lakes
into the Northeast Tuesday-Friday, ahead of the system tracking
northeast from the Plains and trailing wave lifting through the
east-central U.S. Morning lows could be close to daily record warm
values over parts of the East Coast. Proximity of the
strengthening Cuba/Bahamas upper ridge may push Florida Peninsula
high temperatures close to daily records at sites with a
relatively shorter period of record. Farther west there will be
two episodes of coolest temperatures. One around Tuesday-Wednesday
should feature highs 10-20F below normal over the Great Basin and
central/southern Rockies. The second will likely progress from
west to east Thursday-Saturday with most highs 5-10F or so below
normal, possibly 10-15F below normal over the north-central
Rockies/High Plains by next Saturday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
256 PM EDT Sat Mar 20 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Mar 23 2021 - 12Z Sat Mar 27 2021

...Midweek heavy rain threat over parts of the South, most likely
from the central Gulf Coast into southern Appalachians...

...Overview...

Expect a large scale mean trough aloft to persist over the
Plains/west-central U.S., between a ridge over the eastern Pacific
and a strengthening Cuba/Bahamas ridge whose influence will extend
into parts of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Shortwaves within
the trough will spread areas of rain and mountain snow from the
Pacific Northwest through much of the Rockies, and with the help
of Gulf moisture generate a broad area of rainfall over the
eastern half of the country. The greatest potential for heavy rain
currently exists from the central Gulf Coast into the southern
Appalachians. Models and ensembles still agree on the overall
pattern while gradually attempting to come close together or
stabilize for important timing and detail aspects of significant
features.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The primary systems of interest will be a fairly vigorous low
tracking northeast from the central Plains Tuesday onward,
upstream energy digging into the West/Rockies into early Wednesday
then ejecting eastward/northeastward (with east-central U.S. wave
tracking into eastern Canada), and finally another shortwave
settling over the Interior West/Rockies late in the week
(associated low pressure reaching the Plains by Friday-Saturday).

For the midweek Plains/Midwest storm, a slower trend by the
GFS/GEFS mean over the past day has narrowed the timing spread
somewhat. However new 12Z guidance does not improve confidence as
the GFS has actually nudged a bit faster again while the CMC leans
slower and the UKMET continues to hold its position on the slow
side of the spread. The 12Z ECMWF maintains its intermediate
continuity. Consensus continues to show the core of the upstream
shortwave reaching a little south of the Four Corners by early
Wednesday. Through the 00Z-06Z cycles the timing spread was
becoming a little less dramatic compared to prior days. A
compromise 70 percent toward the 00Z ECMWF/06Z GFS and their means
relative to the somewhat slower 00Z CMC/06Z parallel GFS (GFSP)
maintained continuity well and reflected the relative balance of
00Z-06Z guidance. The average of new 12Z solutions has adjusted a
little slower. Meanwhile the late week shortwave reaching the West
still shows better than average clustering and continuity in the
guidance though the 00Z ECMWF could start to get a little fast by
day 7 Saturday (slower in the new 12Z run). Models/means are
making gradual adjustments with specifics of associated low
pressure reaching the Plains late in the period.

The operational model blend employed for the first half of the
forecast excluded the 00Z UKMET as it was slow with upstream
features in addition to the Midwest storm. Favorable comparison of
an average among GFS/GFSP/ECMWF/CMC runs with the 06Z GEFS/00Z
ECMWF means allowed for a somewhat higher model-to-mean weight
than would typically be the case by late in the period.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Locally moderate to heavy precipitation may accompany the system
tracking northeast from the central Plains Tuesday onward. Much of
this activity should be in the form of rain but the northwest
fringe of the precip shield may contain some snow. Best potential
for any snow that occurs would extend from near central Nebraska
into northern Minnesota. The interaction of Gulf inflow with the
trailing front--which should decelerate and possibly stall for a
time while awaiting ejection of upstream dynamics from the
West--is likely to produce heavy rainfall over parts of the South
around midweek. Locations from the central Gulf Coast region into
the southern Appalachians currently have the best potential to see
the highest rainfall totals with this event. There is still enough
uncertainty that nearby areas will need to monitor forecasts as
well. Expect the aforementioned western energy to generate a wave
tracking west of the Appalachians Thursday into Friday. This
system will spread areas of moderate to heavy rain through more of
the East late in the week, with somewhat lower totals than over
the South due to faster progression/shorter duration. Another area
of rain may develop over the South next weekend as a warm front
returns northward ahead of the next upper trough reaching the
West. The two systems affecting the West will bring rain and
mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest eastward-southeastward
into much of the Rockies, with highest totals over favored terrain
in the Olympics, northern Cascades, and northern-central Rockies.


The large scale pattern from Tuesday into the weekend will tend to
favor above normal temperatures over the eastern half of the lower
48 and below normal readings from the West into the Rockies and
parts of the High Plains. Expect the highest warm anomalies of
plus 10-25F to extend from the Upper Midwest/western Great Lakes
into the Northeast Tuesday-Friday, ahead of the system tracking
northeast from the Plains and trailing wave lifting through the
east-central U.S. Morning lows could be close to daily record warm
values over parts of the East Coast. Proximity of the
strengthening Cuba/Bahamas upper ridge may push Florida Peninsula
high temperatures close to daily records at sites with a
relatively shorter period of record. Farther west there will be
two episodes of coolest temperatures. One around Tuesday-Wednesday
should feature highs 10-20F below normal over the Great Basin and
central/southern Rockies. The second will likely progress from
west to east Thursday-Saturday with most highs 5-10F or so below
normal, possibly 10-15F below normal over the north-central
Rockies/High Plains by next Saturday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat March 20 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0237 PM CDT Sat Mar 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

The previous forecast for portions of the Southwest into the
southern High Plains tomorrow remains on track. Latest guidance
consensus continues to show sub-15% surface RH lacking in coverage
to warrant a Critical delineation. Fuels also continue to be
marginally receptive of fire spread in several spots. Modestly dry,
breezy northwesterly surface flow will also accompany a post-cold
frontal environment across the northern Plains during the afternoon
hours. However, cooler temperatures and chances for showers are
expected to limit more robust wildfire-spread potential, precluding
any fire weather highlights at this time.

..Squitieri.. 03/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0115 AM CDT Sat Mar 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A trough over the southwestern U.S. will amplify while migrating
toward the Lower Colorado River Valley by early evening.  This will
result in a belt of strong (40-70 kt) mid-level flow from Arizona
through the southern and central High Plains.  At the surface, a low
will gradually organize along the New Mexico/Texas border region
during the forecast period.  Near/west of this low, dry and breezy
conditions will develop along with elevated to near-critical fire
weather.

...Eastern Arizona to far west Texas...
A broad region of westerly surface flow (with speeds of 15-25 mph)
will develop during peak heating hours Sunday. This flow will occur
within a dry airmass across the region with many areas of RH values
at or below 15% at times during the afternoon.  With areas of dry
fuels and ongoing drought, elevated to locally critical fire-weather
is expected.  There are a couple of limiting factors, however.  Many
areas may not experience sub-15% RH values.  Additionally, ERCs are
not particularly high in several areas.  Nevertheless, the most
likely region for critical fire weather is southwestern New Mexico,
and an upgrade may be needed there in subsequent outlooks.

Valid 00Z Sun Mar 21 2021 - 00Z Tue Mar 23 2021

...A couple of rounds of precipitation/snow are forecast for the
Northwest...

...Rain is expected for much of the central U.S. Sunday into
Monday, with snow possible in the central High Plains...

...Mild to warm temperatures are forecast across the north-central
to northeastern U.S. through Monday...

An upper-level trough is forecast to move from the western to the
central U.S. over the next couple of days and push a cold front
slowly eastward just ahead of it at the surface, causing
precipitation to develop. Through tonight, higher elevation snow
and lower elevation rain are possible in the Northwest, with snow
in the Central Rockies. As a low pressure system strengthens in
the central High Plains, precipitation could fall as snow there
Sunday into early Monday. Snow amounts of over a foot are possible
in the higher elevations of the Central Rockies, while a few
inches of snow could accumulate in the central High Plains.
Additional upper-level energy and another cold front are expected
to drop through the Northwest on Monday, causing another round of
snow. Through Monday, 1-2 feet of snow are forecast for the
Cascades, with over a foot in the Northern Rockies as well.

Rain will develop along the cold front in the north-central U.S.
Sunday, and should become more widespread by Sunday night and
Monday across the Plains into the Mississippi Valley. Some
thunderstorms are possible in the south-central U.S. as well.
Meanwhile, the front is expected to pass through with dry
conditions in the Southwest, and fire danger is a concern, with
Elevated to Critical Risks in place for the southern High Plains.

In the East, mainly dry conditions are expected through Monday
underneath a surface high pressure system. The exception will be
across the Atlantic coast from Florida to the Mid-Atlantic, where
a convergent frontal zone and a strengthening surface low pressure
system will develop. While the heaviest rainfall should remain
offshore, showery conditions can be expected there, as well as the
potential for high surf and rip currents. Cooler than normal
temperatures are forecast there given the cloudiness and rain
chances.

Cooler than average temperatures are also expected in the western
U.S. behind the cold front, spreading toward the High Plains
Monday. Meanwhile, milder than average temperatures by 10-20
degrees are likely from the Northern Plains to the Northeast, with
highs generally in the 50s and 60s.

...Midweek heavy rain threat over parts of the South, most likely
from the central Gulf Coast into southern Appalachians...

...Overview...

Expect a large scale mean trough aloft to persist over the
Plains/west-central U.S., between a ridge over the eastern Pacific
and a strengthening Cuba/Bahamas ridge whose influence will extend
into parts of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Shortwaves within
the trough will spread areas of rain and mountain snow from the
Pacific Northwest through much of the Rockies, and with the help
of Gulf moisture generate a broad area of rainfall over the
eastern half of the country. The greatest potential for heavy rain
currently exists from the central Gulf Coast into the southern
Appalachians. Models and ensembles still agree on the overall
pattern while gradually attempting to come close together or
stabilize for important timing and detail aspects of the most
significant features.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

One shortwave and associated deep surface low will be exiting the
Upper Midwest Wednesday-Thursday, as a second follows on its heels
(and a bit farther south) from the Southern Plains to the
Northeast Thursday-Saturday. The deterministic models show fairly
good agreement at this time with both systems so WPC leaned on a
majority deterministic model blend for days 3-5. Bigger forecast
questions and uncertainty begin to arise by late week as shortwave
energy amplifies over the Western U.S. and shifts east into the
Plains by Sunday/Day 7. The latest (18z/Mar 20) run of the GFS
splits northern and southern stream energy more than the rest of
the guidance, developing a deep closed low over Southern
California by the end of the period. There is a little support for
this from the latest run of the CMC as well. However, run to run
continuity is poor for both pieces of guidance (as well as the
ECMWF which is quicker to bring the trough into the Plains) so a
blend towards the ensemble means was preferred for days 6 and 7.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Some lingering precipitation (rain and/or snow) is likely on the
north side of the surface low exiting the Upper Midwest on
Wednesday. South of this however, the interaction of Gulf inflow
with the trailing front--which should decelerate and possibly
stall for a time while awaiting ejection of upstream dynamics from
the West--is likely to produce heavy rainfall over parts of the
South around midweek. Locations from the central Gulf Coast region
into the southern Appalachians continue to show the best potential
to see the highest rainfall totals with this event. There is still
enough uncertainty that nearby areas will need to monitor
forecasts as well. Expect the aforementioned western energy to
generate a wave tracking west of the Appalachians Thursday into
Friday. This system will spread areas of moderate to heavy rain
through more of the East late in the week, with somewhat lower
totals than over the South due to faster progression/shorter
duration. Another area of rain may develop over the South next
weekend as a warm front returns northward ahead of the next upper
trough reaching the West. The two systems affecting the West will
bring rain and mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest
eastward-southeastward into much of the Rockies, with highest
totals over favored terrain in the Olympics, northern Cascades,
and northern-central Rockies.

The large scale pattern from Tuesday into the weekend will tend to
favor above normal temperatures over the eastern half of the lower
48 and below normal readings from the West into the Rockies and
parts of the High Plains. Expect the highest warm anomalies of
plus 10-25F to extend from the Great Lakes into the Northeast
Wednesday-Friday, ahead of the system tracking northeast from the
Plains and trailing wave lifting through the east-central U.S..
Morning lows could be close to daily record warm values over parts
of the East Coast. Proximity of the strengthening Cuba/Bahamas
upper ridge may push Florida Peninsula high temperatures close to
daily records at sites with a relatively shorter period of record.
Farther west there will be two episodes of coolest temperatures.
One around Wednesday should feature highs 10-20F below normal over
the Great Basin and central/southern Rockies. The second will
likely progress from west to east Thursday-Saturday with most
highs 5-10F or so below normal, possibly 10-15F below normal over
the north-central Rockies/High Plains by next Saturday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF WEST TEXAS AND
SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow will amplify further across the southern Rockies/High
Plains as a mid-level low initially over the Four Corners reaches
the High Plains through the end of the forecast period.  As this
occurs, surface troughing/cyclogenesis will become more pronounced
across the Texas South Plains and vicinity, with very dry and windy
conditions west of the trough and increasingly moist air east of the
trough.  Fire-weather concerns will increase considerably west of
the trough.

...Southern Rockies/Plains...
The combination of increasing flow aloft and a steepening surface
pressure gradient will increase surface winds into the 30-40 mph
range across a broad corridor extending from southwestern New Mexico
to the Texas South Plains.  This flow will occur within an extremely
dry airmass characterized by 60s F surface temperatures and RH
values below 10% - lowest in southeastern New Mexico and adjacent
areas of west Texas.  These conditions flirt with extremely critical
thresholds in a few areas, with the only lingering concern being
fuel states and modest ERCs.  Nevertheless, large and rapidly
spreading fires are possible where ignitions occur.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHWESTERN INTO CENTRAL NEW
MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A positive-tilt trough will sharpen across the Desert Southwest
today while migrating southeastward toward the southern Rockies.
This wave will amplify flow aloft downstream into the 40-70 kt
range.  Meanwhile at the surface, a low will organize very near the
New Mexico/Texas border region.  The synoptic setup will foster
areas of elevated to critical fire-weather conditions across the
southern Rockies and High Plains.

...Eastern Arizona through western New Mexico...
Models continue to agree that a broad swath of westerly low-level
flow will develop during peak heating hours across the region.
Speeds of 15-25 mph will become common - locally higher across
southern and western New Mexico.  Meanwhile, a pre-existing dry
airmass will help RH values to lower into the 12-25% range in most
areas - locally lower from southwestern into central New Mexico.  A
critical delineation has been introduced where confidence is highest
that several hours of critically low RH values will coexist with 20+
mph surface winds.  Surrounding this delineation, critical fire
weather may be observed for brief periods throughout the afternoon.

...A storm system will become better organized across the central
U.S. bringing rain and snow...

The majority of the Eastern U.S. will enjoy a dry and cool airmass
through Sunday and into Monday as a large Canadian surface high
builds in from New England.  However, an upper level trough over
the southeast U.S. will support a surface low east of Florida that
will slowly lift towards the northeast, along with a stationary
frontal boundary just off the southeast U.S. coast.  The latest
indications suggest the heaviest rainfall will remain over the
offshore waters, but some showers can be expected from the Outer
Banks of North Carolina to northern Florida, along with some gusty
winds and elevated tide levels.

Across the central U.S., a slow moving cold front exiting the
Rockies will initially have a limited amount of moisture to work
with on Sunday.  An intensifying surface low along the boundary
across western Texas Monday morning will increase moisture
transport across the central and southern Plains, and lead to
greater coverage of rain across much of Kansas and extending
northward across eastern Nebraska and Iowa.  Some strong
thunderstorms may develop across the southern Plains on Monday in
the warm sector of the developing storm system.  Not much in the
way of precipitation is currently expected across Arizona and New
Mexico given a drier airmass here and less forcing, but additional
snow is likely for much of Colorado with the greatest
accumulations for the Front Range, potentially over eight inches
for some areas.  Moderate to heavy snow is also likely for
portions of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon as a second
storm system brings a cold front across this region by late
Sunday.

Cooler high temperatures are likely for the Central Rockies and
Intermountain West on Sunday as the western cold front moves
eastward, and seasonably mild temperatures are forecast for the
Southwest and the Central and Southern Plains ahead of the front.
With high pressure building in across the eastern third of the
nation, mild temperatures are also forecast to spread across the
Midwest and Northeast through Monday.

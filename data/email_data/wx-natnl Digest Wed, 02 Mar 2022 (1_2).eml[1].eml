..Squitieri.. 03/01/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1233 AM CST Tue Mar 01 2022/

...Synopsis...
The fire-weather threat will generally be limited across the CONUS
today, as expansive mid/upper-level ridging favors light surface
winds where the most substantial RH reductions are expected. The one
exception will be over portions of Missouri and eastern Kansas,
where modestly breezy surface winds could briefly overlap
near-critical RH atop very dry fuels during the afternoon. However,
these conditions look too marginal and localized for Elevated
highlights at this time.

...Heavy snow potential over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and
possibly into northern New England during the weekend...

...Heavy rainfall potential from the Mid-Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late weekend into early next week...

...Overview...

Models and ensemble means continue to show the establishment of a
positively tilted mean trough aloft from Canada into the western
U.S., between a building eastern Pacific ridge and another ridge
that migrates across the Gulf of Mexico into the Bahamas. A
leading impulse reaching the West by the start of the period early
Friday and another feature arriving close behind will bring
precipitation to portions of the West, followed by a broad area of
precipitation to the east of the Rockies as two potential systems
track into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley. The first system should
bring greater snowfall potential to the Upper Midwest/Upper Great
Lakes and to some degree northern New England. Most guidance shows
a second system developing along the trailing front whose slow
movement due to alignment with southwesterly mean flow aloft late
weekend into early next week could make it a focus for significant
rainfall farther south. Below normal temperatures will settle over
much of the western and central U.S. while much above normal
readings from the central/southern Plains into the Southeast late
this week become more pronounced over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Within what continues to be a consistently agreeable pattern from
a multi-day mean perspective, operational models continue to show
some spread and variability for details and are still in the
process of refining some of the specifics up to 5-6 days out in
time. There are some common themes though. The period begins
Friday with good consensus for three primary shortwaves within the
broader western trough. The past few guidance cycles have
indicated that the leading southeasternmost one centered over
California Friday will likely be in the form of a compact closed
low that crosses California and then ejects rapidly northeastward
(with mixed signals for being open or closed at various valid
times). The second shortwave now has better consensus that it will
take the form of a closed low as it generally follows the track of
the first, moving through the West and then turning northeastward.
The third is most likely to track across southwestern Canada late
this week and shear out early next week, though with its energy
possibly combining with the initial shortwave as it reaches the
Great Lakes. Then the 00Z CMC was alone in showing another small
closed low diving south along the West Coast over the weekend,
which was not favored.

As the initial shortwave tracks into the Midwest/Great Lakes by
early Sunday, the 00Z and newer 12Z guidance seems to have
steadied in showing deeper solutions with this feature and the
associated surface low compared to some previous runs. Guidance
still signals potential for some weakening beyond the Great Lakes
as the energy aloft may shear out to some degree. Latest GFS/ECMWF
runs and their means indicate that the second ejecting western
impulse may lead to another wave that reaches the Great Lakes or
Ohio Valley on a track farther southeast than the first one and
only about a day behind. There is more uncertainty in position and
depth with this surface low, and the strongest model thus far is
the 12Z GFS. Details of energy behind the second feature become
increasingly uncertain, as seen in differences among the
operational models as well as broadening spread among ensemble
members. The overall trends for this forecast update for day 7
were a deeper trough rebuilding across the West, which is now seen
in the 12Z ECMWF and CMC as well, and a faster trend of the cold
front tracking farther offshore into the Atlantic.

The updated forecast started with primary emphasis on the 06Z
GFS/00Z ECMWF with lesser input from the 00Z CMC/UKMET for about
the first half of the period, to reflect an intermediate solution
among the general clustering that existed for the two primary
upper systems and corresponding surface reflection. The reasonably
good clustering in the overall pattern but with some greater
uncertainty with details of trailing flow led to some addition of
the ensemble means particularly by day 7, but still with a
majority deterministic model blend. This approach yielded
generally modest refinements to continuity other than the
aforementioned ones.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The sequence of two upper systems moving into and through the West
from late this week through the weekend should spread rain and
higher elevation snow across the region. Most activity should be
light to moderate but some locally heavier totals will be
possible, primarily from the Sierra Nevada into the Wasatch and
central Rockies. With much lower confidence, another system that
may drop southeastward into the Northwest early next week may
produce some light to moderate precipitation.

Meanwhile weather will become more active across many areas to the
east of the Rockies from the end of this week into early next
week. The first western feature should generate surface low
pressure that tracks from the central Plains through Upper Great
Lakes during the weekend. The best potential for wintry
precipitation types still extends from the northern half of the
High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England
(where a changeover to rain may occur). Highest probability of
significant snowfall remains just to the northwest of the surface
low track, with increasing chances over the northern Plains and
continued chances over the Upper Midwest. Latest guidance suggests
the storm could be strong enough to produce some brisk winds but
model behavior thus far offers potential for additional changes in
the forecast. Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible over
the rest of the central/east-central U.S. ahead of the trailing
cold front. Embedded thunderstorms could be severe in the
Mid-Mississippi Valley on Saturday per the latest Storm Prediction
Center extended outlook. Then there is a continued signal for
heavier rainfall potential generally within an area from the
southeastern Plains into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by Saturday
night/Sunday into early next week. This threat corresponds to
slower progression of the trailing front as it becomes more
aligned with flow aloft, interaction with low level Gulf moisture,
and the possibility of another wave that would provide added
rainfall focus. The northwestern fringe of this moisture shield
should contain some wintry weather, likely along an axis somewhat
southeast of the first episode. Specifics will depend on
lower-confidence wave details.

Colder air overspreading the western and central U.S. late this
week into the weekend and persisting through at least early next
week should yield a broad area of temperatures that are 5-15F
below normal. Some pockets of colder anomalies are possible over
the northern/central High Plains, particularly in terms of highs.
Leading warm sector air, initially focused over the central Plains
and then becoming more pronounced over the East, will contain
readings that are 10-25F above normal with localized higher
anomalies possible for morning lows. Numerous locations over the
Southeast may challenge daily record highs from the weekend into
early next week, while record warm lows may extend farther
northward.

into Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late weekend into early next week...

...Overview...

Models and ensemble means continue to show the establishment of a
positively tilted mean trough aloft from Canada into the western
U.S., between a building eastern Pacific ridge and another ridge
that migrates across the Gulf of Mexico into the Bahamas. A
leading impulse reaching the West by the start of the period early
Friday and another feature arriving close behind will bring
precipitation to portions of the West, followed by a broad area of
precipitation to the east of the Rockies as two potential systems
track into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley. The first system should
bring greater snowfall potential to the Upper Midwest/Upper Great
Lakes and to some degree northern New England. Most guidance shows
a second system developing along the trailing front whose slow

SYNOPSIS: There is good agreement among the dynamical models in regards to =
the
strength and evolution of mid-level low pressure over the western half of t=
he
contiguous U.S. during week-2. The favored strengthening of this mid-level
feature during the period is expected to result in anomalously cold
temperatures for many areas west of the Mississippi, with an increased risk
for
much below normal temperatures over the Northern Plains towards the middle =
of
the period. Surface low formation favored over the Plains increases the
potential for heavy precipitation over flood prone areas of the east-centra=
l
CONUS and possible heavy snow over parts of the Plains and Midwest. Prevail=
ing
mid-level high pressure forecast for much of the eastern U.S. and Alaska is
favored to bring more tranquil conditions during week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Norther=

FOR WEDNESDAY MARCH 09 - TUESDAY MARCH 15: By the outset of week-2, there i=
s
good agreement among the dynamical model 500-hPa height forecasts depicting=
 a
negative Pacific-North America (PNA) pattern, as the anomalous troughing
predicted over the western CONUS continues to be the primary focus for haza=
rd
potential during the period. Consistent with previous model runs, both the
latest GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means favor the amplification of this mid-le=
vel
feature through the middle of week-2, resulting in a broad, full latitude
coverage of negative height departures extending from Canada to northern
Mexico
by days 9 and 10 (Mar 10-11). This mid-level pattern is expected to bring
anomalously cold temperatures to much of the western two thirds of the CONU=
S,
promote elevated winds across the southern tier, as well as help trigger
surface low formation to increase the risk of heavy precipitation downstrea=
m
over the southeastern U.S.  Later in the period, the latest ensemble guidan=
ce
has become slightly more progressive with the 500-hPa height pattern where
there are increasing signs of anomalous ridging developing over the West
Coast,
and the aforementioned troughing shifting eastward over the northeastern CO=
NUS
by the middle of March.



Late in week-1, the Weather Prediction Center's (WPC) surface analysis show=
s
high pressure overspreading the western and central CONUS in the wake of a
large, advancing frontal boundary where anomalously cold temperatures are
favored to be in place by the start of the period. By day 9, both the 0z GE=
FS
and 0z ECMWF ensemble continue to show surface low development in lee of th=
e
Rockies tied to the amplifying troughing aloft, as a potential northeastern
storm track is expected to draw another round of cold air into portions of =
the
northwestern and north-central CONUS. This evolution is well reflected in t=
he
reforecast tools which show a widespread coverage of at least a 20% chance =
of
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below freezing a=
t
the start of the period, with increasing probabilities focused over the
north-central CONUS which peak in magnitude (40-60%) on days 10 and 11 (Mar
11-12). Thus, a moderate risk of much below normal temperatures remains iss=
ued
for Mar 10-12, and is expanded to include more of the Northern Plains and t=
he
Upper Mississippi Valley relative to yesterday's outlook. A key disagreemen=
t
between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools concerns the potential for
anomalous cold shifting eastward with time. The GEFS reforecast tool falls
more
in-line with the progressive nature of the raw ensemble mean height forecas=
ts
late in the period (i.e. increasing potential for much below normal
temperatures over the northeastern U.S), whereas the ECMWF reforecast tool
maintains much of the anomalous cold primarily west of the Mississippi Vall=
ey
through the end of the period. Given the added uncertainty at this lead, th=
e
slight risk area of much below normal temperatures remains issued for many
parts of the western and central CONUS, but is now valid from Mar 9-13 in
today's outlook.



Across the southwestern and south-central CONUS, the strengthening trough
favored aloft is expected to be conducive for elevated winds throughout thi=
s
part of the country. This is supported by strong surface pressure gradients=
 in
the deterministic and ensemble guidance, and reforecast tools through the
middle of period, and a slight risk of high winds remains issued from the F=
our
Corners region to the southern Plains, Mar 9-13. The potential for high win=
ds
over parts of the Southwest and Great Basin increases the risk of wildfires
and
dust storms given low soil moisture content and the widespread severe to
extreme drought conditions currently registered in the region.



With the aforementioned surface low forecast to develop across the High
Plains,
both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to feature surface high pressure
situated over the western Atlantic to set up return flow and the advection =
of
Gulf of Mexico moisture into the southern tier of the CONUS. While there is
good multi-model agreement among the raw calibrated ensembles regarding the
location of potentially heavy precipitation, the ECMWF ensemble has backed =
off
on the magnitude of daily mean precipitation amounts over the southeastern
CONUS compared to yesterday. Good agreement still exists between the GEFS a=
nd
ECMWF reforecast tools with at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation
amounts exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch to support the continuatio=
n
of
a slight risk of heavy precipitation over the southeastern CONUS for Mar 9-=
12.
The increased precipitation anticipated over the eastern CONUS early in the
period also supports the continuation of a flooding possible hazard over
portions of the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, given antecedent w=
et
conditions, ongoing river flooding, and above-normal precipitation forecast=
 in
the region late in week-1.  Additionally, with cold air advection favored
upstream across the Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, increased snowfall=
 is
likely on the backside of the surface low as it tracks northeastward.
Reforecast tools maintain at least a 20% chance of 3-day amounts exceeding =
the
85th percentile across the Missouri River basin and the upper Midwest, and =
a
slight risk of heavy snow remains issued for Mar 9-11.



Over Alaska, amplified mid-level ridiging forecast over much of northern
Pacific and the Bering Sea is expected to lead to unseasonably warm
temperatures with increased onshore flow to promote above-normal precipitat=
ion
across the western Mainland. No precipitation related hazards are posted as
amounts are not expected to reach hazard thresholds. However, the persisten=
ce
of above normal temperatures over Alaska bears monitoring as the state
approaches the river ice breakup season later this spring.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 PM CST Tue Mar 01 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. In addition, dry surface
conditions are expected during the afternoon tomorrow across the
Southeast. Sustained surface winds approaching 10 mph amid 15-25
percent minimum surface RH will materialize across southern Alabama
into southern South Carolina in the 18-21Z period. Since fuels are
modestly receptive to fire spread, and the ambient surface wind
speeds are likely to be relatively weak, no fire weather highlights
have been introduced this outlook. However, localized
wildfire-spread concerns exist wherever gustier winds overlap with
drier fuel beds.

..Squitieri.. 03/01/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1235 AM CST Tue Mar 01 2022/

...Synopsis...
An amplified mid/upper-level ridge will encompass the western
two-thirds of the CONUS, where a dry antecedent airmass will remain
in place. As maximum temperatures climb into the middle/upper 70s
across the central and southern Plains, widespread minimum RH
reductions of 10-15 percent will develop. Along the northern
periphery of the ridge, a midlevel speed maximum will move
southeastward across the Missouri Valley, supporting the potential
for 15-20 mph wind gusts across the central Plains into parts of the
Middle MS Valley. This could result in locally elevated conditions,
though the lack of a tighter surface pressure gradient casts
uncertainty on the fire-weather threat. Therefore, no Elevated
highlights will be added at this time, though trends will be
monitored.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Tue March 01 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 07 - 11 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. A strong ridge and associated abov=
e
normal 500-hPa heights are predicted across the Northeast Pacific, extendin=
g
north to Alaska. An enhanced trough is predicted over the western and centr=
al
CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights. Downstream, ridging is forecast to
persist over the eastern CONUS, leading to predicted above normal heights
there.

Increased chances for above normal temperatures are indicated for most of
Alaska, associated with predicted above normal 500-hPa heights. There are
enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures across the western and
much
of the central CONUS beneath amplified troughing. Above normal temperatures
are
likely for the eastern CONUS and the Lower Mississippi Valley due to predic=
ted
ridging and above normal heights.

The potential for several storm systems tracking ahead of a mean trough wes=
t
of
Mainland Alaska favors increased probabilities for above normal precipitati=
on
for southern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. The predicted ridge over th=
e
Northeast Pacific favors enhanced odds of below normal precipitation across
the
Alaska Panhandle and parts of the Southwest and Southern High Plains. Sever=
al
storm systems are forecast to develop ahead of the western trough and track
east across the country, enhancing the likelihood of above normal
precipitation
for most of the central and eastern CONUS.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 09 - 15 2022

During the week-2 period, split 500-hPa flow is forecast to develop over
Alaska, resulting in distinct ridges over the Northeast Pacific and norther=
n
Mainland Alaska, respectively. An amplified pattern is forecast to remain
across the CONUS associated with expansive troughing extending from
east-central Canada southward to much of the central and western CONUS. Thi=
s
trough is forecast to progress eastward, resulting in height falls for the
Northeast. Ridging is forecast to persist farther to the south, across the
Southeast.

Above normal temperatures are favored for Alaska associated with mean ridgi=
ng
predicted over the state. Conversely, below normal temperatures are favored
for
most of the western and central CONUS, associated with troughing. Near to
above
normal temperatures are favored for the eastern CONUS, ahead of the predict=
ed
troughing.

An active pattern is likely to continue into week-2 across southwestern
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians underneath enhanced southwesterly mid-lev=
el
flow, leading to elevated probabilities of above normal precipitation. Belo=
w
normal precipitation is most likely across eastern Mainland Alaska, the Ala=
ska
Panhandle, and the Southwest, associated with ridging forecast over norther=
n
Mainland Alaska and off the West Coast of the CONUS. Below normal
precipitation
is also favored for parts of the Southern High Plains consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. Near to above normal precipitation is favored
across the Northern and Central Rockies eastward to Mississippi Valley and =
the
eastern CONUS associated with broad, cyclonic mid-level flow.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern, off=
set
by some disagreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

...Heavy precipitation across portions of the Pacific Northwest
continues to wane but unsettled weather will persist across the
area through midweek...

...Above normal temperatures will expand eastward into the eastern
U.S. but cold conditions with periods of light snow remain across
the northern tier...

Afternoon satellite and radar imagery show the Pacific moisture
plume responsible for heavy rain and winter weather over parts of
the Pacific Northwest and the northern Rockies continues to flow
onshore, albeit in a weakened state. The forecast for a lowering
excessive rainfall risk looking toward midweek remains on track,
although isolated instances of flash flooding are possible today
in western Oregon/southwest Washington where a Marginal Risk of
excessive rainfall resides. Although the flash flood threat is
expected to end by tomorrow morning, unsettled weather should
remain overhead through midweek as remnant low pressure offshore
will continue to direct moisture toward the coast.  Meanwhile, a
frontal boundary is forecast to slide slowly across the Pacific
Northwest to reach northern California by Thursday morning,
bringing another shot of rain and modest high elevation snow into
the region. East of the Rockies, yet another Arctic cold front
will support snow and wintry precipitation chances over the
Northern Plains beginning Wednesday, although generally limited
impacts are anticipated for this event as of now. The same front
will further spread snows across the Great Lakes, Northeast, and
New England Wednesday-Thursday, with limited to localized minor
impacts from snow accumulations possible.

Ahead of the front, Spring-like temps are in store for much of the
CONUS, as Daytime highs are forecast to climb 10-30 above normal
across most places from the central and southern Plains to the
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast today and Wednesday. A few daily high
temperature records could fall in the central Plains and Southwest
by the end of the work week. Eventually, the aforementioned Arctic
air mass should surge south out of the Upper-Midwest by Thursday
and temporarily end the warm weather for the northern half of the
CONUS. Strong southerly flow should arrive in time for the
weekend, however, to usher in above average temperatures once
again over the Plains, Southeast, and Midwest.

...Heavy snow potential over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and
possibly into northern New England during the weekend...

...Heavy rainfall potential from the Mid-Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late weekend into early next week...

...Overview...

Models and ensemble means continue to show the establishment of a
positively tilted mean trough aloft from Canada into the western
U.S., between a building eastern Pacific ridge and another ridge
that migrates across the Gulf of Mexico into the Bahamas. A
leading impulse reaching the West by the start of the period early
Friday and another feature arriving close behind will bring
precipitation to portions of the West, followed by a broad area of
precipitation to the east of the Rockies as two potential systems
track into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley. The first system should
bring greater snowfall potential to the Upper Midwest/Upper Great
Lakes and to some degree northern New England. Most guidance shows
a second system developing along the trailing front whose slow
movement due to alignment with southwesterly mean flow aloft late
weekend into early next week could make it a focus for significant
rainfall farther south. Below normal temperatures will settle over
much of the western and central U.S. while much above normal
readings from the central/southern Plains into the Southeast late
this week become more pronounced over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Within what continues to be a consistently agreeable pattern from
a multi-day mean perspective, operational models continue to show
some spread and variability for details and are still in the
process of refining some of the specifics up to 5-6 days out in
time. There are some common themes though. The period begins
Friday with good consensus for three primary shortwaves within the
broader western trough. The past few guidance cycles have
indicated that the leading southeasternmost one centered over
California Friday will likely be in the form of a compact closed
low that crosses California and then ejects rapidly northeastward
(with mixed signals for being open or closed at various valid
times). The second shortwave now has better consensus that it will
take the form of a closed low as it generally follows the track of
the first, moving through the West and then turning northeastward.
The third is most likely to track across southwestern Canada late
this week and shear out early next week, though with its energy
possibly combining with the initial shortwave as it reaches the
Great Lakes. Then the 00Z CMC was alone in showing another small
closed low diving south along the West Coast over the weekend,
which was not favored.

As the initial shortwave tracks into the Midwest/Great Lakes by
early Sunday, the 00Z and newer 12Z guidance seems to have
steadied in showing deeper solutions with this feature and the
associated surface low compared to some previous runs. Guidance
still signals potential for some weakening beyond the Great Lakes
as the energy aloft may shear out to some degree. Latest GFS/ECMWF
runs and their means indicate that the second ejecting western
impulse may lead to another wave that reaches the Great Lakes or
Ohio Valley on a track farther southeast than the first one and
only about a day behind. There is more uncertainty in position and
depth with this surface low, and the strongest model thus far is
the 12Z GFS. Details of energy behind the second feature become
increasingly uncertain, as seen in differences among the
operational models as well as broadening spread among ensemble
members. The overall trends for this forecast update for day 7
were a deeper trough rebuilding across the West, which is now seen
in the 12Z ECMWF and CMC as well, and a faster trend of the cold
front tracking farther offshore into the Atlantic.

The updated forecast started with primary emphasis on the 06Z
GFS/00Z ECMWF with lesser input from the 00Z CMC/UKMET for about
the first half of the period, to reflect an intermediate solution
among the general clustering that existed for the two primary
upper systems and corresponding surface reflection. The reasonably
good clustering in the overall pattern but with some greater
uncertainty with details of trailing flow led to some addition of
the ensemble means particularly by day 7, but still with a
majority deterministic model blend. This approach yielded
generally modest refinements to continuity other than the
aforementioned ones.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The sequence of two upper systems moving into and through the West
from late this week through the weekend should spread rain and
higher elevation snow across the region. Most activity should be
light to moderate but some locally heavier totals will be
possible, primarily from the Sierra Nevada into the Wasatch and
central Rockies. With much lower confidence, another system that
may drop southeastward into the Northwest early next week may
produce some light to moderate precipitation.

Meanwhile weather will become more active across many areas to the
east of the Rockies from the end of this week into early next
week. The first western feature should generate surface low
pressure that tracks from the central Plains through Upper Great
Lakes during the weekend. The best potential for wintry
precipitation types still extends from the northern half of the
High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England
(where a changeover to rain may occur). Highest probability of
significant snowfall remains just to the northwest of the surface
low track, with increasing chances over the northern Plains and
continued chances over the Upper Midwest. Latest guidance suggests
the storm could be strong enough to produce some brisk winds but
model behavior thus far offers potential for additional changes in
the forecast. Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible over
the rest of the central/east-central U.S. ahead of the trailing
cold front. Embedded thunderstorms could be severe in the
Mid-Mississippi Valley on Saturday per the latest Storm Prediction
Center extended outlook. Then there is a continued signal for
heavier rainfall potential generally within an area from the
southeastern Plains into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by Saturday
night/Sunday into early next week. This threat corresponds to
slower progression of the trailing front as it becomes more
aligned with flow aloft, interaction with low level Gulf moisture,
and the possibility of another wave that would provide added
rainfall focus. The northwestern fringe of this moisture shield
should contain some wintry weather, likely along an axis somewhat
southeast of the first episode. Specifics will depend on
lower-confidence wave details.

Colder air overspreading the western and central U.S. late this
week into the weekend and persisting through at least early next
week should yield a broad area of temperatures that are 5-15F
below normal. Some pockets of colder anomalies are possible over
the northern/central High Plains, particularly in terms of highs.
Leading warm sector air, initially focused over the central Plains
and then becoming more pronounced over the East, will contain
readings that are 10-25F above normal with localized higher
anomalies possible for morning lows. Numerous locations over the
Southeast may challenge daily record highs from the weekend into
early next week, while record warm lows may extend farther
northward.

...Heavy snow potential over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and
possibly into northern New England during the weekend...

...Heavy rainfall potential from the Mid-Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late weekend into early next week...

...Overview...

Models and ensemble means continue to show the establishment of a
positively tilted mean trough aloft from Canada into the western
U.S., between a building eastern Pacific ridge and another ridge
that migrates across the Gulf of Mexico into the Bahamas. A
leading impulse reaching the West by the start of the period early
Friday and another feature arriving close behind will bring
precipitation to portions of the West, followed by a broad area of
precipitation to the east of the Rockies as two potential systems
track into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley. The first system should
bring greater snowfall potential to the Upper Midwest/Upper Great
Lakes and to some degree northern New England. Most guidance shows
a second system developing along the trailing front whose slow
movement due to alignment with southwesterly mean flow aloft late
weekend into early next week could make it a focus for significant
rainfall farther south. Below normal temperatures will settle over
much of the western and central U.S. while much above normal
readings from the central/southern Plains into the Southeast late
this week become more pronounced over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Within what continues to be a consistently agreeable pattern from
a multi-day mean perspective, operational models continue to show
some spread and variability for details and are still in the
process of refining some of the specifics up to 5-6 days out in
time. There are some common themes though. The period begins
Friday with good consensus for three primary shortwaves within the
broader western trough. The past few guidance cycles have
indicated that the leading southeasternmost one centered over
California Friday will likely be in the form of a compact closed
low that crosses California and then ejects rapidly northeastward
(with mixed signals for being open or closed at various valid
times). The second shortwave now has better consensus that it will
take the form of a closed low as it generally follows the track of
the first, moving through the West and then turning northeastward.
The third is most likely to track across southwestern Canada late
this week and shear out early next week, though with its energy
possibly combining with the initial shortwave as it reaches the
Great Lakes. Then the 00Z CMC was alone in showing another small
closed low diving south along the West Coast over the weekend,
which was not favored.

As the initial shortwave tracks into the Midwest/Great Lakes by
early Sunday, the 00Z and newer 12Z guidance seems to have
steadied in showing deeper solutions with this feature and the
associated surface low compared to some previous runs. Guidance
still signals potential for some weakening beyond the Great Lakes
as the energy aloft may shear out to some degree. Latest GFS/ECMWF
runs and their means indicate that the second ejecting western
impulse may lead to another wave that reaches the Great Lakes or
Ohio Valley on a track farther southeast than the first one and
only about a day behind. There is more uncertainty in position and
depth with this surface low, and the strongest model thus far is
the 12Z GFS. Details of energy behind the second feature become
increasingly uncertain, as seen in differences among the
operational models as well as broadening spread among ensemble
members. The overall trends for this forecast update for day 7
were a deeper trough rebuilding across the West, which is now seen
in the 12Z ECMWF and CMC as well, and a faster trend of the cold
front tracking farther offshore into the Atlantic.

The updated forecast started with primary emphasis on the 06Z
GFS/00Z ECMWF with lesser input from the 00Z CMC/UKMET for about
the first half of the period, to reflect an intermediate solution
among the general clustering that existed for the two primary
upper systems and corresponding surface reflection. The reasonably
good clustering in the overall pattern but with some greater
uncertainty with details of trailing flow led to some addition of
the ensemble means particularly by day 7, but still with a
majority deterministic model blend. This approach yielded
generally modest refinements to continuity other than the
aforementioned ones.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The sequence of two upper systems moving into and through the West
from late this week through the weekend should spread rain and
higher elevation snow across the region. Most activity should be
light to moderate but some locally heavier totals will be
possible, primarily from the Sierra Nevada into the Wasatch and
central Rockies. With much lower confidence, another system that
may drop southeastward into the Northwest early next week may
produce some light to moderate precipitation.

Meanwhile weather will become more active across many areas to the
east of the Rockies from the end of this week into early next
week. The first western feature should generate surface low
pressure that tracks from the central Plains through Upper Great
Lakes during the weekend. The best potential for wintry
precipitation types still extends from the northern half of the
High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England
(where a changeover to rain may occur). Highest probability of
significant snowfall remains just to the northwest of the surface
low track, with increasing chances over the northern Plains and
continued chances over the Upper Midwest. Latest guidance suggests
the storm could be strong enough to produce some brisk winds but
model behavior thus far offers potential for additional changes in
the forecast. Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible over
the rest of the central/east-central U.S. ahead of the trailing
cold front. Embedded thunderstorms could be severe in the
Mid-Mississippi Valley on Saturday per the latest Storm Prediction
Center extended outlook. Then there is a continued signal for
heavier rainfall potential generally within an area from the
southeastern Plains into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by Saturday
night/Sunday into early next week. This threat corresponds to
slower progression of the trailing front as it becomes more
aligned with flow aloft, interaction with low level Gulf moisture,
and the possibility of another wave that would provide added
rainfall focus. The northwestern fringe of this moisture shield
should contain some wintry weather, likely along an axis somewhat
southeast of the first episode. Specifics will depend on
lower-confidence wave details.

Colder air overspreading the western and central U.S. late this
week into the weekend and persisting through at least early next
week should yield a broad area of temperatures that are 5-15F
below normal. Some pockets of colder anomalies are possible over
the northern/central High Plains, particularly in terms of highs.
Leading warm sector air, initially focused over the central Plains
and then becoming more pronounced over the East, will contain
readings that are 10-25F above normal with localized higher
anomalies possible for morning lows. Numerous locations over the
Southeast may challenge daily record highs from the weekend into
early next week, while record warm lows may extend farther
northward.

...Heavy snow potential over the Northern Plains through Great
Lakes and possibly into northern New England during the weekend...

...Heavy rainfall potential from the Mid-Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late weekend into early next week...

...Overview...

Guidance maintains the forecast of a positively tilted mean trough
from Canada into the western U.S., between a strong ridge over the
eastern Pacific and another ridge ridge that meanders over or near
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. This configuration will support
an active weather pattern, with a couple episodes of precipitation
over parts of the West and likely one or more areas of significant
rain and snow over some areas of the central and eastern U.S. The
system having highest confidence will track northeastward from the
central Rockies/Plains into the Upper Great Lakes this weekend
with a corresponding band of snow from the north-central High
Plains through the Upper Great Lakes and possibly northern New
England. A trailing upper low reaching the West should ultimately
produce another surface wave, along the first system's cold front,
that takes a somewhat farther southeast track but whose details
are otherwise less certain. This evolution may support an area of
heavy rainfall over parts of the east-central U.S. late weekend
into early next week and possibly some snow on the cold side of
the second wave. Below normal temperatures initially over the West
and northern Plains will expand into the rest of the central U.S.
while frontal progression will gradually trim the western extent
of much above normal temperature anomalies over the
central/eastern states.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Early in the period a blend of the 12Z/18Z operational models
provided a reasonable starting point for the forecast. After some
significant variability and spread in recent days, guidance over
the past day appears to be stabilizing within the stronger half of
the prior envelope for strength as it reaches the Upper Great
Lakes early Sunday while maintaining decent continuity for track.
The 00Z CMC trended somewhat weaker than its 12Z run though.
Latest consensus seems to be holding onto better definition as it
continues northeastward. The trailing wave (or even two waves),
initially supported by the next upper low tracking out of the
West, still shows up in most guidance but it remains a complicated
forecast. Not only does flow immediately upstream have some
possible influence on the feature, but separate upper troughing
that drops into the northern Plains and vicinity could eventually
interact with it. Thus latest runs vary significantly for the
character and timing of the surface reflection (new 00Z ECMWF
trending notably slower for example), including differences in
strength and whether there is one consolidated wave or possibly
two waves. By early Monday the model blend and modest
incorporation of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means accounted for the
uncertainty with this feature at that time. If anything,
north-south spread has widened in the new 00Z guidance.

Returning upstream later in the period, there is some relative
agreement that mid-period energy over the West should gradually
continue eastward (but with less effect on sensible weather) but a
lot more spread with a shortwave expected to round the Pacific
ridge and possibly drop into the Northwest. Ensemble means have
tended to agree upon a somewhat faster progression than the latest
ECMWF and especially CMC runs while the GFS and UKMET have been
closer to the means in principle. For continuity the forecast
ultimately trended a little more toward the ensemble means by next
Wednesday with a little more weight to the GFS relative to the
ECMWF for the lingering operational weight.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Across the West, the leading system emerging into the Plains may
produce some central Rockies snow early in the weekend while the
system immediately behind it spreads rain and higher elevation
snow primarily from the Sierra Nevada into the Wasatch and central
Rockies. Expect generally light to moderate totals but with some
locally heavier totals possible. There is continued potential for
another system to spread mostly light to moderate precipitation
into the Northwest/northern Rockies during the first half of next
week but with less than ideal confidence in the details.

To the east of the Rockies, the leading system forecast to track
from the central Plains through Upper Great Lakes during the
weekend should spread wintry precipitation from the north-central
High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England
(where a changeover to rain may occur). Highest probability of
significant snowfall remains just to the northwest of the surface
low track, with increasing chances over the northern Plains and
continued chances over the Upper Midwest. The storm may be strong
enough to produce some brisk winds, with specifics to be resolved
in coming days. Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible
over the rest of the central/east-central U.S. ahead of the
trailing cold front. Embedded thunderstorms could be severe in the
Mid-Mississippi Valley on Saturday per the latest Storm Prediction
Center extended outlook. Guidance is still showing potential for
heavier rainfall within an area from the southeastern Plains into
the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by Saturday night/Sunday into early
next week. This threat corresponds to slower progression of the
trailing front as it becomes more aligned with flow aloft,
interaction with low level Gulf moisture, and the possibility of
one or more waves that would provide added rainfall focus. The
northwestern fringe of this moisture shield should contain some
wintry weather, likely along an axis somewhat southeast of the
first episode. Specifics will depend on lower-confidence wave
details which will take additional time to resolve.

Colder air initially over the western U.S. and northern Plains and
spreading over the rest of the central U.S. into early next week
should yield a broad area of temperatures that are 5-15F below
normal. Best potential for locally colder anomalies, especially
for highs, will be over the northern/central High Plains. Leading
warm sector air, initially focused over the central-southern
Plains and southern two-thirds of the East on Saturday, will
become more pronounced over the East by Sunday-Monday when plus
10-25F above normal anomalies for highs and localized higher
anomalies for morning lows may challenge daily records for
highs/warm lows. Highest concentration of record highs may be over
the Southeast with a few record highs elsewhere. Coverage of
record warm lows may be broader. After Monday, frontal progression
will increasingly confine the warmth to the Southeast.

...Heavy snow potential over the Northern Plains through Great
Lakes and possibly into northern New England during the weekend...

...Heavy rainfall potential from the Mid-Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late weekend into early next week...

...Overview...

Guidance maintains the forecast of a positively tilted mean trough
from Canada into the western U.S., between a strong ridge over the
eastern Pacific and another ridge ridge that meanders over or near
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. This configuration will support
an active weather pattern, with a couple episodes of precipitation
over parts of the West and likely one or more areas of significant
rain and snow over some areas of the central and eastern U.S. The
system having highest confidence will track northeastward from the
central Rockies/Plains into the Upper Great Lakes this weekend
with a corresponding band of snow from the north-central High
Plains through the Upper Great Lakes and possibly northern New
England. A trailing upper low reaching the West should ultimately
produce another surface wave, along the first system's cold front,
that takes a somewhat farther southeast track but whose details
are otherwise less certain. This evolution may support an area of
heavy rainfall over parts of the east-central U.S. late weekend
into early next week and possibly some snow on the cold side of
the second wave. Below normal temperatures initially over the West
and northern Plains will expand into the rest of the central U.S.
while frontal progression will gradually trim the western extent
of much above normal temperature anomalies over the
central/eastern states.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Early in the period a blend of the 12Z/18Z operational models
provided a reasonable starting point for the forecast. After some
significant variability and spread in recent days, guidance over
the past day appears to be stabilizing within the stronger half of
the prior envelope for strength as it reaches the Upper Great
Lakes early Sunday while maintaining decent continuity for track.
The 00Z CMC trended somewhat weaker than its 12Z run though.
Latest consensus seems to be holding onto better definition as it
continues northeastward. The trailing wave (or even two waves),
initially supported by the next upper low tracking out of the
West, still shows up in most guidance but it remains a complicated
forecast. Not only does flow immediately upstream have some
possible influence on the feature, but separate upper troughing
that drops into the northern Plains and vicinity could eventually
interact with it. Thus latest runs vary significantly for the
character and timing of the surface reflection (new 00Z ECMWF
trending notably slower for example), including differences in
strength and whether there is one consolidated wave or possibly
two waves. By early Monday the model blend and modest
incorporation of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means accounted for the
uncertainty with this feature at that time. If anything,
north-south spread has widened in the new 00Z guidance.

Returning upstream later in the period, there is some relative
agreement that mid-period energy over the West should gradually
continue eastward (but with less effect on sensible weather) but a
lot more spread with a shortwave expected to round the Pacific
ridge and possibly drop into the Northwest. Ensemble means have
tended to agree upon a somewhat faster progression than the latest
ECMWF and especially CMC runs while the GFS and UKMET have been
closer to the means in principle. For continuity the forecast
ultimately trended a little more toward the ensemble means by next
Wednesday with a little more weight to the GFS relative to the
ECMWF for the lingering operational weight.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Across the West, the leading system emerging into the Plains may
produce some central Rockies snow early in the weekend while the
system immediately behind it spreads rain and higher elevation
snow primarily from the Sierra Nevada into the Wasatch and central
Rockies. Expect generally light to moderate totals but with some
locally heavier totals possible. There is continued potential for
another system to spread mostly light to moderate precipitation
into the Northwest/northern Rockies during the first half of next
week but with less than ideal confidence in the details.

To the east of the Rockies, the leading system forecast to track
from the central Plains through Upper Great Lakes during the
weekend should spread wintry precipitation from the north-central
High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England
(where a changeover to rain may occur). Highest probability of
significant snowfall remains just to the northwest of the surface
low track, with increasing chances over the northern Plains and
continued chances over the Upper Midwest. The storm may be strong
enough to produce some brisk winds, with specifics to be resolved
in coming days. Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible
over the rest of the central/east-central U.S. ahead of the
trailing cold front. Embedded thunderstorms could be severe in the
Mid-Mississippi Valley on Saturday per the latest Storm Prediction
Center extended outlook. Guidance is still showing potential for
heavier rainfall within an area from the southeastern Plains into
the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by Saturday night/Sunday into early
next week. This threat corresponds to slower progression of the
trailing front as it becomes more aligned with flow aloft,
interaction with low level Gulf moisture, and the possibility of
one or more waves that would provide added rainfall focus. The
northwestern fringe of this moisture shield should contain some
wintry weather, likely along an axis somewhat southeast of the
first episode. Specifics will depend on lower-confidence wave
details which will take additional time to resolve.

Colder air initially over the western U.S. and northern Plains and
spreading over the rest of the central U.S. into early next week
should yield a broad area of temperatures that are 5-15F below
normal. Best potential for locally colder anomalies, especially
for highs, will be over the northern/central High Plains. Leading
warm sector air, initially focused over the central-southern
Plains and southern two-thirds of the East on Saturday, will
become more pronounced over the East by Sunday-Monday when plus
10-25F above normal anomalies for highs and localized higher
anomalies for morning lows may challenge daily records for
highs/warm lows. Highest concentration of record highs may be over
the Southeast with a few record highs elsewhere. Coverage of
record warm lows may be broader. After Monday, frontal progression
will increasingly confine the warmth to the Southeast.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Expansive mid/upper-level ridging will remain centered over the
western states, while the southern periphery of strong northwesterly
flow aloft extends across the central Plains and Lower Missouri
Valley. At the surface, a cold front will move southward across the
northern and central Plains.

...Central/Southern Plains into the Lower Missouri Valley...
As maximum temperatures climb into the upper 70s to lower 80s,
widespread 10-20 percent RH will develop across the region. Ahead of
the approaching cold front, sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds may reach 10-15 mph (with gusts up to 20 mph) across portions
of eastern Kansas, northeastern Oklahoma, and western Missouri.
Here, the combination of critically low RH, locally breezy surface
winds, and dry fuels could support spotty elevated conditions.
However, the lack of a tighter pressure gradient and modest
sustained surface winds cast uncertainty on the overall fire-weather
threat -- precluding highlights at this time.

...Southeast...
A very dry antecedent airmass will remain in place, supporting
minimum afternoon RH of 15-20 percent where fuels continue to dry.
While the critically low RH and drying fuels do raise fire-weather
concerns, generally light sustained surface winds (10 mph or less)
should limit the overall fire-weather threat.

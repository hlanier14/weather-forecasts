Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 AM CDT Wed Jun 02 2021

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

The previous forecast remains valid with no major changes. Isolated
mostly dry thunderstorms will be possible across portions of western
Wyoming this afternoon and evening. However, sparse fuels and above
average fuel moisture suggest the threat for fire initiation will be
limited. See the previous discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 06/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CDT Wed Jun 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad upper troughing will prevail across the central and eastern
CONUS as a mid-level ridge continues to slowly propagate eastward
from the West Coast towards the Inter-mountain West today. Beneath
the mid-level ridge, hot surface temperatures will contribute to
some wildfire concerns across central California. Also, an impinging
mid-level trough towards the end of the period will promote enough
lift for isolated thunderstorms across portions of southern Oregon
into northern California late in the day. Brief, locally dry and
breezy conditions may also be expected across terrain-favoring areas
of the Lower Colorado River Basin. Otherwise, weak surface winds,
moist low-level conditions, or appreciable rainfall accumulations
will dampen significant wildfire-spread concerns east of the
Rockies.

...Central California into southern Oregon...
As temperatures peak near 100 F across portions of California
tomorrow, heat low development is likely in the inner valley areas.
Dry downslope flow is expected along the immediate lee of the Coast
Ranges bordering the lower Sacramento Valley, Bay Area, and San
Joaquin Valley, which may promote low-end Elevated conditions by
afternoon peak heating. Unseasonably dry fuels are the primary
motivator for maintaining Elevated highlights. In addition,
plume-dominated wildfire potential will exist across the higher
terrain areas of the Coast Ranges and windward side of the Sierra
given near-record temperatures coupled with upslope flow and
receptive fuels.

...Northern California into southern Oregon...
By late afternoon/early evening, at least isolated thunderstorm
development is possible along the California/Oregon border. These
storms are expected to be relatively slow moving, with the latest
guidance consensus showing 0.8-1.0 inch precipitable water values,
with some of the storms likely being wet in nature. Nonetheless,
fuels across far south-central Oregon into far northeast California
are quite receptive to fire spread, with lightning induced ignitions
possible where dry strikes may overlap the most receptive fuels. An
isolated dry thunderstorm area was delineated where the best overlap
of dry strikes/receptive fuels is expected.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 02 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure is favored to bring anomalously
warm
temperatures and possible excessive heat over the northeastern contiguous U.S
early in the period. There is increased uncertainty regarding heavy
precipitation potential based on the latest model guidance and reforecast
tools, however any continued rainfall over the south-central U.S. is likely to
aggravate flooding conditions over portions of Texas and Louisiana into
week-2.
Over Alaska, mid-level low pressure forecast over the Bering Sea favors wetter
than normal conditions over parts of the Mainland.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern and Central Plains,
Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys,
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, Thu-Sat, Jun 10-12.

Flooding possible for parts of southern and eastern Texas and the Lower
Mississippi Valley.

FOR THURSDAY JUNE 10 - WEDNESDAY JUNE 16: Heading into mid-June, dynamical
models continue to advertise amplified 500-hPa ridging centered over the
north-central CONUS to promote above-normal temperatures across much of the
country. Over the past few days, there has been good run-to-run continuity
between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means favoring the deamplification of this
mid-level anomalous ridging towards the end of week-1, which is anticipated to
result in a moderation of temperatures and lessen concerns for early season
excessive heat extending into the week-2 period. In comparing today's
multi-model ensembles, the 0z ECMWF is more progressive with this weakening
than the 0z GEFS early in the period, as the latter maintains a more northerly
mean placement of 582-dam heights across the Dakotas and the upper Midwest.
Despite this, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools remain in fair
agreement
depicting a broad area with at least of 20% chance of daytime maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 degrees F from the Northern
plains eastward through the Atlantic coastline early in the period, and a
slight risk for excessive heat remains issued for the region from Jun 10 to
12.
Given the overall reduction of probabilities for maximum temperatures
exceeding
the highest percentiles in today's reforecast tools, particularly over the
Northeast, the moderate risk of excessive heat is removed as much of this heat
potential is likely to occur prior to the start of week-2. This is also
supported by the National Blend of Models analysis, which no longer indicates
stations approaching near record breaking temperatures early in the period.
Towards the end of the week-2, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles are beginning
to show signs of anomalous mid-level ridging restrengthening across the
Northern Plains. However, there is uncertainty in whether this mid-level
ridging will translate into hazardous temperatures across the central CONUS by
mid-June, but this trend will continue to be monitored in subsequent outlooks.



For precipitation, there is a large degree of disagreement between GEFS and
ECMWF ensemble guidance and reforecast tools regarding the prospect of heavy
precipitation across the CONUS during week-2. Much of this disagreement is
attributable to an upstream anomalous trough predicted over the eastern
Pacific, where the ECMWF favors a more westerly placed and weaker mean
solution, and the GEFS favors a more amplified trough that encroaches the West
Coast. As a result, the GEFS favors increased chances for above-normal
rainfall
over the southwestern CONUS, while the ECMWF shows these signals farther east
over the south-central and southeastern CONUS associated with low-level return
flow from the Gulf of Mexico during week-2. Similar to yesterday, there
doesn't
appear to be a clear synoptic forcing mechanism in the ensemble means, which
suggests that any heavy precipitation that occurs across the southern CONUS
will likely be convective in nature. In the absence of large-scale circulation
features to limit predictability and with the aforementioned model
differences,
no heavy rain hazard is issued in today's outlook. However, given the
saturated
conditions being felt the across the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley (many areas along the Gulf coast of Texas have experienced more than
twice their normal rainfall accumulation since early May), and enhanced
precipitation forecast by the Weather Prediction Center (anticipating another
3
to 5 inches of rainfall over the region during week-1), a flooding possible
hazard is issued over southern and eastern Texas and into Louisiana as the
observed minor to moderate river flooding may persist into week-2.



As noted in the hazard discussion yesterday, the tropics are becoming
interesting. Although it is relatively early in the Atlantic Hurricane season,
the large-scale environment continues to remain favorable for tropical
cyclogenesis in the Atlantic with eastward propagating wave features predicted
to traverse the Americas during week-2. Since yesterday, the 0z and 6z GEFS
continue to favor an area of deepening mean low pressure south of Cuba, with
some ensemble members depicting low centers now tracking northward into the
Gulf of Mexico towards the end of week-2. While uncertainty remains too high
at
this lead to preclude any precipitation or wind related hazards being added,
the potential system bears monitoring and will be addressed in upcoming hazard
outlooks this week.



Over Alaska, mid-level troughing favored by the GEFS is anticipated to bring
above-normal precipitation over parts of the Mainland during week-2, however,
precipitation amounts are not expected to exceed hazard thresholds.

...Record Heat possible from parts of the Northern Plains into the
Northeast....

...Multiple Day Heavy Rainfall Event Likely For Parts of the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

A large scale upper trough entering the Northwest U.S. at the
start of the period (Saturday) should finally suppress the strong
Western U.S. ridge that is currently anchored over the region.
Amplification and persistence of this trough near the West Coast
into the first half of next week will promote mean ridging over
most of the East and shift much of the above normal
temperatures/possible record heat into areas across the northern
tier. Between these features, from the weekend into early next
week expect a slow-moving upper low/trough to generate unsettled
weather and potentially heavy rainfall over the Southern Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley regions that are already overly
saturated. The upper system should eventually weaken enough for
rainfall to become lighter and less organized by midweek.
Shortwave energy passing over the East Coast this weekend may form
a modest upper low off the Mid-Atlantic coast but with low
confidence for details.

Compared to continuity, the 00Z-06Z model/ensemble runs provided
similar aspects of large-scale agreement as well as spread later
in the period. This maintained the preference for an operational
model composite this weekend followed by a trend toward more
GEFS/ECMWF ensemble input, reaching 70 percent total by day 7
Wednesday. Developing issues with the West Coast trough originate
from widely differing solutions for aspects of central Pacific
flow early next week, ultimately affecting northeastern Pacific
flow and in particular the track and timing of an upper low that
may drop south/southeast from the western coast of Mainland
Alaska. 00Z ECMWF/06Z GFS runs suggested this upper low could hold
far enough west to weaken the West Coast trough by midweek, but in
contrast very different upstream flow in the 00Z CMC led to an
amplified West Coast trough at that time. New 12Z runs of both the
GFS and CMC have trended toward more moderate ideas per the more
consistent means. A significant change in ECMWF specifics from the
00Z to new 12Z runs further highlights the uncertainty over this
area. Meanwhile the GFS/ECMWF and their means offer a good middle
ground for the Plains upper low/trough. 00Z/12Z UKMET runs are on
the southern side of the envelope and CMC runs are on the eastern
side. There is a reasonable consensus that the feature will
gradually weaken/open up by later in the period. Specifics of
associated potential heavy rainfall will be very sensitive to
exact details of the upper feature as well as mesoscale boundaries
which all have low predictability multiple days out in time. The
possible weak upper low near/offshore the East Coast also has low
predictability given its small scale and being embedded within a
larger-scale ridge.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A multi-day heavy rainfall event is looking more likely across
portions of Texas, Louisiana, and into the ArkLaTex region with a
persistent deep-layer flow of Gulf moisture interacting with a
Southern Plains upper level trough/low and western Gulf Coast
surface front. Models continue to suggest the potential for
several inches or more of rain within a region which has seen well
above normal precipitation over recent weeks. In less extreme
form, some of this rainfall may extend northward over the
east-central U.S. toward the middle of next week as the upper
feature opens up/elongates. Elsewhere, much of the East should
remain fairly dry although diurnally-favored showers may linger
over parts of the Southeast and flow around Bermuda high pressure
may eventually extend some moisture northward through the
Appalachians. Specifics of a possible but low-confidence upper low
near/offshore the East Coast will have to be watched as well.
Expect a gradual increase in moisture over the Pacific Northwest
as mean troughing aloft settles near the West Coast while ejecting
shortwaves/frontal systems should extend some activity into the
northern Rockies and eventually the northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley.

The most extreme temperature anomalies are likely to shift from
the Great Basin through northern Plains/Upper Midwest at the start
of the period Saturday into the Upper Great Lakes and Northeast
Sunday onward. Highs and/or morning lows may reach up to 20-25F
above normal over parts of the northern Plains and vicinity early
in the weekend and northern New England early next week. While the
heat will moderate over the Great Basin with time, areas from the
north-central Rockies through the northern tier should continue to
see areas of plus 10-20F anomalies into midweek. On most days
expect various portions of the northern tier to see temperatures
approach or exceed daily records for highs/warm lows. Meanwhile
Texas and Louisiana are likely to see below normal highs (up to
minus 10-12F anomalies on Saturday) at least from the weekend into
early next week due to persistent clouds and rainfall. West Coast
highs will trend moderately below normal as amplified upper
troughing becomes established over the region.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed June 02 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 08 - 12 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast mean ridging over the
North Pacific in the south of the Aleutians. Downstream, a mean trough is
predicted over the western CONUS, with ridging and positive 500-hPa height
anomalies predicted over the remainder of the CONUS. Southerly low-level
surface flow is predicted into the central and eastern CONUS, around surface
high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean.

A predicted mean trough and negative 500-hPa height anomalies lead to likely
below normal temperatures over the West Coast. Below normal temperatures are
also favored over much of Texas and parts of Louisiana and Florida, as a
trough
and storm systems are predicted to traverse the regions. Probabilities of near
to above normal temperatures are enhanced for the remainder of the CONUS under
above normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal temperatures are favored for
southwestern Mainland Alaska, while near to below normal temperatures are
slightly more likely for the rest of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle,
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted mean ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the central
and eastern CONUS lead to increased probabilities of below normal
precipitation
for much of the West and parts of the central CONUS. Increased probabilities
of
near to above normal precipitation are indicated over parts of the Southern
Plains and the Mississippi Valley, related to potential storm systems
associated with shortwave troughs and anomalous southerly surface flow. Below
normal precipitation is likely over the Atlantic Seaboard and the Northeast,
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool. Below normal 500-hPa
heights lead to increased chances of above normal precipitation over northern
Mainland Alaska, while below normal precipitation is favored over southern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle due to the predicted positive 500-hPa
height anomalies.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 10 - 16 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is generally forecast to
persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, while ensemble spread
and uncertainty increases. Ridging over the North Pacific and the central and
eastern CONUS deamplify, relative to the 6-10 day period, with a slight
retrogression of the predicted center of the maximum positive mid-level height
anomalies over the CONUS.

The temperature pattern forecast over the CONUS for the week-2 period is
similar to the 6-10 day outlook period. Below normal temperatures are favored
over south-central CONUS and along the Gulf Coast, as storm systems are
predicted to traverse the region, associated with a mean trough. Probabilities
of near to above normal temperatures are enhanced for the remainder of the
CONUS due to near to positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Near to above normal
temperatures are favored over most of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians due to
above normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal temperatures are likely over parts
of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool.

Near to below normal precipitation is likely over most of the northern CONUS,
extending to parts of the Southern Plains. Chances of above normal
precipitation are enhanced over parts of the Southern Rockies, Southern Plains
and much of the southeastern CONUS, related to potential storm systems
associated with shortwave troughs and anomalous southerly surface flow. Above
normal precipitation is favored for parts of western Mainland Alaska and parts
of the central Aleutians, while below normal precipitation is indicated over
the Alaska Panhandle, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Record Heat possible from parts of the Northern Plains into the
Northeast....

...Multiple Day Heavy Rainfall Event Likely For Parts of the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

A large scale upper trough entering the Northwest U.S. at the
start of the period (Saturday) should finally suppress the strong
Western U.S. ridge that is currently anchored over the region.
Amplification and persistence of this trough near the West Coast
into the first half of next week will promote mean ridging over
most of the East and shift much of the above normal
temperatures/possible record heat into areas across the northern
tier. Between these features, from the weekend into early next
week expect a slow-moving upper low/trough to generate unsettled
weather and potentially heavy rainfall over the Southern Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley regions that are already overly
saturated. The upper system should eventually weaken enough for
rainfall to become lighter and less organized by midweek.
Shortwave energy passing over the East Coast this weekend may form
a modest upper low off the Mid-Atlantic coast but with low
confidence for details.

Compared to continuity, the 00Z-06Z model/ensemble runs provided
similar aspects of large-scale agreement as well as spread later
in the period. This maintained the preference for an operational
model composite this weekend followed by a trend toward more
GEFS/ECMWF ensemble input, reaching 70 percent total by day 7
Wednesday. Developing issues with the West Coast trough originate
from widely differing solutions for aspects of central Pacific
flow early next week, ultimately affecting northeastern Pacific
flow and in particular the track and timing of an upper low that
may drop south/southeast from the western coast of Mainland
Alaska. 00Z ECMWF/06Z GFS runs suggested this upper low could hold
far enough west to weaken the West Coast trough by midweek, but in
contrast very different upstream flow in the 00Z CMC led to an
amplified West Coast trough at that time. New 12Z runs of both the
GFS and CMC have trended toward more moderate ideas per the more
consistent means. A significant change in ECMWF specifics from the
00Z to new 12Z runs further highlights the uncertainty over this
area. Meanwhile the GFS/ECMWF and their means offer a good middle
ground for the Plains upper low/trough. 00Z/12Z UKMET runs are on
the southern side of the envelope and CMC runs are on the eastern
side. There is a reasonable consensus that the feature will
gradually weaken/open up by later in the period. Specifics of
associated potential heavy rainfall will be very sensitive to
exact details of the upper feature as well as mesoscale boundaries
which all have low predictability multiple days out in time. The
possible weak upper low near/offshore the East Coast also has low
predictability given its small scale and being embedded within a
larger-scale ridge.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A multi-day heavy rainfall event is looking more likely across
portions of Texas, Louisiana, and into the ArkLaTex region with a
persistent deep-layer flow of Gulf moisture interacting with a
Southern Plains upper level trough/low and western Gulf Coast
surface front. Models continue to suggest the potential for
several inches or more of rain within a region which has seen well
above normal precipitation over recent weeks. In less extreme
form, some of this rainfall may extend northward over the
east-central U.S. toward the middle of next week as the upper
feature opens up/elongates. Elsewhere, much of the East should
remain fairly dry although diurnally-favored showers may linger
over parts of the Southeast and flow around Bermuda high pressure
may eventually extend some moisture northward through the
Appalachians. Specifics of a possible but low-confidence upper low
near/offshore the East Coast will have to be watched as well.
Expect a gradual increase in moisture over the Pacific Northwest
as mean troughing aloft settles near the West Coast while ejecting
shortwaves/frontal systems should extend some activity into the
northern Rockies and eventually the northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley.

The most extreme temperature anomalies are likely to shift from
the Great Basin through northern Plains/Upper Midwest at the start
of the period Saturday into the Upper Great Lakes and Northeast
Sunday onward. Highs and/or morning lows may reach up to 20-25F
above normal over parts of the northern Plains and vicinity early
in the weekend and northern New England early next week. While the
heat will moderate over the Great Basin with time, areas from the
north-central Rockies through the northern tier should continue to
see areas of plus 10-20F anomalies into midweek. On most days
expect various portions of the northern tier to see temperatures
approach or exceed daily records for highs/warm lows. Meanwhile
Texas and Louisiana are likely to see below normal highs (up to
minus 10-12F anomalies on Saturday) at least from the weekend into
early next week due to persistent clouds and rainfall. West Coast
highs will trend moderately below normal as amplified upper
troughing becomes established over the region.

0240 PM CDT Wed Jun 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Northern Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest...
As lift from the approaching trough begins to overspread a
moistening low-level airmass, scattered thunderstorms should develop
through the afternoon hours from central California and northern
Nevada into portions of southeastern Oregon and western Idaho. Model
soundings show moderate buoyancy (500-1000 J/kg of MUCAPE) along
with the potential for organized strong/severe thunderstorm clusters
atop low-level inverted v profiles. Despite a mixed wet/dry storm
mode and borderline fuels, storm coverage, and the resulting
potential for lightning, will likely be great enough to meet dry
thunderstorm requirements. Isolated dry thunder probabilities have
been added to account for the potential of lightning starts.

Additional thunderstorms across the Southwest and southern Rockies
may pose a risk for a few lightning starts. However, lesser storm
coverage and even higher PWAT values (150-200% of normal) suggest
more limited potential for dry storms.

..Lyons.. 06/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0207 AM CDT Wed Jun 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will continue to meander eastward across the
eastern CONUS as an upper ridge expands across the central CONUS,
and another mid-level trough impinges on the Pacific Northwest
tomorrow. Very warm surface temperatures are expected across
portions of central California, with wildfire-spread potential
expected to be slightly more localized compared to previous days.
Very localized wildfire spread is also possible to the lee of the
Cascades and Sierra in advance of the approaching trough, given
thunderstorm potential. Otherwise, brief bouts of dry, breezy flow
may occur across terrain-favoring areas of the Lower Colorado River
Basin, with minimal concerns for major wildfire spread east of the
Rockies given accumulating rains, weak surface winds, or moist
low-level conditions.

...Portions of the Pacific Northwest into northwest Nevada...
With the approach of the upper trough, deep-layer ascent and
buoyancy will become adequate enough to support isolated to
scattered thunderstorm development across eastern portions of the
Pacific Northwest into the northwestern Great Basin tomorrow
afternoon and evening. While the storms are expected to be
relatively high-based, precipitable water values above 0.75 inches
and slow storm speeds will result in wetting rains. Fuels across the
Pacific Northwest into northern parts of the Great Basin are drier
than average, but do not appear critically receptive to fire spread.
While a couple fire starts are possible where a dry strike may occur
within a locally drier fuel bed, the lack of more widespread
receptive fuels precludes an isolated dry thunderstorm area at this
time.

...Portions of Central California...
As the upper trough slowly shifts eastward towards the Interior
West, the more extreme (100+ F) surface temperatures are expected to
be confined mainly to portions of the lower San Joaquin Valley late
tomorrow afternoon. As such, downslope flow along the lee of the
Coast Ranges is also expected to remain a bit more localized
compared to previous days, with Elevated highlights being withheld
this outlook.

...Record-breaking heat found across the western United States to
spread into the Northern Plains by Thursday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over
west-central Texas through Thursday morning; there is a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday
into Friday morning...

Strong upper-level ridging over the western U.S. will produce
record-breaking heat from the Southwest to the Pacific Northwest.
High temperatures will reach the upper-90s and triple digits
across a broad spanning region from the Desert Southwest to the
Northern High Plains. The largest temperature anomalies across the
interior sections of the Pacific Northwest, where high
temperatures will be near 30 degrees above the average high for
this time of year. Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories
stretch from Southern California to Northern Washington and Idaho.
Extreme heat in these locations will significantly increase the
potential for heat-related illnesses.

Additionally, much of the Southwest and West are experiencing
severe to exceptional drought conditions, contributing to the
current heatwave. A weak cold front is expected to reach the
Pacific Northwest by Thursday evening and offer some relief, along
with a few isolated showers and thunderstorms. As the upper-level
ridge slowly slides eastward, well above average temperatures will
spread into the Northern Plains by Friday.  Upper-level energy
over the Southern High Plains will produce showers and
thunderstorms may interrupt outdoor activities both Wednesday and
Thursday. The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
over west-central Texas through Thursday morning. The main hazards
associated with the severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning,
severe thunderstorm wind gust, and hail.  The severe thunderstorm
threat shifts to the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday into Friday morning
as a weak area of low pressure over the Lower Mississippi Valley
swings northeast into the Lower Great Lakes by Thursday.

Meanwhile, an associated warm front to its east will lift
northward and usher in warm and humid air to nearly the East
Coast. Thunderstorms will also form along a slow-moving cold front
trailing the system from the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to
southern Texas.

...Record Heat possible from parts of the Great Lakes into the
Northeast....

...Multiple Day Heavy Rainfall Event Likely For Parts of the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The medium range will feature amplification and persistence of a
mean trough over the West Coast throughout the period which will
promote mean ridging over most of the East. This will shift much
above normal temperatures this weekend over the Great
Basin/Northern Plains, into parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast
next week. In between, expect a slow-moving upper low/trough to
generate unsettled weather and potentially heavy rainfall over
parts of the already over saturated Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley. Shortwave energy passing over the East Coast
this weekend may also form a modest upper low embedded within the
mean ridge off the Mid-Atlantic coast but with low confidence for
details.

The latest operational model runs show reasonable agreement to
warrant a purely operational model blend for the WPC progs for
days 3 and 4. After this time, developing issues with the West
Coast trough originate from differences in the details of energy
dropping into the mean trough and in particular the track and
timing of an upper low that may drop south/southeast from Alaska.
By late in the period, this affects both placement and strength of
the trough over the West Coast. Especially out towards days 6 and
7, run to run continuity in much of the guidance is poor so
uncertainty in the details is high. Therefore, a blend towards the
better agreeable ensemble means is preferred beyond day 5. For the
Plains upper low/trough, the GFS/ECMWF and their means offer a
good middle ground for the solution. UKMET runs continue to be on
the southern side of the envelope and CMC runs are on the eastern
side. There is a reasonable consensus that the feature will
gradually weaken/open up by later in the period however, specifics
of associated potential heavy rainfall will be very sensitive to
exact details of the upper feature as well as mesoscale boundaries
which all have low predictability multiple days out in time.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A multi-day heavy rainfall event is likely across portions of
Texas, Louisiana, and into the ArkLaTex region with a persistent
deep-layer flow of Gulf moisture interacting with the Southern
Plains upper level trough/low and a western Gulf Coast surface
front. Models continue to suggest the potential for several inches
or more of rain within a region which has seen well above normal
precipitation over recent weeks, leading to flooding concerns. As
the trough opens up and elongates, rainfall should become lighter
with time with moisture also extending northward over the
east-central U.S. toward the middle of next week. Elsewhere, the
Northeast should remain fairly dry with diurnally-favored showers
lingering over parts of the Southeast and flow around Bermuda high
pressure may eventually extend some moisture northward through the
Appalachians. Out West, increasing moisture over the Pacific
Northwest is expected this weekend, with ejecting
shortwaves/frontal systems extending some activity into the
northern Rockies and eventually the northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley.

The most extreme temperature anomalies are likely from parts of
the Great Basin/northern Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and
Northeast. Highs and/or morning lows may reach up to 20-25F above
normal over parts of the northern Plains and vicinity early in the
weekend and northern New England early next week. Especially
across parts of the Northeast next week, these values could come
close to or exceed daily records for highs and warm lows.
Meanwhile Texas and Louisiana are likely to see slightly below
normal highs into early next week due to persistent clouds and
rainfall. West Coast highs will trend moderately below normal as
amplified upper troughing becomes established over the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 AM CDT Thu Jun 03 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughs will be traversing the West and East Coasts while
a mid-level ridge propagates across the Interior West into the
Plains states today. Deep-layer ascent and adequate low-level
moisture/buoyancy ahead of the Pacific Northwest mid-level trough
will foster thunderstorm potential, with some wildfire spread threat
apparent. Locally dry and breezy surface conditions may promote
brief Elevated conditions across terrain-favoring areas of the lower
Colorado River Valley, westward to central California. Otherwise,
low-level moist conditions or weak surface winds are expected across
much of the CONUS east of the Rockies, precluding significant
wildfire concerns.

...Parts of the Pacific Northwest/northwestern Great Basin...
At least isolated thunderstorm development is expected across the
higher terrain of the Sierra, northward to the lee of the southern
Cascades by mid afternoon. Though storm motions are expected to be
slow, 0.50-0.75 inch precipitable water values and the presence of a
surface-500 mb sub-cloud layer suggests that several of the storms
may produce dry strikes with some ignition efficiency, especially
given unseasonably dry fuels. A couple of strong, erratic wind gusts
may also accompany the outflow of the stronger storms. Please see
the Day 1 Convective Outlook for more details on severe potential.
Preceding storm development, locally dry and breezy westerly flow
may also be observed to the lee of the Cascades and Sierra. An
Elevated area may need to be added in the Day 1 outlook update
pending stronger winds in future guidance or observations.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 AM CDT Thu Jun 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will gradually build across much of the central U.S.
as a mid-level trough traverses the northwest CONUS tomorrow.
Surface lee troughing across the northern CONUS associated with the
passing upper-level impulse will support dry and breezy conditions
ahead of a cold front across portions of North Dakota, while
downslope flow along the lee of the Cascades will also promote
wildfire-spread potential. Deep-layer ascent ahead of the upper
trough will foster thunderstorm development atop a dry boundary
layer from the northern Rockies into the central Great Basin, with
some dry strikes likely.

...Pacific Northwest...
15-25 mph sustained westerly surface flow amidst 15-20% RH is likely
during the afternoon hours tomorrow to the lee of the Cascades due
to both downslope flow and boundary-layer mixing. Elevated
highlights have been introduced given the presence of unseasonably
dry, receptive fuels. Some of the latest guidance also depicts
locally Critical conditions across portions of the Columbia and
Harney Basin areas. Critical highlights may be needed in future
outlooks if 20+ mph sustained westerly winds appear more widespread
and longer lasting than currently expected.

...Northern North Dakota...
Ahead of a southward-sagging cold front, southwesterly flow ahead of
the surface lee trough is expected to sustain at/above 15 mph for at
least a few hours prior to frontal passage. Guidance consensus has
been trending drier across portions of northern North Dakota, with
RH dropping to 20-25% by afternoon peak heating, warranting the
introduction of Elevated highlights.

...Northern Rockies into the Great Basin...
Deep-layer lift ahead of the upper trough will promote isolated to
widely scattered thunderstorm development during the afternoon to
early evening hours. Storms are expected to be slow moving, but will
be developing atop a deep, dry boundary layer amidst 0.5-0.8 inch
precipitable water values, with dry strikes likely in spots. As
such, highlights for isolated dry thunderstorms were added across
parts of the northern Rockies and parts of the Great Basin, where
dry strikes are most likely and where fuels are most receptive to
fire spread.

...Record-breaking heat found across the western United States and
Northern Plains...

...Severe weather and scattered flash flooding possible across the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic today...

...Additional chances for thunderstorms and heavy rain to linger
across southern Texas and Louisiana through the weekend...

A few more days of potentially record-breaking heat is in store
for the West Coast and Intermountain West before the bulk of the
well above normal temperatures shift into the northern tier
states. A strong upper-level ridge responsible for the blistering
early-season heat is currently located over the Great Basin and
Northern Rockies. This ridge will slowly weaken on Friday and
early this weekend, while shifting into the Northern Plains. Thus,
well above average temperatures are forecast to spread into the
Northern High Plains today and the rest of the Northern Plains and
Upper Midwest on Friday. Widespread high temperatures in the
upper-90s and low triple digits will be found across a large area
to end the week, stretching from the Southwest, throughout much of
the Intermountain West/Northern Rockies, and into the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest. Temperatures this hot can significantly
increase the potential for heat-related illnesses. Scattered
Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories have been issued for
California and the Southwest, as well as the northern/central
Great Basin. Much of this region happens to also be in the middle
of extreme or exceptional drought conditions, which will be
exacerbated by the ongoing heat. A cold front entering the Pacific
Northwest today will offer much cooler temperatures by this
weekend for sections of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. This
frontal boundary may also lead to scattered thunderstorms
throughout the Northern Great Basin today and northern High Plains
on Friday.

For the eastern and south-central United States, a warm and humid
airmass in place will lead to scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the Northeast to the western Gulf Coast. High pressure
located in the western Atlantic will continue to funnel southerly
winds and ample moisture up the eastern third of the country, with
a weak cold front located across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to
help spark thunderstorm activity. A few severe thunderstorms are
possible today across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with
damaging wind gusts and isolated tornadoes possible. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a slight risk for severe weather
(level 2/5) that extends from southern New York to central
Virginia. Along with the severe thunderstorm threat, a few storms
may produce heavy rain for an extended period of time, which could
lead to instances of flash flooding. WPC has highlighted two areas
with the highest probabilities for flash flooding. A Slight Risk
of Excessive Rainfall (level 2/4) has been issued for sections of
Upstate New York and southern Vermont, as well as southeast
Virginia and the eastern Carolinas.

Further south, linger precipitation will also be found across
portions of Louisiana and southern Texas. This section of the
country has experienced a plethora of rainfall over the last
month, which has made ground conditions susceptible for flash
flooding. Due to this concern and the potential for an additional
1 to 3 inches of rain today across South Texas, WPC has issued
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for the region. Rain chances
will continue into the early part of the weekend as well, thanks
to a slow-moving upper level low located over the Lone Star State,
but shower activity is expected to be more isolated in nature to
end the workweek.

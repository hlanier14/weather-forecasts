Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1051 AM CST Sat Mar 06 2021

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

Much of the previous forecast remains on track. Current visible
satellite imagery depicts clear skies across much of the central and
northern High Plains. Continued diurnal heating through the
afternoon should foster enough boundary-layer mixing for surface RH
to drop into the 20-25% range, as also suggested by the latest model
guidance consensus. Latest guidance also suggests that RH will drop
to 15% along the Colorado Front Range into the Nebraska Panhandle.
However, sustained southerly winds across the High Plains is
expected to remain within the 15-20 mph range, and given the
sparsity of the 15-20% RH, Critical highlights have been withheld,
though locally Critical conditions may still occur across portions
of the central High Plains.

Across the eastern U.S., late morning boundary-layer mixing has
already resulted in surface RH dropping at/below 30% across much of
Virginia into North Carolina. RH may drop even further by afternoon
peak heating, however, guidance consensus currently suggests that
surface winds will likely remain at/below 10-15 mph on a widespread
basis, precluding an Elevated delineation. However, given lack of
recent rainfall and near single-digit 10/100 hr fuel moisture
values, localized wildfire potential exists, especially across
southern Virginia into northern North Carolina.

..Squitieri.. 03/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0100 AM CST Sat Mar 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave trough, noted in morning water-vapor
imagery moving onshore across northern California, will continue to
progress to the northeast into the northern Rockies by this
afternoon. In response, a deepening lee trough will strengthen
pressure-gradient winds and support elevated fire weather conditions
across the Plains as well as the Great Basin. Elsewhere across the
CONUS, rain chances across the Southeast and weak winds over
southwestern TX will limit additional fire weather concerns.

...High Plains...
The overall forecast remains on track and confidence in widespread
elevated fire weather conditions from eastern CO northward into
western SD is high based on recent observations. Regional 00 UTC
soundings and recent surface observations reveal a dry boundary
layer already in place, which will help relative humidity values
fall into the 15-20% range later today. Sustained winds near 20 mph
are expected, and steepening low-level lapse rates will help
downward mixing of 30-35 mph gusts by late afternoon.

Recent hi-res ensemble guidance continues to show high probabilities
in elevated conditions, and suggests that sustained winds near 20
mph and RH values between 20-25% may extend as far north as western
ND/eastern MT (though slightly higher boundary-layer moisture is
noted in the 00 UTC BIS sounding). Transient critical conditions are
possible across northeast CO and western NE where the potential for
RH near 15% and frequent gusts to 30 mph is highest. Confidence in
sustained, widespread critical conditions is currently not high
enough to warrant a delineation, though trends will continue to be
monitored.

...Great Basin...
Lee troughing to across MT/WY with gradual surface pressure rises
across CA will help strengthen the pressure gradient across the
Great Basin this afternoon. Winds increasing to 15-20 mph are likely
and may coincide with areas of 15-20% RH - especially across
southeast UT where the overlap of favorable wind/RH is highest per
recent guidance. However, ERC values across this region remain below
critical thresholds, suggesting a muted fire weather concern.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
154 PM EST Sat Mar 06 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Mar 09 2021 - 12Z Sat Mar 13 2021

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to offer a strong signal that an amplified
eastern Pacific mean trough aloft will settle over the West next
week in a pattern with above normal forecast predictability into
the middle of next week.  This trough will support rain and higher
elevation snow along with the advent of below normal temperatures.
Meanwhile, a main shortwave forecast to eject from the trough
Tuesday-Wednesday will support a Plains low pressure system to
spread a broad area of precipitation across the
central/east-central U.S..  There has been a general model
tendency to eject this initial low pressure wave from the northern
Plains to central Canada into the northern stream, while another
low pressure center develops over the central High Plains in
connection with the southern stream wave ejection.

Ahead of this evolution, eastern U.S. heights will tend to rise
for much of the coming week as ridging moves in from the central
U.S. and an upper high builds up from the Gulf.  This will bring
much above normal temperatures from the north-central U.S. to the
East.  Toward the end of next week, models generally agree that a
cold front will progressively move through the Northeast, whereas
the trailing portion of the front should become nearly stationary
from the central/southern Plains to the Mid-Mississippi Valley,
where there is a decent model signal for an axis of heavy rain to
develop.  Low pressure waves that form and track along the front
would be instrumental in producing the heavy rain axis.  However,
the timing of these waves will be difficult to resolve until we
get closer in time toward the event.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was derived from a
composite of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS with
smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  Beginning on Day
6, more of the 06Z GEFS together with the 00Z EC mean were used to
account for the increasing forecast uncertainty due to recent run
to run model continuity issues at longer time frames.  WPC
continuity is well maintained with this forecast strategy.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect rain/higher elevation snow as an upper trough/low settles
into the West/Southwest in separated southern stream flow. Heavier
precipitation will focus over favored terrain in California, with
highest amounts most likely for the Sierra Nevada and coastal
ranges.  Some meaningful precipitation will also spread across the
Interior West and the Rockies with upper trough, ejecting impulses
and frontal system progressions.  Energies ejecting into the
Plains will support frontal low pressure systems with
precipitation focusing into the south-central Plains,
Mid-Mississippi Valley, and Midwest/Great Lakes/Ohio Valley with

country mid-late next week.  Morning lows should remain as warm as
15-25F above normal and approach some record values while high
temperature anomalies should be less anomalous.  Meanwhile, the
West will experience a decent cooling trend spreading across the
region from west to east during the period with highs tending to
drop to 5-10F or so below normal.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to offer a strong signal that an amplified
eastern Pacific mean trough aloft will settle over the West next
week in a pattern with above normal forecast predictability into
the middle of next week.  This trough will support rain and higher
elevation snow along with the advent of below normal temperatures.
Meanwhile, a main shortwave forecast to eject from the trough
Tuesday-Wednesday will support a Plains low pressure system to
spread a broad area of precipitation across the
central/east-central U.S..  There has been a general model
tendency to eject this initial low pressure wave from the northern
Plains to central Canada into the northern stream, while another
low pressure center develops over the central High Plains in
connection with the southern stream wave ejection.

Ahead of this evolution, eastern U.S. heights will tend to rise
for much of the coming week as ridging moves in from the central
U.S. and an upper high builds up from the Gulf.  This will bring
much above normal temperatures from the north-central U.S. to the
East.  Toward the end of next week, models generally agree that a
cold front will progressively move through the Northeast, whereas
the trailing portion of the front should become nearly stationary
from the central/southern Plains to the Mid-Mississippi Valley,
where there is a decent model signal for an axis of heavy rain to
develop.  Low pressure waves that form and track along the front
would be instrumental in producing the heavy rain axis.  However,
the timing of these waves will be difficult to resolve until we
get closer in time toward the event.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was derived from a
composite of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS with
smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  Beginning on Day
6, more of the 06Z GEFS together with the 00Z EC mean were used to
account for the increasing forecast uncertainty due to recent run
to run model continuity issues at longer time frames.  WPC
continuity is well maintained with this forecast strategy.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect rain/higher elevation snow as an upper trough/low settles
into the West/Southwest in separated southern stream flow. Heavier
precipitation will focus over favored terrain in California, with
highest amounts most likely for the Sierra Nevada and coastal
ranges.  Some meaningful precipitation will also spread across the
Interior West and the Rockies with upper trough, ejecting impulses
and frontal system progressions.  Energies ejecting into the
Plains will support frontal low pressure systems with
precipitation focusing into the south-central Plains,
Mid-Mississippi Valley, and Midwest/Great Lakes/Ohio Valley with
the return of Gulf moisture.  Some wintry weather may be possible
over extreme northern locations. Activity will focus near a wavy
cold front that may tend to stall as upper troughing settles over
the West, possibly leading to some training.

Much above normal temperatures will persist over the northern
Plains/Midwest and then expand into the Great Lakes through the
first part of next week with readings generally 10 to more than
25F above normal.  Daily records should be more numerous for warm

0112 PM CST Sat Mar 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. The latest guidance
continues to show considerable spread for minimum surface RH by
afternoon peak heating across portions of eastern Kansas into
northwestern Missouri and far southwestern Iowa. Given the spread in
surface RH forecasts, an Elevated delineation will continue to be
withheld, with a localized wildfire-spread threat still expected.
Across the southeast towards the Carolina Piedmont, guidance
consensus suggests surface RH may drop to 25-35% by afternoon. While
finer fuels are expected to be at least marginally supportive of
some wildfire-spread potential, surface wind speeds are not expected
to exceed 15 mph on a widespread basis, precluding any fire weather
highlights at this time.

..Squitieri.. 03/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CST Sat Mar 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
Localized fire weather concerns are possible for Sunday afternoon as
winds increase across portions of the southern Plains and Great
Basin. Elsewhere, a building surface high over the eastern third of
the CONUS will yield generally weak winds and low fire weather
potential.

...Eastern Kansas into northern Missouri...
Saturday's lee trough/surface low over the northern Rockies is
forecast to continue translating to the east/northeast into central
Canada in tandem with a de-amplifying upper-level wave. A trailing,
weak surface trough should linger across the Plains on Sunday
afternoon. To the east, surface high pressure will build in the wake
of a departing upper-level wave off the East Coast. The
juxtaposition of these two features should favor strengthening
boundary-layer winds across OK, eastern KS, and western MO. Minimal
moisture return into the region combined with slightly above-normal
temperatures could yield RH reductions in the 20-35% range, though
confidence is low due to high model spread. However, recent reports
from eastern KS suggest that fine fuels are receptive and can
support fire spread. As such, the fire weather threat will be
conditional on the degree of RH reduction across eastern KS/western
MO. Trends will continue to be monitored and a risk area may be
introduced if confidence in the RH forecast improves.

...Great Basin...
A broad upper-level trough will begin approaching the West Coast
through the day Sunday. This feature will bring precipitation
chances to the Northwest as well as modest surface pressure falls
across the Great Basin. Surface winds will likely increase to 15-20
mph in response and support areas of elevated fire weather
conditions where conditions are dry. Northwestern AZ into central NV
and southwest UT should see the highest potential for elevated
conditions, but fuel status remains questionable across this region.

...A tranquil stretch of weather to transpire across most of the
Lower 48 into the start of the upcoming week...

...Showers and thunderstorms tracking across Florida this
afternoon, favorable fire weather conditions to conclude this
evening...

...Unsettled weather in the Northwest; spring-like in the
Heartland, cooler along the East & West Coasts...

Much of the CONUS welcomes a quiet weather pattern this weekend
and into the start of the upcoming week. However, there are a
couple of exceptions. This afternoon, showers and thunderstorms
are tracking along a frontal boundary draped across central
Florida. Some locally heavy rainfall is possible but drier
conditions will return as high pressure builds in from the north
overnight. This area of high pressure also keeps below normal
temperatures in place throughout the Sunshine State on Sunday. In
the Plains, Red Flag Warnings are in effect through this evening
due to gusty winds and low humidity levels. There could be another
chance for locally favorable fire weather conditions in the
southern and central Plains on Sunday.

The region forecast to see the most unsettled weather over the
next couple days in the Northwest. A quick moving upper level
trough will be responsible for light snowfall accumulations in the
northern Rockies tonight. Meanwhile, increasing shower activity is
anticipated across the Pacific Northwest as a Pacific front
approaches from the west. Look for valley/coastal rain and
mountain snow to persist into the day on Sunday for both western
Oregon and Washington. After a brief break in the action Sunday
night into early Monday, another Pacific storm system looks to
produce another swath of valley rain and mountain snow in the
Pacific Northwest and as far south as Northern California Monday
afternoon. Elsewhere, spring-like temperatures have taken hold of
the Northern Plains today with a larger portion of the Midwest and
Plains forecast to reach seasonably warm levels on Sunday. By
Monday, spring-like temperatures will have sprung across the Great
Lakes and into the Mid-South. The West Coast looks to remain on
the cooler side of normal into the start of the week, while that
spring-like temperature regime eventually reaches the East Coast
by Tuesday.

these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1228 AM CST Sun Mar 07 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad upper-level ridging as well as a building surface high over
the central/eastern CONUS will favor mostly clear skies and limited
rain chances today. This will help support fire weather concerns for
portions of the southern and central Plains where grasses have been
drying and dry, windy conditions are expected. Conditional fire
weather threats are also noted across the Great Basin and portions
of the Carolinas where dry conditions are likely.

...Eastern Kansas and adjacent areas of Oklahoma/Missouri...
Elevated, to locally critical, fire weather conditions appear likely
this afternoon from northeast OK, across eastern KS, and into
northwest MO. Early morning observations show a surface trough
meandering eastward as a weakening surface low moves into Canada.
This trough should be draped meridionally across the Plains by
mid/late afternoon. To the east, a building surface high will help
strengthen the pressure gradient over the southern and central
Plains.

Sustained south/southwesterly winds upwards of 15-25 mph appear
likely by mid afternoon. Mostly clear skies will aid in diurnal
heating and boundary layer mixing, which should support wind gusts
up to 30-35 mph. Dewpoint trends across eastern KS have been slowly
declining over the past 12 hours as drier air across OK and northern
TX is advected northward within a meager southerly flow regime.
However, dry air advection will likely accelerate later today as
winds increase. This factor, coupled with favorable daytime heating,
should allow relative humidity values to fall into the 20-30% range.
Reports from the region suggest that fine grassy fuels are receptive
and should support wildfire spread. Localized critical conditions
appear possible across eastern KS, and a critical delineation may be
considered if confidence increases that RH values will fall below
20% over a broad region.

...Great Basin...
Modest surface pressure falls are forecast across the Great Basin
today as an upper-level trough, noted in early-morning water-vapor
imagery approaching the Northwest Coast, gradually moves onshore.
Low-level winds will likely increase to 15-20 mph across the region,
but limited upper-level support should preclude widespread windy
conditions.  Relative humidity in the teens and low 20s has been
common over the past few days, but fuels largely remain
non-critical. One exception to this is portions of central to
western AZ where localized elevated fire weather conditions are
possible this afternoon as RH falls into the teens once again.
However, the threat is expected to remain largely localized.

...Carolinas...
Dry conditions have been noted across the western Carolinas and
west/southwest VA where recent fuel analyses suggest 10-hour fuel
moisture values are in the 5-10% range and little precipitation has
fallen in recent days. A northwesterly, post-frontal flow regime
will remain in place for today, and upstream dewpoints in the single
digits and low teens suggest another day of dry conditions is
likely. This is supported by latest guidance, which shows reasonable
probabilities for RH less than 30%. However, wind speeds will
generally remain too weak for highlights. Nonetheless,
topographically enhanced flow east of the Carolina Piedmont may
support pockets of elevated fire weather conditions this afternoon.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to show a strong signal that an
amplified southern stream upper trough/low will settle over the
West/Southwest this week in a pattern with above normal forecast
predictability. This trough will support rain and higher elevation
snow along with the advent of below normal temperatures. Lead
energies forecast to eject from the trough will support a quite
wavy and slow moving central to eastern U.S. front whose Gulf
moisture and instability pooling will fuel a focus for locally
enhanced rainfall and training convection.

Ahead of this evolution, eastern U.S. heights will tend to rise
for much of the coming workweek as ridging moves in from the
central U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico.  This will bring much above
normal temperatures from the north-central U.S. to the East.
Toward the end of the week and next weekend, models generally
agree that a cold front will progressively move through the
Midwest and down through the East in response to amplified
northern stream upper trough passage whereas the trailing front
will become nearly stationary from the central/southern Plains to
the Mid-Mississippi and into the Ohio Valley, where there is ample
model signal for an axis of heavy rain to develop. Low pressure
waves that form and track along the front would be instrumental in
producing periodic heavy rains. However, the timing of the waves
will be difficult to resolve until we get closer to the event.

The WPC medium range product suite for days 3-5 (Wed-Fri) was
derived from a composite of the 18 UTC GEFS mean, 12 UTC ECMWF
ensemble mean and best clustered 12 UTC ECMWF along with the 01
UTC National Blend of Models. Opted to focus primarily on guidance
from the ECMWF ensemble mean next weekend. WPC continuity is well
maintained with this forecast strategy. In contrast, 18 UTC GFS
system timings are increasingly less well clustered with the WPC
preferred blend, but the experimental GFS was more in line. The
GEFS mean also increasingly became an outlier solution with a
faster ejection of the main Southwest U.S. upper trough.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect rain/higher elevation snow as an upper trough/low settles
into the West/Southwest in separated southern stream flow. Heavier
precipitation will focus over favored terrain in California, with
highest amounts lingering into this period for the Sierra Nevada
and coastal ranges. Some meaningful precipitation will also spread
across the Interior West and Rockies with the upper trough/low,
ejecting impulses and frontal system progressions. Energies
ejecting into the Plains will support frontal low pressure systems
with precipitation focusing into the south-central Plains,
Mid-Mississippi Valley, and Midwest/Great Lakes/Ohio Valley with
the return and pooling of Gulf moisture and instability. Some
wintry weather may be possible over northern locations. Activity
will focus near a wavy trailing cold front that will tend to stall
as upper troughing settles over the West, possibly leading to cell
training. There is increased forecast spread with respect to the
eventual ejection and increasingly neutral tilt of the main
Southwest upper trough next weekend, but height falls and
instability may invigorate precipitation potential for the
south-central Rockies/Plains with deformation and terrain/upslope
flow. This includes a wintry threat focus from the Rockies to the
High Plains as lead cold air filters southward through the central
and eastern U.S.

Mid-Mississippi Valley, and Midwest/Great Lakes/Ohio Valley with
the return and pooling of Gulf moisture and instability. Some
wintry weather may be possible over northern locations. Activity
will focus near a wavy trailing cold front that will tend to stall
as upper troughing settles over the West, possibly leading to cell
training. There is increased forecast spread with respect to the
eventual ejection and increasingly neutral tilt of the main
Southwest upper trough next weekend, but height falls and
instability may invigorate precipitation potential for the
south-central Rockies/Plains with deformation and terrain/upslope
flow. This includes a wintry threat focus from the Rockies to the
High Plains as lead cold air filters southward through the central
and eastern U.S.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0129 AM CST Sun Mar 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave trough, currently off the West Coast, is
forecast to translate into the Great Basin and central Rockies
through the day Sunday. Surface pressure falls across the
inter-mountain West and High Plains are expected, and will help
drive increasing winds across the region. Elevated fire weather
conditions are likely where dry and windy conditions can overlap
with favorably receptive fuels. To the east, surface high pressure
will limit wind speeds and minimize the fire weather potential
(despite favorably dry fuels for some locations).

...Northeast New Mexico and southeast Colorado...
Lee troughing along the High Plains will allow for strengthening
west/southwesterly flow off the higher terrain to the west. As a
result, downslope warming/drying should yield relative humidity
values in the low 20s (and perhaps teens) coincident with 15-20 mph
winds. This appears most likely across northeast NM into southeast
CO and adjacent areas of KS and the OK/TX Panhandles. While the
northern extent of elevated conditions is somewhat uncertain due to
spread in guidance, fuels across this region are fairly dry after
several days of warm, dry, and windy conditions.

...Southwest...
Pressure-gradient winds will likely increase to 20-25 mph across a
broad swath of the southern Great Basin and AZ/NM. While the
strongest winds and driest conditions are currently expected over
northern AZ under a belt of stronger mid-level flow, fuels in this
region are below critical thresholds per recent fuel guidance.
Further to the southeast, ERC values have been climbing to above
seasonal averages for southeast AZ/southwest NM. Although this
region is on the periphery of the stronger flow, sustained winds in
the 15-20 mph range remain likely and should be coincident with RH
values near 15%. As such, elevated fire weather conditions are
expected.

...Western Carolinas...
Dry conditions will persist across the Carolinas where fine fuels
have continued to cure after several days of warm/dry weather.
Relative humidity values will likely fall to near 20% as
temperatures warm under mostly clear skies. However, surface high
pressure over the region will limit wind speeds and mitigate most
fire weather concerns.

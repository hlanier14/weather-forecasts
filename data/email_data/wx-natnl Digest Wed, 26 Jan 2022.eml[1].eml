0921 AM CST Tue Jan 25 2022

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Morning observations, guidance, and
fuel analyses continue to suggest low fire weather potential for
most of the CONUS today. Elevated conditions remain likely across
the lower CO River Valley, but fuels remain too limited for a more
substantial fire weather concern. See the discussion below for
additional details.

..Moore.. 01/25/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1224 AM CST Tue Jan 25 2022/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will round the base of the larger-scale trough
across the upper Midwest and Northeast today. This will push colder
air into the Plains and force the cold front to near the Gulf Coast.
Farther west, another shortwave trough will move through the Great
Basin and into the Southwest. High pressure will similarly build at
the surface in its wake across the Great Basin. Cold temperatures
and areas of precipitation will generally keep fire weather concerns
minimal. Dry and windy northerly/northeasterly winds will return to
southern California and the lower Colorado River Basin. Winds of
15-20 mph and RH reductions to 15-20% are possible in some
locations. Fuels are not particularly supportive of fire spread,
however.

...Coastal winter storm threat from the Mid-Atlantic to especially
New England Friday into the weekend...


...Overview...

At the beginning of the medium range period late this week, deep
troughing will traverse the eastern half of the U.S. and spin up a
significant and rapidly deepening surface low in the western
Atlantic. This strong coastal storm may cause heavy snow in the
coastal Mid-Atlantic region with more certainty for heavy snow
over the Northeast, where high winds and coastal flooding are also
likely through the weekend. Meanwhile, initial ridging in the West
will be somewhat disrupted by Pacific energy tracking eastward
over the weekend, before a more potent trough digs into the West
early in the workweek and finally flips the overall upper pattern
somewhat with decreasing heights over the West and rising heights
over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent guidance is still on track with a significant low pressure
system in the western Atlantic late this week, though with some
bouncing around in the exact placement of the low and its track.
Sources of this uncertainty include several upstream shortwaves (a
couple moving through the Great Lakes region and one diving
approximately through the Rockies Wednesday night-Thursday night)
that affect the development of the upper-level trough. These
fine-scale features will still take a while to be resolved
satisfactorily. In general, 00Z/06Z guidance showed a slightly
eastern track compared to the previous runs, but with the
exception of the deterministic ECMWF and to a lesser extent the EC
mean on the western side. Cluster analysis and plots of individual
ensemble lows showed that the EC suite of guidance was pretty
consistently farther west as the low develops than the
deterministic GFS runs and GEFS and CMC ensemble members, given an
EC wider trough bumping up to a bit more of an upstream ridge in
the Atlantic so a low wraps in. However, then the 12Z GFS, GEFS
mean, and CMC came in with a slight westward shift in the low
track, though not quite as far west as the 00Z and new 12Z ECMWF.
So, the strategy of taking a middle ground position with the low
between the western/eastern extremes seems to have worked well,
and this was similar to the previous forecast position of the low.
This forecast track also shows more snow as the dominant
precipitation type rather than sleet/freezing rain.

Models agree regarding ridging in the West initially on Friday,
with a compact possibly closed low in the eastern Pacific. This
relatively small feature could still lead to predictability issues
for a while as it tracks eastward into the Southwest this weekend
and with less certainty beyond then. The GFS runs and ECMWF start
out in good agreement while the 00Z CMC did not cluster well with
consensus (the 12Z run looks better). By early next week, GFS runs
kept stronger energy farther north compared to a weakening EC
feature in South Texas early Monday.

The larger scale upper trough eventually reaching into the western
U.S. will be from some combination of progressive North Pacific
energy and flow descending from Alaska. Differences by day
7/Tuesday are within the realm of typical guidance spread/error at
that time frame but differences remain in its evolution.

The WPC forecast early in the period used a blend favoring the GFS
and ECMWF runs as well as continuity, with an Atlantic low
position generally in between the deterministic guidance and some
manual enhancement in terms of the central pressure. Increased the
proportion of ensemble means by the end of the period to resolve
some of the timing and detail differences that arise.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Key Messages for January 28-30 (Friday-Weekend) Winter Storm:
Confidence is increasing that a significant winter storm will
create considerable impacts Friday through the weekend from the
Mid-Atlantic through the Northeast. Heavy snow is most likely in
parts of New England. Heavy snow is still possible further south
on the East Coast, including the major I-95 metropolitan areas
from New York City to Washington D.C., but that is more uncertain
at this time. Significant coastal impacts are possible in the
Northeast, including coastal flooding and beach erosion.
Additionally, strong winds may cause blowing snow and some damage.
Hazardous travel conditions are likely in parts of the region.
Please continue to monitor for updates, and check your local
forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://weather.gov__;!!K543PA!fOOul=
-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ .

Other Weather Highlights:
Currently it appears that the upper trough/low that may track into
California and the Southwest this weekend could be weak enough not
to produce much if any precipitation over that region.  Its
strength and track thereafter will determine how much
precipitation may develop from the Gulf Coast northward by the
first part of next week. Confidence is very low given a wide array
of possibilities between meaningful amounts and dry conditions.
Ahead of the northeastern Pacific upper trough, moisture should
begin to move into the Northwest on Sunday and then continue to
spread across more of the West with time. Highest totals of
rain/mountain snow should be over the Pacific Northwest, but
amounts do not appear too significant at this time. A series of
waves/fronts may bring episodes of light and scattered snow into
parts of the Great Lakes.

Much of the eastern half of the country will be quite chilly
through the weekend, with Saturday-Sunday having the broadest
coverage of temperatures 10-20F below normal. Expect a warming
trend to bring readings back close to normal by Monday or Tuesday.
 Much of the Plains will see above normal temperatures (up to plus
10-20F anomalies) late this week into Monday, aside from a cool
Friday over far southern areas. Northern locations will see a
colder trend Monday-Tuesday while the relative warmth farther
south spreads a bit farther eastward. The West should see plus
5-10F or so anomalies through the weekend followed by a cooler
trend early next week as upper troughing moves in.

...Coastal winter storm threat from the Mid-Atlantic to especially
New England Friday into the weekend...


...Overview...

At the beginning of the medium range period late this week, deep
troughing will traverse the eastern half of the U.S. and spin up a
significant and rapidly deepening surface low in the western
Atlantic. This strong coastal storm may cause heavy snow in the
coastal Mid-Atlantic region with more certainty for heavy snow
over the Northeast, where high winds and coastal flooding are also
likely through the weekend. Meanwhile, initial ridging in the West
will be somewhat disrupted by Pacific energy tracking eastward
over the weekend, before a more potent trough digs into the West
early in the workweek and finally flips the overall upper pattern
somewhat with decreasing heights over the West and rising heights
over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent guidance is still on track with a significant low pressure
system in the western Atlantic late this week, though with some
bouncing around in the exact placement of the low and its track.
Sources of this uncertainty include several upstream shortwaves (a
couple moving through the Great Lakes region and one diving
approximately through the Rockies Wednesday night-Thursday night)
that affect the development of the upper-level trough. These
fine-scale features will still take a while to be resolved
satisfactorily. In general, 00Z/06Z guidance showed a slightly
eastern track compared to the previous runs, but with the
exception of the deterministic ECMWF and to a lesser extent the EC
mean on the western side. Cluster analysis and plots of individual
ensemble lows showed that the EC suite of guidance was pretty
consistently farther west as the low develops than the
deterministic GFS runs and GEFS and CMC ensemble members, given an
EC wider trough bumping up to a bit more of an upstream ridge in
the Atlantic so a low wraps in. However, then the 12Z GFS, GEFS
mean, and CMC came in with a slight westward shift in the low
track, though not quite as far west as the 00Z and new 12Z ECMWF.
So, the strategy of taking a middle ground position with the low
between the western/eastern extremes seems to have worked well,
and this was similar to the previous forecast position of the low.
This forecast track also shows more snow as the dominant
precipitation type rather than sleet/freezing rain.

Models agree regarding ridging in the West initially on Friday,
with a compact possibly closed low in the eastern Pacific. This
relatively small feature could still lead to predictability issues
for a while as it tracks eastward into the Southwest this weekend
and with less certainty beyond then. The GFS runs and ECMWF start
out in good agreement while the 00Z CMC did not cluster well with
consensus (the 12Z run looks better). By early next week, GFS runs
kept stronger energy farther north compared to a weakening EC
feature in South Texas early Monday.

The larger scale upper trough eventually reaching into the western
U.S. will be from some combination of progressive North Pacific
energy and flow descending from Alaska. Differences by day
7/Tuesday are within the realm of typical guidance spread/error at
that time frame but differences remain in its evolution.

The WPC forecast early in the period used a blend favoring the GFS
and ECMWF runs as well as continuity, with an Atlantic low
position generally in between the deterministic guidance and some
manual enhancement in terms of the central pressure. Increased the
proportion of ensemble means by the end of the period to resolve
some of the timing and detail differences that arise.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Key Messages for January 28-30 (Friday-Weekend) Winter Storm:
Confidence is increasing that a significant winter storm will
create considerable impacts Friday through the weekend from the
Mid-Atlantic through the Northeast. Heavy snow is most likely in
parts of New England. Heavy snow is still possible further south
on the East Coast, including the major I-95 metropolitan areas
from New York City to Washington D.C., but that is more uncertain
at this time. Significant coastal impacts are possible in the
Northeast, including coastal flooding and beach erosion.
Additionally, strong winds may cause blowing snow and some damage.
Hazardous travel conditions are likely in parts of the region.
Please continue to monitor for updates, and check your local
forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://weather.gov__;!!K543PA!fOOul=
-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ .

Other Weather Highlights:
Currently it appears that the upper trough/low that may track into
California and the Southwest this weekend could be weak enough not
to produce much if any precipitation over that region.  Its
strength and track thereafter will determine how much
precipitation may develop from the Gulf Coast northward by the
first part of next week. Confidence is very low given a wide array
of possibilities between meaningful amounts and dry conditions.
Ahead of the northeastern Pacific upper trough, moisture should
begin to move into the Northwest on Sunday and then continue to
spread across more of the West with time. Highest totals of
rain/mountain snow should be over the Pacific Northwest, but
amounts do not appear too significant at this time. A series of
waves/fronts may bring episodes of light and scattered snow into
parts of the Great Lakes.

Much of the eastern half of the country will be quite chilly
through the weekend, with Saturday-Sunday having the broadest
coverage of temperatures 10-20F below normal. Expect a warming
trend to bring readings back close to normal by Monday or Tuesday.
 Much of the Plains will see above normal temperatures (up to plus
10-20F anomalies) late this week into Monday, aside from a cool
Friday over far southern areas. Northern locations will see a
colder trend Monday-Tuesday while the relative warmth farther
south spreads a bit farther eastward. The West should see plus
5-10F or so anomalies through the weekend followed by a cooler
trend early next week as upper troughing moves in.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST January 25 2022

SYNOPSIS: There is significant disagreement among the latest dynamical mode=
l
guidance which lessens confidence in today's hazard outlook, particularly
across western North America. By the outset of the period, surface high
pressure descending from Canada is expected to bring anomalously cold and
possibly much below normal temperatures throughout the Great Plains. A surf=
ace
low forecast over the Great Lakes increases the potential for heavy
precipitation, high winds and heavy snow across the eastern U.S. early in t=
he
period. Over Alaska, no hazards are posted due to increased uncertainty in =
the
evolving mid-level pattern.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for the Great Plains, and
portions of the Middle and Upper Mississippi Valley, Wed-Thu, Feb 2-3.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the Southern Plains, Mississippi, Oh=
io
and Tennessee Valleys, Southeast, Appalachians, and the Mid-Atlantic, Wed-F=
ri,
Feb 2-4.

Slight risk of heavy snow for parts of the Northern to Central Great Plains=
,
Middle to Upper Mississippi Valley, and the Great Lakes, Wed-Fri, Feb 2-4.

Slight risk of high winds for the northeastern CONUS, Wed-Fri, Feb 2-4.

zvSrcAe2KTB$

FOR WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 02 - TUESDAY FEBRUARY 08: Compared to previous
dynamical
model guidance, there is significant disagreement between the GEFS and ECMW=
F
500-hPa height forecasts this morning. Although both models continue to fav=
or
anomalous mid-level troughing across western North America by the start of
February, the 0z ECMWF is far more progressive with this feature than the 0=
z
GEFS, while also favoring the development of positive height departures
overspreading the West Coast from the eastern Pacific early in the period.
This
is in contrast to the last several runs of the GEFS, which continues to dep=
ict
a more stable trough/ridge pattern across the CONUS than the ECMWF during t=
he
outlook period. As a result of these differences, there is increased
uncertainty in today's hazards outlook, particularly for much of the CONUS
west
of the Mississippi as well as over Alaska.



By the outset of the period, 850-hPa temperature anomalies from the 0z GEFS
and
0z ECMWF ensembles favor anomalously cold air from Canada beginning to expa=
nd
into the north-central CONUS. The GEFS is far more robust with the negative
lower-level temperatures departures than the ECMWF, which is also reflected=
 in
the GEFS reforecast tool where it depicts a large coverage of elevated
probabilities (>40%) of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percent=
ile
during the first several days of the period. The ECMWF reforecast tool has =
a
substantially weaker cold signal than the GEFS, but it still maintains at
least
a 20% chance of temperatures falling below the 15th percentile tied to surf=
ace
high pressure prevailing throughout the Great Plains. In light of these
differences between the uncalibrated and calibrated guidance, the moderate
risk
of much below normal temperatures is removed in today's outlook, however a
slight risk remains designated during the first few days of the period (Feb
2-3). This slight risk area is expanded further south into the Southern Pla=
ins
relative to the previous outlook where there is agreement between the
reforecast tools for minimum temperatures reaching hazards criteria.



Ahead of the predicted surface high pressure and the accompanying anomalous
cold, deterministic and ensemble mean solutions from both the 0z GEFS and 0=
z
ECMWF continue to favor a potentially potent surface low tracking
northeastward
across the Great Lakes. There is continued agreement with a synoptic return
flow setup, favorable for the advection of Gulf moisture and potentially he=
avy
precipitation over parts of the eastern CONUS. Uncalibrated and calibrated
reforecast guidance supports the continuation of a slight risk of heavy
precipitation over much of the eastern half of the CONUS from Feb 2 to 4,
where
precipitation is expected to be in the form of rainfall in the warm sector.
With cold air advection likely on the backside the surface low, a slight ri=
sk
of heavy snow also remains issued from the Great Plains to the eastern Grea=
t
Lakes from Feb 2 to 4. Relative to the previous outlook, this slight risk a=
rea
is adjusted further southeastward based on the latest guidance as mixed
precipitation is also possible along the southern periphery of the highligh=
ted
area. Several ensemble members from the 0z and 6z GEFS show this low tracki=
ng
from the Great Lakes into Canada, which is favored to spare the Northeast f=
rom
potentially heavy snowfall accumulations. However, strong pressure gradient=
s
featured in the guidance supports the addition of a slight risk of high win=
ds
over the northeastern CONUS, where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
show at least a 20% chance of sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile
early in the period tied to this surface feature.



Across the western North America, there is significant multi-model
disagreement
in regards to favored areas of anomalous temperatures and precipitation. He=
avy
snow in the higher elevations and high winds remain possible across the
western
CONUS associated with anomalous troughing aloft. However there is insuffici=
ent
confidence to maintain the pair of slight risk areas for heavy snow coverin=
g
the Cascades, Great Basin and the Northern and Central Rockies in today's
outlook. Similarly, a slight risk of high winds is also removed based on
disagreement between the reforecast tools. However this hazard may be added
later this week over the West Coast as the ECMWF and Canadian solutions are
beginning to favor stronger mean surface high pressure over the Great Basin=
,
conducive for Santa Ana and Diabo wind events.



Over Alaska, a sharply contrasting mid-level height pattern favored between
the
GEFS and ECMWF during week-2 significantly decreases confidence in the haza=
rds
outlook throughout much of the state. A skill weighted blend of both the GE=
FS
and ECMWF ensembles during the 6-10 day period suggests a slight tilt towar=
ds
below normal temperatures over southeastern Alaska early in the period.
However, the overall conflict in the latest temperature guidance warrants t=
he
removal of both the slight and moderate risk of much below normal temperatu=
res
over the southeastern Mainland and the Panhandle in today's outlook.

...Snow will diminish across the central High Plains tonight,
while lingering over the Southern Rockies/High Plains into early
Wednesday...

...Arctic air to overtake much of the eastern U.S. through
Thursday...

A potent upper level low swinging through the Southern Rockies
tonight will continue to focus the chance for moderate-to-heavy
snow across parts of the region, while also extending into the
central and southern High Plains. Much of the snowfall should end
across the central High Plains this evening as the precipitation
gradually shifts southward overnight. An additional 2-4 inches of
snow are possible just east of the Rockies, with snowfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches possible in the higher terrain of
northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. Winter Storm Warnings
and Winter Weather Advisories remain in effect for areas most
likely to see potentially dangerous travel conditions. A few snow
showers associated with this system will attempt to cross through
parts of northern Texas and central Oklahoma on Wednesday, with
little accumulation expected.

Elsewhere, showers and isolated thunderstorms will be found across
the Florida Peninsula tonight and Wednesday as an area of low
pressure crosses the Sunshine State. Farther north, a pair of cold
fronts are expected to enter the Northern Tier by Wednesday
evening and spread snow showers across the Northern Plains and
Great Lakes into Thursday. For the West, dry and mostly quite
weather is anticipated.

Outside of the Southeast, much of the eastern U.S. is in for a
deep arctic chill through Thursday. The coldest temperatures are
expected from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast on Wednesday
morning, with widespread lows below zero. Subfreezing low
temperatures will also make it as far south as central Louisiana.
Gusty winds will make it feel even colder in most spots. Thus,
Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories stretch from the Northern
Plains to parts of the Midwest, where wind chills could drop as
low as 40 below zero. By Thursday morning, the brunt of the cold
air will shift into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Lows will once
again drop below zero from the central Appalachians to New
England.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 31 - FEB 04, 2022

During the 6-10 day period, a large amplitude 500-hPa ridge is predicted ov=
er
the North Pacific by all models. This ridge extends into western Alaska in =
the
6Z GEFS ensemble mean solution, while the 0Z ECMWF and 0Z Canadian ensemble
means depict increasing influence of troughing to the south of the western
Aleutians on the circulation over Mainland Alaska. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble me=
an
predicts a change in the circulation pattern over the CONUS, with a split i=
n
the flow of the trough over the western CONUS, rising 500-hPa heights, and
positive anomalies over the West Coast, as the ridge over the North Pacific
progresses eastward. The GEFS ensemble mean predicts an alternative solutio=
n
with larger amplitude negative 500-Pa height anomalies over the western CON=
US.
All models predict a ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the
eastern CONUS. The ECMWF ensemble mean was given greater weight in the manu=
al
blend of 500-hPa height forecasts as the rapid transition of the circulatio=
n
pattern is consistent with yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model fore=
casts. The ECMWF ensemble
temperature and precipitation forecasts were also given greater weight in t=
he
consolidation tools and in the outlook, based on higher skill during the
recent
period.

Above normal temperatures are likely for the Aleutian Islands under souther=
ly
surface flow. Below normal temperatures are favored for northern and easter=
n
Alaska and the northern Alaska Panhandle, supported by the temperature
consolidation. There is widespread disagreement in the temperature forecast
for
the western CONUS between the ECMWF and GEFS ensemble mean, with the ECMWF
predicting a rapid warmup of most areas. Below normal temperatures are
slightly
favored for a large area of the West supported by the Auto blend forecast.
Near
normal is favored for northern areas of the Pacific Northwest, Rocky
Mountains,
and High Plains, where the ECMWF favors a rapid warmup. Below normal
temperatures are favored for parts of the Northern Plains, consistent with =
the
temperature consolidation. Above normal temperatures are likely from East
Texas
and the Gulf Coast states northeastward across the eastern CONUS, supported=
 by
the temperature consolidation tool.

Above normal precipitation is favored from southwestern Mainland Alaska int=
o
Central Alaska with southwesterly flow ahead of a predicted trough in the
manual blend of 500-hPa height forecasts. Below normal precipitation is
favored
for extreme southeastern Mainland Alaska and for the Alaska Panhandle, unde=
r
predicted anomalous northerly flow. Below normal precipitation is favored f=
or
the southwestern coastal region of the CONUS, under the increasing influenc=

of
the ridge over the North Pacific. Above normal precipitation is favored ove=

trough
over the western CONUS, and supported by the precipitation consolidation to=

While probabilities for above normal precipitation decrease over the northw=
est
CONUS, probabilities for above normal precipitation increase over the Centr=
al
Plains, exceeding 50 percent in some areas.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well below average, 1 out of 5=
,
due to disagreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern=
,
particularly over Alaska and the western CONUS, and disagreement among the
temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 02 - 08 2022

The circulation pattern continues to evolve more rapidly in the ECMWF ensem=
ble
mean forecast relative to the GEFS ensemble mean forecast during the 8-14 d=
ay
period. The ECMWF ensemble mean predicts southwesterly onshore flow into
Mainland Alaska ahead of a trough over the Aleutian Islands, while the GEFS
ensemble mean continues to predict an extension of the ridge over the North
Pacific into western Mainland Alaska. The ECMWF ensemble mean predicts the
more
rapid eastward progression of a ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies
into the western CONUS, relative to the GEFS ensemble mean, resulting in
significantly different temperature and precipitation forecasts over the
western CONUS by the different model solutions. Models continue to be in
relative agreement on prediction of ridging and positive 500-hPa height
anomalies over the eastern CONUS in the 8-14 day period.

Above normal temperatures are favored over the Aleutians, under southerly
surface flow. Below normal temperatures continue to be favored over
northwestern Mainland Alaska, supported by the temperature consolidation to=
ol.
Increased disagreement among temperature tools leads to a forecast of near
normal for remaining areas of Alaska. Below normal temperatures are favored
for
parts of the interior West centered around the four corners region, where
there
is greater consensus among temperature tools. Above normal temperatures are
favored for parts of the Northern High Plains, where temperatures are
predicted
to rapidly warm, supported by ECMWF temperature tools. Below normal
temperatures continue to be favored for eastern areas of the Northern Plain=
s
and western areas of the Great Lakes region, where temperatures are predict=
ed
to be well below normal early in the period. Above normal temperatures are
favored for much of the eastern CONUS, supported by the temperature
consolidation tool.

Above normal precipitation is favored for interior areas of Mainland Alaska=
,
under predicted southwesterly flow in the manual blend. Below normal
precipitation is favored for parts of the central Pacific Coast, under the
increasing influence of the ridge over the North Pacific. Above normal
precipitation is favored for parts of the Northern Plains, East Texas, and
much
of the eastern half of the CONUS, ahead of the predicted trough.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 17.

...Coastal winter storm threat from the Mid-Atlantic to especially
New England Friday into the weekend...


...Overview...

At the beginning of the medium range period late this week, deep
troughing will traverse the eastern half of the U.S. and spin up a
significant and rapidly deepening surface low in the western
Atlantic. This strong coastal storm may cause heavy snow in the
coastal Mid-Atlantic region with more certainty for heavy snow
over the Northeast, where high winds and coastal flooding are also
likely through the weekend. Meanwhile, initial ridging in the West
will be somewhat disrupted by Pacific energy tracking eastward
over the weekend, before a more potent trough digs into the West
early in the workweek and finally flips the overall upper pattern
somewhat with decreasing heights over the West and rising heights
over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent guidance is still on track with a significant low pressure
system in the western Atlantic late this week, though with some
bouncing around in the exact placement of the low and its track.
Sources of this uncertainty include several upstream shortwaves (a
couple moving through the Great Lakes region and one diving
approximately through the Rockies Wednesday night-Thursday night)
that affect the development of the upper-level trough. These
fine-scale features will still take a while to be resolved
satisfactorily. In general, 00Z/06Z guidance showed a slightly
eastern track compared to the previous runs, but with the
exception of the deterministic ECMWF and to a lesser extent the EC
mean on the western side. Cluster analysis and plots of individual
ensemble lows showed that the EC suite of guidance was pretty
consistently farther west as the low develops than the
deterministic GFS runs and GEFS and CMC ensemble members, given an
EC wider trough bumping up to a bit more of an upstream ridge in
the Atlantic so a low wraps in. However, then the 12Z GFS, GEFS
mean, and CMC came in with a slight westward shift in the low
track, though not quite as far west as the 00Z and new 12Z ECMWF.
So, the strategy of taking a middle ground position with the low
between the western/eastern extremes seems to have worked well,
and this was similar to the previous forecast position of the low.
This forecast track also shows more snow as the dominant
precipitation type rather than sleet/freezing rain.

Models agree regarding ridging in the West initially on Friday,
with a compact possibly closed low in the eastern Pacific. This
relatively small feature could still lead to predictability issues
for a while as it tracks eastward into the Southwest this weekend
and with less certainty beyond then. The GFS runs and ECMWF start
out in good agreement while the 00Z CMC did not cluster well with
consensus (the 12Z run looks better). By early next week, GFS runs
kept stronger energy farther north compared to a weakening EC
feature in South Texas early Monday.

The larger scale upper trough eventually reaching into the western
U.S. will be from some combination of progressive North Pacific
energy and flow descending from Alaska. Differences by day
7/Tuesday are within the realm of typical guidance spread/error at
that time frame but differences remain in its evolution.

The WPC forecast early in the period used a blend favoring the GFS
and ECMWF runs as well as continuity, with an Atlantic low
position generally in between the deterministic guidance and some
manual enhancement in terms of the central pressure. Increased the
proportion of ensemble means by the end of the period to resolve
some of the timing and detail differences that arise.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Key Messages for January 28-30 (Friday-Weekend) Winter Storm:
Confidence is increasing that a significant winter storm will
create considerable impacts Friday through the weekend from the
Mid-Atlantic through the Northeast. Heavy snow is most likely in
parts of New England. Heavy snow is still possible further south
on the East Coast, including the major I-95 metropolitan areas
from New York City to Washington D.C., but that is more uncertain
at this time. Significant coastal impacts are possible in the
Northeast, including coastal flooding and beach erosion.
Additionally, strong winds may cause blowing snow and some damage.
Hazardous travel conditions are likely in parts of the region.
Please continue to monitor for updates, and check your local
forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://weather.gov__;!!K543PA!fOOul=
-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ .

Other Weather Highlights:
Currently it appears that the upper trough/low that may track into
California and the Southwest this weekend could be weak enough not
to produce much if any precipitation over that region.  Its
strength and track thereafter will determine how much
precipitation may develop from the Gulf Coast northward by the
first part of next week. Confidence is very low given a wide array
of possibilities between meaningful amounts and dry conditions.
Ahead of the northeastern Pacific upper trough, moisture should
begin to move into the Northwest on Sunday and then continue to
spread across more of the West with time. Highest totals of
rain/mountain snow should be over the Pacific Northwest, but
amounts do not appear too significant at this time. A series of
waves/fronts may bring episodes of light and scattered snow into
parts of the Great Lakes.

Much of the eastern half of the country will be quite chilly
through the weekend, with Saturday-Sunday having the broadest
coverage of temperatures 10-20F below normal. Expect a warming
trend to bring readings back close to normal by Monday or Tuesday.
 Much of the Plains will see above normal temperatures (up to plus
10-20F anomalies) late this week into Monday, aside from a cool
Friday over far southern areas. Northern locations will see a
colder trend Monday-Tuesday while the relative warmth farther
south spreads a bit farther eastward. The West should see plus
5-10F or so anomalies through the weekend followed by a cooler
trend early next week as upper troughing moves in.

...Coastal winter storm threat from the Mid-Atlantic to especially
New England Friday into the weekend...


...Overview...

Early in the medium range period from Saturday into early Sunday,
a deep upper trough reaching the East Coast will likely close off
an embedded upper low that tracks near the New England coast. The
evolution aloft will support further deepening of strong low
pressure just off the East Coast and direct the system northward,
from east of the Mid-Atlantic coast into the Canadian Maritimes.
This strong coastal storm may cause heavy snow in the coastal
Mid-Atlantic region with higher confidence for heavy snow over the
Northeast, where high winds and coastal flooding are also likely
through the weekend. At the same time a weak eastern Pacific
trough/upper low will cut through the southern part of initial
ridging over the West. From late weekend into next week a more
potent upper trough will push into the West and steadily amplify,
ultimately flipping the upper pattern as a ridge axis reaches the
East Coast by Wednesday. This configuration should lead to a
pronounced increase of precipitation over the central U.S. by the
end of the forecast period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest guidance continues to favor an intermediate/consensus
approach for depicting the western Atlantic storm during the
weekend. A significant key to the forecast of the surface low by
late Saturday appears to be exactly when, where, and how deeply
the upper low within the overall trough closes off. In general GFS
runs have tended to be a little later/weaker with the upper low
while the 12Z ECMWF is somewhat on the earlier/deeper side. The
12Z ECMWF scenario brings the surface track back to the west for a
brief time, which a number of ECMWF ensembles have also been
doing. The 00Z CMC has a less pronounced and farther north
depiction of this idea. The new 00Z ECMWF has adjusted east with
the surface low toward the longer-term consensus due to a slightly
weaker upper low. This is a very fine-scale detail and the
supporting energy is still over northwestern North America so it
may take additional time to resolve specifics with reasonable
satisfaction.

For the upper trough moving into the West, the forecast of leading
energy has become more uncertain in the new 00Z cycle as models
show varying ways in which some of the energy in the shortwave may
get pulled off to the southwest--leading to meaningful differences
in amplitude as the remaining energy reaches the West Coast. On
the other hand, guidance from the 12Z cycle onward seems to have
come into better agreement for the pattern from the North Pacific
through Alaska and Siberia. This has in turn helped to narrow the
spread somewhat for the larger scale upper trough amplifying into
the West during the first half of the week.

Models are slowly improving their agreement with respect to the
weak upper trough/low moving into the Southwest during the weekend
and continuing along the southern tier before weakening as it
heads into a developing mean ridge in the East. General trends by
the time the feature reaches the Plains have been more in the
direction of the southern ECMWF versus some earlier northern GFS
runs.

The updated forecast started with a blend of 12Z models, with
minor manual enhancement of the western Atlantic storm. The 12Z
GFS compared slightly better in concept to other guidance versus
the 18Z run. Meanwhile the model blend accounted for the most
common ideas for the arriving western trough as of the 12Z/18Z
cycles. By later in the period an average of recent operational
model runs has fairly good support from the GEFS/ECMWF means for
the amplifying western trough, so even by days 6-7
Tuesday-Wednesday the forecast included only 30 percent total
ensemble mean weight.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Key Messages for January 28-30 (Friday-Weekend) Winter Storm:
Confidence is increasing that a significant winter storm will
create considerable impacts Friday through the weekend from the
Mid-Atlantic through the Northeast. Heavy snow is most likely in
parts of New England. Heavy snow is still possible farther south
along the East Coast, including the major I-95 metropolitan areas
from New York City to Washington D.C., but that is more uncertain
at this time. Significant coastal impacts are possible in the
Northeast, including coastal flooding and beach erosion.
Additionally, strong winds may cause blowing snow and some damage.
Hazardous travel conditions are likely in parts of the region.

-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ .

Other Weather Highlights:
It still appears that the upper trough/low that may track into
California and the Southwest this weekend may be weak enough not
to produce much if any precipitation over that region. Its
strength and track thereafter will determine how much
precipitation may develop from the Gulf Coast northward by the
first part of next week. Over the past day guidance has started to
show some convergence toward the idea of at least some meaningful
rainfall along and north of the western half of the Gulf Coast by
Monday. Moisture ahead of a northeastern Pacific upper trough
should begin to move into the Northwest on Sunday and then
continue to spread across more of the West with time as the upper
trough moves inland and amplifies. Highest totals of rain/mountain
snow should be over the Pacific Northwest, but amounts do not
appear too significant at this time. Toward midweek the western
trough and leading surface front will interact with a healthy flow
of Gulf moisture to produce a rapidly expanding area of
precipitation, some of it potentially becoming moderate to heavy.
Lighter wintry precipitation will be possible over northern
latitudes. A series of waves/fronts may bring episodes of light
and scattered snow into parts of the Great Lakes before the larger
scale pattern changes.

The eastern U.S. will be quite chilly through the weekend with
broad coverage of temperatures 10-20F below normal, including
subfreezing lows extending into portions of Florida. Areas from
the Mississippi Valley to Appalachians should see a moderating
trend from west to east. Aside from some below normal readings
over Texas and vicinity, much of the Plains will see above normal
temperatures from the weekend into next week with readings up to
10-20F or so above normal. This warmth will progress into the
eastern half of the country early-mid week with the increase of
Gulf moisture helping to raise min temperature anomalies in
particular by Wednesday. Moderately above normal temperatures over
the West during the weekend will trend lower next week with the
arrival of an amplifying upper trough and 5-15F below normal highs
may extend from the Interior West into the High Plains/northern
tier by Tuesday-Wednesday.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Flow aloft will become broadly cyclonic across a sizable portion of
the country today. At the surface, high pressure will be present in
the West and from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast. A strong
surface cyclone in southern Canada will move eastward north of the
international border, bringing gusty winds to parts of the northern
Plains and upper Midwest. Fire weather concerns will remain minimal
due to a combination of cool/cold conditions and unreceptive fuels.

...Synopsis...
Upper-level troughing will intensify on Thursday across from the
Plains to the East Coast. As this occurs, another surface high
pressure system will reinforce cold air across much of the Plains
and upper Midwest. In the West, an upper ridge will amplify across
the Great Basin, strengthening the surface anticyclone within the
region. Cool/cold conditions, precipitation, and generally light
winds will keep fire weather concerns minimal in most locations. The
surface pattern will again favor northerly/northeasterly winds in
southern California and the lower Colorado River Valley. Though RH
will fall to perhaps below 15%, live and dead fuel moisture remains
high enough to keep fire concerns low in these areas as well.

A upper level trough digging southward into the southern Rockies
will continue to bring a good chance of snow across the northern
half of New Mexico this morning before swinging eastward across
the Texas Panhandle and into Oklahoma later today into tonight.
Much of these areas should receive 1 to 3 inches of snow, although

Wednesday night.

Caught in between mild air that builds up over the High Plains and
a pair of arctic cold fronts forecast to plunge from Canada, the
northern tier states will experience large temperature swings
through the next couple of days.  Frigid conditions across the
upper Midwest this morning will be quickly followed by milder than
normal conditions by Thursday before another arctic surge reaches
the area Thursday night.  mainly light snow is expected to
associated with the arctic front as it sweeps through the Great
Lakes on Thursday.  Meanwhile, arctic air that has settled across
the eastern and southern U.S. will moderate slowly during the next
couple of days.

Elsewhere, a low pressure wave will bring some showers and
possibly thunderstorms across southern Florida today and into
Thursday.  This low pressure wave is forecast to become nearly
stationary just east of Florida through Friday morning, with rain
chance gradually decreasing over Florida. For the West, dry and
mostly quite weather is anticipated.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Thu Apr 01 2021

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN MONTANA...NORTH
DAKOTA...AND FAR NORTHWEST MINNESOTA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE GREATER WESTERN OKLAHOMA
PANHANDLE REGION...

No changes to the ongoing forecast. Strong winds are already present
across both critical areas and continued warming will drop relative
humidity at or near critical thresholds.

..Bentley.. 04/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Thu Apr 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor reveals an upper-level ridge building over
the western CONUS as a trough and attendant surface cold front begin
to push off the East Coast. The passage of this cold front across
the Plains and into the Southeast over the past 48 hours has yielded
very dry conditions across much of the central U.S., which will help
support another day of fire weather concerns from the southern to
northern U.S. borders.

...Northern Plains...
Dewpoint values in the single digits and teens are noted from
eastern MT into the central Plains, and regional 00 UTC soundings
reveal minimal boundary-layer moisture. Mostly clear to partly
cloudy skies this afternoon will help support another day of
humidity values in the 20-30% range. A weak upper-level shortwave is
noted in water-vapor imagery propagating northeastward towards the
apex of the synoptic ridge. Stronger flow associated with this
feature, along with weak synoptic lift ahead of the wave, will
support the deepening of a lee low over the Canadian Prairies. In
response, south to southwesterly winds are forecast to increase into
the 15-20 mph range from central NE into SD and will likely reach
the 20-25 mph range for ND and northern MT. A broad swath of
elevated conditions are expected, and a few areas of critical
conditions appear likely - particularly across northern MT where
downslope warming/drying will aid in RH reductions and across
central ND, which is immediately downstream from the driest air mass
(per regional soundings). 10-hour fuel moisture in the 5-10% range
across the region will support the fire weather threat given the
expected meteorological conditions.

...Southern High Plains...
Lee troughing along the High Plains juxtaposed next to surface high
over the Midwest/MS Valley region will lead to strengthening
pressure-gradient winds this afternoon for the southern High Plains.
Southerly winds at 15-25 mph will be common, and although downslope
affects will be minimal, a antecedent dry air mass and mostly clear
skies will help RH values fall into the low teens this afternoon.
The most likely location for critical conditions resides across the
greater OK Panhandle region where fuels are receptive and the
potential for sustained critical wind/RH is highest (largely due to
strengthening low to mid-level flow through the day). To the
southeast into the TX Panhandle, elevated to critical fire weather
conditions are possible, but slightly more marginal fuels preclude
an expansion at this time.

...Southern Arizona into Southern New Mexico...
Guidance continues to show reasonably high agreement in the
potential for elevated fire weather conditions this afternoon from
the southern NM/AZ border into west-central AZ. Easterly winds up to
15-20 mph should be common and will likely coincide with RH values
in the teens to perhaps single digits. Fuels across this region
become more marginal with northern extent, but the coverage of cured
fuels should be sufficient to support an elevated fire weather
concern for much of the area.

...Coastal South California...
North to northeasterly winds will likely continue into the early
morning hours over coastal south CA due to residual surface high
pressure to the north and an approaching shortwave trough to the
south. A handful of surface observations from the region show
elevated to critical conditions ongoing, which may persist into the
mid-morning hours before winds diminish as the low moves onshore.
Despite the ongoing wind/RH conditions, fuels remain only modestly
receptive and approaching rain showers and weak thunderstorms may
further limit fuel readiness. Consequently, no highlights are
introduced.

...Large Scale Pattern, Guidance Preferences and Predictability
Assessment...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

An upper level low will be slow moving east of New England while
another trough amplifies along the West Coast and moves slowly
inland. The downstream ridge over the central US will lead to warm
and dry conditions for much of the central and southern U.S., and
some precipitation for the West and the northern tier states.

The models and ensembles start showing differences in first across
the eastern Pacific by Sunday night.  The models move an upper
trough and accompanying surface front onshore and inland across
the northern Rockies and Plains, early next week, continuing into
the MS Valley and upper Great Lakes midweek.

The differences in the timing and phasing of the upper trough
among the 00z ECMWF, 00-06z GFS, 00z UKMET, and 00z Canadian
global led to low weighting to any one model solution plus
blending with the ensemble means from each of the 00z ECMWF/00z
Canadian/06z GEFS.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Precipitation coverage should begin to pick up in coverage across
Washington, and Oregon and the northern Rockies as the upper
trough progresses across these areas late this weekend into early
next week. As the trough moves across the plains into the MS
Valley, upper Great Lakes and Ohio Valley mid week, then
precipitation will occur in tandem with the upper trough
progression.
None of the current models has a forecast of particularly heavy
snow or rain.

Very warm temperatures are forecast for much of the central U.S.
over the weekend, making it feel more like late May or even early
June.  Afternoon high temperatures will likely be on the order of
15 to 30 degrees above normal.  Highs are forecast to reach the
low to mid 80s across portions of the central Plains Sunday and
Monday, then cooling by Wed and Thu Apr 8th as the upper trough
moves through. High temperatures are forecast to be well into the
90s for the lower elevations of the Desert Southwest with perhaps
some daily record highs.  Some 100 degree readings are becoming
more likely for the hotter desert locations.  A slow cooling trend
is expected for the West Coast as the upper trough/low moves
through and cloud cover increases.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 01 2021

SYNOPSIS: A low amplitude mid-level height pattern is forecast over most of
the
U.S. in week-2. The most significant feature is mid-level low pressure
predicted across parts of Alaska and the northeastern Pacific, which favors
anomalously cold temperatures across most of Alaska. Across the lower-48, w=
eak
mid-level high (low) pressure is forecast over the central (eastern) CONUS.
This pattern favors above normal temperatures for parts of the Plains, and
more
seasonable weather across the East.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures across interior parts of centra=
l
and eastern Mainland Alaska, Fri, Apr 9.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across interior parts of
Mainland Alaska, including to the western Alaskan coast, Fri-Sat, Apr 9-10.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across Mainland Alaska, Fri-M=
on,
Apr 9-12.

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures across parts of the Southern
Plains, Fri-Sat, Apr 9-10.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY APRIL 04 - THURSDAY APRIL 08:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!u25C9Tu6LqrGRuIubbL89azxzNkRENWawjkfeS1MY7jKrMB-YrSmQp7IRQtyK=
iOGP-dcosdT$

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 09 - THURSDAY APRIL 15: At the onset of the period, ensemb=
le
means from the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian all depict anomalous troughing acr=
oss
the northeastern Pacific, extending through parts of Alaska and western
Canada.
Upstream of this trough, ridging is favored across the Central Pacific and
into
the western Aleutians. This synoptic set-up favors increased northerly
mid-level flow across Alaska, and a mean storm track from the Bering Sea,
southeastward to the Gulf of Alaska. Mean surface low pressure forecast ove=
r
the Gulf of Alaska throughout week-2 favors enhanced easterly surface flow
across the Mainland. As a result, substantial below normal temperatures are
anticipated across much of Alaska during the first half of the period,
potentially delaying river ice breakup across parts of the state. Both the
GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate some areas of the central and eastern
Mainland having at least a 60% chance of minimum temperatures falling below
the
10th percentile on Apr 9. For this reason, an upgrade to a high risk of muc=
h
below normal temperatures is highlighted over the region for this day only,
with actual temperatures possibly dropping below -20 deg F in some areas, a=
nd
approaching record lows for this time of year. A broader moderate risk area=
 is
highlighted through Apr 10 across the western and interior Mainland where t=
he
reforecast tools continue to depict probabilities of at least 40% for
temperatures falling below the lowest 10th percentile. The GEFS and Canadia=
n
solutions are more progressive than the ECMWF, which are quicker to moderat=
e
the cold air mass. However, the ECMWF ensemble solution favors the anomalou=
s
cold persisting into the middle of the outlook period with troughing
reamplifying across the state, and elevated probabilities (>20%) for hazard=
ous
cold continuing through Apr 12 across the Mainland, supporting the extensio=
n
of
the slight risk area.



The aforementioned troughing is forecast to shift into the western CONUS,
bringing colder temperatures to portions of the Pacific Coast, and spreadin=
g
inland to the Rockies by the middle of the period. While the ECMWF reforeca=
st
tool depicts elevated probabilities (>20%) for minimum temperatures droppin=
g
below the lowest 15th percentile and freezing over some areas, the GEFS is =
not
as robust. Additionally, the uncalibrated tools from both the ECMWF and GEF=
S
ensembles do not show widespread substantial minimum temperature anomalies,
with a stronger signal in the maximum temperatures. For this reason, no
related
temperature hazard is highlighted over the West at this time.



Downstream of this trough, weak ridging and associated above normal
temperatures are forecast across the Great Plains. There are some indicatio=
ns,
particularly in the ECMWF guidance, that temperatures over the Southern Pla=
ins
may reach hazards thresholds. Specifically, the ECMWF reforecast tool depic=
ts
elevated probabilities over parts of Texas with at least a 40% chance of
temperatures reaching the 90th percentile on Apr 9 and 10. The GEFS is weak=
er
with the signal, instead showing the highest positive temperature anomalies
late in week-1, but not persisting into week-2. This is related to the
evolution of the troughing upstream over the western CONUS and the timing o=
f
the passage of a frontal system. The less progressive ECMWF allows the
anomalous ridging to persist over the region early in week-2. Given anteced=
ent
dry soils, and moderate to extreme drought over many parts of the Southern
Plains, a slight risk of much above normal maximum temperatures is depicted
over the region for Apr 9 and 10, with the potential for daytime highs well
into the 90s (deg F), should the warmer ECMWF guidance verify.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu April 01 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 07 - 11 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa patt=
ern
across the forecast domain during the 6-10 day period. Dynamical models
forecast a 500-hPa ridge and associated above normal heights over the North=
ern
Pacific extending across the Aleutians. A trough with below normal heights =
is
forecast from Mainland Alaska down to the western CONUS. A broad ridge is
favored over much of the central and eastern CONUS, resulting in predicted
near
to above normal heights. However, below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast=
 to
expand westward to the East Coast later in the period.

Probabilities of below normal temperatures are enhanced across the West Coa=
st
of the CONUS to parts of the Northern Rockies, associated with below normal
heights. Broad ridging predicted over the central and eastern CONUS favors
above normal temperatures for most of the rest of the CONUS. Forecast
troughing
and northeast surface flow over southern Alaska increase the odds of below
normal temperatures across the Mainland and the Panhandle.

The troughing continues to favor above normal precipitation for much of
Alaska.
Troughing over the western CONUS and a short wave system moving across the
Northern Plains to the East Coast lead to elevated chances of near to above
normal precipitation over the parts of the Northern Great Plains, Ohio Vall=
ey
and Mid-Atlantic. Increased odds of below normal precipitation are indicate=
d
across the Northeast and Florida Peninsula, consistent with the consolidati=
on
forecast tool. Above normal heights also favor below normal precipitation o=
ver
parts of the Great Basin, the Southern Rockies, Central and Southern Plains=
.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset by increasing uncertainty=
 in
regards to the precipitation forecast over the CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 09 - 15 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is generally forecast =
to
deamplify compared to the 6-10 day period. Troughing is forecast to develop
over the eastern CONUS, while a 500-hPa ridge weakens across the central
CONUS.
Near to below normal heights are forecast over the western CONUS due to a
persistent through. Troughing is forecast across Mainland Alaska with the
below
normal heights, while ridging is forecast across the western Aleutians with
above normal heights.

Forecast troughing and easterly surface flow lead to increased chances of
below
normal temperatures across Alaska. Troughing favors below normal temperatur=
es
across the West Coast. Elevated chances of near to above normal temperature=
s
are forecast across the remainder CONUS, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across much of
Mainland Alaska due to predicted troughting. Near to below normal
precipitation
is favored over much of the CONUS,  due to a forecast mean ridge centered o=
ver
the Great Plains and also consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=

of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty in regards to the temperature and precipitation
forecast
over the CONUS.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CDT Thu Apr 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

Expanded the elevated area in the Plains to the north and east.
Winds will likely be sustained at 20 to 25 mph across much of the TX
Panhandle, Oklahoma, and Kansas into the Upper Midwest. However, the
drier relative humidity will be closer to the diffuse
dryline/trough. Some high resolution guidance does drop relative
humidity as low as 25 percent farther east. Therefore, trends will
need to be monitored and a farther north and east expansion of this
elevated area may be warranted.

Also expanded the elevated area in northern Montana to include much
of North Dakota and portions of South Dakota. Winds of 15 to 20 mph
are expected in this region with relative humidity dropping below 15
percent. In addition, this region has seen several consecutive days
of dry and windy conditions which has dried fuels further.

..Bentley.. 04/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Thu Apr 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad low-amplitude upper-level ridging is forecast to become
established over the CONUS through the day Friday. Impulses embedded
within the larger flow regime will introduce areas of gustier winds
that could lead to fire weather concerns for parts of the northern
Plains and southern High Plains. Elsewhere across the U.S., broad
surface high pressure over the mid-South and Ohio River Valley will
yield relatively weak surface winds and reduce the fire weather
potential.

...Northern Plains...
The exit of Thursday's surface low to the east/northeast will reduce
pressure-gradient winds over the region for Friday. However,
continued zonal flow over the northern Rockies will favor persistent
downslope flow across northern MT. Winds between 15-20 mph should
overlap regions of reduced humidity down to 20-30% by Friday
afternoon, and given receptive fine fuels, will introduce the
potential for elevated fire weather conditions. To the southeast,
portions of WY and SD may experience elevated wind/RH conditions
behind a surface trough that will be migrating across the northern
Plains. However, these conditions should remain fairly localized and
transient.

...Southern High Plains...
The upper-level shortwave trough that is currently off the south CA
coast is forecast to move onshore and into northern Mexico over the
next 24-48 hours. Somewhat weak surface pressure falls are expected
across northern NM ahead of this wave. This will augment the
pressure gradient already in place due to the stout surface high to
the east. Southerly sustained winds at 15-25 mph appear likely from
southwest TX into central KS. Modest moisture return into the Trans
Pecos region (where the driest fuels are noted) may mitigate
humidity reductions compared to further north where RH values near
20% should be common. Fuels across the OK/TX Panhandles are somewhat
marginal due to spring green-up, but should remain dry enough to
support an elevated fire weather concern.

...Large Scale Pattern, Guidance Preferences and Predictability
Assessment...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

An upper level low will be slow moving east of New England while
another trough amplifies along the West Coast and moves slowly
inland. The downstream ridge over the central US will lead to warm
and dry conditions for much of the central and southern U.S., and
some precipitation for the West and the northern tier states.

The models and ensembles start showing differences in first across
the eastern Pacific by Sunday night.  The models move an upper
trough and accompanying surface front onshore and inland across
the northern Rockies and Plains, early next week, continuing into
the MS Valley and upper Great Lakes midweek.

The differences in the timing and phasing of the upper trough
among the 00z ECMWF, 00-06z GFS, 00z UKMET, and 00z Canadian
global led to low weighting to any one model solution plus
blending with the ensemble means from each of the 00z ECMWF/00z
Canadian/06z GEFS.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Precipitation coverage should begin to pick up in coverage across
Washington, and Oregon and the northern Rockies as the upper
trough progresses across these areas late this weekend into early
next week. As the trough moves across the plains into the MS
Valley, upper Great Lakes and Ohio Valley mid week, then
precipitation will occur in tandem with the upper trough
progression.
None of the current models has a forecast of particularly heavy
snow or rain.

Very warm temperatures are forecast for much of the central U.S.
over the weekend, making it feel more like late May or even early
June.  Afternoon high temperatures will likely be on the order of
15 to 30 degrees above normal.  Highs are forecast to reach the
low to mid 80s across portions of the central Plains Sunday and
Monday, then cooling by Wed and Thu Apr 8th as the upper trough
moves through. High temperatures are forecast to be well into the
90s for the lower elevations of the Desert Southwest with perhaps
some daily record highs.  Some 100 degree readings are becoming
more likely for the hotter desert locations.  A slow cooling trend
is expected for the West Coast as the upper trough/low moves
through and cloud cover increases.

...Record-breaking cold to overspread areas from the Lower
Mississippi
Valley to Northeast through Friday...

...Warm temperatures found across the western United States with
critical fire weather located across the Northern Plains and parts
of the Southern High Plains...

A deep low just off the Maine Coast will slowly move eastward into
Southeastern Canada overnight Thursday.   A tight pressure
gradient around the low will help produce gusty winds over parts
of the Northeast that will weaken overnight as the surface low
fills.  In the wake of the system, light snow will develop over
parts of the Northeast into the Central Appalachians overnight
Thursday, mostly ending by Friday morning.  High pressure over the
Upper Great Lakes into the Middle Mississippi Valley will slowly
move eastward to the Southeast by Saturday evening.  The high will
usher in much colder temperatures and gusty winds across the
eastern United States.  Even though colder temperatures are coming
in, the combination of previous warm temperatures and rain could
lead to rivers rising and ice jams occurring across northern
Maine. Flood Watches are in effect to highlight the potential
hazard.  Furthermore, the colder temperatures associated with the
high will produce record cold temperatures from the Central Gulf
Coast to the Mid-Atlantic.

Additionally, record cold maximum temperatures may be in store for
parts of the Southeast northward to the Northeast.  Freeze
Warnings and Watches, and Hard Freeze Warnings have been issued
across the Middle Mississippi Valley, Tennessee, Lower Ohio
Valleys, and Southeast and Mid-Atlantic parts. Low temperatures
are forecast to dip to near freezing as far south as Central
Georgia and Southern South Carolina.  Temperatures this cold
during the beginning of April can cause damage to early-season
crops and plants. Gusty winds along the East Coast will make it
feel even colder at times.

Across the western U.S., much warmer and tranquil weather is
expected through Saturday.  High temperatures are forecast to run
well above average and virtually no precipitation is expected.
However, the combination of warm weather, low relative humidity,
and gusty winds will create conditions ripe for wildfires to
possibly spread uncontrollably across the Northern Plains and
Southern High Plains. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Critical Risk of fire weather that extends from northern Montana
to far northwest Minnesota, with a small area issued across the
greater western Oklahoma Panhandle region. Also, Red Flag Warnings
have been issued across the Northern Plains, as well as southeast
Arizona.

Extended Forecast Discussion

256 AM EDT Fri Apr 02 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 05 2021 - 12Z Fri Apr 09 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The two primary uncertainties of the forecast involve initial West
Coast/Northwest shortwave energy that may progress through the
western and central U.S. in the form of a closed low, followed by
the specifics of eastern Pacific/western U.S. flow with guidance
showing increasing divergence by late next week.  The leading
system should spread precipitation across the northern half of the
West/Rockies and then onward through a majority of the
central/eastern U.S.  Late week flow details will determine how
much precipitation reaches the Pacific Northwest at that time.
Meanwhile an upper low just offshore New England and Nova Scotia
at the start of the week will drift away only gradually due to a
fairly blocky pattern over the Atlantic and eastern Canada.

Over recent days guidance has been showing difficulty in resolving
the character of eastern Pacific shortwave energy during the
weekend, with resulting differences and variability affecting the
forecast across the lower 48 for most of the period.  In the past
24 hours the operational models have been gravitating toward the
idea of West Coast energy forming an upper low by early Monday or
shortly thereafter.  This upper low would then continue across the
western and central U.S.  So far the new 00Z guidance is following
through fairly well on the 12Z/18Z consensus, albeit with some
spread for track and timing.  This provides some increase in
confidence but recent guidance behavior still provides some
concern.  Recent GFS runs appear to be on the deep side of the
spread for the upper low and associated surface reflection so the
preferred blend tones down that aspect its forecast.

The spread for eastern Pacific and western U.S. flow becomes most
noticeable by next Thursday-Friday as the GFS and more subdued
GEFS mean amplify central Pacific ridging farther west than most
other guidance, in turn leading to a farther west eastern Pacific
trough/western U.S. ridge.  In varying ways the ECMWF/CMC and
their means are farther east with the upstream ridge, promoting a
mean trough close to the West Coast and a more modest/eastward
ridge to the east.  Each cluster's trough position is internally
consistent with their respective upstream ridge
teleconnection-wise, and both clusters have maintained their
solutions for a while, so an intermediate approach seems best at
this time.

An average of guidance looks good for the upper low initially near
New England.  The new 00Z GFS has trended a bit eastward from
previous runs that were on the western side of the spread for a
time.  Between this low and the system emerging from the West,
there are some lower predictability uncertainties for some
southern-eastern Canada and eastern U.S. flow specifics that will
affect where a surface boundary will be positioned on a day-to-day
basis.

Forecast preferences led to an operational model composite during
the first half of the period transitioning toward a blend
consisting of half 12Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean and half 18Z GFS/GEFS mean
(but with much more GEFS mean than GFS) later in the week.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Early in the week the system moving into the West will bring an
area of rain and high elevation snow mainly over the northern half
of the region.  Coverage and intensity of precipitation should
then increase to the east of the Rockies as the upper system
continues onward and associated low pressure/frontal system evolve
over the central U.S.  Some areas of locally moderate to heavy
rainfall may be possible within a broad area extending from the
northern half of the Plains into portions of the East.  A front
ahead of this system may also provide a focus for enhanced
rainfall over parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes.  Meanwhile the
Pacific Northwest may see an increase of moisture during the
latter half of the week but with considerable uncertainty as to
the magnitude, and there is still a less probable scenario that
would have the region staying relatively dry into late week.

Warm flow ahead of the initial Northwest system will bring well
above normal temperatures to areas from the Southwest and parts of
the Great Basin through the Midwest/Great Lakes early in the week.
 Best potential for plus 20F or greater anomalies for min and/or
max readings will be over the northern and central Plains into
Midwest.  Some daily records are possible from the
Southwest/southern Rockies northeastward.  This warmth will
moderate as it moves eastward ahead of the system that should
reach into the Plains/Mississippi Valley, with late week eastern
U.S. anomalies tending to be in the plus 10-20F range for morning
lows and plus 5-15F for highs.  System passage over the West
should bring temperatures down only to around normal or perhaps
briefly below, with southern areas tending to stay moderately
above climatology.  The Pacific Northwest should be near to
modestly below normal for most of the week.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The two primary uncertainties of the forecast involve initial West
Coast/Northwest shortwave energy that may progress through the
western and central U.S. in the form of a closed low, followed by
the specifics of eastern Pacific/western U.S. flow with guidance
showing increasing divergence by late next week.  The leading
system should spread precipitation across the northern half of the
West/Rockies and then onward through a majority of the
central/eastern U.S.  Late week flow details will determine how
much precipitation reaches the Pacific Northwest at that time.
Meanwhile an upper low just offshore New England and Nova Scotia
at the start of the week will drift away only gradually due to a
fairly blocky pattern over the Atlantic and eastern Canada.

Over recent days guidance has been showing difficulty in resolving
the character of eastern Pacific shortwave energy during the
weekend, with resulting differences and variability affecting the
forecast across the lower 48 for most of the period.  In the past
24 hours the operational models have been gravitating toward the
idea of West Coast energy forming an upper low by early Monday or
shortly thereafter.  This upper low would then continue across the
western and central U.S.  So far the new 00Z guidance is following
through fairly well on the 12Z/18Z consensus, albeit with some
spread for track and timing.  This provides some increase in
confidence but recent guidance behavior still provides some
concern.  Recent GFS runs appear to be on the deep side of the
spread for the upper low and associated surface reflection so the
preferred blend tones down that aspect its forecast.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Fri Apr 02 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will continue to develop across the West and
central U.S. today. The strongest flow aloft will be displaced to
the north along the and near the Canadian border. With the building
upper-level ridge, a surface high pressure system will maintain its
strength as it moves through the Midwest and into the Mid-South. To
the north, a strong shortwave trough will help to deepen a surface
low in the Canadian Prairies. These two surface features will
promote elevated fire weather conditions across portions of the
Plains and western Florida.

...Northern Plains..
15-20 mph winds with 10-25% RH during the afternoon will be possible
from northern Montana into the Dakotas behind a weak surface
front/pressure trough. Fine fuels continue to dry out in this region
and will support fire spread. Winds aloft will be greater in this
region compared to points southward; however, a weaker surface
pressure gradient will tend to limit the potential critical fire
weather in most locations. Some areas of the High Plains will see
similar conditions, but the duration of these conditions is in doubt
given the weaker winds aloft.

...Southern/Central Plains...
Between the surface trough and the surface high pressure, a zone of
enhance winds in the lowest 2-3 km will develop from the Texas
Panhandle into the Mid-Missouri Valley. Winds of 15-25 mph appear
possible in this region. Guidance differs on how low RH will fall,
especially with eastern extent. In similar situations with a frontal
boundary nearby with surface trajectories generally remaining
continental, the drier guidance tends to perform better. With that
in mind, the elevated area has been expanded north and east. Even
though some areas could see higher RH values in the afternoon, the
strength of the winds and dry fuel conditions will support elevated
risk.

...Western Florida Coast...
Post-frontal wind will remain strong into the afternoon with the
surface high maintaining its strength. 10-20 mph winds will overlap
RH potentially as low as 25-30% in areas near the western coast.
ERCs in this location are nearing the 90th percentile and will
support an elevated fire weather risk.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Ridging at upper-levels will continue to be the main feature across
the West and into the Mississippi Valley on Saturday. The surface
high pressure system is expected to weaken in the Southeast with the
pattern in elsewhere being relatively disorganized. A subtle
shortwave trough at upper-levels will move into the northern Rockies
by afternoon. A weak surface low will develop in MT and the western
Dakotas. With the low, a diffuse surface boundary will move east
during the day. Southwesterly winds in portions of central South
Dakota into eastern North Dakota could reach 15-20 mph during the
afternoon. Surface conditions are likely to be dry with most areas
seeing 20-25%, though areas of 15-20% are possible. Given the
overall disorganized surface pressure pattern, conditions are most
likely going to remain elevated on a relatively brief and localized
basis. Elsewhere across the CONUS, weak winds over dry fuels will
keep fire weather concerns low.

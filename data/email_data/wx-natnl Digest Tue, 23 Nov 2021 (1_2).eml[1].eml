Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1052 AM CST Mon Nov 22 2021

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE VENTURA VALLEY IN
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR SOUTHEAST
WYOMING...

Latest METAR observations continue to suggest that Critical
conditions are ongoing across portions of the Ventura Valley, with
RH hovering around 15% and the LAX to WJF/PMD surface pressure
gradients remaining at Critical thresholds (-5 to -10 mb). Since
some of these pressure gradients have peaked past 12Z in some cases,
Critical conditions are likely to persist for at least a few more
hours given poor RH recovery, necessitating the maintenance of
Critical highlights across the Ventura Valley.

Meanwhile, METAR observations in southeast Wyoming have shown
sustained westerly surface winds occasionally approaching 25 mph.
While surface temperatures are mainly in the 40s F, clear skies
should support boundary-layer heating, with surface temperatures
reaching near 60F and RH dropping to 15%. While winds are expected
to gradually weaken with time, a window of opportunity exists for
the overlap of low-end Critical conditions across portions of
southeast Wyoming this afternoon, with the Critical area maintained
to account for this scenario.

Cloud cover prevails across northern Montana this morning, which may
limit more robust heating and associated boundary-layer mixing, at
least into the early afternoon hours. Nonetheless, METARs show RH
values hovering around 20% within the ongoing Elevated delineation,
where surface winds are exceeding 15 mph. Elevated to locally
Critical conditions are expected to continue through the afternoon
hours based on the latest guidance consensus.

..Squitieri.. 11/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CST Mon Nov 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge over the West is forecast to shift eastward
today as a shortwave trough approaches the Pacific Northwest coast.
At the surface, high pressure over the Great Basin will gradually
weaken throughout the day, resulting in an eventual relaxation of
the pressure gradient across Southern California.

...Portions of Southern California...
With ongoing downslope, offshore flow through the morning, RH
recovery will be poor, resulting in continuous critical fire weather
conditions across portions of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties in
Southern California.  While the offshore flow will eventually weaken
through the afternoon, a multi-hour period of sustained
northeasterly winds over 20 mph concurrent with RH values less than
15% is likely, especially across southern portions of Ventura
County.

...Southeastern Wyoming into the Southern Nebraska Panhandle...
Westerly winds are expected to peak early and largely decrease into
the afternoon hours while the RH is forecast to continue falling
through the afternoon with diurnal heating.  Nevertheless, there
should be sufficient spatiotemporal overlap of strong winds (~20
mph) and low RH (~15%) to warrant a critical delineation for
portions of southeastern Wyoming, especially considering atypical
fuel conditions for this time of year (i.e., ERC and 100-h fuel
moisture values around the 90th percentile).

...Portions of North-Central Montana...
Despite relatively cool conditions (highs largely in the 50s F),
strong winds just above the surface coupled with diurnal
heating/mixing is likely to result in strong/gusty winds.  As the
morning inversion erodes, RH values are expected to fall to
near-critical values, leading to elevated fire weather conditions
across the region.

...Potential heavy rainfall for portions of eastern Texas and the
Pacific Northwest may impact travel for the Thanksgiving holiday...


17Z Update: The deterministic guidance is in above average
agreement through the end of the week on the synoptic scale
pattern, with the main difference being a slightly more amplified
CMC solution with the building trough over the Midwest and Ohio
Valley, and a stronger upstream ridge over the northern Plains.
Except for the East Coast region where the UKMET is stronger with
the offshore upper low, this model is also in good agreement
across most of the nation.  By the weekend, the CMC is stronger
with a northern stream shortwave tracking towards the Great Lakes,
and this stronger solution does not have as much ensemble support
as the GFS and ECMWF.  One of the main changes for this forecast
cycle was increased QPF downwind of the Great Lakes given greater
prospects for lake effect snow owing to strong cold air advection
in place.  The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/ECENS blend through Friday, and then mainly
GFS/ECMWF and their respective means for Saturday through Monday.
The previous forecast discussion is appended below for reference.
/Hamrick


...Overview...

Amplified and elongated troughing across the Central U.S. should
be splitting into two separate streams as the medium range period
begins. The southern energy should drop southward and linger
off/over Baja California through next weekend while the northern
energy closes off a low over the Great Lakes and shifts into
eastern Canada. Additional energy from Canada should act to reload
and amplify the trough over the eastern U.S. by early next week as
upper level ridging builds across the Northwest/Rockies the second
half of the period.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A closed low off the Northeast coast may hang around for a day or
two before it weakens and the energy becomes absorbed by northern
stream energy from the West. With this, the latest suite of
guidance shows reasonable agreement in the large scale as a low
closes off over the Great Lakes, with only some minor
timing/placement differences. There's more uncertainty with
secondary energy diving into the western fringe of the trough (CMC
much stronger than the GFS/ECMWF) and then evolution and detail
differences as the trough re-amplifies over the East day 6-7. The
models actually show really good agreement with the southern
stream closed low over Baja California which may try to inch into
the Southwest by next Monday. Elsewhere, there are some
differences in the East Pacific with the next trough towards the
West Coast with the CMC beginning to get out of phase with the
GFS/ECMWF and ensemble means.

WPC used a blend of the deterministic guidance (more weighting
towards the GFS and ECMWF) for days 3-5, with increasing
contributions from the agreeable ensemble means by late period
which should help mitigate the differences discussed above. This
combination helps maintain good continuity with the previous WPC
forecast for days 3-6.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moderate rainfall, possibly heavy at times, is expected over parts
eastern Texas into Thanksgiving Day. The guidance still shows the
best chance for heavy rainfall may be along the western Gulf
Coast/far south Texas where instability should be greatest and at
least a localized flood threat may develop. The degree of risk for
excessive rainfall will be dependent on the how quickly the cold
front progresses; if it slows or stalls the risk for local
flooding concerns will elevate. Less intense and more scattered
rain may extend northward along the cold front into parts of the
Lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys Thursday and
eventually the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Friday.

Shortwave energy should help direct an elongated plume of moisture
into the Pacific Northwest to produce terrain-enhanced, moderate
to heavy rain and mountain snows across eastern portions of
Washington and Oregon on Thanksgiving Day. Unsettled conditions
will persist across the West through the weekend, with the
precipitation weakening in intensity for a few days. The system to
follow has the possibility of ushering in another round of locally
heavy rains to the Pacific Northwest next weekend.

One day of near normal temperatures are expected over the East,
but after Thanksgiving temperatures should once again trend much
cooler from the Midwest into the East underneath of amplified
upper troughing. Periods of 10-15 below normal are possible from
the Gulf Coast to the Midwest/Ohio Valley on Friday, with
generally minus 5-10 degrees into the East next weekend.
Meanwhile, amplified troughing into the West will promote a
warming trend across the West and into the Plains through the
period. By next Sunday and Monday, daytime highs and morning lows
across the northern/central High Plains could be 10 to 20 degrees
above normal.

GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/ECENS blend through Friday, and then mainly
GFS/ECMWF and their respective means for Saturday through Monday.
The previous forecast discussion is appended below for reference.
/Hamrick


...Overview...

Amplified and elongated troughing across the Central U.S. should
be splitting into two separate streams as the medium range period
begins. The southern energy should drop southward and linger
off/over Baja California through next weekend while the northern
energy closes off a low over the Great Lakes and shifts into
eastern Canada. Additional energy from Canada should act to reload
and amplify the trough over the eastern U.S. by early next week as
upper level ridging builds across the Northwest/Rockies the second
half of the period.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A closed low off the Northeast coast may hang around for a day or
two before it weakens and the energy becomes absorbed by northern
stream energy from the West. With this, the latest suite of
guidance shows reasonable agreement in the large scale as a low
closes off over the Great Lakes, with only some minor
timing/placement differences. There's more uncertainty with
secondary energy diving into the western fringe of the trough (CMC
much stronger than the GFS/ECMWF) and then evolution and detail
differences as the trough re-amplifies over the East day 6-7. The
models actually show really good agreement with the southern
stream closed low over Baja California which may try to inch into
the Southwest by next Monday. Elsewhere, there are some
differences in the East Pacific with the next trough towards the
West Coast with the CMC beginning to get out of phase with the
GFS/ECMWF and ensemble means.

WPC used a blend of the deterministic guidance (more weighting
towards the GFS and ECMWF) for days 3-5, with increasing
contributions from the agreeable ensemble means by late period
which should help mitigate the differences discussed above. This
combination helps maintain good continuity with the previous WPC
forecast for days 3-6.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moderate rainfall, possibly heavy at times, is expected over parts
eastern Texas into Thanksgiving Day. The guidance still shows the
best chance for heavy rainfall may be along the western Gulf
Coast/far south Texas where instability should be greatest and at
least a localized flood threat may develop. The degree of risk for
excessive rainfall will be dependent on the how quickly the cold
front progresses; if it slows or stalls the risk for local
flooding concerns will elevate. Less intense and more scattered
rain may extend northward along the cold front into parts of the
Lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys Thursday and
eventually the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Friday.

Shortwave energy should help direct an elongated plume of moisture
into the Pacific Northwest to produce terrain-enhanced, moderate
to heavy rain and mountain snows across eastern portions of
Washington and Oregon on Thanksgiving Day. Unsettled conditions
will persist across the West through the weekend, with the
precipitation weakening in intensity for a few days. The system to
follow has the possibility of ushering in another round of locally
heavy rains to the Pacific Northwest next weekend.

One day of near normal temperatures are expected over the East,
but after Thanksgiving temperatures should once again trend much
cooler from the Midwest into the East underneath of amplified
upper troughing. Periods of 10-15 below normal are possible from
the Gulf Coast to the Midwest/Ohio Valley on Friday, with
generally minus 5-10 degrees into the East next weekend.
Meanwhile, amplified troughing into the West will promote a
warming trend across the West and into the Plains through the
period. By next Sunday and Monday, daytime highs and morning lows
across the northern/central High Plains could be 10 to 20 degrees
above normal.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST November 22 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure and enhanced Pacific onshore flow is expec=
ted
to promote above-normal and possibly heavy precipitation and high sustained
winds over portions of the northwestern contiguous U.S. throughout week-2.
Prevailing mid-level northerly flow across the Bering Sea is anticipated to
bring much below normal temperatures across much of the Alaska Mainland
through
the middle of the outlook period. East of the Rockies, more tranquil
conditions
are favored for the lower 48 heading into December.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for parts western Mainland
Alaska, Tue-Thu, Nov 30-Dec 2.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for the Alaskan Mainland and
parts of the Aleutians, Tue-Sat, Nov 30-Dec 4.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the Pacific Northwest and northern
California, Tue-Mon, Nov 30-Dec 6.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the Northern Rockies, Tue-Sat, Nov
30-Dec 4

Slight risk of high winds for the Pacific Northwest, Northern Intermountain=

FOR TUESDAY NOVEMBER 30 - MONDAY DECEMBER 06: Towards the end of November,
there is good agreement among the dynamical models favoring the break-down =
of
a
500-hPa blocking ridge to the south of Greenland, which is expected to allo=
w
for a more transitional mid-level height pattern across the CONUS during
week-2. Both the GEFS and ECMWF mid-level height forecasts show the weakeni=
ng
of anomalous troughing across the eastern CONUS, with the development of
positive height departures overspreading much of the CONUS and promote near=
 to
above-normal temperatures coast to coast during week-2. Upstream however, m=
uch
of anomalous mid-level troughing focused across the northeastern Pacific is
anticipated to shift southeastward, leading to enhanced onshore flow and
possible atmospheric river activity across the West Coast by the outset of =
the
period. Farther north, there has been good run-to-run continuity in the mod=
els
favoring the gradual development of anomalous mid-level ridging over wester=
n
Mainland Alaska by the middle of the period, though the persistence of
mid-level northerly flow looks to maintain an elevated potential for hazard=
ous
cold for the western Mainland heading into December.



Late in week-1, surface low and frontal activity remains favored over the
northeastern Pacific bringing periods of above-normal precipitation over th=
e
northwestern CONUS. This is reflected in both the GEFS and ECMWF Integrated
Vapor Transport (IVT) tool which shows the continuation of increased moistu=
re
signals persisting into the week-2 period. There is agreement in the GEFS a=
nd
the ECMWF reforecast tools indicating at least a 20% chance of 3-day
precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches (1
inch)
over the Pacific Northwest (northern California) throughout the period, and=
 a
slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for the entirety of week-2. To
the
east, increased probabilities exist in the reforecast tools over the Northe=
rn
Rockies, prompting a separate slight risk area for heavy precipitation in t=
he
outlook through the middle of the period. The increased chances for
atmospheric
river activity supports the addition of a slight risk of high winds over th=
e
northwestern CONUS, which is also endorsed by the GEFS reforecast tool with=
 at
least a 20% chance of sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile through
the
middle of the period. Periods of heavy precipitation during week-2 may trig=
ger
localized flooding over parts of western Washington, where streamflow and s=
oil
moisture content are currently registering in highest percentiles due to
antecedent above-normal precipitation. Although localized flooding is possi=
ble
further south, the increased precipitation is likely to aid in continued
drought recovery for portions of western Oregon and northern California whe=
re
D0 to D4 conditions remain designated in the U.S. Drought Monitor. No heavy
snow hazards are posted in the outlook due to the absence of anomalous cold
signals in the model guidance over the northwestern CONUS, however high
elevation snowfall across the Sierra Nevadas, Cascades and Bitterroot
Mountains
cannot be ruled out given the abundance of available moisture forecast.



Over Alaska, models show a fairly amplified ridge/trough mid-level pattern
over
the northern Pacific that gradually shifts eastward with time. Tied to thes=
e
features, the prevailing northerly flow from the Bering Sea favors below
normal
temperatures throughout the state, where there is good agreement in the raw
GEFS and ECMWF ensembles showing mean temperature departures in excess of -=
20
degrees (F) focused across the western Mainland early in the period.
Reforecast
tools show at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the
15th
percentile and negative 20 degrees (F) to support the addition of a moderat=
e
risk of much below normal temperatures over the western Mainland from Nov 3=
0
to
Dec 2. A broader slight risk area for much below normal temperatures is iss=
ued
for the majority of Mainland and parts of the Aleutians where there is at
least
a 20% chance in the reforecast guidance for meeting this criteria through t=
he
middle of the period. Beyond this time, the mid-level pattern is expected t=
o
become more zonal, allowing for a moderation of temperatures throughout Ala=

towards the end of week-2.

0155 PM CST Mon Nov 22 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHEAST WYOMING INTO
THE NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHEAST COLORADO INTO
EXTREME NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO...

Portions of southeast Colorado and extreme northeast New Mexico were
upgraded to Critical given the expectation of a more favorable
surface wind/RH overlap. Some of the latest high-resolution model
guidance has come into consensus in depicting 20+ mph sustained
westerly surface winds overlapping with 10-15% RH for at least a few
hours during the afternoon. While the meteorological conditions are
borderline Critical across the region, fuels remain abnormally dry,
with ERCs forecast to exceed the 90th percentile, hence the
introduction of Critical highlights.

Elevated/Critical fire weather conditions are still expected across
eastern Wyoming into Nebraska. Latest guidance consensus continues
to suggest that 20-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds will
overlap with 10-20% RH for multiple hours during the afternoon. The
best chance for a Critical wind/RH overlap would be along the
Wyoming/Nebraska border, where finer fuels are drier relative to
points farther west.

Dry and breezy conditions are likely tomorrow afternoon across
portions of the Florida Panhandle into Georgia and South Carolina.
RH is expected to drop as low as 25-35% in places. While some light
rain has recently fallen across the region, abnormally dry
conditions have been observed over the past few weeks. However, the
overall surface wind field is expected to remain relatively weak.
Nonetheless, some of the finer fuels may dry sufficiently to support
a localized wildfire-spread threat wherever stronger winds may
develop. The lack of a more widespread 15+ mph sustained wind field
precludes the introduction of any fire weather highlights at this
time.

..Squitieri.. 11/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Mon Nov 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough with a slightly positive tilt is forecast to
move eastward across the Great Basin on Tuesday.  In response at the
surface, a trough of low pressure is expected to develop from
eastern North Dakota southwestward into northeastern New Mexico by
Tuesday afternoon.

...Southeastern Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle...
As the trough approaches, enhanced westerly low-level flow is
forecast to develop across the region.  While there is some
uncertainty among model solutions with regard to the amount of
vertical mixing and the exact placement of the surface pressure
trough, there is confidence in the dry, downslope flow regime for
critical fire weather conditions to develop across portions of
southeastern Wyoming and the western Nebraska Panhandle. Afternoon
RH values are likely to fall below critical thresholds with
sustained winds of 20 mph (gusting to over 30 mph).

...Portions of Southeastern Colorado, Southwestern Kansas,
Northeastern New Mexico, and TX/OK Panhandles...
Low-level flow will also be enhanced farther south across the
southern High Plains in advance of the approaching trough.  Diurnal
heating in the presence of a dry airmass will result in rapid drying
and vertical mixing.  Afternoon RH values are expected to fall below
20% with surface winds approaching 20 mph.  Fuels are unusually dry
for this time of year, elevating the fire weather concerns.

...Holiday travelers thankful as Thanksgiving week kicks off on a
tranquil note across much of the Lower 48...

...Wet and snowy conditions in the Northwest; Lake effect snow
showers in the Great Lakes...

...Scattered rainfall and thunderstorms begin over Southern Plains
and Mississippi Valley Wednesday night...

...Chilly temperatures in the East, warmer trend in the Heartland;
Critical fire weather areas in the central High Plains and
Southern California...

A relatively quiet start to Thanksgiving week will give way to an
active period for portions of the Southern Plains and Mississippi
Valley by midweek. The departures of a pair of cold fronts in the
East will usher in a period of cooler weather across the eastern
third of the country over the next couple of days as high pressure
settles over the region. A shift to northwesterly winds across the
Great Lakes will generate Lake effect snow showers through Tuesday
afternoon before winds shift again ahead of an approaching system.
First freeze potential exists over parts of the interior Southeast
tonight and Tuesday night as temperatures are expected to drop to
between 15-20 degrees below average in some places.

Our main weather driver of the week will be a shortwave trough,
which is currently impacting the Pacific Northwest. Rain and snow
showers are forecast for the low elevations and mountains of the
Northwest respectively through Tuesday night. Several inches to
isolated amounts well over a foot of snow are expected for the
Northwest mountain ranges with marginal rainfall amounts likely
for lower elevations. As the upper-trough progresses eastward it
will dig into the Southwest and northern Mexico. High temperatures
will likely be between 15-20 degrees above average across portions
of the Great Plains and Upper Midwest as a result. Critical Fire
weather outlooks were issued for portions of the Central Plains
due to this warm up, drier air and windy conditions over the next
two days. This will lead to the development of scattered rain
showers and thunderstorms across the Southern Plains and
Mississippi Valley by Wednesday afternoon/evening. There's a
potential for heavy rainfall to impact portions of southeast Texas
on Thanksgiving day as the, now very amplified, upper trough over
northern Mexico taps into a rich repository of moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico and spreads across the surface cold front extending
from eastern Texas into the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley and
Midwest.

...Potential heavy rainfall for portions of eastern Texas and the
Pacific Northwest may impact travel for the Thanksgiving holiday...


17Z Update: The deterministic guidance is in above average
agreement through the end of the week on the synoptic scale
pattern, with the main difference being a slightly more amplified
CMC solution with the building trough over the Midwest and Ohio
Valley, and a stronger upstream ridge over the northern Plains.
Except for the East Coast region where the UKMET is stronger with
the offshore upper low, this model is also in good agreement
across most of the nation.  By the weekend, the CMC is stronger
with a northern stream shortwave tracking towards the Great Lakes,
and this stronger solution does not have as much ensemble support
as the GFS and ECMWF.  One of the main changes for this forecast
cycle was increased QPF downwind of the Great Lakes given greater
prospects for lake effect snow owing to strong cold air advection
in place.  The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/ECENS blend through Friday, and then mainly
GFS/ECMWF and their respective means for Saturday through Monday.
The previous forecast discussion is appended below for reference.

...Overview...

Amplified and elongated troughing across the Central U.S. should
be splitting into two separate streams as the medium range period
begins. The southern energy should drop southward and linger
off/over Baja California through next weekend while the northern
energy closes off a low over the Great Lakes and shifts into
eastern Canada. Additional energy from Canada should act to reload
and amplify the trough over the eastern U.S. by early next week as
upper level ridging builds across the Northwest/Rockies the second
half of the period.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A closed low off the Northeast coast may hang around for a day or
two before it weakens and the energy becomes absorbed by northern
stream energy from the West. With this, the latest suite of
guidance shows reasonable agreement in the large scale as a low
closes off over the Great Lakes, with only some minor
timing/placement differences. There's more uncertainty with
secondary energy diving into the western fringe of the trough (CMC
much stronger than the GFS/ECMWF) and then evolution and detail
differences as the trough re-amplifies over the East day 6-7. The
models actually show really good agreement with the southern
stream closed low over Baja California which may try to inch into
the Southwest by next Monday. Elsewhere, there are some
differences in the East Pacific with the next trough towards the
West Coast with the CMC beginning to get out of phase with the
GFS/ECMWF and ensemble means.

WPC used a blend of the deterministic guidance (more weighting
towards the GFS and ECMWF) for days 3-5, with increasing
contributions from the agreeable ensemble means by late period
which should help mitigate the differences discussed above. This
combination helps maintain good continuity with the previous WPC
forecast for days 3-6.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moderate rainfall, possibly heavy at times, is expected over parts
eastern Texas into Thanksgiving Day. The guidance still shows the
best chance for heavy rainfall may be along the western Gulf
Coast/far south Texas where instability should be greatest and at
least a localized flood threat may develop. The degree of risk for
excessive rainfall will be dependent on the how quickly the cold
front progresses; if it slows or stalls the risk for local
flooding concerns will elevate. Less intense and more scattered
rain may extend northward along the cold front into parts of the
Lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys Thursday and
eventually the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Friday.

Shortwave energy should help direct an elongated plume of moisture
into the Pacific Northwest to produce terrain-enhanced, moderate
to heavy rain and mountain snows across eastern portions of
Washington and Oregon on Thanksgiving Day. Unsettled conditions
will persist across the West through the weekend, with the
precipitation weakening in intensity for a few days. The system to
follow has the possibility of ushering in another round of locally
heavy rains to the Pacific Northwest next weekend.

One day of near normal temperatures are expected over the East,
but after Thanksgiving temperatures should once again trend much
cooler from the Midwest into the East underneath of amplified
upper troughing. Periods of 10-15 below normal are possible from
the Gulf Coast to the Midwest/Ohio Valley on Friday, with
generally minus 5-10 degrees into the East next weekend.
Meanwhile, amplified troughing into the West will promote a
warming trend across the West and into the Plains through the
period. By next Sunday and Monday, daytime highs and morning lows
across the northern/central High Plains could be 10 to 20 degrees
above normal.

...Potential heavy rainfall for portions of eastern Texas and the
Pacific Northwest may impact travel for the Thanksgiving holiday...


17Z Update: The deterministic guidance is in above average
agreement through the end of the week on the synoptic scale
pattern, with the main difference being a slightly more amplified
CMC solution with the building trough over the Midwest and Ohio
Valley, and a stronger upstream ridge over the northern Plains.
Except for the East Coast region where the UKMET is stronger with
the offshore upper low, this model is also in good agreement
across most of the nation.  By the weekend, the CMC is stronger
with a northern stream shortwave tracking towards the Great Lakes,
and this stronger solution does not have as much ensemble support
as the GFS and ECMWF.  One of the main changes for this forecast
cycle was increased QPF downwind of the Great Lakes given greater
prospects for lake effect snow owing to strong cold air advection
in place.  The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/ECENS blend through Friday, and then mainly
GFS/ECMWF and their respective means for Saturday through Monday.
The previous forecast discussion is appended below for reference.
/Hamrick


...Overview...

Amplified and elongated troughing across the Central U.S. should
be splitting into two separate streams as the medium range period
begins. The southern energy should drop southward and linger
off/over Baja California through next weekend while the northern
energy closes off a low over the Great Lakes and shifts into
eastern Canada. Additional energy from Canada should act to reload
and amplify the trough over the eastern U.S. by early next week as
upper level ridging builds across the Northwest/Rockies the second
half of the period.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A closed low off the Northeast coast may hang around for a day or
two before it weakens and the energy becomes absorbed by northern
stream energy from the West. With this, the latest suite of
guidance shows reasonable agreement in the large scale as a low
closes off over the Great Lakes, with only some minor
timing/placement differences. There's more uncertainty with
secondary energy diving into the western fringe of the trough (CMC
much stronger than the GFS/ECMWF) and then evolution and detail
differences as the trough re-amplifies over the East day 6-7. The
models actually show really good agreement with the southern
stream closed low over Baja California which may try to inch into
the Southwest by next Monday. Elsewhere, there are some
differences in the East Pacific with the next trough towards the
West Coast with the CMC beginning to get out of phase with the
GFS/ECMWF and ensemble means.

WPC used a blend of the deterministic guidance (more weighting
towards the GFS and ECMWF) for days 3-5, with increasing
contributions from the agreeable ensemble means by late period
which should help mitigate the differences discussed above. This
combination helps maintain good continuity with the previous WPC
forecast for days 3-6.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moderate rainfall, possibly heavy at times, is expected over parts
eastern Texas into Thanksgiving Day. The guidance still shows the
best chance for heavy rainfall may be along the western Gulf
Coast/far south Texas where instability should be greatest and at
least a localized flood threat may develop. The degree of risk for
excessive rainfall will be dependent on the how quickly the cold
front progresses; if it slows or stalls the risk for local
flooding concerns will elevate. Less intense and more scattered
rain may extend northward along the cold front into parts of the
Lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys Thursday and
eventually the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Friday.

Shortwave energy should help direct an elongated plume of moisture
into the Pacific Northwest to produce terrain-enhanced, moderate
to heavy rain and mountain snows across eastern portions of
Washington and Oregon on Thanksgiving Day. Unsettled conditions
will persist across the West through the weekend, with the
precipitation weakening in intensity for a few days. The system to
follow has the possibility of ushering in another round of locally
heavy rains to the Pacific Northwest next weekend.

One day of near normal temperatures are expected over the East,
but after Thanksgiving temperatures should once again trend much
cooler from the Midwest into the East underneath of amplified
upper troughing. Periods of 10-15 below normal are possible from
the Gulf Coast to the Midwest/Ohio Valley on Friday, with
generally minus 5-10 degrees into the East next weekend.
Meanwhile, amplified troughing into the West will promote a
warming trend across the West and into the Plains through the
period. By next Sunday and Monday, daytime highs and morning lows
across the northern/central High Plains could be 10 to 20 degrees
above normal.

...Holiday travelers thankful as Thanksgiving week kicks off on a
tranquil note across much of the Lower 48...

...Wet and snowy conditions in the Northwest; Lake effect snow
showers in the Great Lakes...

...Scattered rainfall and thunderstorms begin over Southern Plains
and Mississippi Valley Wednesday night...

...Chilly temperatures in the East, warmer trend in the Heartland;
Critical fire weather areas in the central High Plains and
Southern California...

A relatively quiet start to Thanksgiving week will give way to an
active period for portions of the Southern Plains and Mississippi
Valley by midweek. The departures of a pair of cold fronts in the
East will usher in a period of cooler weather across the eastern
third of the country over the next couple of days as high pressure
settles over the region. A shift to northwesterly winds across the
Great Lakes will generate Lake effect snow showers through Tuesday
afternoon before winds shift again ahead of an approaching system.
First freeze potential exists over parts of the interior Southeast
tonight and Tuesday night as temperatures are expected to drop to
between 15-20 degrees below average in some places, which may lead
to impacts to sensitive soils/crops.

Our main weather driver of the week will be a shortwave trough,
which is currently impacting the Pacific Northwest and the
sensible weather impacts it causes across the Southern Plains and
Mississippi Valley on Thanksgiving. Rain and snow showers are
forecast for the low elevations and mountains of the Northwest
respectively through Tuesday night. Several inches to isolated
amounts well over a foot of snow are expected for the Northwest
mountain ranges with marginal rainfall amounts likely for lower
elevations. The upper trough will dig into the Southwest and
northern Mexico over the next couple days. High temperatures will
likely be between 15-20 degrees above average across portions of
the Great Plains and Upper Midwest as a result. Critical Fire
weather outlooks were issued for portions of the Central Plains
due to the warm up, as drier air and windy conditions settle-in
over the next two days. The amplifying pattern will lead to the
development of scattered rain showers and thunderstorms across the
Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley by Wednesday
afternoon/evening. There's a potential for heavy rainfall to
impact portions of southeast Texas on Thanksgiving day as the, now
very amplified, upper trough over northern Mexico taps into a rich
repository of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and spreads it
along the surface cold front extending from eastern Texas into the
Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley and Midwest.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 28 - DEC 02, 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. Strong ridging over eastern Siberi=
a
is
forecast, leading to anticipated troughing downstream across Alaska.
Anomalous
ridging is likely farther to the south, across the western two-thirds of th=
e
CONUS. Mean troughing is predicted along the Eastern Seaboard.  In general,
these overall features are forecast to progress eastward and deamplify duri=
ng
the period. The ridge across the western CONUS early in the period is forec=
ast
to traverse across the central CONUS as the trough across the Eastern Seabo=
ard
pushes offshore. As the western ridge progresses eastward, enhanced Pacific
Flow is forecast to become more likely across the Pacific Northwest by the =
end
of the period.  The troughing over Alaska is forecast to persist throughout
the
duration of the period.

Persistent troughing forecast over Alaska leads to increased chances of bel=
ow
normal temperatures across most of the state, with probabilities exceeding =
70
percent for much of the western Mainland. Ridging over the western two-thir=
ds
of the CONUS favors above normal temperatures from the West Coast to the
Plains. Probabilities of above normal temperatures exceed 80 percent for pa=
rts
of the northern High Plains as the potential for downslope flow and associa=
ted
compressional warming exists early in the period. Conversely, troughing
predicted over the Eastern Seaboard leads to increased chances of below nor=
mal
temperatures for most of the eastern quarter of the CONUS, particularly ear=
ly
in the period.

The potential for enhanced Pacific Flow, particularly later in the period,
increases chances of above normal precipitation for the northwestern CONUS.
Ridging and surface high pressure are expected across much of the remainder=
 of
the CONUS, favoring below normal precipitation. An exception is for parts o=
f
the Southern Plains, where above normal precipitation chances are slightly
elevated ahead of a weak trough forecast over northern Mexico. Above normal
precipitation is likely for much of southeastern Alaska, ahead of a trough
predicted over the Gulf of Alaska. Offshore flow behind this trough leads t=

increased chances of below normal precipitation across western Alaska.

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
a good agreement on a predicted amplified 500-hPa flow pattern early in the
period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 30 - DEC 06, 2021

The potential for a significant pattern change exists for the week-2 period=
 as
the AO and NAO are both forecast to switch from negative to positive.
Agreement
is good early in the period between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means, with
troughs predicted across Alaska and the Eastern Seaboard, and a ridge forec=
ast
over the west-central CONUS.  Thereafter, model uncertainty increases
significantly with the potential pattern change as major model phasing
differences become evident by the middle of week-2.  Models are in agreemen=
t
on
a general de-amplification of the pattern with time. With this
de-amplification, enhanced Pacific Flow is forecast to become a more domina=
nt
feature across much of the West Coast. Upstream, strong troughing over Alas=
ka
is expected to persist early in the period, but weaken and push eastward by
the
end of week-2.

Increased chances of below normal temperatures are indicated for Alaska,
particularly early in the period. Ridging early in the period, and a genera=
l
low-amplitude pattern thereafter, leads to increased chances of above-norma=
l
temperatures across most of the CONUS west of the Appalachians. Near to bel=
ow
normal temperatures are favored east of the Appalachians as a trough predic=
ted
over the Eastern Seaboard early in the period pushes offshore. Near normal
temperatures are favored for the Pacific Northwest as above normal
temperatures
early in the period potentially gives way to a colder pattern as a trough
approaches from the northwest.

As the overall pattern transitions to a more zonal orientation, enhanced
Pacific Flow is increasingly likely across much of the West Coast.
Additionally, teleconnections from an upstream ridge predicted over the
Aleutians and trough forecast over the Gulf of Alaska both present a very
strong wet signal across much of the West Coast. Due to these factors,
above-normal precipitation is favored across most of the northwestern CONUS
and
southward along much of the West Coast, with probabilities exceeding 60
percent
for the Pacific Northwest.  Below normal precipitation is slightly favored =
to
the south and east from parts of the Southwest, northeastward to the Great
Lakes, due primarily to the ridging forecast early in the period. Below nor=
mal
precipitation is also favored for the Southeast and parts of the Mid-Atlant=
ic
due to surface high pressure predicted behind a departing trough. Above nor=
mal
precipitation probabilities are slightly elevated for the western Gulf Coas=
t
region, due to the potential for return flow moisture behind the predicted
surface high over the Southeast. Above normal precipitation is also favored
for
the Alaska Panhandle, as an active pattern and cyclonic flow is likely to
persist into week-2. A dry pattern is likely for western Alaska, due to the
potential for mean offshore flow behind the predicted trough axis.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=

Valid 12Z Fri Nov 26 2021 - 12Z Tue Nov 30 2021


...Overview...

The medium range should remain very amplified in the upper levels
through the entire period. A closed southern stream low over Baja
California looks to linger for a few days before weakening and
attempting to lift into the Southwest early next week. Meanwhile,
a closed low over the Great Lakes will lift into the Northeast
while additional energy from the west should act to reload and
amplify the trough over the eastern U.S. by early next week. Upper
level ridging will build across the Northwest/Rockies this weekend
and early next week as the next system approaches the West Coast
by Tuesday.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Latest guidance continues to show above average agreement on the
large scale flow through most of the period. The greatest
uncertainties in the forecast lie with reinforcing energy into the
East this weekend and early next week, where the guidance
continues to show varying solutions on the details and evolution
of the trough. The models indicate the potential for another
surface low to spin up and deepen off the Northeast Coast but
again, timing and strength of this low are an issue. The CMC is
the farthest north lifting the low towards the northwest across
Maine on Tuesday, which the ECMWF and GFS are notably farther
south and more offshore (GFS farthest offshore). The run to run
variability in the deterministic solutions remains all over the
place though so confidence in the specifics is low with this
system. The ensemble means are weaker, as expected, with the low
but do provide a nice middle ground solution at this time.
Elsehwere, there are also timing and amplitude differences with
the approaching trough into the West on day 7.

WPC used a general model blend for days 3-5, with increasing
contributions from the ensemble means by late period. This should
help to mitigate differences discussed above. This combination
maintains good continuity with the previous WPC forecast for days
3-6.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A cold front exiting the East coast as the period begins Friday
may continue to bring some light to moderate precipitation to
parts of the Northeast as well as the Great Lakes. Favorable
westerly flow over the still relatively warmer lakes should result
in at least modest lake effect snow accumulations mainly downwind
of Lakes Erie and Ontario on Friday into Saturday. Another weak
shortwave should help direct a plume of moisture into the Pacific
Northwest this weekend, possibly bringing another round of
moderate to locally heavy rains to parts of western Washington,
with the heaviest totals likely along favorable terrain. Lighter
precipitation should spill over into parts of the Northwest and
Rockies as well this weekend but quickly dry out early next week.
The remainder of the country should remain fairly dry through the
weekend and into next week. A weak system moving through the Ohio
Valley into the East may bring some light precipitation to the
region but nothing looks particularly impactful at this time.

A building trough over the East should keep temperatures below
normal through the entire five day period with the greatest
anomalies (-10 to -15F) likely on Friday into Saturday from south
Texas/lower Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley and
Mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, amplified ridging will promote a warming
trend across the West and into the Plains with several days of +10
to +20 anomalies (locally higher) likely, especially across parts
of the northern and central High Plains Sunday and Monday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN WYOMING INTO THE
WESTERN NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO
AND NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move eastward across the West today
bringing enhanced southwesterly to westerly flow aloft to much of
the High Plains.  At the surface, low pressure is forecast to deepen
over eastern South Dakota by late afternoon with a pressure trough
extending southwestward back to the southern Colorado-Kansas border.

...Eastern Wyoming, Southern South Dakota, and Northern Nebraska...
Enhanced westerly flow aloft overspreading the area will begin
mixing down to the surface as the boundary layer warms/deepens
through the day, resulting in strong and gusty winds.  Given the
very dry airmass in place (PW values less than 0.25"), RH values
will fall into the single digits over most of the area.  Critical
fire weather conditions are forecast over portions of southeastern
Wyoming into the western Nebraska Panhandle, where the best overlap
of strong winds (20-25 mph sustained westerlies with 40 mph gusts)
and low RH (<10%) is likely to occur during the afternoon hours.

...Adjacent Portions of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New
Mexico...
Similar fire weather conditions will also develop farther south.
The most likely overlap of low RH (<10%) and sustained 20 mph
surface winds is for favored downslope regions of southeastern
Colorado and northeastern New Mexico.  Farther east into the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles and Western Kansas/Oklahoma (i.e., east of
the surface trough), the RH values are likely to stay above critical
thresholds, though the strong pressure gradient there will favor
widespread southerly winds over 20 mph.  Given the relatively dry
fuels and lack of recent rainfall, elevated fire weather conditions
are likely.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
As an upper-level trough moves across the central U.S. on Wednesday,
an upper-level ridge is forecast to build into the Great Basin.  At
the surface, a low pressure system will move eastward across the
Great Lakes Region while an associated cold front extending
south-southwestward slowly advances eastward across the southern
Plains.  In the wake of this cold front, high pressure is forecast
to build over the central Great Basin enhancing the surface pressure
gradient across Southern California.

...Southern California...
Offshore flow will develop once again over Southern California by
early Wednesday morning.  By Wednesday afternoon, the upper-level
flow is forecast to be more northeasterly over Southern California
lending support to downslope, offshore flow.  Critical RH values
appear likely and sustained winds approaching 20 mph appear
probable, especially for terrain-favored locations.  Though the
event is forecast to peak Thursday morning, an upgrade to critical
may be warranted on Wednesday in later updates.

...Adjacent Portions of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New
Mexico...
In the wake of a cold frontal passage on Wednesday morning, strong
northerly winds (15-20 mph) are likely across portions of the High
Plains.  Initially, these strong winds will be coincident with low
RH values (<20%) until cooling and moistening raise the RH values in
the late afternoon. As a result, elevated fire weather conditions
are likely during the early afternoon.

...Holiday travelers thankful as a relatively tranquil stretch of
weather persists in the final days leading up to Thanksgiving...

...Chilly temperatures in the East, warmer in the Heartland;
Critical fire weather areas in the central High Plains...

...Unsettled weather in the Northwest, mountain snow in the
Southern Rockies; Swath of showers and thunderstorms from the
mid-Mississippi Valley to south Texas Wednesday night and
Thanksgiving morning...

With Thanksgiving just a couple days away, Mother Nature is
providing a suitable weather pattern for travelers for the vast
majority of the U.S. mainland through Wednesday night. This is due
to a dome of Canadian high pressure in control of the weather
pattern across much of the East. This high pressure system has
engulfed much of the eastern third of the U.S. in an air-mass more
akin to what is typically observed in the heart of the holiday
season. Freeze Watches and Warnings have been issued in parts of
the Southeast while Winter Weather Advisories remain in effect
downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario early this morning. Daytime
highs will struggle to get out of the 40s in the Northeast today
while much of the Southeast sees high temperature departures
ranging between 10 and 20 degrees below normal. Another chilly day
is on tap up and down the East Coast on Wednesday before warmer
temperatures arrive on Thanksgiving. Speaking of "warmer
temperatures", an upper level ridge of high pressure traversing
the Nation's Heartland is responsible for a surge in abnormally
warm conditions from the Southwest to the Midwest today. The
warmest daytime high departures will be centered in the central
Plains where highs range anywhere from 15 to 30 degrees above
normal. In addition, Critical Risks for fire weather and Red Flag
Warnings have been issued in parts of the Great Plains due to
favorable fire weather prospects today. This dramatic warm-up will
be short lived, however, as another intrusion of cold Canadian
high pressure plunges into the northern Rockies and Plains on
Wednesday, then sweeps across most of the Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley by Thanksgiving. Most of the Intermountain West
and West Coast will also see temperatures plunge to below normal
levels mid-week before returning to more seasonally warm levels by
Thanksgiving.

The main culprit for unsettled weather into the middle of the week
is an upper level disturbance tracking through the Northwest this
morning. It is ushering a stream of Pacific moisture into the
Pacific Northwest that is responsible for areas of coastal/valley
rain and mountain snow today. Most accumulations are forecast to
be on the lighter side, although some of the higher elevations
(Cascades, Bitterroots, Lewis Range, Tetons) could pick up as much
as a foot of snow by the time the snow subsides Wednesday evening.
Farther south, a cold front crossing through the southern Rockies
may lead to spotty showers and accumulating mountain snow Tuesday
night. The aforementioned Pacific Northwest disturbance will head
east and cause an area of low pressure to form over the Great
Lakes. As its trailing cold front advances east through the
nation's mid-section mid-week, this sets the stage for scattered
showers to breakout from the Lower Great Lakes to the South
Central U.S. Wednesday night. Some thunderstorms may also develop
in the southern Plains Wednesday night into early in the day on
Thanksgiving. Look for showers and thunderstorms to push into the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys later in the day on Thanksgiving with
locally heavy rainfall possible in southeast Texas. The regions
most likely to stay dry on Thanksgiving are the Southwest,
Intermountain West, Midwest, and much of the East Coast.

while much of the Southeast sees high temperature departures
ranging between 10 and 20 degrees below normal. Another chilly day
is on tap up and down the East Coast on Wednesday before warmer
temperatures arrive on Thanksgiving. Speaking of "warmer
temperatures", an upper level ridge of high pressure traversing
the Nation's Heartland is responsible for a surge in abnormally
warm conditions from the Southwest to the Midwest today. The
warmest daytime high departures will be centered in the central
Plains where highs range anywhere from 15 to 30 degrees above
normal. In addition, Critical Risks for fire weather and Red Flag
Warnings have been issued in parts of the Great Plains due to
favorable fire weather prospects today. This dramatic warm-up will
be short lived, however, as another intrusion of cold Canadian
high pressure plunges into the northern Rockies and Plains on
Wednesday, then sweeps across most of the Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley by Thanksgiving. Most of the Intermountain West
and West Coast will also see temperatures plunge to below normal
levels mid-week before returning to more seasonally warm levels by
Thanksgiving.

The main culprit for unsettled weather into the middle of the week
is an upper level disturbance tracking through the Northwest this
morning. It is ushering a stream of Pacific moisture into the
Pacific Northwest that is responsible for areas of coastal/valley
rain and mountain snow today. Most accumulations are forecast to
be on the lighter side, although some of the higher elevations
(Cascades, Bitterroots, Lewis Range, Tetons) could pick up as much
as a foot of snow by the time the snow subsides Wednesday evening.
Farther south, a cold front crossing through the southern Rockies
may lead to spotty showers and accumulating mountain snow Tuesday
night. The aforementioned Pacific Northwest disturbance will head
east and cause an area of low pressure to form over the Great
Lakes. As its trailing cold front advances east through the
nation's mid-section mid-week, this sets the stage for scattered
showers to breakout from the Lower Great Lakes to the South
Central U.S. Wednesday night. Some thunderstorms may also develop
in the southern Plains Wednesday night into early in the day on
Thanksgiving. Look for showers and thunderstorms to push into the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys later in the day on Thanksgiving with
locally heavy rainfall possible in southeast Texas. The regions
most likely to stay dry on Thanksgiving are the Southwest,
Intermountain West, Midwest, and much of the East Coast.

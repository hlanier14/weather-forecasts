...Bitterly cold wind chills in the northern Rockies and High
Plains today, more heavy mountain snow from the Sierra Nevada to
the central Rockies...

...Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall in Southern California today
and Thursday; urban and flash flooding possible...

...Spring-like weather to stick around in the South; Slight Risks
for severe storms and Excessive Rainfall posted in parts of the
Deep South today...

The continental U.S. remains under the influence of prolonged
troughing in the Intermountain West and ridging in the Southeast.
Beneath the troughing pattern in the West, chilly temperatures are
most common with dangerously cold wind chills located in the
Northern Plains. Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories were issued
from Montana and parts of the Dakotas to northern Minnesota where
wind chills will range anywhere from -30 to -50 degrees. In
addition to the cold, accumulating snowfall throughout the
mountain ranges of the West will be common with heavy
accumulations expected for some. The heaviest snow totals are
forecast from the southern Sierra Nevada and the Transverse range
of southern California to the Wasatch and central Rockies. Snow
totals in the highest peaks of these regions will be measured in
feet, which combined with whiteout conditions in these areas will
result in hazardous and, at times, impassable travel conditions.
Closer to southern California, a storm system rounding the base of
the upper trough in the West is funneling Pacific moisture into
the Los Angeles and San Diego metro areas. Excessive rainfall
potential is high enough to warrant a Slight Risk, meaning there
is a threat for flash flooding today and into Thursday. Lastly,
High Wind watches were posted for southern Wyoming this Thursday
as strong cross winds could make for hazardous travel conditions
for light weight and high profile vehicles.

Farther east, the anchored ridge atop the southeastern U.S. shows
no sign in relinquishing its spring-like regime in the South and
East-Central U.S.. Numerous record warm lows and highs are
anticipated from the Southeast coast to the Rio Grande of South
Texas today. More of the same is expected in the Southeast on
Thursday with highs in the 70s and lows that are 20 to 40 degrees
above normal. An Elevated Risk for fire weather is also in place
for portions of the southern High Plains today. In terms of
precipitation, moist southerly flow and increasing instability
levels will lead to an increasingly favorable environment for
severe weather. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced
Risk (threat level 3/5) for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
while a Slight Risk (threat level 2/5) stretches from southern
Arkansas to the southern Appalachians. Highly anomalous moisture
content also supports the threat for Excessive Rainfall, thus
leading to the issuance of a Slight Risk for the Tennessee Valley
today due to a heightened chance for localized flash flooding.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms will remain possible across a
broad portions of the South on Thursday, but the severe and flash
flood threat will be lower compared to today's threat. Meanwhile,
a little farther north, light rain and snow showers across the
Lower Great Lakes Wednesday evening. A coating to 2 inches is
possible from southern Iowa to the northern Illinois and Indiana
with a light but treacherous glaze of ice possible from northeast
Missouri to central Illinois and Indiana.

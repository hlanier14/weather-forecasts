Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1051 AM CST Tue Nov 16 2021

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EAST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO INTO TEXAS
SOUTH PLAINS...

A few adjustments to the northern High Plains area based on surface
observations. Areas of 40-50 mph sustained winds have already
developed in northwestern South Dakota and southwestern North
Dakota. Given these winds, fire conditions will be elevated even
with potentially marginally low RH. Portions of far southeastern
Wyoming and the Nebraska Panhandle have also been included as
observations are showing near-critical conditions in some locations.
The elevated and critical areas in the southern High plains remain
unchanged. Some mid/high-level clouds remain, but the critical area
is situated just south of cloud deck and should continue to warm
with increasing winds as the day progresses.

..Wendt.. 11/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CST Tue Nov 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a trough/upper low across the northern Rockies
will move eastward, ejecting onto the northern Plains by early
evening. At the surface, a lee low will develop across the southern
High Plains ahead of a fast-moving cold front associated with the
upper trough. Strong winds ahead of and behind the front will
support several areas of fire weather potential from the
northern/central Plains to the southern Rockies.

...Southern Rockies and High Plains...
As increasing mid-level flow ahead of the trough/upper low over the
northern Rockies spreads eastward, dry westerly flow is forecast to
increase through the day. Unseasonably warm temperatures and ongoing
dry conditions across much of the southern Rockies/High Plains will
favor widespread diurnal minimum relative humidity values of 8-15%.
Coincident with the decreasing humidity, surface winds will
strengthen to 15-20 mph in response to increased momentum transfer
from deep vertical mixing and growing flow aloft. Widespread
elevated fire weather conditions appear likely given the favorable
overlap of dry and windy conditions with dry fuels across portions
of southern CO, eastern NM, and western OK/TX.

A corridor of enhanced 850-700 mb flow also appears likely to
develop across portions of eastern NM and west TX ahead of the
southern branch of the approaching trough, as well as in response to
tightening surface pressure gradients behind the developing lee low.
Here, winds of 25-35 mph and greater gusts appear likely through the
afternoon and into the evening. Given the presence of very warm/dry
surface conditions along with the stronger winds, high confidence
exists in the development of widespread critical fire weather
conditions within this zone.

...Central High Plains...
Less certainty exists on the potential for fire weather conditions
ahead of and behind the fast-moving cold front sweeping south across
the central High Plains. Very strong surface winds with gusts of 40+
mph are expected from eastern WY through portions of NE and SD.
However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the development
of low relative humidity across the region. Cloud cover ahead of the
front may limit diurnal minimum RH to around 25%. This suggests
coverage and duration of elevated fire weather conditions may be
limited. However, given the presence of at least marginally
supportive fuel loads and very strong winds, an elevated area was
added to account for brief elevated fire weather potential.

Behind the front, rapidly cooling surface temperatures and cloud
cover may also limit the coverage and duration of low relative
humidity, mainly across portions of northern/western SD. Here,
surface RH should quickly rise after frontal passage, before falling
again as the drier and cooler airmass moves in. At least brief
elevated fire weather conditions will be possible through early
evening, but forecast uncertainty on the coverage and duration of
sustained conditions remains high. Though winds will remain gusty,
fire weather concerns will diminish overnight as higher RH and
cooler temperatures settle in across portions of the central Plains.

...19Z Update...

Updated model guidance continues to indicate the potential for a
notable low pressure system developing and tracking across parts
of the East early next week. However, guidance remains variable
with timing and track details of the system. The consensus of the
00Z/06Z model cycle used for the most recent WPC forecast showed a
deepening mid-upper trough across the Midwest by Monday that
becomes negatively tilted across the Northeast on Tuesday, with
some guidance closing off a 500 mb low there. The 00Z ECMWF tended
to dig vorticity/energy the most and produces a farther southwest
surface low and slower associated cold front compared to
consensus, though it did have some support from some EC ensemble
members. The updated WPC forecast was a bit stronger with the
surface low given increasing confidence in a reasonably deep
system, and also slowed the front down across the Ohio Valley to
Northeast, which served to produce more QPF than the previous
forecast, though certainly not to the extent of the 00Z ECMWF.
Incoming 12Z models seem to have trended slightly faster overall,
reflecting continued uncertainty in the forecast for the system.

...Previous Discussion...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The overall forecast is consistent in advertising a transition
from relatively flat and progressive mean flow late this week to a
more amplified pattern during the weekend and early next week as a
deepening upper trough heads into the East downstream from a ridge
that moves into the West by Monday. The upper trough and a
possible embedded low may support potentially significant low
pressure that would affect portions of the East, and requires
monitoring given the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel week.
Meanwhile it looks increasingly likely that initially weak
southern stream Pacific energy will collect into an upper low to
the west/south of California. This feature may approach or reach
the southwestern U.S. by next Tuesday. The expected pattern will
produce two surges of chilly air over the eastern half of the
country, one during Friday-Saturday and another early next week,
while maintaining mostly above normal temperatures from the West
into parts of the High Plains.

After a lot of spread and variability over recent days, model
clustering is decent but still not ideal for the system expected
to reach just inland over the Pacific Northwest at the start of
the period early Friday. 12Z/18Z GFS runs and the 12Z ECMWF/CMC
provided the most comparable solutions through the 18Z cycle while
the 12Z UKMET was weak and suppressed. The new 00Z UKMET is closer
to the other models but the 00Z ECMWF has now become the
weak/south extreme.

Detail differences with this system's energy as well as for
upstream flow digging into the amplifying mean trough maintain a
fair degree of uncertainty for the specifics of one or more
surface lows and frontal systems over the central and eastern U.S.
from Saturday through Tuesday. This has supported a model/ensemble
mean blend approach to tone down differences and run-to-run
variability seen in the operational models. As for potentially
stronger development near the East Coast by day 7 Tuesday, thus
far there has been a decent signal for a storm system but within a
broad area encompassing the Great Lakes to Mid-Atlantic through
the Northeast, Canadian Maritimes, and western Atlantic. At this
time an intermediate surface low position just off southeastern
New England as of 12Z Tuesday provides a reasonable starting point
relative to the models/ensemble means. This is somewhat closer to
the ECMWF mean that has been fairly stable over its past three
runs in contrast to the GEFS mean that has trended southward since
yesterday (but has been steady near the southern tip of Nova
Scotia in the past 12 hours of runs). The 12Z CMC mean was well
offshore with the surface low but the new run has trended farther
northwest for early Tuesday. The southern track of the 12Z ECMWF
deep upper low near the East Coast led to some 500mb height
anomalies of 5-6 standard deviations below normal while the
anomalies in other models are somewhat less extreme. The new 00Z
ECMWF is a tad weaker as of early Tuesday.

Question marks upstream late in the period involve the next
Pacific shortwave scheduled to arrive into the West around late
Monday-Tuesday, along with what becomes of the upper low expected
to form offshore from the southwestern U.S.  Consensus indicates
the 12Z CMC was too amplified with the northern stream shortwave
and indeed the new 00Z run has toned it down somewhat. Prior
GFS/CMC runs were fastest to eject the upper low energy into the
West and the new 00Z runs have trended slower.

Best model clustering favored use of the 12Z ECMWF/CMC and 18Z GFS
as the basis of the updated forecast early in the period. Ongoing
detail uncertainties with shortwaves digging into the eventual
eastern U.S. trough and eventual straying of the 12Z CMC from
consensus recommended a transition to a mix of the 18Z GEFS/12Z
ECMWF means with lingering input of the 12Z ECMWF/18Z GFS.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system forecast to reach the Northwest by early Friday should
spread light to moderate rain/mountain snow from the northern half
of the West Coast through the northern Rockies. After Friday much
of the West will see multiple dry days aside from some moisture
returning to the northern Pacific Northwest Sunday onward and
possibly some scattered precipitation reaching southern parts of
the West by Tuesday ahead of the upper low that forms southwest of
California. The eastern Great Lakes could see some lingering lake
effect activity on Friday. Expect precipitation to expand in
coverage over the eastern half of the country from Sunday onward
in association with one or more surface lows/frontal systems. It
is too early to resolve detailed effects from low pressure that
may be near the East Coast by next Tuesday but significant
rain/snow and strong winds could be possible. At this time the
relatively higher potential for meaningful snow extends from the
central Appalachians through interior New England. The broad
cyclonic circulation and cold air may produce some lake
effect/enhancement as well. Easterly flow from late week through
the weekend may promote periods of rain over the southern/eastern
parts of the Florida Peninsula.

Much of the eastern U.S. will see below normal temperatures Friday
into Saturday with some highs 10F or more below normal on Friday.
Another surge of chilly air will likely bring highs over the East
back down to 5-15F below normal next Monday-Tuesday. Anomalies
could trend colder depending on the ultimate depth of the upper
trough crossing the region. On the other hand the central/southern
High Plains may see highs up to 10-15F above normal Friday into
Saturday and again next Tuesday. Expect moderately above normal
temperatures over many areas from the Rockies to the West Coast
through the period.

...19Z Update...

Updated model guidance continues to indicate the potential for a
notable low pressure system developing and tracking across parts
of the East early next week. However, guidance remains variable
with timing and track details of the system. The consensus of the
00Z/06Z model cycle used for the most recent WPC forecast showed a
deepening mid-upper trough across the Midwest by Monday that
becomes negatively tilted across the Northeast on Tuesday, with
some guidance closing off a 500 mb low there. The 00Z ECMWF tended
to dig vorticity/energy the most and produces a farther southwest

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

Potential mid-level clouds remain a source of uncertainty in the
forecast, particularly within the central Plains. The strongest
winds are also expected to occur from mid-morning through early
afternoon, leading to some lack of phasing with the lowest RH. That
being said, only minor adjustments have been made to the ongoing
forecast. Dry and windy conditions could extend into eastern Kansas
and southern Nebraska, but duration and fuel receptiveness preclude
expansions in these areas. Fuels will generally be more receptive
across the combined Panhandles into western Oklahoma.

..Wendt.. 11/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CST Tue Nov 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
Troughing over the northern Plains will continue eastward reaching
the upper Midwest and Great Lakes by early evening Day2/Wednesday.
At the same time, shortwave ridging will develop over much of the
western US as strong mid-level flow retreats northward. At the
surface, a cold front will move south across the southern Plains,
approaching the Gulf Coast by sundown. Dry and windy conditions
supporting elevated fire weather potential are expected across
portions of the central and southern High Plains Day2/Wednesday.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Frontal passage early in the day across the southern Plains will
usher in a cooler and drier airmass across portions of western KS/OK
and the TX Panhandle. Steepening low-level pressure gradients will
support strong northerly winds of 20-30 mph through much of the day.
High-resolution ensemble guidance also suggests the cooling and
drying airmass will favor relative humidity values near 20%.
However, considerable uncertainty on the coverage and duration of
lower relative humidity remains, given model variability on cloud
cover and the cooler temperatures. Fuels remain marginally receptive
to fire spread suggesting that while overall forecast confidence
remains low, widespread strong wind gusts and near-criteria humidity
may support some elevated fire weather potential through the
afternoon.

...A deep low center over southern Canada will continue to produce
strong and locally damaging winds over portions of the northern
Rockies and northern Plains...

...Warm temperatures along with windy, dry conditions will result
in elevated to locally critical fire weather concerns over the
High Plains through midweek...

...A cold front will bring a threat of showers and thunderstorms
into the eastern U.S. Wednesday night through Thursday...

A very strong area of low pressure crossing southern Canada will
gradually weaken as it moves off to the east over the next couple
of days, but will still be capable of producing strong and locally
damaging winds across portions of the northern Rockies and
northern Plains going through tonight and Wednesday. Winds across
these areas may still reach as high as 60 to 70 mph, with locally
stronger gusts over the higher peaks of the northern Rockies. The
winds should gradually begin to subside by Wednesday night as
strong high pressure begins to nose over the region.

The same area of low pressure crossing southern Canada will also
allow for a strong cold front to advance east and south across the
Plains and the Midwest going through early Thursday. Warm
temperatures will be pooled out ahead of the front initially which
coupled with windy and dry conditions should lead to elevated to
locally critical fire weather concerns. The greatest wildfire
threat will generally be over the High Plains going through
Wednesday, but colder temperatures and diminishing winds
thereafter should reduce this threat.

Warm temperatures ahead of this cold front will spread from the
Plains east through the lower/middle Mississippi Valley and Ohio
Valley on Wednesday and reach the eastern seaboard on Thursday.
High temperatures for Wednesday and Thursday will be locally as
much as 20 degrees above normal, with temperatures returning to
slightly below normal behind the cold front.

Increasing southerly flow ahead of this front will allow moisture
to return north from the Gulf of Mexico and this will allow for a
broken axis of showers and thunderstorms to develop along the
front as it moves through the eastern U.S. Some post frontal
lake-effect rain and snow shower activity is expected to develop
over the Great Lakes region.

Elsewhere, there will be a set-up for some moist easterly flow
coming in off the Atlantic Ocean for south Florida going through
Thursday which will bring a threat of showers and perhaps some
locally heavy rainfall to coastal areas of southeast Florida.
Meanwhile, a new storm system will be approaching the Pacific
Northwest by late Thursday, and this will bring a new threat of
rain and higher elevation snowfall here as moisture streams inland.

may
bring heavy precipitation and high winds to the Alaska Panhandle at the
beginning of the period.

yvG6SYNm2i1$

FOR WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 24 - TUESDAY NOVEMBER 30: Surface high pressure acro=
ss
parts of the eastern CONUS is expected to continue from the end of week-1 i=
nto
the start of week-2 as a storm exits the Northeast. Therefore, a slight ris=
k
of
much below normal temperatures is posted for day 8 (Nov 24), where the GEFS
and
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatur=
es
falling to the lowest 15th percentile and below freezing. The likelihood fo=
r
much below normal temperatures decrease thereafter with the surface high
pressure moving eastward.



As the center of this surface high pressure moves offshore to the Atlantic =
on
day 9 (Nov 25), the orientation of this feature may support enhanced moistu=
re
from the Gulf of Mexico into parts of the eastern CONUS. Additionally, ther=
e
is
good agreement among the daily 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means =
as
well as the recent deterministic GFS and ECMWF solutions indicating a serie=
s
of
surface lows and frontal activity across the eastern CONUS as an amplified
mid-level trough propagates across the CONUS during week-2. Anticipated moi=
st
southerly flow from the Gulf of Mexico in combination with these predicted
surface disturbances across the eastern CONUS supports a slight risk of hea=
vy
precipitation across parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, eastern Texas,
Ohio
Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southern Appalachians, and the Southeast, Nov 24 =
to
27. There is good run to run model consistency in the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast
tools indicating at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding t=
he
85th percentile and one inch in the highlighted area. The uncalibrated ECMW=
F
ensemble 3-day precipitation totals of exceeding one inch is in good agreem=
ent
with these reforecast tools. Recent deterministic GFS and ECMWF runs show t=
he
potential for one of these surface lows intensifying as it tracks from the
Tennessee Valley to the Northeast towards the end of the period, which coul=
d
support heavy snow across parts of the Northeast. Due to inherent high
uncertainty regarding storm potential at this lead time and ensemble means =
not
supporting heavy precipitation across the region, a related heavy snow risk=
 is
not posted but will be monitored in the upcoming days.



Amplified mid-level troughing across Mainland Alaska from the beginning to
middle of the period supports a slight risk of much below normal temperatur=
es
across parts of the western Mainland. A slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is designated for parts of western mainland Alaska, where both
the
GEFS and ECMWF tools indicate at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures
falling to the lowest 15th percentile and below zero Deg F.



There is good multi-model depiction of a strong surface low forming over th=
e
Gulf of Alaska at the beginning of the period, which could bring heavy
precipitation to parts of the Alaska panhandle. A slight risk of heavy
precipitation is posted for the Alaska Panhandle, Nov 24 to 26 where the
reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of exceeding the 85th percentil=
e
and 2 inches. Localized higher elevation areas may experience heavy
precipitation in the form of snow. A heavy snow hazard is not specified due=
 to
inherent difficulty in identifying these specific areas. The orientation of
this storm may also support a tight pressure gradient along coastal portion=
s
of
the Alaska Panhandle and southeastern Mainland, resulting in localized high
winds. A slight risk of high winds is posted in these areas, Nov 25 to 26,
where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
exceeding the 85th percentile and 40 mph.

...19Z Update...

Updated model guidance continues to indicate the potential for a
notable low pressure system developing and tracking across parts
of the East early next week. However, guidance remains variable
with timing and track details of the system. The consensus of the
00Z/06Z model cycle used for the most recent WPC forecast showed a
deepening mid-upper trough across the Midwest by Monday that
becomes negatively tilted across the Northeast on Tuesday, with
some guidance closing off a 500 mb low there. The 00Z ECMWF tended
to dig vorticity/energy the most and produces a farther southwest
surface low and slower associated cold front compared to
consensus, though it did have some support from some EC ensemble
members. The updated WPC forecast was a bit stronger with the
surface low given increasing confidence in a reasonably deep
system, and also slowed the front down across the Ohio Valley to
Northeast, which served to produce more QPF than the previous
forecast, though certainly not to the extent of the 00Z ECMWF.
Incoming 12Z models seem to have trended slightly faster overall,
reflecting continued uncertainty in the forecast for the system.

See the previous discussion below for additional details and other
aspects of the forecast.

...Previous Discussion...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The overall forecast is consistent in advertising a transition
from relatively flat and progressive mean flow late this week to a
more amplified pattern during the weekend and early next week as a
deepening upper trough heads into the East downstream from a ridge
that moves into the West by Monday. The upper trough and a
possible embedded low may support potentially significant low
pressure that would affect portions of the East, and requires
monitoring given the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel week.
Meanwhile it looks increasingly likely that initially weak
southern stream Pacific energy will collect into an upper low to
the west/south of California. This feature may approach or reach
the southwestern U.S. by next Tuesday. The expected pattern will
produce two surges of chilly air over the eastern half of the
country, one during Friday-Saturday and another early next week,
while maintaining mostly above normal temperatures from the West
into parts of the High Plains.

After a lot of spread and variability over recent days, model
clustering is decent but still not ideal for the system expected
to reach just inland over the Pacific Northwest at the start of
the period early Friday. 12Z/18Z GFS runs and the 12Z ECMWF/CMC
provided the most comparable solutions through the 18Z cycle while
the 12Z UKMET was weak and suppressed. The new 00Z UKMET is closer
to the other models but the 00Z ECMWF has now become the
weak/south extreme.

Detail differences with this system's energy as well as for
upstream flow digging into the amplifying mean trough maintain a
fair degree of uncertainty for the specifics of one or more
surface lows and frontal systems over the central and eastern U.S.
from Saturday through Tuesday. This has supported a model/ensemble
mean blend approach to tone down differences and run-to-run
variability seen in the operational models. As for potentially
stronger development near the East Coast by day 7 Tuesday, thus
far there has been a decent signal for a storm system but within a
broad area encompassing the Great Lakes to Mid-Atlantic through
the Northeast, Canadian Maritimes, and western Atlantic. At this
time an intermediate surface low position just off southeastern
New England as of 12Z Tuesday provides a reasonable starting point
relative to the models/ensemble means. This is somewhat closer to
the ECMWF mean that has been fairly stable over its past three
runs in contrast to the GEFS mean that has trended southward since
yesterday (but has been steady near the southern tip of Nova
Scotia in the past 12 hours of runs). The 12Z CMC mean was well
offshore with the surface low but the new run has trended farther
northwest for early Tuesday. The southern track of the 12Z ECMWF
deep upper low near the East Coast led to some 500mb height
anomalies of 5-6 standard deviations below normal while the
anomalies in other models are somewhat less extreme. The new 00Z
ECMWF is a tad weaker as of early Tuesday.

Question marks upstream late in the period involve the next
Pacific shortwave scheduled to arrive into the West around late
Monday-Tuesday, along with what becomes of the upper low expected
to form offshore from the southwestern U.S.  Consensus indicates
the 12Z CMC was too amplified with the northern stream shortwave
and indeed the new 00Z run has toned it down somewhat. Prior
GFS/CMC runs were fastest to eject the upper low energy into the
West and the new 00Z runs have trended slower.

Best model clustering favored use of the 12Z ECMWF/CMC and 18Z GFS
as the basis of the updated forecast early in the period. Ongoing
detail uncertainties with shortwaves digging into the eventual
eastern U.S. trough and eventual straying of the 12Z CMC from
consensus recommended a transition to a mix of the 18Z GEFS/12Z
ECMWF means with lingering input of the 12Z ECMWF/18Z GFS.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system forecast to reach the Northwest by early Friday should
spread light to moderate rain/mountain snow from the northern half
of the West Coast through the northern Rockies. After Friday much
of the West will see multiple dry days aside from some moisture
returning to the northern Pacific Northwest Sunday onward and
possibly some scattered precipitation reaching southern parts of
the West by Tuesday ahead of the upper low that forms southwest of
California. The eastern Great Lakes could see some lingering lake
effect activity on Friday. Expect precipitation to expand in
coverage over the eastern half of the country from Sunday onward
in association with one or more surface lows/frontal systems. It
is too early to resolve detailed effects from low pressure that
may be near the East Coast by next Tuesday but significant
rain/snow and strong winds could be possible. At this time the
relatively higher potential for meaningful snow extends from the
central Appalachians through interior New England. The broad
cyclonic circulation and cold air may produce some lake
effect/enhancement as well. Easterly flow from late week through
the weekend may promote periods of rain over the southern/eastern
parts of the Florida Peninsula.

Much of the eastern U.S. will see below normal temperatures Friday
into Saturday with some highs 10F or more below normal on Friday.
Another surge of chilly air will likely bring highs over the East
back down to 5-15F below normal next Monday-Tuesday. Anomalies
could trend colder depending on the ultimate depth of the upper
trough crossing the region. On the other hand the central/southern
High Plains may see highs up to 10-15F above normal Friday into
Saturday and again next Tuesday. Expect moderately above normal
temperatures over many areas from the Rockies to the West Coast
through the period.

West and the new 00Z runs have trended slower.

Best model clustering favored use of the 12Z ECMWF/CMC and 18Z GFS
as the basis of the updated forecast early in the period. Ongoing
detail uncertainties with shortwaves digging into the eventual
eastern U.S. trough and eventual straying of the 12Z CMC from
consensus recommended a transition to a mix of the 18Z GEFS/12Z
ECMWF means with lingering input of the 12Z ECMWF/18Z GFS.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system forecast to reach the Northwest by early Friday should
spread light to moderate rain/mountain snow from the northern half
of the West Coast through the northern Rockies. After Friday much
of the West will see multiple dry days aside from some moisture
returning to the northern Pacific Northwest Sunday onward and
possibly some scattered precipitation reaching southern parts of
the West by Tuesday ahead of the upper low that forms southwest of
California. The eastern Great Lakes could see some lingering lake
effect activity on Friday. Expect precipitation to expand in
coverage over the eastern half of the country from Sunday onward
in association with one or more surface lows/frontal systems. It
is too early to resolve detailed effects from low pressure that
may be near the East Coast by next Tuesday but significant
rain/snow and strong winds could be possible. At this time the
relatively higher potential for meaningful snow extends from the
central Appalachians through interior New England. The broad
cyclonic circulation and cold air may produce some lake
effect/enhancement as well. Easterly flow from late week through
the weekend may promote periods of rain over the southern/eastern
parts of the Florida Peninsula.

Much of the eastern U.S. will see below normal temperatures Friday
into Saturday with some highs 10F or more below normal on Friday.
Another surge of chilly air will likely bring highs over the East
back down to 5-15F below normal next Monday-Tuesday. Anomalies
could trend colder depending on the ultimate depth of the upper
trough crossing the region. On the other hand the central/southern
High Plains may see highs up to 10-15F above normal Friday into
Saturday and again next Tuesday. Expect moderately above normal
temperatures over many areas from the Rockies to the West Coast
through the period.

...Potential continues for a strong cold front and significant
storm to affect the East early next week...

...Overview...

The expected large scale pattern evolution from the weekend into
the middle of next week remains on track. Guidance consensus shows
flat mean flow as of early Saturday steadily becoming more
amplified as a deepening upper trough heads into the eastern U.S.,
downstream from a Pacific upper ridge that reaches western Canada
and the northwestern U.S. by Monday. Within the eastern trough
most models continue to show an upper low closing off and taking a
path somewhere within an area from the Great Lakes/southern Canada
into New England, supporting fairly strong low pressure which
could undergo some redevelopment during the overall system's life
span. This storm remains a prominent weather focus due to its
timing right before Thanksgiving but it will likely still take a
while to resolve the details. Meanwhile the models and ensembles
still have an upper low developing southwest/south of California
during the weekend and early next week. This feature should open
up by Wednesday as a Pacific shortwave reaches the West by Tuesday
and additional energy could arrive thereafter. Overall Northern
Plains into western U.S. troughing should amplify at least a
little around midweek as another upper ridge builds over the
Eastern Pacific. The Northeast storm will usher in a brief cold
spell over the East during the first half of next week while the
West and parts of the High Plains will see variable but generally
above normal temperatures through Tuesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Relative to typical guidance spread and error for forecasts 5-7
days out in time, most models and ensemble means were fairly well
clustered for the eastern North America evolution as of the
12Z/18Z cycles. A somewhat less extreme/northward trend in ECMWF
upper low track, six-hourly GFS runs shuffling around the guidance
average, and a deeper trend in the ensemble means (leading to at
least an implied upper low if not a closed one such as depicted in
the new 00Z GEFS mean) have led to a forecast upper low track
across the upper/eastern Great Lakes and into New England. This
evolution reinforces a recent stronger trend for low pressure
between the Great Lakes and James Bay as of early Monday and a
slight northward adjustment from continuity for secondary
development over/near New England by Tuesday. CMC details have
differed somewhat. Taken as a whole, recent GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs
illustrate the possibilities of redevelopment and/or looping of
low pressure. The new 00Z ECMWF provides a significantly different
adjustment that would lessen effects over the Northeast.  It is
important to note that the upper dynamics supporting this system
are still within flow to the north/west of an upper low over
Alaska and historically models can have difficulty in resolving
important details of amplifying shortwaves from higher latitudes
until much closer to an event.

The GFS/ECMWF/UKMET along with the GEFS/ECMWF means are providing
the most common solution for the upper low that forms west/south
of California, with some opening/progression likely to occur after
early Tuesday. Including the new 00Z run, the CMC has been on the
eastern side of the guidance spread. A general model/mean average
is reasonable and consistent for the shortwave reaching the
Northwest and then the Plains Tuesday-Wednesday and for
downplaying uncertain shortwave details upstream (such as the
stronger 12Z ECMWF feature nearing the West Coast early Wednesday).

Based on the 12Z/18Z guidance comparisons, the updated forecast
started with the 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF along with some 12Z
UKMET for about the first half of the period and then transitioned
to a blend of those models along with the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The start of the weekend should be dry over much of the country
aside from rainfall persisting along the eastern Florida Peninsula
and some light snow over parts of the northern/central Rockies.
Expect precipitation to develop along and east of the Mississippi
Valley on Sunday ahead of a leading Plains front and trailing
strong cold front (anchored by southern Canada low  that catches
up. Most rain should be light to moderate given the frontal
progression but locally more intense activity may be possible.
Highest totals for Sunday-Sunday night should be in the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. From Monday onward the most likely
evolution of this system would bring more of an enhanced rainfall
threat to New England, ahead of the cold front/secondary low
development. The best snow potential would be in the cold air
behind the system to the lee of the Great Lakes and in
westward-facing terrain from the central Appalachians
northeastward. There is still enough uncertainty in system
evolution to allow for other possibilities regarding precipitation
types/amounts. Confidence is somewhat higher in the potential for
a period of brisk to strong winds behind the cold front sweeping
through the Plains into the East during Sunday-Monday and
continuing over the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast through
at least Tuesday. The Pacific Northwest into northern Rockies may
see mostly light precipitation during the first half of next week
with a shortwave arriving from the Pacific. The combination of
this energy aloft and the opening/progression of the upper low
southwest of California may spread some moisture into parts of the
West by Tuesday/Wednesday, but with low confidence for
precipitation coverage/amounts at this time.

The East will see chilly temperatures (mostly 5-10F below normal)
lingering into the early weekend. The next surge of colder air
will spread across the eastern half of the lower 48 Monday-Tuesday
with the broadest coverage of highs 10-15F below normal expected
on Tuesday. Some locations may also see morning lows 10F or so
below normal. The West into the central/southern High Plains will
see mostly above normal temperatures through Tuesday with the
warmest anomalies of plus 10-15F for highs likely over the High
Plains on Saturday (lingering into Sunday near the Rio Grande) and
again on Tuesday. The broader upper trough over the West by
Wednesday will likely bring highs down to near or slightly below
normal levels at that time.

least an implied upper low if not a closed one such as depicted in
the new 00Z GEFS mean) led to a forecast upper low track across
the upper/eastern Great Lakes and into New England. This evolution
reinforces a recent stronger trend for low pressure between the
Great Lakes and James Bay as of early Monday and a slight
northward adjustment from continuity for secondary development
over/near New England by Tuesday. CMC details have differed
somewhat. Taken as a whole, recent GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs illustrate
the possibilities of redevelopment and/or looping of low pressure.
The new 00Z ECMWF provides a significantly different adjustment
that would lessen effects over the Northeast.  It is important to
note that the upper dynamics supporting this system are still
within flow to the north/west of an upper low over Alaska and
historically the models can have difficulty in resolving important
details of amplifying shortwaves from higher latitudes until much
closer to an event.

The GFS/ECMWF/UKMET along with the GEFS/ECMWF means are providing
the most common solution for the upper low that forms west/south
of California, with some opening/progression likely to occur after
early Tuesday. Including the new 00Z run, the CMC has been on the
eastern side of the guidance spread. A general model/mean average
is reasonable and consistent for the shortwave reaching the
Northwest and then the Plains Tuesday-Wednesday and for
downplaying uncertain shortwave details upstream (such as the
stronger 12Z ECMWF feature nearing the West Coast early Wednesday,
eliminated in the new 00Z run).

Based on the 12Z/18Z guidance comparisons, the updated forecast
started with the 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF along with some 12Z
UKMET for about the first half of the period and then transitioned
to a blend of those models along with the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The start of the weekend should be dry over much of the country
aside from rainfall persisting along the eastern Florida Peninsula
and some light snow over parts of the northern/central Rockies.
Expect precipitation to develop along and east of the Mississippi
Valley on Sunday ahead of a leading wavy Plains front and trailing
strong cold front (anchored by northern tier U.S./southern Canada
low pressure) that catches up. Most rain should be light to
moderate given the frontal progression but locally more intense
activity may be possible. Highest totals for Sunday-Sunday night
should be in the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. From Monday onward the
most likely evolution of this system would bring more of an
enhanced rainfall threat to New England, ahead of the cold
front/secondary low development. The best snow potential would be
in the cold air behind the system, to the lee of the Great Lakes
and along westward-facing terrain from the central Appalachians
northeastward. There is still enough uncertainty in system
evolution to allow for other possibilities regarding precipitation
types and amounts. Confidence is somewhat higher in the potential
for a period of brisk to strong winds behind the cold front
sweeping through the Plains into the East, with such winds
continuing over the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into at
least Tuesday. The Pacific Northwest into northern Rockies may see
mostly light precipitation during the first half of next week with
a shortwave arriving from the Pacific. The combination of this
energy aloft and the opening/progression of the upper low
southwest of California may spread some moisture into parts of the
West by Tuesday/Wednesday, but with low confidence for
precipitation coverage/amounts at this time.

The East will see chilly temperatures (mostly 5-10F below normal)
lingering into the early weekend. The next surge of colder air
will spread across the eastern half of the lower 48 Monday-Tuesday
with the broadest coverage of highs 10-15F below normal expected
on Tuesday. Some locations may also see morning lows 10F or so
below normal. The West into the central/southern High Plains will
see mostly above normal temperatures through Tuesday with the
warmest anomalies of plus 10-15F for highs likely over the High
Plains on Saturday (lingering into Sunday near the Rio Grande) and
again on Tuesday. The upper trough over the West by Wednesday will
likely bring highs down to near or slightly below normal levels at
that time.

...Potential continues for a strong cold front and significant
storm to affect the East early next week...

...Overview...

The expected large scale pattern evolution from the weekend into
the middle of next week remains on track. Guidance consensus shows
flat mean flow as of early Saturday steadily becoming more
amplified as a deepening upper trough heads into the eastern U.S.,
downstream from a Pacific upper ridge that reaches western Canada
and the northwestern U.S. by Monday. Within the eastern trough
most models continue to show an upper low closing off and taking a
path somewhere within an area from the Great Lakes/southern Canada
into New England, supporting fairly strong Southern Canada into
Northeast U.S. low pressure which could undergo some redevelopment
during the overall system's life span. This storm remains a
prominent weather focus due to its timing right before
Thanksgiving but it will likely still take a while to resolve the
details. Meanwhile the models and ensembles still have an upper
low developing southwest/south of California during the weekend
and early next week. This feature should open up by Wednesday as a
Pacific shortwave reaches the West by Tuesday and additional
energy could arrive thereafter. Northern Plains into western U.S.
troughing should amplify at least a little around midweek as
another upper ridge builds over the Eastern Pacific. Eastern North
America low pressure and its trailing front will usher in a brief
cold spell over the East during the first half of next week while
the West and parts of the High Plains will see variable but
generally above normal temperatures through Tuesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Relative to typical guidance spread and error for forecasts 5-7
days out in time, most models and ensemble means were fairly well
clustered for the eastern North America evolution as of the
12Z/18Z cycles. A somewhat less extreme/northward trend in ECMWF
upper low track, six-hourly GFS runs shuffling around the guidance
average, and a deeper trend in the ensemble means (leading to at
least an implied upper low if not a closed one such as depicted in
the new 00Z GEFS mean) led to a forecast upper low track across
the upper/eastern Great Lakes and into New England. This evolution
reinforces a recent stronger trend for low pressure between the
Great Lakes and James Bay as of early Monday and a slight
northward adjustment from continuity for secondary development
over/near New England by Tuesday. CMC details have differed
somewhat. Taken as a whole, recent GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs illustrate
the possibilities of redevelopment and/or looping of low pressure.
The new 00Z ECMWF provides a significantly different adjustment
that would lessen effects over the Northeast.  It is important to
note that the upper dynamics supporting this system are still
within flow to the north/west of an upper low over Alaska and
historically the models can have difficulty in resolving important

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CST Wed Nov 17 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a broad area of cyclonic flow associated with an
upper low/trough across southern Manitoba will move eastward across
the central US through the day. A cold front trailing south from the
upper low will sweep through the Plains early this morning, reaching
the Gulf Coast by late evening. To the west, shortwave ridging will
quickly build over the Great Basin and Pacific Coast. Brief elevated
fire weather conditions will be possible within the dry and windy
airmass behind the front across portions of the central and southern
Plains.

...Central and southern Plains...
Current forecast and observational trends place the cold frontal
position roughly from northeastern KS, through northwestern OK, and
into the TX Panhandle by 12z this morning. To the north of the
front, strong northerly winds of 20-30 mph will develop early in the
day and continue through mid afternoon. As the front accelerates
southward, surface pressure gradients and winds will gradually
diminish through late afternoon and early evening.

Advection of a drier airmass behind the front may support a few
hours of lower relative humidity across portions of western KS/OK
and the TX Panhandle. While still uncertain given potential for
lingering cloud cover, high-resolution ensemble guidance shows
humidity values may fall to 20-25% by mid to late afternoon. This
suggests some potential misalignment with the strongest diurnal
winds. However, the potential for at least a few hours of elevated
to near critical fire weather conditions, coincident with drying
fuels, warrants the continuation of elevated fire weather
probabilities across portions of the central and southern Plains.
Fire weather concerns will quickly diminish after sunset as winds
weaken and higher humidity recoveries develop.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0137 AM CST Wed Nov 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
As the upper low/trough across southern Canada continues east, the
shortwave ridge over the western US will shift eastward and
gradually weaken as the upper-level flow pattern trends more zonal.
Cooler and drier conditions behind the recent cold front will
continue, as surface high pressure moves over the southern Plains.
Daytime surface RH values may fall to as low as 15% across portions
of the southern High Plains where southerly winds are expected to
return later in the day. The ongoing dry conditions may briefly
overlap with breezy conditions across the southern High Plains where
slightly stronger surface flow may develop late in the period.
However, any elevated fire weather conditions will likely be brief
and localized, keeping overall fire weather concerns low.

...Strong and gusty winds across the northern Plains will
gradually moderate as deep low in southern Canada weakens and
moves away...

...A cold front will bring a around of rain through the eastern
U.S. for the next couple of days followed by colder temperatures
and lake-effect snow/rain over the Great Lakes...

...Tropical moisture will bring some enhanced rainfall across
southern Florida on Thursday...

A deep low pressure system moving across southern Canada will
gradually weaken as it heads towards eastern Canada during the
next couple of days.  Strong and gusty winds across the northern
Plains will gradually moderate today and should have largely
subsided by Thursday as a high pressure ridge takes over.
Meanwhile, mild air across the Deep South through the Ohio Valley
will be pushed into the eastern U.S. and up through New England
following the passage of a warm front.  High temperatures for
Wednesday and Thursday will be locally as much as 20 degrees above
normal in the eastern U.S.  A cold front will then push steadily
through the eastern U.S. on Thursday and then off into the
Atlantic by Friday morning.
Increasing southerly flow ahead of this front will allow moisture
to return north from the Gulf of Mexico and this will allow for an
axis of showers and some thunderstorms to develop.  Cold air
behind the front will set up some lake-effect rain and snow
showers the Great Lakes region.

Meanwhile, a new storm system will be approaching the Pacific
Northwest by late Thursday, and this will bring a new threat of
rain and higher elevation snowfall here as moisture streams inland.

Elsewhere, tropical moisture from the western Caribbean Sea will
be lifted northward ahead of a weak upper-level trough moving into
the Gulf of Mexico.  Some enhanced rainfall can be expected to
move across southern Florida mainly on Thursday.  By Friday
morning, much of the rain should be on its way eastward into the
Atlantic as a cold front reaches northern Florida.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1012 AM CDT Sun Apr 04 2021

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
necessary based on the latest observed trends and morning guidance.
The central/southern High Plains remain the most likely region to
see persistent/widespread elevated, to potentially critical, fire
weather conditions. To the north, elevated conditions remain
probable for northern MT, but increasing cloud cover maintains
uncertainty for the western Dakotas (though pockets of elevated
conditions may develop this afternoon). While dry conditions (RH
between 15-25%) will overspread portions of IA/MN/WI, as well as
much of the East Coast and Southeast, winds should remain too light
to warrant additional highlights.

..Moore.. 04/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0130 AM CDT Sun Apr 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge across most of the country will continue to
slowly shift east today. The ridge will begin to erode from the west
as a shortwave trough moves into the Pacific Northwest. Some
increasing flow across the northern/central Rockies will help a
surface trough in the Plains to the east.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
With the southeastern surface high maintaining some strength
tomorrow, increasing winds within the lowest 2-3 km will promote
15-25 mph winds from northeastern New Mexico into western Kansas.
Dry south-southwesterly winds tend to limit moisture return into the
area as compared to points eastward. RH will likely fall to 15-20%
with low teens locally, perhaps. Elevated conditions are probable
with locally critical conditions possible.

...Montana...
Increasing mid/high-level cloud cover will tend to limit heating
during the afternoon. However, dry low-level conditions will remain
with modest westerly surface winds. RH may fall under 20% in
localized areas, but will generally be 20-25% for a majority of
northern/northeastern Montana. Models have continued to trend
downward in terms of wind speeds. The greatest chance for sustained
elevated conditions will likely be in terrain-favored locations.

...Western Dakotas...
Dry air will remain across the region tomorrow with RH of 15-20%
expected. Winds will be more questionable than previous days.
However, some guidance shows a weak surface low developing in the
northern High Plains vicinity which could locally enhance surface
winds. Elevated conditions may be sustained for a few hours
conditional on the strength of the surface trough/weak low.

...Northeast Iowa into Western Wisconsin...
A warm front will lift northward through the region tomorrow
morning. Low-level winds will continue to strengthen as the trough
deepens to the west. Despite moisture increasing during the day, the
primary surge will likely be late. This could leave a narrow window
where elevated conditions exist at least briefly. RH of 20-25% may
occur, but there is a wide range of values forecast in guidance.
Even with the drier solutions tending to perform well as of late,
the limited spatial extent, duration, and increasing cloud cover
precludes highlights this outlook.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 PM CDT Sun Apr 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN ARIZONA...

The main changes for this update were to introduce a critical risk
area to northern Arizona and an elevated risk area to portions of
New England. Additional expansions of the western elevated risk area
were also made based on trends in recent guidance.

...northern Arizona...
Fuel reports from USFS and local weather offices indicate that fine
fuels across the region are more receptive than perhaps suggested by
some fuel analyses and should support fire spread. Additionally,
recent guidance maintains a corridor of stronger winds from
southeastern NV into northern AZ/southern UT. With widespread RH
values in the low teens likely, the probability of sustained
critical wind/RH conditions over receptive fuels has increased
enough to introduce the critical risk area.

...New England...
Recent reports from the Northeast suggest that fuels are largely
receptive after several days of very dry conditions (RH values in
the 15-30% range are noted and are likely again tomorrow). A
migratory cyclone off the New England coast is forecast to meander
closer to shore as it gradually weakens over the next 24 hours. This
will induce breezy offshore flow at 15-20 mph from eastern PA into
the VT/NH/MA region. Elevated fire weather conditions appear
probable across the region, as supported by recent ensemble
guidance.

..central Plains...
Windy conditions are expected immediately following a cold frontal
passage around mid-day. Cold air advection behind the front may not
be particularly strong and allow diurnal heating to warm
temperatures enough to support RH values near 20%. While elevated
fire weather conditions are possible, notable spread in the RH
forecast (as well as the timing/progression of the front) introduce
enough uncertainty to preclude an additional risk area.

..Moore.. 04/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0221 AM CDT Sun Apr 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough within the Pacific Northwest will progress to
the southeast during the day, Monday. Mid-level winds will intensify
across the central/southern Great Basin into the Southwest. At the
surface, a front will accompany the trough and reach the Four
Corners by the end of the period. Farther east, a surface cyclone
will deepen along the Kansas/Colorado border.

...Central/Southern Great Basin...
Strong mid-level winds along the southern flank of the approaching
trough will overlap an increasing surface pressure gradient ahead of
the front approaching from the northwest. Winds of 20-25 mph will be
possible, particularly in eastern Nevada into western Utah.
Terrain-favored areas will also see higher winds. RH of 10-20% is
likely during the afternoon. While these critical meteorological
conditions will exist, fuels in most locations still appear
marginally receptive to fire spread.

...Southwest and Southern High Plains...
Mid-level winds will also increase across parts of Arizona as a
southern stream jet moves eastward during the day. There is some
question as to the duration of strong surface winds with southern
extent, but most areas into central Arizona will likely see 15-20
mph with locally higher values possible. RH will be similarly low at
10-20%. Given the ongoing drought, there will be areas of dry fuels
even though ERCs are near normal in most locations. Elevated
conditions will likely extend into New Mexico and southeastern
Colorado with the deepening High Plains surface low. Mid-level winds
will be weaker that far east, which should keep the potential for
critical conditions lower.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest model guidance this morning made some notable adjustments
to the overall pattern evolution across the U.S. during the
medium-range period as the upper-level flow gets increasingly
blocky across Canada by next weekend.  The main areas of concern
are (a) the eventual status of a low pressure system forecast to
move across the Midwest/Ohio Valley to the Great Lakes, and (b)
timing of various upper-level troughs/shortwaves forecast to move
into the Pacific Northwest.

Early in the period, there continues to be decent clustering for
the upper low forecast to track over the Plains/Midwest.
Meanwhile, the ECMWF has sped up the arrival of an upper-level
trough from the northeastern Pacific into the west coast of Canada
in excellent agreement with the GFS cluster.  The faster forward
motion of this upper trough eventually leads to its greater degree
of interaction with the low pressure system moving into the Great
Lakes by late next week.  The ECMWF now shows this system lifting
across the Great Lakes ahead of upper trough approaching from the
west by next Friday--more in line an idea that the GFS has been
advertising.  The CMC shows a similar trend as well.  By next
weekend, forecast uncertainty further increases as ensemble means
show agreement on the formation of an omega block over eastern
Canada.

The WPC medium-range forecast package generally followed these
latest guidance changes.  This resulted in a noticeable departure
from WPC continuity regarding the track of the low pressure system
moving across the Great Lakes from Day 5 onward together with a
faster eastward push of colder air across the Canadian prairies
into the northern Plains.  The low is forecast to slowly weaken or
perhaps dissipate over the Great Lakes as the omega block sets up
over eastern Canada.  Meanwhile, a low pressure wave could linger
near the North Carolina coast and could begin to develop next
weekend.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Some locally heavy rain may occur over parts of the Midwest around
midweek, near the upper low and associated surface system
affecting the region.  Other areas of enhanced rainfall will be
possible along the trailing front--most likely from near the
south-central Mississippi Valley toward the southern Appalachians
on Wednesday.  The lingering front may provide a focus for
additional showers and thunderstorms over parts of the South
through at least Friday or Saturday.  Many other portions of the
eastern U.S. will also see one or more days of rain with varying
intensity.  The Northwest should see periods of rain and mountain
snow, with highest totals likely over favored terrain in the
Olympics and Washington Cascades.

Locations from the Midwest into Ohio Valley and Great Lakes will
see well above normal temperatures during mid-late week.  Morning
lows should be particularly anomalous with some areas seeing a day
or two of 20-25F above normal readings.  Warmest highs should be
10-20F above normal but they should tend to cool off some by the
weekend.  Clouds and precipitation should keep min temperatures
above normal over the East into the weekend.  Expect Texas to be
very warm to hot during the period with highs 10-20F above normal
most days.  Above normal temperatures initially over a majority of
the West will likely give way to below normal conditions
penetrating further across the Northwest into northern Rockies.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun April 04 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Much warmer than average temperatures in the western and
central U.S. will support Elevated Risks of fire weather...

...Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will produce showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the Upper Midwest, the Plains, and
Ohio Valley overnight Monday into Tuesday...

The Southwestern to Upper Midwest will experience temperatures 15
to 25 degrees above average as a broad upperlevel ridge takes
shape through Tuesday evening.  The Desert Southwest should see
temperatures in the upper 90s and nearing 100 degrees, while 80s
are forecast for Northern Plains and the Central/Southern High
Plains. Additionally, several daily high-temperature records could
be set. These warm temperatures combined with dry soils, low
relative humidity, and gusty winds will lead to the potential for
fire weather. Per the SPC, Fire Weather Outlook indicates an
Elevated Risk across parts of Montana and Central High Plains. On
Monday, the risk will be Critical over portions of Nevada into the
Four Corners region.  Meanwhile, parts of Southern New England and
northern Mid-Atlantic will have an Elevated Risk.

In the meantime, a front extending from the Northern High Plains
southwestward to the northern California coast will slowly move
eastward to the Northern/Central Plains roughly southwestward to
the Southwest U. S. by Tuesday evening.  The associated
upper-level trough will help produce higher elevation snow and
rain over parts of the Northwest into the Northern Intermountain
Region.  Overnight Sunday, snow will develop over parts of the
Northern Rockies that will slowly move southeastward into parts of
the Central Rockies later Tuesday morning.  The snow will continue
over the Central Rockies and trickle into parts of the Central
High Plains Tuesday afternoon.  Furthermore, moisture pooling over
the Plains will help produce showers and thunderstorms over parts
of the Central Plains into parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley
overnight Sunday.  Rain and showers/thunderstorms will move into
parts of the Upper Great Lakes by Monday morning and into parts of
the Ohio Valley by Monday evening.   Overnight Monday, as the
associated front moves southward, showers and thunderstorms will
develop over parts of the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley and
expand into parts of the Central/Southern Plains on Tuesday into
Tuesday evening. The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over this area on Tuesday.  Furthermore, Rain will
move into parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and into parts of
the Mid-Atlantic by Tuesday evening.

Elsewhere, rain and snow will develop from wrap-around moisture
from a slow-moving surface low in the Atlantic off Maine's coast.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 AM CDT Mon Apr 05 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NORTHERN ARIZONA...

...Synopsis...
A strong shortwave trough will dig southeastward into the
central/southern Great Basin. A southern stream mid-level jet will
phase with the trough and bring strong winds aloft across much of
the Basin into the Southwest. At the surface, the trough will bring
a cold front through Nevada to near the Four Corners by the end of
the period. Farther east, a surface low will deepen along the CO/KS
border, particularly overnight. A strong upper-low will remain off
the Northeast coast bringing enhanced low-level winds across parts
of New England into the Mid-Atlantic.

...Southwest/Great Basin...
Strong southwesterly winds are likely as the cold front approaches
during the day. The strengthening pressure gradient will be
augmented by the strong winds aloft. Winds of 20-30 mph are
possible, especially north of the Mogollon Rim. With RH nearing
10-15%, critical fire weather is likely in northeast Arizona.
Long-term drought will limit the abundance of fuels, but those that
are present will be available to burn.

In NV/UT, similarly dry conditions will exist with RH potentially as
low as 10-15% with 15-20% becoming more common with northward
westward extent. Elevated to locally critical conditions will be
possible in these locations. Fuels are slightly less receptive as
compared to AZ so critical highlights will be withheld this outlook.


...Southern/Central High Plains...
Mid-level winds will be weaker this far east, though the deepening
lee cyclone will still promote 15-20 mph wind with higher speeds
possible in terrain-favored areas. Very deep mixing is expected with
potential for 5-20% RH by afternoon. Locally critical conditions may
occur in wind-prone areas, but elevated fire weather is the main
expectation given the weaker surface winds.

...Northeast...
Surface winds of around 15 mph are possible during the afternoon.
Winds could gust into the 20-30 mph range. Mid-level dry air on the
western flank of the upper-low will keep skies clear and allow RH to
fall to 25-35%. Elevated fire weather is expected given dry fine
fuels.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

From the height anomaly perspective, the most dominant feature
over North America will be a strengthening eastern Canada mean
ridge.  The associated core of positive height anomalies to the
east of Hudson Bay in latest D+8 means teleconnect to mean
troughing over the Upper Midwest/western Great Lakes and a modest
split flow regime over the western part of the continent (some
ridging over western Canada and troughing over the southwestern
U.S. through Baja California).

Thus far the guidance has maintained the improved clustering that
emerged in the 00Z cycle from 24 hours ago for the evolution of
the initial Midwest upper low and upstream shortwave energy
emerging from western Canada and northwestern U.S.  Over the
course of Thursday-Saturday the current consensus would have the
initial upper low energy lifting northward as the upstream energy
forms another upper low over the Upper Midwest/western Great
Lakes.  The upstream frontal system would also essentially replace
the leading one as this evolution occurs.  While differences have
existed over this area over recent days, there has been decent
continuity for a wavy front extending through the southern
Mid-Atlantic.  During the latter half of the period the 18Z GFS
provided the most pronounced discrepancy versus other guidance for
the second Midwest/Great Lakes upper low, tracking it into the
Northeast instead of holding it farther west.

Differences still exist for upstream flow from the northeastern
Pacific eastward.  To varying degrees the majority of guidance
suggests that shortwave energy arriving into the Northwest by day
5 Saturday will be followed fairly quickly by a modest ridge that
eventually reaches western Canada, versus the GFS/GEFS mean which
have additional shortwave energy.  The ECMWF cluster seems to
provide a better lead into the teleconnection-favored pattern.
The 12Z CMC may be overdone with how much shortwave energy digs
into the West (more moderate in the new 00Z run) while the CMC
mean is on the fast side with the shortwave.

In light of the above considerations, the operational model blend
early in the period trended toward greater weight of recent ECMWF
runs and 12Z ECMWF mean relative to the 12Z GFS and 18Z GEFS mean
by days 6-7 Sunday-Monday.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Combination of the initial Midwest upper low/surface system and
upstream energy that replaces it will produce a period of
precipitation of varying intensity over the Midwest/Great Lakes.
Most of this activity will be rain but there is a slight chance
that the northern fringe of the moisture shield could contain a
little snow.  The front approaching from the west toward the
leading system could provide a focus for enhancement.  A fairly
broad area of rainfall will also extend across many other portions
of the East along/ahead of fronts associated with the northern
systems.  Heaviest rainfall is most likely to be over portions of
the South.  Late-period shortwave energy could support another
episode of rainfall over parts of the Plains by Sunday or Monday.
Over the Northwest/northern Rockies expect an episode of fairly
light rain/mountain snow around Thursday followed by another event
late week into the weekend.  Highest totals with the latter should
be over the Olympics and Washington Cascades.

Clouds and precipitation will tend to support above normal morning
lows over the East most of the period.  Some locations in the
Midwest/Great Lakes may see record warm lows on Thursday, within
an area of plus 15-25F anomalies.  High temperatures will be more
moderate but the Great Lakes and vicinity could still see daytime
readings exceed 10F above normal late this week into Saturday.
Meanwhile expect a localized area of well above normal
temperatures over southern Texas, especially late this week when
highs could reach at least 15F above normal, with a moderating
trend to follow.  The southern half to two-thirds of the West will
generally be above normal through the period with plus 5-12F
anomalies for highs.  Farther north expect a couple periods of
modestly below normal highs behind progressive cold fronts.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS INTO SOUTHERN
NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A potent upper-level trough will continue east into the southern
High Plains on Tuesday. Mid-level winds will be strong across parts
of the Southwest into western Texas. At the surface, the surface low
in western Kansas will continue to deepen and develop southward and
eastward during the afternoon and evening. A cold front will move
southward along the lee of the Rockies and into the southern High
Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Surface winds across southern New Mexico into the Trans-Pecos and
east-central New Mexico are expected to reach 20-30 mph. Guidance
continues to show that region reaching near 5% RH during the
afternoon with 10-15% from Arizona into the Texas Panhandle. Locally
extremely critical meteorological conditions are possible especially
along the West Texas southern New Mexico border where 850 mb winds
will be stronger. However, ERCs at or just above normal will
generally limit extreme fire behavior.

...Southwest...
Elevated fire weather is again expected during the afternoon with
the deepening low to the east and lingering strong mid-level winds.
RH of 10-20% will be possible eastern Arizona into parts of western
New Mexico. Winds will be weaker with westward extent and are only
expected to reach 15-20 mph. Some locations could see 20+ mph but
duration should be brief.

...Rain and potentially severe thunderstorms are likely over parts
of the central U.S., with snow across higher elevations of the
Northwest...

...Continued much warmer than average temperatures in the western
and central U.S. will support Elevated to Critical Risks of fire
weather...

For the first part of the workweek, an upper-level trough/low is
forecast to move through the Northwest and into the central U.S.,
which is expected to push a cold front forward and help a surface
low consolidate over the central U.S. by Tuesday. This pattern
will lead to rain and thunderstorms across portions of the Plains
and Mississippi Valley over the next couple of days, becoming more
widespread Tuesday. Today and tonight, Marginal and Slight Risks
of severe storms are in place for the Central Plains into the
Upper Mississippi Valley from the Storm Prediction Center. Chances
for severe weather should shift southward Tuesday into the
Central/Southern Plains, and toward the Lower Mississippi Valley
on Wednesday. Rainfall totals of a couple of inches are likely
over the Northern Plains to Upper Midwest, and localized flooding
or flash flooding cannot be ruled out. Lighter rain showers are
also possible periodically farther east in the northern
Mid-Atlantic region along a meandering front. Underneath the upper
low, temperatures are expected to switch to cooler than average,
and the low will provide lift for snow to form and fall over
higher elevations of the Northwest. The highest snow totals could
reach over a foot in the Wind River Mountains/Tetons and the
Bighorn Mountains, with the Northern Rockies and the Black Hills
seeing some enhanced snow amounts too.

Another day of potentially record-breaking warmth is on tap today
across the southwestern to north-central U.S., with temperatures
nearing 100 degrees in the Desert Southwest and 80s as far north
as South Dakota and Minnesota. The warmth should ease a bit on
Tuesday as it shifts eastward, but remain above normal. The warmth
combined with dry soils, low relative humidity, and gusty winds
will lead to the potential for dangerous fire weather conditions.
An Elevated Risk is delineated today across eastern Nevada and the
Four Corners states, with an embedded Critical Risk in
northeastern Arizona. Then on Tuesday, Elevated to Critical Risks
are in place for parts of the Southwest and Southern High Plains.
Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches are also in effect for
these areas. Additionally, an Elevated Risk for fire weather is in
place today for southern portions of the Northeast and the
northern Mid-Atlantic given dry and windy conditions. Meanwhile
farther north in Maine, continued rain and snow are expected from
wraparound moisture from a slow-moving surface low offshore in the
Atlantic.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 AM CDT Mon Jun 07 2021

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWEST NEVADA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEASTERN NEVADA
INTO WESTERN UTAH...

Portions of the Critical area across western Utah were expanded
slightly northward, with the Elevated delineation expanded
southeastward into northeastern Arizona to reflect the consensus of
the latest guidance. Current visible satellite shows clear skies
across the CONUS west of the Rockies, allowing for boundary layer
mixing to support widespread Elevated/Critical surface
meteorological conditions across much of the Great Basin into the
Four Corners later this afternoon. Please see the previous forecast
below for more details regarding the ongoing Elevated/Critical
highlights.

Otherwise, locally Elevated conditions are expected by afternoon
peak heating across southern Arizona into central New Mexico. A dry
thunderstorm or two is also possible today across parts of the
northern Great Basin into the central Rockies. However, the sparse
and brief nature of the southern Arizona/central New Mexico
dry/breezy overlapping conditions, and thunder coverage across the
northern Great Basin/central Rockies precludes fire weather
highlights across these areas.

..Squitieri.. 06/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Mon Jun 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale mid/upper-level trough over the eastern Pacific Ocean
is forecast to amplify while remaining offshore through tonight.
Meanwhile, a secondary mid/upper-level low is forecast to weaken as
it moves onshore across southern California and toward the Four
Corners area.

...Great Basin...
Critical fire weather conditions are most likely today across:

1. Portions of northwestern Nevada
Enhanced mid-level flow along the eastern/southeastern periphery of
the aforementioned eastern Pacific Ocean trough is forecast to
persist (while also becoming more southerly) over portions of
northwestern Nevada through today. Critical fire weather conditions
are expected by afternoon, as sustained westerly winds near 20-30
mph (with greater gusts) overlap minimum RH values of 15% or less
and dry fuels. Fire weather conditions should abate overnight as
winds subside and RH values recover.

2. Portions of southeastern Nevada and southwestern Utah
Enhanced mid-level flow is forecast to accompany the aforementioned
secondary mid-level low as it shifts across the southwestern United
States. Critical fire weather conditions are expected by afternoon
as sustained southwesterly winds of 20-30 mph overlap Critical RH
values (e.g. < 15%) and increasingly receptive fuels. Of additional
concern is the threat for lightning holdovers from isolated dry
thunderstorms in recent days. Archived cloud-to-ground lightning and
AHPS accumulated precipitation data suggest the greatest threat for
lightning holdovers would exist over south-central Nevada. Locally
elevated fire weather conditions may remain through the overnight
due to lingering breeziness and somewhat poor overnight RH
recoveries.

...Locally Heavy Rainfall Thursday and Friday from the
Tennessee/Ohio River Valleys to the Central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic...

...Much Above Normal Temperatures for the North-Central U.S Late
This Week and Weekend....


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest model guidance offers average to above average
predictability for the Nation during the medium range period
(Thursday-Monday) and is driven by the amplified upper level
pattern featuring a western U.S. trough with ridging across the
southern to central U.S. and some troughing becoming established
over the Northeast this weekend. The main difference from previous
WPC continuity was with placement/movement of shortwave energy
through the Rockies into southern Canada along with track of low
pressure at the surface. Much of the guidance now lifts this
energy north into south-central Canada Friday-Saturday, when
previous model runs hinted at a closed low making its way eastward
across the Great Lakes. For the 00z cycle of guidance, the only
deterministic solution still advertising this was the UKMET (and
thus it was not used in WPCs blend for today), but the new 12z
model came in better agreement with the consensus, adding some
confidence in this adjustment to continuity. The 06z GFS also
slowed down it's progression of Eastern Pacific troughing and is
now more in line with the ECMWF and the CMC with keeping the main
trough axis off the West Coast by day 7. WPC favored a blend of
the deterministic runs (ECMWF/CMC/GFS) through day 4, increasing
weighting of the ensemble means thereafter but only to a 50/50
ensemble mean/deterministic blend by day 7. Aside from what's
mentioned above, this maintained good continuity with the previous
WPC forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Upper level ridging building through the central U.S. will favor
much above normal temperatures from the southern High Plains into
the northern Rockies and northern Plains Thursday and then again
through the weekend to early next week (brief reprieve expected on
Friday). Departures above normal could reach 15F to 20F, locally
higher, with highs well into the 90s. These values may approach or
exceed both daytime highs and warm morning low records, especially
on Thursday and also Friday morning, for some locations.

Locally heavy rainfall capable of producing flash flooding will be
possible Thursday and Friday across portions of the Ohio Valley to
the Mid-Atlantic as moisture and lift associated with a weak upper
level feature traverses the region. Its eventual interaction with
a more substantial cold front dropping south will shunt the
moisture southward this weekend. For this upcoming weekend,
unsettled weather and higher precipitation chances will be
confined to the Southeast U.S. along the residual frontal boundary
as well as portions of the Pacific Northwest as a few waves of low
pressure move onshore.

...Locally Heavy Rainfall Thursday and Friday from the
Tennessee/Ohio River Valleys to the Central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic...

...Much Above Normal Temperatures for the North-Central U.S Late
This Week and Weekend....


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest model guidance offers average to above average
predictability for the Nation during the medium range period
(Thursday-Monday) and is driven by the amplified upper level
pattern featuring a western U.S. trough with ridging across the
southern to central U.S. and some troughing becoming established
over the Northeast this weekend. The main difference from previous
WPC continuity was with placement/movement of shortwave energy
through the Rockies into southern Canada along with track of low
pressure at the surface. Much of the guidance now lifts this
energy north into south-central Canada Friday-Saturday, when
previous model runs hinted at a closed low making its way eastward
across the Great Lakes. For the 00z cycle of guidance, the only
deterministic solution still advertising this was the UKMET (and
thus it was not used in WPCs blend for today), but the new 12z
model came in better agreement with the consensus, adding some
confidence in this adjustment to continuity. The 06z GFS also
slowed down it's progression of Eastern Pacific troughing and is
now more in line with the ECMWF and the CMC with keeping the main
trough axis off the West Coast by day 7. WPC favored a blend of
the deterministic runs (ECMWF/CMC/GFS) through day 4, increasing
weighting of the ensemble means thereafter but only to a 50/50
ensemble mean/deterministic blend by day 7. Aside from what's
mentioned above, this maintained good continuity with the previous
WPC forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Upper level ridging building through the central U.S. will favor
much above normal temperatures from the southern High Plains into
the northern Rockies and northern Plains Thursday and then again
through the weekend to early next week (brief reprieve expected on
Friday). Departures above normal could reach 15F to 20F, locally
higher, with highs well into the 90s. These values may approach or

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon June 07 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 13 - 17 2021

Today's model solutions are in a good agreement on the 500-hPa circulation
pattern across the forecast domain. An amplified pattern is predicted,
consisting of anomalous ridges centered south of the Aleutians and over much
of
the western and central CONUS, and amplified troughs over the Eastern Pacific
and the Northeast.

Troughing centered across the Bering Sea and associated southerly flow  are
forecast to favor relatively warm conditions for Alaska. Downstream,
anomalously strong ridging predicted over much of the west-central CONUS is
expected to significantly increase chances of above normal temperatures across
most of the western and central CONUS, especially over parts of the Northern
and Central Rockies, where positive height anomalies are highest. The
potential
for some shortwave troughs and frontal activities persist over parts of the
Southern Plains and much of the eastern CONUS, enhancing the likelihood of
near
to below normal temperatures over those regions. Above normal temperatures are
favored over the central and southern Florida Peninsula, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered across the Bering Sea favors near to above
precipitation over western Alaska. Probabilities for near to below normal
precipitation over eastern Alaska are enhanced underneath positive 500-hPa
height anomalies. Downstream, a forecast deep trough over the Eastern Pacific
favors above normal precipitation over parts of the Pacific Northwest.
Anomalously strong ridging and positive height anomalies predicted over much
of
the north and central CONUS is expected to significantly increase chances of
below normal precipitation across the region, especially over parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley. The potential for some shortwave troughs predicted
across parts of the Southern Plains and Southeast enhances the chance of near
to above normal precipitation over this region.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 4 out of 5,
due to good agreement among the model solutions, an amplified pattern
predicted
across the domain, offset by some uncertainties among the precipitation and
temperature forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 15 - 21 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is forecast to persist, but
deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. Because the pattern is expected to
be similar to the 6-10 day period, the temperature probability forecast is
quite similar.

Above normal temperatures are expected for most of Mainland Alaska underneath
the forecast above normal 500-hPa heights. Positive height anomalies
associated
with the forecast ridge centered over the west-central CONUS favor above
normal
temperatures across the west and central CONUS. Near to below temperatures are
expected over parts of the Southern Plains and most of the eastern CONUS
underneath forecast below normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal temperatures
are
more likely for most of the Florida Peninsula consistent with the
consolidation
forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered over the Bering Sea favors near to above normal
precipitation over much of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Below normal
precipitation is expected across the north central CONUS and parts of the
Southern Plains underneath forecast ridging over the western CONUS and
predicted surface high over the eastern CONUS. Due in part to the potential
for
increased tropical activity over parts of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico,
above normal precipitation is favored for states along the Gulf of Mexico,
parts of the Southeast, and southern Mid-Atlantic.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0242 PM CDT Mon Jun 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN INTO
THE FOUR CORNERS...

The primary change to the Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook was to expand
Critical highlights eastward into parts of the Upper Colorado River
Basin, where the latest guidance consensus has trended upward in
wind speeds. Similarly, the Elevated area was expanded to include
northeast Arizona and more of north-central Wyoming, with 15+ mph
sustained south-southwesterly surface winds more likely to overlap
with RH under 20%. Otherwise, 20+ mph sustained southwesterly winds
are still expected to overlap with critically low RH across portions
of the Great Basin tomorrow afternoon and evening.

An isolated thunderstorm or two is possible across far western
Wyoming during the afternoon/early evening hours. However,
precipitable water values under 0.50 inches suggest that stronger
storm cells and associated strike production will remain quite
sparse, precluding an isolated dry thunderstorm area introduction
this outlook. However, given modestly receptive fuels, fast motion
for any storms that form, and the presence of a deep sub-cloud
layer, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights may be needed for
western Wyoming if future guidance trends higher with precipitable
water.

..Squitieri.. 06/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Mon Jun 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad Pacific Northwest trough is forecast to continue amplifying
while remaining offshore across the eastern Pacific Ocean Day
2/Tuesday. As this occurs, a belt of enhanced mid-level flow is
forecast to strengthen over much of the western United States.

...Great Basin...
Critical fire weather conditions appear most likely Day 2/Tuesday
across portions of southeastern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and far
northwestern Arizona as the aforementioned belt of enhanced
mid-level flow impinges on the area. Critical fire weather
conditions are forecast to develop by midday as efficient deep-layer
mixing promotes sustained southerly/southwesterly surface winds in
excess of 20 mph amidst minimum RH values at or below 15%. While
critical fire weather conditions should subside by late evening,
lingering breeziness and relatively poor overnight RH recoveries may
allow for locally elevated fire weather conditions through the
overnight.

...South-central Wyoming...
Meteorological critical fire weather conditions are expected across
much of south-central Wyoming Day 2/Tuesday, as strong
southerly/southwesterly sustained surface winds (> 25 mph) overlap
critical RH values (< 15%). However, these conditions are currently
expected where fuel loads are extremely low, precluding the
introduction of a critical fire weather area.

...Persistent heat for the Upper Midwest to the East Coast...

...Continued wet pattern for the south-central states...

Portions of the south-central and central U.S. will have multiple
rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall that will keep the threat for
excessive rainfall and flooding concerns elevated. Parts of
northeast Texas, extreme southeast Oklahoma and northwest
Louisiana, along with southern Arkansas has been identified by WPC
as having a Moderate Risk for excessive rainfall through Tuesday
morning. This area will shift north and east through Wednesday
morning, focusing over Arkansas, northwest Mississippi, western
Tennessee, southwest Kentucky, southern tip of Illinois and
southeast Missouri. And over far northeast Arkansas, northern
Mississippi, western Tennessee and west/central Kentucky through
Thursday morning.

In terms of severe weather potential, the Storm Prediction Center
has a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms for Monday and Tuesday
across portions of the Northern Plains as a well defined surface
low and front intercepts a warm and unstable airmass across this
region. Another Slight Risk area is in effect through Tuesday
morning for parts of the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley.

Widespread heat will remain in place from the Upper Midwest to the
Northeast over the next couple of days. The height pattern
associated with this hot airmass is anomalous for early June and
is more typical of those in mid-summer. The largest temperature
departures will likely occur in South Dakota, where afternoon
highs are forecast to reach the mid 90s to low 100s. Additionally,
daily maximums in the 90s can also be expected along the
Interstate 95 corridor from Washington D.C. to the greater Boston
metro area.  Stifling heat will continue across the Southwest with
western Texas in averaging 100 to 105F. Points to the east will
not be as hot thanks to abundant cloud cover and rainfall.

...Locally Heavy Rainfall Thursday and Friday from the
Tennessee/Ohio River Valleys to the Central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic...

...Much Above Normal Temperatures for the North-Central U.S Late
This Week and Weekend....


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest model guidance offers average to above average
predictability for the Nation during the medium range period
(Thursday-Monday) and is driven by the amplified upper level
pattern featuring a western U.S. trough with ridging across the
southern to central U.S. and some troughing becoming established
over the Northeast this weekend. The main difference from previous
WPC continuity was with placement/movement of shortwave energy
through the Rockies into southern Canada along with track of low
pressure at the surface. Much of the guidance now lifts this
energy north into south-central Canada Friday-Saturday, when
previous model runs hinted at a closed low making its way eastward
across the Great Lakes. For the 00z cycle of guidance, the only
deterministic solution still advertising this was the UKMET (and
thus it was not used in WPCs blend for today), but the new 12z
model came in better agreement with the consensus, adding some
confidence in this adjustment to continuity. The 06z GFS also
slowed down it's progression of Eastern Pacific troughing and is
now more in line with the ECMWF and the CMC with keeping the main
trough axis off the West Coast by day 7. WPC favored a blend of
the deterministic runs (ECMWF/CMC/GFS) through day 4, increasing
weighting of the ensemble means thereafter but only to a 50/50
ensemble mean/deterministic blend by day 7. Aside from what's
mentioned above, this maintained good continuity with the previous
WPC forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Upper level ridging building through the central U.S. will favor
much above normal temperatures from the southern High Plains into
the northern Rockies and northern Plains Thursday and then again
through the weekend to early next week (brief reprieve expected on
Friday). Departures above normal could reach 15F to 20F, locally
higher, with highs well into the 90s. These values may approach or
exceed both daytime highs and warm morning low records, especially
on Thursday and also Friday morning, for some locations.

Locally heavy rainfall capable of producing flash flooding will be
possible Thursday and Friday across portions of the Ohio Valley to
the Mid-Atlantic as moisture and lift associated with a weak upper
level feature traverses the region. Its eventual interaction with
a more substantial cold front dropping south will shunt the
moisture southward this weekend. For this upcoming weekend,
unsettled weather and higher precipitation chances will be
confined to the Southeast U.S. along the residual frontal boundary
as well as portions of the Pacific Northwest as a few waves of low
pressure move onshore.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 07 2021

SYNOPSIS: Amplified mid-level high pressure is predicted to build across the
western half of the lower 48 at the beginning of the period, supporting
anomalously warm temperatures and possible excessive heat over parts of the
western half of the contiguous U.S. There continues to be increased chances
for
tropical cyclone formation over the Caribbean during mid-June which may bring
heavy rainfall to parts of the Gulf Coast and Southeast, which could prolong
flooding across the aforementioned areas. Mid-level low pressure is forecast
over the North-Central Pacific, favoring above normal precipitation for parts
of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Precipitation amounts are not
anticipated
to exceed pre-defined hazards thresholds.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat across parts of the Rockies, Central Great
Basin, Southwest, and Northern Plains, Tue-Wed, Jun 15-16.

Slight risk of excessive heat across many parts of the western half of the
CONUS, Tue-Thu, Jun 15-17.

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of interior California, the Central
Great Basin, southern parts of the Northern Great Basin, and Southwest,
Fri-Mon, Jun 18-21.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the central and eastern Gulf
Coast states and South Carolina, Wed-Sat, Jun 16-19.

Slight risk of high winds across coastal portions of northern California,
Thu-Sat, Jun 17-19.



DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY JUNE 10 - MONDAY JUNE 14:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pzjaBGOfp35J-Cw9Ozf1LLnmV-78WA9wJxFLMnQrDy4DAl56-Q8rn28WB4aI_HqGVrr5sPgA$

FOR TUESDAY JUNE 15 - MONDAY JUNE 21: Anomalous amplified mid-level ridging
continues to be predicted for many parts of the western half of the CONUS at
least through the beginning of the period. The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble means generally indicate weakening of the mid-level pattern by the
middle of week-2, especially across the Northwest. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean
favors the amplified ridging persisting longer and shifting eastward to the
North-Central CONUS, whereas the 0Z GEFS noticeably weakens the ridging across
the northern tier of the CONUS by the middle of the period. Due to increasing
model differences regarding the heat signal across the central CONUS, and the
week-2 mean consolidated tool favoring the GEFS across this region, the risk
for excessive heat is based more on the GEFS reforecast tool. A slight risk of
excessive heat is posted for many parts of the western half of the CONUS, June
15 to 17, with the southern half of this risk area (interior California, the
Central Great Basin, southern parts of the Northern Great Basin, and
Southwest)
persisting until the end of week-2. A moderate risk of excessive heat is
designated for parts of the Rockies, Central Great Basin, Southwest, and
Northern Plains, June 15 to 16, where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
indicate at least a 40% (20%) chance of temperatures exceeding the 85th (95th)
percentile. In general both reforecast tools show maximum temperatures
potentially exceeding 90 (100) deg F across the Northwest and Northern Plains
(Southwest, San Joaquin Valley and Southern California). Many parts of the
West, especially the southwestern CONUS continue to experience severe drought.
Anticipated dry conditions and anomalous heat across the West may support
increased chances for localized wildfire risk during the period.



Across the tropics, the large-scale environment continues to remain favorable
for tropical cyclogenesis in the Caribbean Sea during week-2. Dynamical models
continue to support tropical cyclone (TC) formation, although there is
significant model uncertainty regarding the details of the timing and
evolution
of TCs. The ECMWF probabilistic TC tool depicts elevated chances for cyclone
development initially over the Bay of Campeche at the beginning of the period,
with increased potential extending into the Gulf of Mexico throughout the
period. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) currently indicates a disturbance
over the western Caribbean having a 20% chance of TC formation in the next 5
days. The uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF daily ensemble means indicate the
greatest likelihood for this potential TC formation to bring heavy
precipitation to the central and eastern Gulf Coast after day 8. The ECMWF
reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals
exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and one inch over the course of
days 8 to 12. Some of the 0Z and 6Z GEFS members indicate potential for
possible low formation along the western Gulf Coast, although more towards the
end of the period. Given these differences, a broad area is posted with a
slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the central and eastern
Gulf
Coast states and extending into South Carolina, June 16 to 19. Anticipated
heavy rainfall may lead to possible flooding across parts of the highlighted
risk areas, particularly for Louisiana, where the River Forecast Center (RFC)
5-day Significant River Outlook indicates elevated flood potential prior to
week-2.



Surface high pressure is predicted to form over the northeastern Pacific, with
surface low pressure over California. The orientation of these features may
support a tight pressure gradient over Northern California, especially during
the middle of week-2, resulting in increased chances for high winds over the
region. Therefore, a slight risk of high winds is highlighted for coastal
parts
of Northern California, June 17 to 19, where both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast
tools show at least a 20% chance of sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th
percentile and 25 mph.



Mid-level troughing is forecast to form over the North-Central Pacific during
week-2, which would support above normal precipitation across many parts of
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, which would help decrease chances for
elevated wildfire risk during the period.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
On Wednesday, a large upper-level trough will slowly shift east
toward the Great Basin. This approaching trough will lead to some
lee cyclogenesis in the northern Great Basin. In addition, strong
downslope flow and deep mixing is anticipated as 50+ mph mid-level
flow crosses the Sierra. Therefore, strong surface winds of 30 to 35
mph are possible in portions of eastern Nevada and western Utah. In
addition, a dry surface airmass will be in place with relative
humidity around 10 to 15 percent. ERC values are now above the 90th
percentile in much of the Great Basin and thus fuels are likely
critically dry across the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1228 AM CDT Tue Jun 08 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN INTO
CENTRAL WYOMING...

...Synopsis...
A compact mid-level shortwave trough is apparent over southern
California early this morning. This shortwave trough will shift
northeastward through the day today. As it does, lee troughing is
anticipated with a lee cyclone in the vicinity of eastern
Wyoming/eastern Montana and the northern Great Basin. Strong
mid-level flow is anticipated in close proximity to this upper-level
shortwave trough. Deep mixing is forecast across much of the Great
Basin and therefore, some of this stronger mid-level flow is
expected to make it to the surface. The stronger winds are forecast
where the stronger mid-level flow is expected to pass overhead from
southern Nevada into central Wyoming, where a critical delineation
is present.

Elevated fire weather conditions are forecast across portions of New
Mexico. A lack of upper-level support should limit the overall wind
speeds, but the tightening pressure gradient in response to the lee
cyclogenesis should be sufficient for some gusty winds.

...Locally Heavy Rainfall Threat Continues Friday Across Central
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic...

...Much Above Normal Temperatures Return Late This Weekend and
Early Next Week Across Northern Rockies/Northern Plains....

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest model guidance offers average to above average
predictability for the Nation during the medium range period
(Friday-Tuesday) and is driven by the amplified upper level
pattern featuring a western U.S. trough with ridging across the
southern to central U.S. and some troughing becoming established
over the Northeast this weekend. By early next week, this pattern
becomes asserted and persistent with heights building through the
central U.S./Rockies while upstream troughing off the western U.S.
deepens. There is some question on how the Northeast/Great Lakes
troughing will evolve, whether it'll be more progressive/zonal
like the GFS suggests or more amplified with a closed low forming
like the 07.12Z ECMWF advertises. An ensemble mean approach
supports the more progressive/zonal flow idea and this is also
supported by the teleconnections driven by positive height
anomalies over the northern U.S. and negative height anomalies off
the West Coast. So for this cycle, the WPC blend favored the
deterministic models for days 3-5 consisting of the 12Z ECMWF/CMC
and 18Z GFS followed with mostly ECENS/GEFS means for days 6-7 to
account for some of the model spread on either coast. This
resulted in a blend forecast trending well with continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The amplification of the upper ridge over the central U.S. is
expected to bring another round of much above normal to possibly
record warm temperatures to the northern Rockies and northern
Plains late this weekend and early next week. Temperature
departures from normal of 20F to 30F are likely with some
triple-digit readings possible across central/eastern Montana
Monday and Tuesday. Nighttime lows will also remain unseasonably
warm for the region and likely stay 10F to 15F above normal for
middle of June. Elsewhere across the Nation, no significant
temperature anomalies are expected for the medium range forecast
period.

The threat of locally heavy rainfall capable of producing flash
flooding will linger on Friday across portions of the central
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic as higher moisture interacts with a
southward dropping cold front. For the weekend and early next
week, the dominant upper ridge over the central U.S. will keep
much of the Nation on the drier side with any substantial
precipitation confined to the Pacific Northwest as well as
portions of the Southeast and Florida along a residual frontal
boundary.

...Persistent heat from the Northern Plains to the East Coast...

...Continued wet pattern for the south-central states...

The overall weather pattern will be rather slow to change through
the middle of the week across most of the nation.  A large upper
level ridge anchored over the Plains will keep a frontal boundary
from making much eastern progress across the Intermountain West
and the Rockies.  Meanwhile, a cold front will make slow progress
southward across the Great Lakes and Northeast U.S. through early
Thursday, bringing some relief to the recent hot weather for these
areas by the end of the week.  It will remain hot and humid with
July-like conditions across the remainder of the central and
eastern U.S. with highs running 5 to 15+ degrees above seasonal
averages in many cases, with the greatest anomalies across the
northern Plains and portions of the Northeast through Wednesday.
It will be pleasantly cool for this time of year across the West
Coast region since an upper level trough will be situated across
the eastern Pacific.

Additional rounds of heavy rainfall are in the forecast across
portions of the central U.S., particularly from southern Arkansas
to western Tennessee where 3 to locally 6 inches of rain will be
possible over the next two days.  This will increase the flash
flood threat where training of thunderstorm cells develops.
Numerous showers and storms are also expected across the Ohio
Valley and extending eastward across southern New England, where
localized 2 inch rainfall totals may become realized.

Strong to severe thunderstorms will be possible across portions of
the western High Plains on Tuesday per the latest convective
outlook from the Storm Prediction Center, with a Slight Risk from
western Nebraska to eastern Montana.  There will also be elevated
fire weather concerns across much of the Intermountain West, owing
to a favorable combination of gusty winds and very low humidity
levels, along with ongoing severe drought.

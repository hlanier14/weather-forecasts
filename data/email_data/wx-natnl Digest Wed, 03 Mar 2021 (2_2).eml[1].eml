Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0104 AM CST Wed Mar 03 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
A closed upper low will move into southern California during the day
today, overspreading moderate to strong mid-level flow across the
Southwest and into the southern Great Basin. At the surface, an area
of low pressure will strengthen as it moves into southern Nevada by
evening. The combination of the strengthening pressure gradient and
deep mixing transporting stronger flow from aloft toward the surface
will bring strengthening surface flow. Winds are expected to be
around 25 mph across much of southern Arizona. Dry surface
conditions will be in place with RH of 8 to 15 percent, but moisture
advection from the southwest will lead to increasing humidity,
especially across southwest Arizona. Current elevated area
highlights where humidity will be minimally impacted by increasing
moisture and where duration of the stronger winds will be long
enough for some large-fire concerns.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO
AND WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A closed upper low will move eastward across the southern Rockies
during the day Thursday. A lee cyclone is expected to develop in
southeast Colorado and move southeast into the TX/OK Panhandles
through the day. Dry conditions are expected west of the dry line
with relative humidity of 5 to 13 percent. In this area, strong
winds of 20 to 30 mph are also likely. The strongest winds will
likely be in northeast New Mexico/western TX Panhandle where the
gradient is maximized and in southeast New Mexico where mid-level
flow will be the strongest. Some guidance suggests sustained winds
in excess of 30 mph are possible in the TX Panhandle. Therefore,
critical conditions are likely in this area.

...A low pressure system will spread precipitation across the
southwestern to south-central CONUS...

...Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather are in place for
portions of the Southwest to Southern High Plains...

A surface low pressure system along with an upper-level low are
forecast to move across Southern California into the Four Corners
states through Thursday and into the Southern Plains early Friday.
Along this track, precipitation is forecast to spread across these
regions, with rain in the lower elevations and snow in higher
elevations. Snow could accumulate to a few inches in the mountains
of Southern California, the Mogollon Rim, and Wasatch, while the
Central Rockies and San Juan Mountains could see 6-12 inches of
snow through Friday morning. Showers and a few thunderstorms are
forecast for the Southern/Central Plains late Thursday into Friday.

Another threat with this system will be fire danger. An Elevated
Risk of fire weather as well as Red Flag Warnings are in effect
for much of Arizona today. On Thursday, as winds increase and
humidity dries out behind the cold front, a Critical Risk of fire
weather is in place for the Southern High Plains.

Elsewhere, the Southeast should see rain and thunderstorms ending
today after a low pressure system moves away into the Atlantic.
Light snow is possible in the interior Northeast through Thursday,
with snow accumulating to a few inches possible in higher
elevations. The Pacific Northwest can expect precipitation chances
to increase late Thursday into Friday as an upper-level low and
frontal system approach.

Temperature-wise, the Northern Plains should continue to see
rather mild temperatures with highs nearing or exceeding 60
degrees over the next several days, about 20-30 degrees above
average. The Southeast can expect cooler than normal temperatures
today, while Thursday will be chillier than average in the
Northeast.

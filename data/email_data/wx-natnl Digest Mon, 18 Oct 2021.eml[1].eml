Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1054 AM CDT Sun Oct 17 2021

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

Two small Elevated risk areas are introduced to north-central
Montana and northeast Colorado where elevated wind/RH conditions are
expected to overlap with favorably dry fuels for at least a few
hours this afternoon.

...North-Central Montana...
Morning hi-res guidance has come into better agreement regarding the
potential for a small area of elevated conditions this afternoon in
the immediate lee of the northern Rockies. While winds today are
forecast to be lighter than yesterday, frequent gusts between 20-25
mph are possible through the afternoon. Given ERC values across this
region in the 90-95th percentile and forecast RH values near 20%, at
least a low-end fire weather concern seems probable.

...Northeast Colorado...
Morning observations show weak surface pressure falls underway in
the lee of the Rockies, indicative of a strengthening lee trough.
This trend will continue through the day and support sustained winds
near 15 mph. Although winds will only marginally meet elevated
thresholds, morning RH values in the 30-35% range are forecast to
fall further into the 10-15% range this afternoon. This unseasonably
dry air (near the 10th percentile for this time of year) coupled
with ERC values near the 90th percentile may support a few hours of
elevated fire weather conditions.

..Moore.. 10/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1148 PM CDT Sat Oct 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will move into the Plains today. Across the
West, an upper-level trough will pivot into the Pacific Northwest
and northern California. At the surface, southerly winds will return
the southern High Plains on the western flank of a surface high
pressure system. A cold front will progress into northern California
and western/central parts of the Great Basin by the end of the
period.

Strong winds along with areas of lowered RH are possible ahead of
the front in the Great Basin. Fuels are too moist for fire weather
concerns. Across parts of north-central Montana, surface winds will
increase ahead of the cold front as well. Guidance continues to vary
on the degree of drying that will occur. Even with areas of 20-25%
RH, winds generally will stay below 15 mph except within areas of
terrain enhancement. Locally elevated conditions are most probable
in the lee of the Lewis Range where some fuels remain dry. Lastly,
modestly dry and windy conditions are expected in the southern High
Plains. Winds continue to appear relatively light (below 15 mph)
along with fuels not being particularly dry.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
205 PM EDT Sun Oct 17 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Oct 20 2021 - 12Z Sun Oct 24 2021

...Overview...

A fairly typical late October weather pattern is expected to be in
place across the majority of the nation during the medium range
forecast period. A surface low and trailing cold front will track
from the Midwest to the Northeast, with the front exiting the East
Coast by the end of the week. A rather active pattern will be in
place across the eastern Pacific with a persistent upper level
trough off the West Coast that will support several shortwaves
rotating around it, along with a couple of cold frontal passages
and rounds of precipitation. Meanwhile, a ridge axis is expected
to briefly build over the Intermountain West and then be
positioned over the Plains by next weekend.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

00Z/06Z model guidance remains in good agreement with the overall
synoptic scale pattern through about Thursday, as positioning of
the closed low over the central U.S. Wednesday appears well
handled by deterministic and ensemble guidance, even as it tracks
eastward into the Great Lakes region and starts getting absorbed
into northern stream flow on Thursday. Guidance is also becoming
more agreeable with a northern stream closed upper low centered
over James Bay Thursday, but uncertainties remain with this flow
over the southeastern quadrant of Canada by Friday. While the 00Z
GFS appears in line with the consensus of 00Z guidance with a
relatively slow track of the upper low eastward, the 06Z GFS lifts
a trough more quickly northeastward, and the new 12Z GFS also
followed this faster track. The 06/12Z GFS runs do appear to be
somewhat fast outliers at this point, while the CMC is slowest,
and the 00Z ECMWF provides a good middle ground solution that
aligns with the 00Z EC and GEFS ensemble means. Overall consensus
does suggest a slightly faster trend with this feature compared to
earlier runs by Friday/Saturday, but likely not as fast as the
recent GFS runs. Troughing is expected across the eastern U.S. by
next weekend, but its amplitude will depend on these northern
stream factors.

While all model guidance shows the overall troughing pattern in
the eastern Pacific, shortwave timing and magnitude differences
persist. The 00Z/06Z GFS runs appear to be a more amplified and
slower outlier with troughing approaching California on Friday,
and even the GEFS ensemble members are generally deeper than
members from the CMC and EC ensemble suites. Once again the ECMWF
seems to show a middle ground solution compared to the deep GFS
runs and the weak UKMET. Differences in deterministic guidance
persist through the weekend with shortwave tracks and if/how they
amplify the broader flow, but fortunately the ensemble mean
guidance seems generally agreeable.

Thus for this forecast, a multi-model blend of the deterministic
ECMWF/GFS/UKMET/CMC was able to be used at the beginning of the
period, generally weighting the ECMWF slightly heavier through the
period. Began leaning away from the 06Z GFS and 00Z CMC by Friday,
while increasing contributions from the ensemble means by next
weekend to reduce individual model issues.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

For the West Coast, surges of moisture along and ahead of cold
fronts approaching the region will lead to multiple rounds of
moderate to possibly heavy precipitation for northern California
into the Pacific Northwest through next weekend. Currently, the
heaviest round of precipitation looks to occur next weekend as a
more west-east oriented atmospheric river takes aim at the West
Coast. Some precipitation is likely to spill into the
Intermountain West and northern Rockies around Friday and through
the weekend. In general, lower elevation rain and higher elevation
snow are expected, with snow levels possibly lowering slightly
next weekend behind the cold frontal passage. The quantitative
precipitation forecast for the upcoming week (including the short
range period) shows 3-10 inches of rain/melted snow amounts over
favored windward terrain, particularly the Coastal Ranges and to a
lesser extent the Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada. Gusty winds
are also possible near the coast. Meanwhile for the eastern half
of the U.S., showers and possibly a few thunderstorms are expected
along the track of the surface low and its associated cold front
late next week, but rain amounts should remain generally light
given not much moisture to work with. As moisture increases by
next weekend, rain chances are also forecast to increase around
the Middle Mississippi Valley.

In terms of temperatures, it will feel more like mid November
across much of the Northern Plains in the wake of the departing
storm system on Wednesday, with high temperatures running about 10
to 15 degrees below average. There should be a gradual moderation
in temperatures going through the end of the workweek and into the
weekend as an upper-level ridge begins to build in, and then
readings up to 10 degrees above average for the High Plains by
next Sunday. Generally cooler than normal temperatures are
forecast for the West Coast, influenced by the upper trough and
mainly overcast skies. Ahead of the cold front, it will likely
feel more like late September from the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley
to the East Coast with highs on the order of 5-10 degrees above
average for the middle of the week, although humidity levels
should remain in check. Slightly below normal highs are then
expected behind the cold front.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
205 PM EDT Sun Oct 17 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Oct 20 2021 - 12Z Sun Oct 24 2021

...Overview...

A fairly typical late October weather pattern is expected to be in
place across the majority of the nation during the medium range
forecast period. A surface low and trailing cold front will track
from the Midwest to the Northeast, with the front exiting the East
Coast by the end of the week. A rather active pattern will be in
place across the eastern Pacific with a persistent upper level
trough off the West Coast that will support several shortwaves
rotating around it, along with a couple of cold frontal passages
and rounds of precipitation. Meanwhile, a ridge axis is expected
to briefly build over the Intermountain West and then be
positioned over the Plains by next weekend.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

00Z/06Z model guidance remains in good agreement with the overall
synoptic scale pattern through about Thursday, as positioning of
the closed low over the central U.S. Wednesday appears well
handled by deterministic and ensemble guidance, even as it tracks
eastward into the Great Lakes region and starts getting absorbed
into northern stream flow on Thursday. Guidance is also becoming
more agreeable with a northern stream closed upper low centered
over James Bay Thursday, but uncertainties remain with this flow
over the southeastern quadrant of Canada by Friday. While the 00Z
GFS appears in line with the consensus of 00Z guidance with a
relatively slow track of the upper low eastward, the 06Z GFS lifts
a trough more quickly northeastward, and the new 12Z GFS also
followed this faster track. The 06/12Z GFS runs do appear to be
somewhat fast outliers at this point, while the CMC is slowest,
and the 00Z ECMWF provides a good middle ground solution that
aligns with the 00Z EC and GEFS ensemble means. Overall consensus
does suggest a slightly faster trend with this feature compared to
earlier runs by Friday/Saturday, but likely not as fast as the
recent GFS runs. Troughing is expected across the eastern U.S. by
next weekend, but its amplitude will depend on these northern
stream factors.

While all model guidance shows the overall troughing pattern in
the eastern Pacific, shortwave timing and magnitude differences
persist. The 00Z/06Z GFS runs appear to be a more amplified and
slower outlier with troughing approaching California on Friday,
and even the GEFS ensemble members are generally deeper than
members from the CMC and EC ensemble suites. Once again the ECMWF
seems to show a middle ground solution compared to the deep GFS
runs and the weak UKMET. Differences in deterministic guidance
persist through the weekend with shortwave tracks and if/how they
amplify the broader flow, but fortunately the ensemble mean
guidance seems generally agreeable.

Thus for this forecast, a multi-model blend of the deterministic
ECMWF/GFS/UKMET/CMC was able to be used at the beginning of the
period, generally weighting the ECMWF slightly heavier through the
period. Began leaning away from the 06Z GFS and 00Z CMC by Friday,
while increasing contributions from the ensemble means by next
weekend to reduce individual model issues.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

For the West Coast, surges of moisture along and ahead of cold

moderate to possibly heavy precipitation for northern California

to the East Coast with highs on the order of 5-10 degrees above

should remain in check. Slightly below normal highs are then

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun October 17 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Oct 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

A small Elevated risk area is introduced to northeast NM, southeast
CO, and the far western OK/TX Panhandles. Latest high-res guidance
continues to show considerable spread regarding the quality of
moisture return across the southern and central Plains, but has
shown higher probabilities for sustained RH values near 15% across
NM and southeast CO. Although 20+ mph winds remain most likely
across central OK to central KS, 15-20 mph winds should be common
across the risk area. ERCs generally remain marginal (in the 60-90th
percentile range), but recent 1 and 10-hour fuel moisture analyses
show fuel moisture values below 5 and 10 percent respectively.
Further curing of dormant grasses today should support at least a
low-end fire weather concern Monday afternoon.

..Moore.. 10/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1151 PM CDT Sat Oct 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough in the West will continue eastward and begin
become less of an open wave with time. As this feature approaches
the Four Corners, lee cyclogenesis is expected to occur late in the
period across eastern Colorado. Southerly flow will increase across
a broad area of the Plains.

...Southern/central High Plains...
The greatest fire weather concerns will be focused within this
region on Monday. Southerly return flow will be ongoing from late
Sunday onward. With some moisture advecting northward, along with
mid/upper-level clouds possible in some areas, it is unclear how
long elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions will overlap.
Consequently, most guidance suggests only brief periods of concern
with the exception of the typically drier HRRR solutions. The
longest duration of 15-20% RH and 15-20 mph winds will most likely
occur in northeast New Mexico into southeast Colorado and parts of
western Kansas. Aside from concerns about duration, fuels remain
marginally dry. While some grasses could potentially carry fire by
Monday, concerns remain too localized for highlights.

Valid 00Z Mon Oct 18 2021 - 00Z Wed Oct 20 2021

...Seasonably cool temperatures along the Coasts and the Deep
South; warming up from the Northern Rockies to the Midwest...

...Upper trough to cause accumulating mountain snowfall and lower
elevation rainfall from the Pacific Northwest to the Intermountain
West; lake effect showers in the eastern Great Lakes; showers and
storms possible in South Florida...

After a remarkably warm first half of October along and east of
the Mississippi River, autumn has finally made its long awaited
appearance across the South and along the East Coast. High
temperature departures tonight and into Monday look to range
anywhere from 5 to 15 degrees below normal along the East Coast
and as far south as South Texas. Meanwhile, after a chilly few
days in the central High Plains and Midwest, temperatures will
rebound to abnormally warm levels in these regions. Daytime highs
in these areas will soar into the 70s with some 80s sprinkled in
over the central and southern High Plains. This warm air mass will
eventually shift into the eastern half of the country mid to late
week. Farther west, the West Coast joins the East Coast in
experiencing much cooler temperatures than their neighbors in the
Heartland. As an upper trough tracks into the Intermountain West
on Monday, daily max temperature departures are forecast to range
between 10 and 20 degrees below normal from the central Great
Basin to the California coast.

Precipitation-wise, while much of the country will be dry thanks
to an expansive area of high pressure, there are still a few areas
likely to contend with wet and even snowy weather. An amplifying
upper trough will take aim at the West Coast directing Pacific
moisture at the Pacific Northwest tonight. This will lead to
valley and coastal showers from northern California to western
Washington. Meanwhile, precipitation will fall in the form of snow
in the higher elevations of the northern Sierra Nevada and Oregon
Cascades. Most totals will only range between 2-6 inches, but the
tallest peaks could pick up as much as a foot of snow. As the
upper trough becomes a closed upper low on Monday, the threat for
snow moves east into the Intermountain West with the Tetons, Wind
River, and Absaroka Ranges having the best chances of picking up
6-12 inches of snowfall. Elsewhere, lake effect rain showers are
expected to continue down wind of the Lakes Ontario and Erie. As
the pressure gradient weakens throughout the Great Lakes, bands of
lake effect showers will dissipate sometime Monday. Lastly, the
cold front that ushered in much cooler conditions into the East
will potentially trigger spotty showers and thunderstorms in South
Florida later tonight. Troughing in the Northeast may lead to a
light wintry mix for parts of northern New England Monday night
into Tuesday Morning. Elevated Fire conditions are expected to
continue for parts of the Northern Rockies and Central Plains this
evening due to to higher winds and dry air.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 PM CDT Sun Oct 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong shortwave trough now along the northern California coast
will progress eastward and become more closed off with time. As this
feature nears the Four Corners, a deepening lee trough and
cyclogenesis is expected in the central High Plains. With the
anticyclone maintaining strength within the Southeast, strong
southerly winds are likely across parts of the southern and central
Plains.

...Northeast New Mexico into southeast Colorado...
The deepening lee trough will combine with modestly strengthening
westerly winds aloft to promote breezy conditions during the
afternoon. Surface winds of 15-20 mph are possible and are the
higher confidence portion of the forecast. RH during the afternoon
continues to be rather varied in guidance. The typically dry HRRR
shows a period of about 3-4 hours where elevated to near critical
conditions are possible. With a general moistening trend expected,
dry conditions will depend on downslope winds along the southern
Rockies. Highlights remain where dry grasses exist and where
confidence is highest in a few hours of elevated conditions.

...Mid-Missouri Valley vicinity...
A low-level jet is expected to develop in response to the
approaching shortwave. Some of the stronger winds in the Plains are
expected in this region for that reason. While RH is likely to have
improved from the diurnal minima seen Sunday afternoon, 25-30% is
possible in some areas with localized values near 20%. Locally
elevated fire concerns are possible within cured crops and corn
stover. Confidence in RH and broadly dry fuels is too low for
highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1147 PM CDT Sun Oct 17 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
A compact, nearly closed low at upper levels will move across the
central Rockies and into the central Plains on Monday. Strong
mid-level winds will exist along the southern flank of the low. At
the surface, a lee cyclone will slowly deepen through the day in the
central High Plains. A cold front will eventually move into the
region as the surface low shifts eastward.

...Parts of the southern/central High Plains...
Given the favorable timing of the surface low reaching maximum
strength during the mid/late afternoon, areas of strong surface
winds (15-25 mph) are possible from east-central Colorado into the
northwest Texas Panhandle. The mid-level jet will also be favorably
placed across this region leading to even stronger gusts. More of
southeast Colorado was included in elevated highlights given the
favorable alignment of the mid-level winds with terrain passes where
the strongest winds are expected. Downslope warming and drying could
produce localized RH near 10% with most other areas seeing 15-20%.
Fuels should maintain enough dryness to support fire spread in
conjunction with the elevated to locally critical meteorological
conditions.

***Heavy rainfall potential next weekend from central California
to western Washington***

...Overview...

An active weather pattern will be developing across the western
U.S. by the end of the week as a series of strong storm systems
off the West Coast pivot around a rather pronounced trough over
the northeast Pacific.  This will result in a couple of cold
frontal passages that will progress inland across the
Intermountain West with heavy precipitation and gusty winds.
Meanwhile across the eastern U.S., a cold front and upper level
trough will be exiting the East Coast by Friday with a Canadian
surface high settling southward across the Plains and Midwest.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance for the 00Z cycle is in decent agreement with the
overall synoptic scale pattern through Friday night, particularly
with the timing of the cold front reaching the East Coast and the
first Pacific cold front affecting the West Coast region, so a
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET model blend sufficed as a starting point in the
forecast process.  The 12Z CMC strayed from the model consensus
with an embedded closed low crossing the northern Rockies, but it
was otherwise close to the other guidance.

For the storm system reaching the West Coast Saturday night, the
GFS is a bit more amplified and faster, with height falls
spreading across the Intermountain West sooner that the CMC/ECMWF.
 By the end of the forecast period, the CMC is stronger with a
shortwave trough crossing the central Plains, whereas the ensemble
means are suggesting more of an upper ridge axis here.  For days 6
and 7, the WPC forecast incorporated more of the EC and GEFS
means, while still maintaining some of the operational guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of showers are
expected from northern California to western Washington, and some
of these will likely be moderate to heavy at times with moist
onshore flow ahead of multiple Pacific storm systems.  Some
locations may get on the order of 3 to 6 inches of rain over the
entire forecast period, particularly across windward terrain.
Snow is likely for the highest mountains of the Cascades and
Sierra Nevada, mainly above pass level.  There is some signal in
the model guidance for an atmospheric river event next weekend
ahead of an energetic Pacific storm system across the coastal
ranges of northern California and southwest Oregon.  Strong winds
are also possible near the coast.  By Sunday and into Monday, some
of this moisture is expected to reach the Intermountain West and
the central/northern Rockies.  Across the eastern U.S., a broken
swath of showers and perhaps some thunderstorms can be expected
ahead of the advancing cold front, but the relative dearth of deep
moisture ahead of it will serve to limit the heavy rainfall
potential.

In terms of temperatures, it will feel more like mid November
across much of the Northern Plains in the wake of the departing
storm system on Thursday, with high temperatures running about 5
to 15 degrees below average.  There should be a gradual moderation
in temperatures going through the end of the workweek and into the
weekend as an upper-level ridge begins to build in, and then
readings up to 10 degrees above average for the High Plains by
next Sunday.  Generally cooler than normal temperatures are
forecast for the West Coast, influenced by the upper trough and
mainly overcast skies.  Ahead of the cold front, it will likely
feel more like late September across the East Coast with highs on
the order of 5-10 degrees above average for Thursday, although
humidity levels should remain in check.  Slightly below normal
highs are then expected behind the cold front.

...Upper level low to generate accumulating mountain snowfall from
the Sierra Nevada to the Intermountain West...

...Below normal temperatures to persist in the West; seasonally
cool temperatures along the East and Gulf Coasts to moderate by
mid-week; warmest temperatures versus normal in the Midwest &
Great Lakes...

As a large dome of high pressure keeps a tranquil weather pattern
in place across much of the South and East, the western half of
the Lower 48 will feature the most active weather to kickoff the
work-week. An area of low pressure associated with a potent upper
level low is forecast to track from the northern Great Basin this
morning into the heart of the Intermountain West later today.
Accumulating snowfall in the northern Sierra Nevada will conclude
by this afternoon with several more inches of snow possible. The
storm system will march east into the Rockies by Tuesday and
eventually reach the Great Plains Tuesday night. Lower elevations
can expect rain showers while mountains such as the Uinta, Wind
River, Big Horn, and Laramie ranges could pick up anywhere from 1
to 2 feet of snow between today and Wednesday morning. Much of
central Wyoming is under a Winter Storm Watch in advance of the
impending winter storm. There is no rest in the weather pattern
out West as yet another storm system approaching from the
northeast Pacific ushers in more coastal/valley rain and mountain
snow to the Pacific Northwest Tuesday night into Wednesday.

Temperatures the first half of the week will be coolest versus
normal over the western third of the CONUS. Daily temperature
departures ranging between 10 to 15 degrees below normal are
anticipated today for much of California and Nevada. As the upper
trough responsible for the wintry weather in the Rockies moves
east on Tuesday, temps will cool to below normal levels as it
works in tandem with another cold front pushing south through the
Northern Plains. Meanwhile, seasonally cool temperatures will
stick around in the Deep South and along the East Coast today.
Conditions are cold enough that some parts of western Tennessee
and the southern Appalachians have been placed under Frost
Advisories. Look for temperatures to gradually warm up along the
Gulf and East Coasts, eventually returning to above normal levels
by mid-week. Lastly, the regions witnessing the warmest
temperatures versus normal will be the Midwest and Great Lakes.
Daytime highs will soar into the 70s with some locations
potentially reaching as high as 80 degrees.

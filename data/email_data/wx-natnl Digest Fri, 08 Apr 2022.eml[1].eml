Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1016 AM CDT Thu Apr 07 2022

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF EXTREME
SOUTHWEST KANSAS INTO THE EASTERN OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE...NORTHEAST
TEXAS PANHANDLE...AND FAR WESTERN OKLAHOMA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

An Extremely Critical area was delineated for portions of the
southern High Plains, as guidance has come into better consensus of
30+ mph sustained northwesterly surface winds overlapping with 10-15
percent RH for at least a few hours around afternoon peak heating.
Many surface observations across the High Plains are showing
widespread 30-40 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds (with
higher gusts) and 20-25 percent RH already in place. Given sunny
skies, diurnal heating and associated boundary-layer mixing should
support RH dropping another 10-15 percent through the afternoon.
Forecast ERCs are expected to reach if not exceed the 90th
percentile, where an extreme to locally exceptional drought is in
place. The rest of the forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 04/07/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0113 AM CDT Thu Apr 07 2022/

...Synopsis...
Today will see another round of widespread fire weather concerns
from the central High Plains to the Texas Gulf Coast. A dry
continental air mass continues to overspread the central CONUS with
dewpoints along the High Plains in the single digits after warm,
dry, and windy conditions today. An occluded surface low over the
western Great Lakes will gradually shift east through the day while
a surface high continues to build over the inter-mountain West. The
resulting pressure gradient will support widespread 20-30 mph
sustained winds across the Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Wednesday afternoon saw widespread 20-30 mph winds from the central
to southern Plains. Frequent wind gusts between 40-60 mph were noted
from northwest OK into the central High Plains. Similar wind speeds
are expected this afternoon as the regional pressure gradient
remains in place. Locations that see mostly sunny skies by early
afternoon will experience enough daytime heating/deep mixing to
realize the stronger wind gusts. This appears most likely from
southeast CO and southwest KS into portions of northwest TX. With
single digit dewpoints noted across this region, and further
downslope drying likely, RH values will fall into the low teens and
support widespread critical fire weather conditions. Locations
further to the northeast will see similar sustained winds (though
perhaps slightly lower gusts) with RH values in the 20-30% range.
Ensemble guidance suggests that sustained extremely critical
conditions are unlikely, but at least periodic extreme conditions
are probable from southeast CO into western OK as RH dips below 10%
in conjunction with the higher gusts. These conditions will likely
impact locations that have seen large fire activity over the past
couple of days.

...New Mexico...
Fuels across NM have been trending drier after several days of
warm/dry conditions. An antecedent dry air mass over the greater
Four Corners region will maintain depressed RH values 15% or lower
this afternoon. Winds will increase to 15-20 mph by late afternoon,
supporting widespread elevated conditions (and localized critical
conditions where winds are locally enhanced near terrain features).


...Texas Gulf Coast...
Breezy northerly winds between 15-20 mph will extend across central
TX into the northwest Gulf. The dry air mass currently upstream
across the TX Panhandle and western OK will overspread the region by
peak daytime heating, allowing for RH reductions into the 20-25%
range. Elevated conditions are expected, but localized critical
conditions appear likely. Fuels with ERC values between the 80-90th
percentiles will support the fire weather threat.

...Active weather is likely next week, with heavy snow spreading
from higher elevations of the West into the north-central U.S. and
heavy rain and severe thunderstorm chances in the south-central
CONUS...

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show an amplified pattern in which
one upper trough departs from the East after Sunday while energy
digging in from the northeastern Pacific reinforces western U.S.
mean troughing that should finally emerge into the Plains by
around midweek. There is a decent signal in the guidance that this
pattern should produce active weather over a significant portion
of the lower 48 next week--including rain/snow over the West,
eventually a vigorous low pressure system over the Plains/Upper
Midwest with some snow to the northwest of its track, and a threat
for areas of heavy rainfall plus strong to severe convection over
some southern areas of the central U.S. However within this broad
theme there are a number of uncertainties for details that temper
confidence in specifics of the forecast, not only for the main
area of focus over the western-central U.S. but also frontal
position over the East due to differences in how leading shortwave
energy initially ejecting across the Plains ultimately evolves.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance remains consistent with the upper trough departing
from the East early in the period. And fortunately, the 00/06Z
model cycle (AND NEW 12Z???) is showing better agreement compared
to the last few cycles with the western trough as well, though
with typical lingering differences in the details. One such detail
is leading shortwave energy in the base of the trough over the
northern Rockies/High Plains early Sunday that shows differences
in its ejection across the northern tier and its effects on
frontal position in the north-central and northeastern U.S. by
Monday-Tuesday. The 00Z UKMET and GFS were among the stronger
solutions with this shortwave and pushed the front farther south
compared to the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF and CMC that deflected the
shortwave on the northern side of the ridge. The WPC forecast
leaned toward the latter cluster given continuity and not much
support for the southward extent of the UKMET especially for Great
Lakes shortwave in individual ensemble members.

The next shortwave with notable differences stems from energy in
the Gulf of Alaska in the short term, and is forecast to drop
south across the northeastern Pacific/western Canada coast to form
possibly a potent shortwave near the Pacific Northwest on Monday.
This feature varies somewhat with its position but particularly
varies in strength, which affects a surface low underneath as
well. Most guidance is now indicating a small closed upper low but
the 00Z and new 12Z ECMWF are persistent in showing an open
shortwave farther east in the northwest and a weaker, displaced
surface low. The ensemble spaghetti plots are extremely messy over
the eastern Pacific and western U.S. so detail confidence remains
quite low. The WPC forecast continued with a solution stronger
than the ECMWF but not as strong as the other guidance.

By Tuesday-Thursday, model agreement has improved regarding the
evolution of the trough and its movement, with the 00Z ECMWF a bit
weaker than its previous runs but clustering better with other
guidance. GFS runs since 00Z have been consistent in showing a
solution similar to what the ECMWF has had, namely a upper low
that closes off in the northern Plains Wednesday and moves into
the Midwest Thursday, and the CMC is similar as well. The track of
the associated surface low is also fairly well clustered for the
late medium range period. Thus models all indicate an impactful
storm system across the central U.S. despite differences in the
exact details.

Trailing flow could bring another system toward the Pacific
Northwest by Wednesday-Thursday, which is now advertised by the
bulk of guidance after previous cycles of the GFS did not show
this feature. Despite better agreement now for a system, timing of
the shortwave track remains questionable.

Better agreement between GFS/ECMWF/CMC deterministic guidance led
to the WPC forecast utilizing a blend of these early in the
period, and even maintained a majority of operational models
through the latter part of the period though phased in some EC and
GEFS ensemble means to temper individual model differences.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Early in the period expect the best rain/mountain snow focus to be
over the Pacific Northwest and central West Coast. However the
details of location and intensity are unusually uncertain for a
forecast only 3-4 days out in time as guidance varies widely for
the strength and track of arriving low pressure. Lighter activity
should prevail eastward through the northern Rockies. Then some
moisture should extend southward into the Sierra Nevada, with rain
and mountain snow extending across central and possibly some
southern parts of the West. By Tuesday the southern Montana into
Colorado Rockies and north-central High Plains should begin to see
a favorable combination of upper trough dynamics and low level
upslope flow that would increase precipitation over those areas,
with the High Plains possibly seeing some springtime snow in
addition to the Rockies. Potentially strong low pressure that may
track from the Plains into the Upper Midwest would extend snow
farther northeast across the northern tier along with strong
winds. Meanwhile in the warm sector, there will be increasing
coverage and intensity of rainfall over the eastern
Plains/Mississippi Valley with the establishment of moist low
level flow from the Gulf of Mexico. Persistence of the Gulf inflow
could lead to a couple days or so with a heavy rain threat over or
near the Lower Mississippi Valley. Also the Storm Prediction
Center is monitoring the potential for severe weather over some
southern areas in the central U.S. Check their latest outlooks for
more information. Farther north, a front draped over the Midwest
could also provide a focus for rainfall though likely with lower
totals given less moisture/instability. Lack of confidence in some
specifics of eastern Pacific/western U.S. flow maintains the
potential for some changes in the above most likely scenario.

Colder air moving into the West will initially bring highs down to
as much as 10-20F below normal over the Northwest/northern Rockies
as of Sunday. An area of minus 10-25F anomalies for highs should
then reach into the Intermountain West, Rockies, and
northern-central Plains by next Tuesday-Wednesday. The northern
half of the Plains should still see highs around 15-20F below
normal on Thursday. Sunday should provide the best potential for
some locations in the Northwest to see max temperatures near or
below current record cold highs but Monday could still produce a
few lingering records. Meanwhile most of the eastern half of the
country should trend from mostly below normal temperatures (minus
5-15F anomalies) on Sunday, and potential for a late frost across
parts of the southeastern quadrant of the country, to mostly above
normal readings (plus 5-15F anomalies for highs and perhaps
slightly warmer for morning lows) spreading from west to east
after the weekend. However confidence is lower for exact
temperatures over the northern half of the East due to uncertain
position of a front during the first half of next week.

...Active weather is likely next week, with heavy snow spreading
from higher elevations of the West into the north-central U.S. and
heavy rain and severe thunderstorm chances in the south-central
CONUS...

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show an amplified pattern in which
one upper trough departs from the East after Sunday while energy
digging in from the northeastern Pacific reinforces western U.S.
mean troughing that should finally emerge into the Plains by
around midweek. There is a decent signal in the guidance that this
pattern should produce active weather over a significant portion
of the lower 48 next week--including rain/snow over the West,
eventually a vigorous low pressure system over the Plains/Upper
Midwest with some snow to the northwest of its track, and a threat
for areas of heavy rainfall plus strong to severe convection over
some southern areas of the central U.S. However within this broad
theme there are a number of uncertainties for details that temper
confidence in specifics of the forecast, not only for the main
area of focus over the western-central U.S. but also frontal
position over the East due to differences in how leading shortwave
energy initially ejecting across the Plains ultimately evolves.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance remains consistent with the upper trough departing
from the East early in the period. And fortunately, the 00/06Z
model cycle and the new 12Z cycle is showing better agreement
compared to the last few cycles with the western trough as well,
though with typical lingering differences in the details. One such
detail is leading shortwave energy in the base of the trough over
the northern Rockies/High Plains early Sunday that shows
differences in its ejection across the northern tier and its
effects on frontal position in the north-central and northeastern
U.S. by Monday-Tuesday. The 00Z UKMET and GFS were among the
stronger solutions with this shortwave and pushed the front
farther south compared to the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF and CMC that
deflected the shortwave on the northern side of the ridge. The WPC
forecast leaned toward the latter cluster given continuity and not
much support for the southward extent of the UKMET especially for
Great Lakes shortwave in individual ensemble members.

The next shortwave with notable differences stems from energy in
the Gulf of Alaska in the short term, and is forecast to drop
south across the northeastern Pacific/western Canada coast to form
possibly a potent shortwave near the Pacific Northwest on Monday.
This feature varies somewhat with its position but particularly
varies in strength, which affects a surface low underneath as
well. Most guidance is now indicating a small closed upper low but
the 00Z and new 12Z ECMWF are persistent in showing an open
shortwave farther east in the northwest and a weaker, displaced
surface low. The ensemble spaghetti plots are extremely messy over
the eastern Pacific and western U.S. so detail confidence remains
quite low. The WPC forecast continued with a solution stronger
than the ECMWF but not as strong as the other guidance.

By Tuesday-Thursday, model agreement has improved regarding the
evolution of the trough and its movement, with the 00Z ECMWF a bit
weaker than its previous runs but clustering better with other
guidance. GFS runs since 00Z have been consistent in showing a
solution similar to what the ECMWF has had, namely a upper low
that closes off in the northern Plains Wednesday and moves into
the Midwest Thursday, and the CMC is similar as well. The track of
the associated surface low is also fairly well clustered for the
late medium range period. Thus models all indicate an impactful
storm system across the central U.S. despite differences in the
exact details.

Trailing flow could bring another system toward the Pacific
Northwest by Wednesday-Thursday, which is now advertised by the
bulk of guidance after previous cycles of the GFS did not show
this feature. Despite better agreement now for a system, timing of
the shortwave track remains questionable.

Better agreement between GFS/ECMWF/CMC deterministic guidance led
to the WPC forecast utilizing a blend of these early in the
period, and even maintained a majority of operational models
through the latter part of the period though phased in some EC and
GEFS ensemble means to temper individual model differences.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Early in the period expect the best rain/mountain snow focus to be
over the Pacific Northwest and central West Coast. However the
details of location and intensity are unusually uncertain for a
forecast only 3-4 days out in time as guidance varies widely for
the strength and track of arriving low pressure. Lighter activity
should prevail eastward through the northern Rockies. Then some
moisture should extend southward into the Sierra Nevada, with rain
and mountain snow extending across central and possibly some
southern parts of the West. By Tuesday the southern Montana into
Colorado Rockies and north-central High Plains should begin to see
a favorable combination of upper trough dynamics and low level
upslope flow that would increase precipitation over those areas,
with the High Plains possibly seeing some springtime snow in
addition to the Rockies. Potentially strong low pressure that may
track from the Plains into the Upper Midwest would extend snow
farther northeast across the northern tier along with strong
winds. Meanwhile in the warm sector, there will be increasing
coverage and intensity of rainfall over the eastern
Plains/Mississippi Valley with the establishment of moist low
level flow from the Gulf of Mexico. Persistence of the Gulf inflow
could lead to a couple days or so with a heavy rain threat over or
near the Lower Mississippi Valley. Also the Storm Prediction
Center is monitoring the potential for severe weather over some
southern areas in the central U.S. Check their latest outlooks for
more information. Farther north, a front draped over the Midwest
could also provide a focus for rainfall though likely with lower
totals given less moisture/instability. Lack of confidence in some
specifics of eastern Pacific/western U.S. flow maintains the
potential for some changes in the above most likely scenario.

Colder air moving into the West will initially bring highs down to
as much as 10-20F below normal over the Northwest/northern Rockies
as of Sunday. An area of minus 10-25F anomalies for highs should
then reach into the Intermountain West, Rockies, and
northern-central Plains by next Tuesday-Wednesday. The northern
half of the Plains should still see highs around 15-20F below
normal on Thursday. Sunday should provide the best potential for
some locations in the Northwest to see max temperatures near or
below current record cold highs but Monday could still produce a
few lingering records. Meanwhile most of the eastern half of the
country should trend from mostly below normal temperatures (minus
5-15F anomalies) on Sunday, and potential for a late frost across
parts of the southeastern quadrant of the country, to mostly above
normal readings (plus 5-15F anomalies for highs and perhaps
slightly warmer for morning lows) spreading from west to east
after the weekend. However confidence is lower for exact
temperatures over the northern half of the East due to uncertain
position of a front during the first half of next week.

surface low. The ensemble spaghetti plots are extremely messy over
the eastern Pacific and western U.S. so detail confidence remains
quite low. The WPC forecast continued with a solution stronger
than the ECMWF but not as strong as the other guidance.

By Tuesday-Thursday, model agreement has improved regarding the
evolution of the trough and its movement, with the 00Z ECMWF a bit
weaker than its previous runs but clustering better with other
guidance. GFS runs since 00Z have been consistent in showing a
solution similar to what the ECMWF has had, namely a upper low
that closes off in the northern Plains Wednesday and moves into
the Midwest Thursday, and the CMC is similar as well. The track of
the associated surface low is also fairly well clustered for the
late medium range period. Thus models all indicate an impactful
storm system across the central U.S. despite differences in the
exact details.

Trailing flow could bring another system toward the Pacific
Northwest by Wednesday-Thursday, which is now advertised by the
bulk of guidance after previous cycles of the GFS did not show
this feature. Despite better agreement now for a system, timing of
the shortwave track remains questionable.

Better agreement between GFS/ECMWF/CMC deterministic guidance led
to the WPC forecast utilizing a blend of these early in the
period, and even maintained a majority of operational models
through the latter part of the period though phased in some EC and
GEFS ensemble means to temper individual model differences.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Early in the period expect the best rain/mountain snow focus to be
over the Pacific Northwest and central West Coast. However the
details of location and intensity are unusually uncertain for a
forecast only 3-4 days out in time as guidance varies widely for
the strength and track of arriving low pressure. Lighter activity
should prevail eastward through the northern Rockies. Then some
moisture should extend southward into the Sierra Nevada, with rain
and mountain snow extending across central and possibly some
southern parts of the West. By Tuesday the southern Montana into
Colorado Rockies and north-central High Plains should begin to see
a favorable combination of upper trough dynamics and low level
upslope flow that would increase precipitation over those areas,
with the High Plains possibly seeing some springtime snow in
addition to the Rockies. Potentially strong low pressure that may
track from the Plains into the Upper Midwest would extend snow
farther northeast across the northern tier along with strong
winds. Meanwhile in the warm sector, there will be increasing
coverage and intensity of rainfall over the eastern
Plains/Mississippi Valley with the establishment of moist low
level flow from the Gulf of Mexico. Persistence of the Gulf inflow
could lead to a couple days or so with a heavy rain threat over or
near the Lower Mississippi Valley. Also the Storm Prediction
Center is monitoring the potential for severe weather over some
southern areas in the central U.S. Check their latest outlooks for
more information. Farther north, a front draped over the Midwest
could also provide a focus for rainfall though likely with lower
totals given less moisture/instability. Lack of confidence in some
specifics of eastern Pacific/western U.S. flow maintains the
potential for some changes in the above most likely scenario.

Colder air moving into the West will initially bring highs down to
as much as 10-20F below normal over the Northwest/northern Rockies
as of Sunday. An area of minus 10-25F anomalies for highs should
then reach into the Intermountain West, Rockies, and
northern-central Plains by next Tuesday-Wednesday. The northern
half of the Plains should still see highs around 15-20F below
normal on Thursday. Sunday should provide the best potential for
some locations in the Northwest to see max temperatures near or
below current record cold highs but Monday could still produce a
few lingering records. Meanwhile most of the eastern half of the
country should trend from mostly below normal temperatures (minus
5-15F anomalies) on Sunday, and potential for a late frost across
parts of the southeastern quadrant of the country, to mostly above
normal readings (plus 5-15F anomalies for highs and perhaps
slightly warmer for morning lows) spreading from west to east
after the weekend. However confidence is lower for exact
temperatures over the northern half of the East due to uncertain
position of a front during the first half of next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu April 07 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 13 - 17 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Amplified ridges are predicted with associated positive
500-hPa height anomalies centered over the Chukchi Sea and over the North
Pacific off of the west coast of the CONUS. A trough and associated negativ=
e
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over the western and north-central
CONUS.
A ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the Easter=
n
Seaboard.

Below normal temperatures are likely over the western and most of the centr=
al
CONUS under enhanced northerly mid-level flow. A ridge and slightly above
average 500-hPa heights lead to increased chances of above normal temperatu=
res
for most of the eastern CONUS and along the Gulf Coast. Below normal
temperatures are likely over most of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhand=
le,
while above normal temperatures are favored over part of southwestern Alask=
a,
supported by the temperature consolidation tool.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Central and
Northern High Plains eastward across the eastern half of the CONUS, ahead o=
f
the predicted trough over the western and central CONUS. Above normal
precipitation is likely over parts of the Pacific Northwest, while near to
below normal precipitation is favored over much of the southwestern CONUS,
consistent with the consolidation precipitation tool. Above normal
precipitation is slightly favored across southern Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, while below normal precipitation is most likely over northwester=
n
Mainland Alaska, supported by the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 33% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 34% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 33% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and am=
ong
the temperature and precipitation tools, offset by a changing pattern.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 15 - 21 2022

During the 8-14 day period, a trough is predicted to develop over the North
Pacific to the south of the Alaska Peninsula, while the downstream ridge an=
d
trough are predicted to progress eastward over the CONUS. The week-2 mean
500-hPa circulation pattern in the manual blend of models indicates positiv=
e
500-hPa height anomalies from the Pacific Coast to near the the Rocky
Mountains
and negative height anomalies over most of the remainder of the CONUS, with
near average 500-hPa heights over the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast of the
Southeast.

A ridge and above normal 500-hPa heights increase the likelihood of above
normal temperatures for parts of the southwestern CONUS. Below normal
temperatures are likely over most of the remainder of the CONUS, associated
with a trough and below normal 500-hPa heights over the east-central CONUS.
Above normal temperatures are favored for the Florida Peninsula and near
normal
temperatures are favored for northern New England, consistent with dynamica=
l
model temperature tools. Elevated probabilities of below normal temperature=
s
are forecast over Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, supported by th=
e
dynamical model temperature tools.

Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the eastern CONUS, due to=
 a
predicted trough over the east-central CONUS and the likelihood for a retur=
n
flow of Gulf moisture advecting northward to the west of surface high press=
ure
over the Atlantic. Above normal precipitation probabilities are also elevat=
ed
across most of Washington, while increased probabilities for below normal
precipitation are favored over much of the remainder of the western CONUS
extending eastward to most of the Great Plains and the western Great Lakes
region, consistent with the precipitation consolidation tool. Above normal
precipitation is slightly favored across southeastern Mainland Alaska and t=
he
Alaska Panhandle, supported by dynamical model precipitation tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 33% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 34% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 33% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and am=
ong
the temperature and precipitation tools, offset by a changing pattern.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL NEBRASKA INTO
CENTRAL KANSAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE EASTERN TEXAS
PANHANDLE INTO WESTERN OKLAHOMA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF FAR SOUTHEAST TEXAS INTO
SOUTHERN LOUISIANA...

Elevated highlights have been expanded farther southeast to the Gulf
Coast, with Critical highlights introduced to portions of far
southeastern Texas into southern Louisiana tomorrow/Friday. Latest
guidance consensus depicts up to 20 mph sustained northwesterly
surface winds overlapping 20-30 percent RH, spanning from Houston,
TX to areas west of Lake Pontchartrain tomorrow afternoon. Latest
fuel guidance shows 100-hr fuel moisture less than 10 percent, with
forecast ERCs/Burning Indices exceeding the 90th percentile on a
widespread basis. While surface winds will only fringe on Critical
criteria, the very dry air and critically dry fuels should
compensate to support significant wildfire-growth potential.
Elevated to locally Critical surface meteorological conditions will
also exist further east along the Gulf Coast as well as parts of the
Florida Peninsula and northeast to the Carolina Piedmont. However,
recent appreciable rainfall accumulations should temper fuel
receptiveness and associated widespread wildfire-spread potential.
However, localized wildfire-spread potential will exist tomorrow
afternoon. Otherwise, the previous forecast (see below) remains on
track regarding fire weather conditions across the Plains states.

..Squitieri.. 04/07/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Thu Apr 07 2022/

...Synopsis...
The compact regional pressure gradient over the Plains will abate
slightly on Friday. While this will result in slightly lower speeds
compared to previous days, winds will remain strong enough to
support widespread fire weather concerns over the Plains. The
persistent northerly flow will allow for no moisture return into the
region, and afternoon RH values will largely be dependent on daily
max temperatures. Latest guidance shows reasonably high confidence
in a broad swath of elevated wind/RH conditions through much of the
Plains where fuels are generally very receptive (ERC values at the
85th percentile or higher). Critical conditions are possible across
much of the broader Elevated risk area, but Critical delineations
are made where confidence in sustained 20+ mph winds is highest.

...Texas Panhandle into western Oklahoma...
Widespread RH reductions between 10-15% are expected from eastern NM
into western OK Friday afternoon. With the surface high gradually
shifting east, the strongest gradient winds over the southern High
Plains will likely develop between the I-27 and I-35 corridors.
Ensemble guidance suggests the highest probability for sustained
critical wind/RH conditions lies across the eastern TX Panhandle and
western OK, but refinement of the risk area is possible as guidance
comes into better agreement regarding regional details.

...Central Plains...
20-25 mph northerly winds appear likely across NE and KS Friday
afternoon. Despite an influx of cooler temperatures, daytime heating
should support enough warming/mixing for RH reductions near 20% and
possibly as low as 15%. As with the southern High Plains, most
solutions show critical wind/RH conditions across the central
Plains, but spread in the exact coverage is noted. Ensemble guidance
shows reasonably high probability for sustained Critical conditions
across central NE to north-central KS, but an expansion to this area
is possible.

...Southern California and northern Nevada...
Elevated wind/RH conditions are expected across the higher terrain
of the south California coast and across northern Nevada through the
day Friday. Drier solutions hint that localized critical conditions
are possible for both regions, but latest fuel guidance for both
coastal CA and northern NV suggest live fuel moisture remains too
high to support a more robust fire weather concern.

US Hazards Outlook

300 PM EDT April 07 2022

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast across the east-central
contiguous
U.S. during week-2, with a surface low pressure favored to track across the
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes at the outset of the period. As a result=
,
impacts related to heavy rainfall are forecast across much of the eastern U=
.S.
This surface low is forecast to move out quickly, but the mid-level pattern
looks to become less progressive later in week-2, with mid-level low pressu=
re
persisting over the eastern half of the contiguous states. Some indicators
show
this pattern generating another strong surface low pressure tracking across
the
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes late in the period, although its strengt=
h
and track are uncertain. This could result in a stalled frontal boundary ov=
er
the Eastern States, potentially serving as a focus for several rounds of he=
avy
precipitation through the week-2 period. Anomalously cold temperatures will
likely be pulled southward into much of the U.S. behind the  storm system,
leading to a good chance for much below normal temperatures in parts of the
Plains early week-2, with lesser chances covering a large area away from th=
e
U.S. Coasts. The exiting system also brings increased chances for high wind=
s
to
most of the eastern half of the U.S. through the middle of week-2. Easterly
surface flow is expected across Alaska, decreasing toward the middle of
week-2.
This favors increased chances for below normal temperatures over most of th=
e
state.



HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across portions of the cent=
ral
and northern Plains, Fri-Sat, Apr 15-16.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the COMUS away
from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf Coasts, Fri-Thu, Apr 15-21.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of the southeastern quadrant of
the
CONUS, and along the Eastern Seaboard, Fri-Thu, Apr 15-21.

Slight risk for high winds across the eastern half of the CONUS, Fri-Mon,  =
Apr
15-18.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across eastern Mainland Alask=
a,
and the Panhandle, Fri-Mon, Apr 15-18.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North and the Illinois River.



DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 15 - THURSDAY APRIL 21: Models are in good agreement showi=
ng
anomalous troughing and an associated surface low pressure tracking across =
the
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes at the outset of week-2. Most models als=
o
show a less-progressive weather pattern evolving later week-2, which could
lead
to another strong surface low pressure taking a track similar to the leadin=
g
storm system. Models are not in good agreement on the evolution of this
potential storm, although the position of the mean central CONUS trough wou=
ld
favor some sort of low pressure system in the central or eastern states. Mo=
st
of the impacts with the initial storm system are forecast to be more focuse=
d
on
days 6 and 7, winding down and moving into eastern Canada by day-8. However=
,
the position of the mid-level trough could result in a stalled frontal syst=
em
across the southeastern quadrant of the CONUS and along the I-95 corridor,
enhancing chances for heavy precipitation throughout the week-2 period. In
addition, on the backside of the mid-level trough and surface storm system,=
 a
tight pressure gradient enhances the chances for high winds across the enti=
re
eastern half of the CONUS, with the ECMWF ensemble re-forecast tools being
more
robust than the GEFS re-forecast tool. The evolution of the surface storm
system and the re-forecast tools favor much below normal temperatures
immediately behind the system early week-2, and the developing less-
progressive
pattern may keep much below normal temperatures across almost the entire CO=
NUS
during week-2, with the best chances for much below normal temperatures mov=
ing
eastward with time. Re-forecast tools favor subfreezing temperatures as far
south as the southern Rockies and south-central Plains early in the period,
with at least a 20 percent chance of much below normal temperatures farther
east toward the end of week-2, dropping below 40=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF into th=
e upper Southeast
and
the southern half of the Appalachians later in the period.



Strong easterly surface flow is forecast over much of Alaska during week-2,
supporting increased cold air advection out of western Canada. This creates=
 a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures in eastern Mainland Alaska an=
d
the Panhandle from 4/15-4/18, but models are not as bullish on much below
normal temperatures as they were yesterday, especially over southern parts =
of
the hazard area.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1053 AM CST Fri Feb 04 2022

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

The Elevated area in southern AZ was expanded slightly southeastward
into Santa Cruz County. Here, RAP forecast soundings show modest
boundary-layer mixing and related RH reductions into the
middle/upper teens amidst 15-20 mph easterly surface winds this
afternoon. Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains on track (see
below).

..Weinman.. 02/04/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0110 AM CST Fri Feb 04 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential will be low across the eastern two-thirds of
the CONUS today as an arctic air mass remains entrenched.
Early-morning surface pressure analysis reveals a broad region of
high pressure from the inter-mountain West into the Plains in the
wake of a departing upper-level trough. While this will limit winds
across much of the central U.S., it will support strong offshore
flow for southern CA and breezy winds across southwest AZ.

...Southwest AZ...
A compact shortwave trough is noted in water-vapor imagery moving
southward along the West Coast, which will induce surface pressure
falls off the southern CA shore. Juxtaposed with the surface high to
the north/northeast, gradient winds will increase over the next
12-24 hours. Ensemble guidance shows relatively high probability for
15-20 mph winds, and RH values are expected to fall into the low to
mid teens. While ERC values are somewhat marginal, 10-hour fuel
moisture has fallen to 3-4% across the region after minimal rainfall
over the past week. This should support a low-end fire weather
threat for this afternoon.

...Coastal Southern CA...
The pressure gradient across southern CA is forecast to strengthen
through tonight as the aforementioned shortwave trough approaches
the region. Surface observations already show winds increasing to
30-40 mph, which should increase to 40-50 mph within the coastal
terrain by late morning. Downslope warming/drying will support RH
reductions into the low teens. While elevated to critical wind/RH
combinations appear likely, fuels remain largely unreceptive per
latest fuel guidance.

reinforcing the trough for much of next week, and a surface low
developing off the East Coast through Tuesday.  An anomalous
closed upper high evolves just off the West Coast for the second
half of next week as part of a +PNA pattern, and this favors a
broad trough east of the Rockies with mainly dry conditions for
most locations.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest deterministic model guidance and ensemble means are
generally in reasonable agreement with the upper-pattern through
the first half of the medium range forecast period, with some
minor timing differences noted with the individual shortwaves east
of the Rockies. The biggest differences involve the evolution of
East coast low pressure Monday onward. The 0Z ECMWF presents a
slower, more northerly surface track to the initial Southeast
surface wave, while the GFS is quicker to push the low out to sea
(with a slightly deeper system noted on the 12z run). Meanwhile,
the 12Z CMC and UKMET have a similar low track to the ECMWF, but
are more bullish with the system strength. To resolve this
uncertainty, used a deterministic blend to obtain a middle ground
solution for the between the various model camps for days 3-5.
Beyond Tuesday, growing spread with the depth and subsequent
evolution of upstream Great Lakes frontal systems supported an
ensemble blend slightly weighted toward the 0Z ECMWF and 6Z GEFS
ensemble means for days 6-7. In general, this blending approach
yielded good continuity with the overnight WPC forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A developing low pressure system off the North Carolina coast
early in the week is likely to be close enough to produce a cold
rain across eastern portions of the Mid-Atlantic region through
early Tuesday, with the potential for snow on the northwestern
edge of this precipitation.  This threat may also affect eastern
New England depending on the eventual track of the surface low, so
this event will continued to be monitored for future trends.
Elsewhere across the nation, mainly dry conditions are expected
for most areas, with the exception of some rain/mountain snow for
western Washington early in the week, and patchy areas of light
snow across portions of the north-central U.S. and the Great Lakes
region in association with the clipper systems.

Temperatures are expected to generally remain below normal across
much of the south-central U.S. for the beginning of the week,
albeit on a moderating trend compared to the well below average
readings expected this weekend.  Readings across the central and
northern Plains are likely to become 10-20 degrees above average,
and near average for most of the East Coast region through the
middle of next week.  Above average temperatures can be expected
for the entire week for the West Coast region owing to the large
upper ridge encroaching from the eastern Pacific.

The overall theme for this forecast period remains a West Coast

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes have been
made with this update. In addition to the fire-weather concerns
described below, locally elevated conditions appear possible across
parts of Southwest AZ on Saturday afternoon -- where a modest
offshore pressure gradient and deep/dry boundary layer will develop.
The brief and localized nature of these conditions casts uncertainty
on the overall fire-weather threat, precluding highlights at this
time.

..Weinman.. 02/04/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0129 AM CST Fri Feb 04 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential remains low for Saturday due to cold
temperatures across the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS and
generally high fuel moisture. An upper-level trough, currently over
the northeast Pacific, is forecast to shift into the north-central
CONUS by late Saturday. This will help deepen a low over the
northern Plains that will induce breezy and warm conditions across
the central Plains. Elevated wind/RH conditions are possible across
parts of SD and NE, but low confidence in the RH forecast and
marginal fuel status mitigate a more robust threat.

Across southern California, offshore winds will continue into
Saturday, but may be weaker and more localized compared to Friday as
the regional pressure gradient slackens. Gusty winds up to 30-40 mph
will likely persist within the lee of higher terrain features with
pockets of RH values in the low teens. Localized elevated conditions
are likely, but fuels will likely remain too moist to support a more
robust threat.

...Major and expansive winter storm finally exiting the
Northeast...

...Bitterly cold temperatures will span an area from the Southern
Plains to the Ohio Valley and Northeast, but with a gradual
warm-up expected over areas of the South by later this weekend...

...Light snow accumulations expected over the Upper Midwest and
northern Great Lakes on Saturday...

The major and expansive winter storm that has impacted areas of
the South, the Midwest and the Northeast over the last couple of
days is finally beginning to exit offshore of New England and will
be pulling away from the U.S. overnight. A strong cold front
associated with the departing winter storm will be clearing much
of the East Coast, and this will allow for some of the Arctic air
over the Midwest and Great Lakes region to surge southeastward and
encompass New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and portions of Southeast
going through the weekend. Despite the colder temperatures, high
pressure will arrive and foster a much more tranquil weather
pattern over the next few days. However, the there will still be a
threat for showers down across the Florida Peninsula this weekend
as close proximity of the front, an increase in Atlantic onshore
flow, and development of a weak area of low pressure off the east
coast of Florida helps to keep moisture focused over the region.

Meanwhile, bitterly cold air that has already infiltrated areas of
the South, and especially the southern Plains region, will begin
to gradually moderate going through the weekend. However, morning
low temperatures for Saturday across areas of Arkansas, Oklahoma
and Texas are forecast to be only in the single digits and teens
which will be as much as 15 to 25 degrees below average. This will
likely be record-setting cold for a number of locations. High
temperatures though for many of these areas will at least be able
to start warming above freezing this weekend which will help
facilitate the thawing out process in the wake of the most recent
winter storm. However, farther to the northeast, temperatures
across the Ohio Valley and Northeast that saw locally significant
snow and ice accumulations will still see bitterly cold
temperatures for much of the weekend. Low temperatures here this
weekend will locally be below zero or in the single digits with
daytime highs remaining well below freezing.

A weak area of low pressure will be dropping southeast on Saturday
across the northern Plains, Upper Midwest and Great Lakes region,
and this will bring a swath of accumulating snow for areas of
northern Minnesota and the U.P. of Michigan where locally several
inches are expected. In behind the departing low center and
associated cold front, there will be a renewed shot of Arctic air
arriving down across the Upper Midwest from southern Canada.
However, on the warm side of this same front, temperatures farther
back to the west across the central and northern High Plains are
expected to be much milder with temperatures warming to as much as
10 to 15 degrees above average this weekend.

Elsewhere, the weekend weather pattern will be dry, and especially
over the Western U.S. thanks to a large area of high pressure that
will remain in place across the region.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri February 04 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 10 - 14 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting a moderately
amplified 500-hPa flow pattern across the forecast domain. Cyclonic flow is
generally forecast to dominate most of North America with two distinct trou=
ghs
featured within the broader flow. The first is a broad northern stream trou=
gh
predicted across east-central North America, extending from north of Hudson
Bay
southward to the Gulf Coast with forecast below normal heights over the
eastern
half of the CONUS. The second is a shortwave trough located over the
southwestern CONUS, associated with a very strong ridge predicted upstream
just
off the Pacific Northwest Coast. Upstream mean troughing is forecast to
persist
over the western Aleutians and much of the Bering Sea, leading to predicted
below normal heights for much of Alaska excluding the Panhandle and
southeastern Mainland.

Below normal temperatures are favored for much of western Alaska associated
with a trough forecast over the Bering Strait in the period. Above normal
temperatures are likely for parts of southeastern Alaska, as well as the
western CONUS due to the predicted ridge over the eastern North Pacific.
Toughing forecast over the southwestern and south-central CONUS favors
increased chances of below normal temperatures for the Southern Rockies and
parts of the Southern Plains. Above normal temperature probabilities are
enhanced for the Northern and Central Plains, due to the potential for
downslope flow. Near to above normal temperatures are favored for parts of =
the
Northeast, consistent with a moderating trend associated with positive 500-=
hPa
height anomalies. Conversely, near and below normal temperatures are favore=
d
from the Great Lakes to the remainder of the eastern CONUS.

The combination of the trough predicted over the Bering Strait and the ridg=
e
forecast over the eastern North Pacific favors enhanced southwesterly flow =
and
an active pattern across much of Alaska. Therefore, enhanced odds of above
normal precipitation are indicated across most of the state. A drier than
normal pattern is favored across much of the western CONUS, downstream of t=
he
Pacific ridge. Below normal precipitation is also likely from the Central a=
nd
Southern Plains eastward to much of the eastern CONUS, associated with mean
surface high pressure. Conversely, weak disturbances may affect parts of th=
e
Northern Plains and upper Great Lakes, leading to slightly elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 12 - 18 2022

During the week-2 period, the overall 500-hPa flow pattern across western
North
America is likely to be dominated by very strong ridging predicted over the
eastern North Pacific. This ridge is forecast to continue strengthening and=
 to
retrograde, leading to height rises for much of southern Alaska. Farther to
the
east, mid-level low pressure is forecast near the Davis Strait, with a broa=
d
area of predicted below normal heights stretching across much of the easter=
n
CONUS.

Above normal temperatures are slightly favored for eastern Alaska and the
Alaska Panhandle, near the predicted ridge over the eastern North Pacific.
Conversely, below normal temperatures are favored for western Alaska,
associated with a trough forecast over the Bering Strait during the period.
Near to above normal temperatures are favored for the western CONUS,
consistent
with above normal 500 hPa height anomalies. Above normal temperature
probabilities are slightly enhanced for parts of the Northern and Central
Plains due to the potential for downslope flow.  As a mean trough is foreca=
st
across the central and eastern CONUS, below normal temperatures are favored
for
parts of the Central and Southern Plains, Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, =
and
the eastern CONUS.

An active pattern is likely to continue into week-2 across much of Alaska
underneath enhanced southwesterly mid-level flow, leading to elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation for most of the state. Below
normal
precipitation is most likely across the western CONUS, associated with stro=
ng
ridging forecast off the West Coast. Due to shortwave troughs in the northe=
rn
stream, above normal precipitation is slightly favored over parts of the
Northern Rockies, Northern Plains, and Great Lakes. Conversely, near to bel=
ow
normal precipitation is favored over the remainder of the central and easte=
rn
CONUS based on the likelihood of prevalent surface high pressure.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red

Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern, off=
set
by some disagreement among the temperature tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 17.

310 PM EST Fri Feb 04 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 07 2022 - 12Z Fri Feb 11 2022

...Overview...

The overall theme for this forecast period remains a West Coast
ridge and broad cyclonic flow aloft over the eastern half of the
nation, with multiple northern stream shortwaves/clipper systems
reinforcing the trough for much of next week, and a surface low
developing off the East Coast through Tuesday.  An anomalous
closed upper high evolves just off the West Coast for the second
half of next week as part of a +PNA pattern, and this favors a
broad trough east of the Rockies with mainly dry conditions for
most locations.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest deterministic model guidance and ensemble means are
generally in reasonable agreement with the upper-pattern through
the first half of the medium range forecast period, with some
minor timing differences noted with the individual shortwaves east
of the Rockies. The biggest differences involve the evolution of
East coast low pressure Monday onward. The 0Z ECMWF presents a
slower, more northerly surface track to the initial Southeast
surface wave, while the GFS is quicker to push the low out to sea
(with a slightly deeper system noted on the 12z run). Meanwhile,
the 12Z CMC and UKMET have a similar low track to the ECMWF, but
are more bullish with the system strength. To resolve this
uncertainty, used a deterministic blend to obtain a middle ground
solution for the between the various model camps for days 3-5.
Beyond Tuesday, growing spread with the depth and subsequent
evolution of upstream Great Lakes frontal systems supported an
ensemble blend slightly weighted toward the 0Z ECMWF and 6Z GEFS
ensemble means for days 6-7. In general, this blending approach
yielded good continuity with the overnight WPC forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A developing low pressure system off the North Carolina coast
early in the week is likely to be close enough to produce a cold
rain across eastern portions of the Mid-Atlantic region through
early Tuesday, with the potential for snow on the northwestern
edge of this precipitation.  This threat may also affect eastern
New England depending on the eventual track of the surface low, so
this event will continued to be monitored for future trends.
Elsewhere across the nation, mainly dry conditions are expected
for most areas, with the exception of some rain/mountain snow for
western Washington early in the week, and patchy areas of light
snow across portions of the north-central U.S. and the Great Lakes
region in association with the clipper systems.

Temperatures are expected to generally remain below normal across
much of the south-central U.S. for the beginning of the week,
albeit on a moderating trend compared to the well below average
readings expected this weekend.  Readings across the central and
northern Plains are likely to become 10-20 degrees above average,
and near average for most of the East Coast region through the
middle of next week.  Above average temperatures can be expected
for the entire week for the West Coast region owing to the large
upper ridge encroaching from the eastern Pacific.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 04 2022

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast to strengthen and expand
northwest from the West Coast of the contiguous 48 states to Alaska during
mid-February. This would lead to a drier-than-normal pattern for western No=
rth
America, with an expected lack of significant storms in the remainder of th=
e
contiguous U.S. (CONUS) until late in week-2. Below-normal temperatures
initially in parts of Alaska will slowly moderate and lift out as the mid-
level
high pressure expands westward into the state. This pattern would also brin=
g
anomalous cold into central and eastern parts of the contiguous states that
slowly drifts eastward and moderates later in the period. The greatest chan=
ce
for much below normal temperatures are anticipated for western Alaska and n=
ear
the Great Lakes.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for western Alaska, Sat-Tue, =
Feb
12-15.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the eastern CONUS=
,
Sat-Tue, Feb 12-15.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY FEBRUARY 07 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 11:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 12 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 18: The GFS and ECMWF ensembles
favor a similar mean longwave pattern during week-2. The anomalous North
Pacific mid-level ridge is centered slightly farther south than yesterday, =
and
500-hPa heights are slightly higher in the downstream trough over eastern
North
America. Farther east, the flat mid-level mean ridge in the North Atlantic =
has
shifted farther east. But despite model solutions being slightly less
amplified
than yesterday, the ridge-to-trough pattern from the North Pacific across
North
America remains pronounced.



The GEFS and the European ensemble reforecast tools have come into better
agreement today compared to yesterday, but the GEFS still brings somewhat
colder air into the eastern half of the country a little more quickly than =
the
European, translating to greater chances for much below normal temperatures=
 in
the GEFS reforecast tool, especially early week-2. On days 8 and 9 (Feb 12 =
to
13), The GEFS reforecast tool depicts 30 to 50 percent chances for much bel=
ow
normal temperatures (less than the 15th percentile) over the Great Lakes an=
d
adjacent areas while the European ensembles reforecast tool shows only
slightly
elevated chances starting day 9 (Feb 13). As week-2 progresses, the GEFS an=
d
European ensemble reforecast tools come into better agreement, with the GEF=
S
reforecast tool showing enhanced chances for much below normal temperatures
shifting eastward and decreasing in likelihood, coming into better agreemen=
t
with the European ensembles reforecast tool after day 9. Both tools show
moderating temperatures into the eastern CONUS toward the end of week-2.



The model ensemble suites both hinted that the cold air may push farther so=
uth
than initially shown earlier, and this trend continues today in both the GE=
FS
and the European ensemble reforecast tools. Both show modestly elevated
chances
for much below normal temperatures beginning day 9 (Feb 13) in the Lower Oh=
io
Valley and Southeastern CONUS (one day later than farther north) and extend=
ing
through day 11. Chances for subfreezing temperatures reach 40 percent to ju=
st
north of the immediate Gulf Coast in both the GEFS and European ensemble
reforecast tools. Temperatures begin to moderate after the middle of week-2=
,
as
they do farther north. Despite these differences, a slight risk of much bel=
ow
normal temperatures is indicated for much of the eastern CONUS Feb 12-15.



The GEFS and European ensembles also better resemble each other than yester=
day
across Alaska, but the European ensemble reforecast tool still shows better
chances of more extreme temperatures than the GEFS. Both reforecast tools h=
ave
20 to 40 percent chances for minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile along the western tier of the state to start week-2, but the
European ensemble reforecast tool shows elevated chances for minimum
temperatures to reach below the 15th percentile farther east across the
Alaskan
interior to near the Canadian border. The GEFS reforecast tool restricts
increased chances for much below normal temperatures western tier of the
state.
The slight risk for much below normal temperatures limits the hazard to
western
Alaska, where both the GEFS and European ensemble reforecast tools show an
increase in the likelihood for extreme cold weather (temperatures below the
15th percentile) approaching 30 percent. As in the eastern CONUS, both
reforecast tools reduce chances for reaching much below normal temperature
thresholds toward the end of week-2.



The prevailing mid-level pattern is not conducive to stormy weather nor hea=
vy
precipitation across the vast majority of North America. Wet and breezy
weather
could visit coastal south-central and southeastern parts of Alaska, but
conditions should not be too far removed from normal. At the tail end of
week-2, most models bring surface low pressure and increased precipitation
(abetted by an influx of Gulf of Mexico moisture) into parts of the
Mississippi
Valley and Upper Midwest, especially the European ensembles reforecast tool=
s
and the operational GFS. But at this time, there appears to be little chanc=
e
of
precipitation totals exceeding one inch. On the northwestern periphery of t=
his
feature, much of the precipitation could fall as snow, with a few inches
likely
across some parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley and Corn Belt. However,
models are inconsistent depicting both the location and intensity of any
snowfall, so no related hazards are posted at this time.

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential appears low today due to widespread cool
temperatures and moist fuels across much of the central/eastern
CONUS. Localized, low-end fire weather concerns are possible across
parts of the central and southern High Plains, where breezy
downslope winds will support RH reductions to near 25% amid
marginally dry fuels. Coastal southern CA and adjacent areas of
southwest AZ will see another day of dry conditions with RH values
in the low to mid teens. Breezy conditions are expected this
afternoon, but any stronger gusts will be more localized and
transient compared to Friday due to a weaker regional pressure
gradient. Latest fuel guidance continues to show near seasonal ERC
values for this region, which further mitigates a more robust fire
weather concern.

Extended Forecast Discussion

148 AM EST Sat Feb 5 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Feb 8 2022 - 12Z Sat Feb 12 2022

...Overview...

The overall theme for this forecast period remains a West Coast
ridge and broad cyclonic flow aloft over the eastern half of the
nation.  There will be a few northern stream shortwaves/clipper
systems reinforcing the trough for much of next week, and a
surface low developing off the East Coast through Tuesday night.
An anomalous closed upper high evolves just off the West Coast for
the second half of next week as part of a +PNA pattern, and this
favors a broad trough east of the Rockies with mainly dry
conditions for most locations through next Saturday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest deterministic model guidance and ensemble means are
generally in reasonable agreement with the upper-pattern through
the first half of the medium range forecast period, with some
minor timing differences noted with the individual shortwaves east
of the Rockies.  By next weekend, more noteworthy timing
differences exist with a shortwave trough dropping south from
western Canada, with the CMC/ECMWF solutions faster than the GFS,
while there is still good agreement on the strength of the West
Coast upper ridge.  To account for the increasing uncertainty with
shortwave timing across the central/eastern U.S. for
Friday/Saturday, a majority of the ensemble means was used as a
starting point in the forecast process, whereas a
multi-deterministic blend worked well for the middle of the week.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A developing low pressure system off the Mid-Atlantic coast early
in the week is likely to be close enough to produce a cold rain
across eastern portions of New England and perhaps some snow for
inland locations, depending on the eventual track of the surface
low, so this event will continued to be monitored for future
trends.  Elsewhere across the nation, mainly dry conditions are
expected for most areas, with the exception of some patchy areas
of light snow over the Great Lakes region in association with the
clipper systems, and some showers near the east coast of Florida
with post-frontal onshore flow.

Temperatures are expected to generally be near to slightly below
normal across much of the south-central U.S. and the East Coast
region for the middle of the week, and this is a moderating trend
compared to the well below average readings expected this weekend
for many areas.  Readings across the central and northern Plains
are expected to be about 10-20 degrees above average, and this can
also be expected for the entire week for the West Coast region
owing to the large upper ridge encroaching from the eastern
Pacific.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will once again be limited on Sunday as a cold
front sweeps southward through the Plains, ushering in another round
of cool temperatures and only modest RH reductions. Height rises
along the West Coast will help strengthen the mid-level pressure
gradient over southern CA. Improving wind support aloft, combined
with a strengthening surface high over the inter-mountain West, will
yield another day of moderate Santa Ana winds along the southern CA
coast. Wind gusts up to 30-50 mph are possible within the higher
terrain and RH reductions into the low teens are probable. However,
live fuel moisture remains too high to support a more appreciable
fire weather threat. Elevated conditions may evolve across parts of
southwest AZ where 10-hour fuel moisture is between 3-5%, but
confidence in the coverage and duration of such conditions is too
low for highlights.

...Bitterly cold temperatures will span an area from the Southern
Plains to the Ohio Valley and Northeast today; gradual warm-up
expected on Sunday..

...Light snow accumulations expected over the Upper Midwest and
northern Great Lakes...

...Wet weather possible in the Southeast and South Texas to close
out the weekend...

A more tranquil stretch of weather is on tap this weekend thanks
to a pair of high pressure systems setting up over the eastern and
western thirds of the Lower 48. The dome of high pressure in the
East is keeping temperatures abnormally cold from the Southern
Plains to the East Coast today. The coldest temperature anomalies
will be located in Texas and the Middle Mississippi Valley where
they look to range between 15 and 25 degrees below normal. In
fact, record cold morning lows may be broken in areas of
south-central Texas. In the Upper Midwest, subzero morning lows
are expected with lingering breezy winds prompting the issuance of
Wind Chill Advisories in parts of Iowa and Illinois. Chilly
temperatures will be common up and down the East Coast today with
the lone exception being South Florida. By Sunday, the Arctic
air-mass engulfing much of the South and East moderates to more
seasonally cool levels. Mostly dry conditions are in store for
most residents from the Great Plains to the Northeast this
weekend, which comes as a welcome sight for those who dealt with
the winter storm in recent days. In the West, the other ridge of
high pressure is leading to the opposite temperature regime along
the West Coast where a milder air-mass will set up shop for the
weekend. Similar to their neighbors to the East, the West is also
forecast to stay mostly dry. Abnormally mild temperatures are also
anticipated in the Northern Plains where a passing warm front
ushers in more March-like temperatures to the region.

There are a few areas that will contend with some unsettled
weather this weekend. A weak area of low pressure dropping
southeast across the Northern Plains, Upper Midwest, and Great
Lakes regions will bring a swath of accumulating snow for areas of
northern Minnesota and the U.P. of Michigan. Several inches of
snow are expected with totals over six inches possible in the U.P.
of Michigan. Meanwhile, the upper trough pushing the
aforementioned low pressure eastward is set to produce light
snowfall accumulations in parts of the northern and central
Rockies. This upper trough is also responsible for a surge in
strong winds across "Big Sky Country", resulting in High Wind
Warnings for parts of Montana early this morning. Off the
Southeast coast, a stalled frontal boundary will foster a
favorable environment for a developing wave of low pressure along
it by Sunday. Spotty showers and even a few thunderstorms are
possible in Florida and as far north as southern Georgia and South
Carolina by Sunday evening. Lastly, an upper trough over western
Mexico will eject east towards Texas Sunday night, leading to the
development of showers and potentially some thunderstorms Sunday
night into Monday morning across far South Texas.

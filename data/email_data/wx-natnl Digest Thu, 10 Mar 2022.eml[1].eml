Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1058 AM CST Wed Mar 09 2022

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

No changes. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 03/09/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0127 AM CST Wed Mar 09 2022/

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow will prevail across the south-central U.S today.
During the day, a mid-level impulse embedded in the broader cyclonic
upper flow will impinge on the Plains states, encouraging the
development and intensification of a surface low across the southern
High Plains. To the west of the low, critically dry and windy
conditions will develop and support wildfire-spread potential.

...Southern High Plains...
By afternoon, intensifying gradient flow from the passing surface
cyclone will support 20+ mph sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds coinciding with 15 percent RH from roughly 20-00Z across much
of central, southern, and eastern New Mexico into the Oklahoma/Texas
Panhandles, and the Trans Pecos region of southwest Texas. Low-end
Critical fire weather conditions are expected given that fuels
remain modestly receptive to wildfire spread (i.e. forecast ERCs in
the 60-80 percent range). However, guidance has trended weaker with
the surface winds, and the latest guidance consensus does indicate
the potential for some high-level cloud cover across central New
Mexico, which may reduce boundary-layer mixing. If guidance
continues to trend weaker with the winds, the Critical area may need
to be removed for the 17Z Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook update.

No changes. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 03/09/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CST Wed Mar 09 2022/

...Synopsis...
Another in a series of mid-level impulses embedded in the larger
scale cyclonic upper flow regime will traverse the Southwest
tomorrow/Thursday, supporting surface low development across central
New Mexico. Dry and windy surface conditions will result, with 15-25
mph sustained westerly surface winds overlapping 15-20 percent RH
during the mid to late afternoon hours, mainly across southern New
Mexico into the Trans Pecos region of southwest Texas. Elevated
highlights have been introduced to address the wildfire-spread
threat. Concerns for mid-level cloud cover exist over the Elevated
area, and forecast ERCs are expected to be in the 60-70 percent
range where the best surface wind/RH overlap will occur, precluding
the introduction of Critical highlights this outlook. Critical
highlights may be introduced in future outlooks if concerns with
cloud cover are resolved and guidance trends upward in surface wind
speeds.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1247 AM CST Thu Mar 10 2022

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
An amplifying mid-level trough, embedded in the larger scale
cyclonic upper flow regime, will impinge on the southern Rockies
today, supporting surface low development across central New Mexico,
and encouraging dry and windy conditions across southern New Mexico
into far west Texas. Elevated highlights have been introduced where
15-25 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds will coincide
with 10-20 percent RH through the mid to late afternoon hours. While
Critical meteorological conditions will most likely develop across
southwestern into central New Mexico, forecast ERCs are expected to
reach the 60th-70th percentiles, suggesting that fuels may not be
quite dry enough to support a widespread, robust wildfire-spread
threat. Fuels are drier near the Trans Pecos, where forecast ERCs
may reach the 80th-90th percentiles. However, westerly surface winds
may sustain only in the 15-20 mph range, which is below Critical
criteria. Nonetheless, the modest fuel receptiveness and dry/windy
conditions should foster high-end Elevated conditions through the
afternoon.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
156 AM EST Thu Mar 10 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 13 2022 - 12Z Thu Mar 17 2022

...Overview...

An amplified trough and associated very deep cyclone will be
exiting the East Coast early Sunday with a modified but chilly
airmass behind. Meanwhile, an active pattern looks to return to
the Pacific Northwest with a couple of shortwaves -- the first
moving through on Sunday and the next one Monday into Tuesday. The
first wave will dive southeast to the Gulf Coast and shift across
the Southeast early to mid next week. The second, stronger wave,
will bring a quick atmospheric river to the region before becoming
more positively tilted and slowly make its way across the West
Wednesday into Thursday. In between, upper ridging will build
across the central U.S. and into the Midwest.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Plenty of uncertainty continues surrounding the initial shortwave
into the Pacific Northwest early Sunday. Right off the bat, the
12z/Mar 9 CMC (most recent run at forecast issuance time) was much
flatter than the consensus, resulting in a quicker wave through
the central/eastern U.S., so it was excluded from the medium range
blend tonight. However, the new 00z run did come in looking more
amplified and usable. Models are beginning to come together on the
idea that this wave may split, with northern stream energy moving
into the Midwest/Northeast and amplifying southern stream energy
with a possible closed low over the Gulf Coast/Southeast mid-next
week. Despite this trend, there remains quite a bit of depth and
timing issues, with the GFS consistently the deepest/slowest of
the solutions (although also the first model to pick up on this
idea) and also significantly faster with the northern stream
energy. The ECMWF seems a little more reasonable and more in line
with recent ensembles. The next trough into the West early next
week continues to show ample run to run variability and timing,
but at least decent agreement on the larger scale.

The WPC blend tonight used a blend of the GFS and ECMWF, and
smaller amounts of the UKMET, through day 5. After this, began
increasing contributions from the ensemble means to help mitigate
the details with both the system in the Southeast and the West.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A departing and still rapidly deepening surface low out of the
Northeast should continue to bring some gusty winds to northern
New England into Sunday. An arctic airmass will still be in place
across the East through Sunday, with daytime highs Sunday
averaging 10-15 degrees below normal likely. Subfreezing
temperatures are likely Sunday morning as far south as the Gulf
Coast and northern Florida, with record lows possible in several
locations. After Sunday, temperatures in the East should rebound
back to more spring like weather with above normal temperatures
persisting through much of next week.

Meanwhile, rain and mountain snows will accompany the first
shortwave passage this week across the West. As the southern
stream energy amplifies into the Southeast next week, it should
tap Gulf moisture to bring increasing rain and thunderstorms
chances across the Gulf Coast and Southeast Monday-Tuesday, and
maybe into Wednesday depending on the progression of the upper
low/trough. Out West, the second trough early next week looks to
direct an atmospheric river into the Pacific Northwest, bringing
mostly beneficial rainfall and higher elevation snows to western
Washington/Oregon and northern California. Upper level ridging
between these troughs will build across the central U.S. with
daytime highs 10 to 25 degrees above normal by next
Tuesday-Wednesday for the northern/central Plains, which should be
a welcome relief to the very chilly weather there currently.

0117 AM CST Thu Mar 10 2022

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Strong northerly surface winds will overspread much of the southwest
and south-central U.S. within a post-cold-frontal regime as an
amplified mid-level trough tracks towards the Mississippi Valley
tomorrow/Friday. Overall cool or moist surface conditions are
expected to limit wildfire spread concerns across most locales. The
one exception may be portions of Arizona, New Mexico, and western
Texas along the international border. While northerly surface winds
may sustain above 15 mph amid 15-20 percent RH, overall coverage of
these more favorable surface meteorological conditions is expected
to be sparse, precluding any fire weather highlights this outlook.

...Moderate to heavy snow over portions of the Southern Rockies
and Central Plains this morning...

...There are Slight Risks of Excessive Rainfall and Severe
Thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast on Friday night...

...Cold air expands over the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley

...Increasing confidence in Winter Storm to impact portions of
Tennessee/Ohio Valleys through interior eastern U.S late Friday
through Saturday....

An amplifying upper-trough will contribute to hazardous weather
for central and eastern parts of the country in the coming days. A
low pressure system over the Rockies will continue to generate
heavy mountain snow over portions of the Southern Rockies as well
as moderate to locally heavy snow over parts of the Central Plains
and Middle Mississippi Valley this morning. Winter Storm Warnings
and Advisories are in effect for these areas as an additional 4-8
inches are possible. Snow accumulations exceeding a foot are
likely over mountain peaks in the Southern Rockies. Gusty winds
may accompany some of the heavy snow in southern Colorado and
northern New Mexico today, so blowing snow may be of concern to
commuters in those areas. Some light snow may extend into the
Midwest by this evening. Arctic air will flow into the Rockies and
Plains today on the backside of the Rockies/Plains system. High
temperatures will be between 15-25 degrees below average. A
secondary cold front will sweep through the Rockies and Plains on
Friday, bringing in another shot of Arctic air to the region.
Highs will be between 20-30 degrees below average over the Great
Plains, with parts of North Dakota potentially failing to make it
out of the single digits.

Light to moderate rain and scattered to isolated thunderstorms
will affect parts of the Southeast beginning today along a
quasi-stationary front draped across the Gulf Coast. The
amplifying upper trough will arrive in the east on Friday, leading
to the rapid intensification of a surface low pressure system over
the Southeast later that day. This deep trough will tap into a
rich plume of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and direct it
toward the Southeast. Moderate to heavy rainfall will develop over
the Florida panhandle through to the Georgia coast on Friday night
as a result. A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to Flash
Flooding is in effect for those areas. Severe thunderstorms
capable of producing damaging winds and a few tornadoes are also
possible from coastal Alabama and the Florida panhandle to the
southeastern coast of North Carolina, where the Storm Prediction
Center issued a Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms.
Unfortunately, the severe weather threat may persist into Saturday
morning before the system quickly moves offshore.

A piece of shortwave energy embedded within the amplifying upper
trough will spin through southern Canada and into the Great Lakes
over the coming days. This shortwave will allow for strengthening
and progression of a surface low pressure system during this time.
This system is forecast to produce heavy snow over parts of the
Ohio Valley and interior eastern U.S. beginning Friday night and
continuing through Saturday. Heavy snow, gusty winds and severely
reduced visibility will make for hazardous to difficult driving
conditions and travel at times, particularly across the interior
Northeast. The greatest accumulations, in excess of 12", are
likely across portions of the interior Northeast. Much colder air
will spread across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic in the wake of
this storm system.

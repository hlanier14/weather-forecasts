30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR JULY 2021

The July 2021 outlook was prepared based on dynamical model and statistical
forecast guidance, current soil moisture/drought conditions, potential impacts
from the MJO, and newly derived long term trends from the 1991-2020 base
period.



ENSO neutral is likely to continue through the outlooks period. The MJO may
also influence the climate pattern. Model predictions for MJO indicate a
strengthening over Africa and the western Indian Ocean, though there is
another
area of upper-level divergence over the Western Pacific. If the signal
emerges,
it would increase the variability throughout the month. That potential
resulted
in some lower probabilities for some regions, as explained below. Drought is
largely entrenched over the western CONUS and Northern Plains, and the summer
months are prime months when current soil moisture  values can impact
temperature and precipitation in following months.



Above normal temperatures are favored along the Rockies and across the West,
with the highest odds in the Great Basin and Four Corners region. The deeply
entrenched drought, long-term trends, and numerical guidance (dynamical models
and statistical tools) all indicate above normal temperatures are most likely.
For the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, an active MJO could result in
more variable conditions, so the odds are more modest in those regions. Sea
surface temperatures are also likely to be below normal near the California
coast, moderating odds there as well.  Equal chances for above, near, and
below
normal are indicated across the Southern Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi
Valleys, and portions of the Southeast. Temperature trends as indicated in the
OCN are not as strong there. The suite of dynamical model guidance from the
NMME, C3S, and CFS all indicate a relative relaxation of probabilities for
above normal temperatures, while some statistical tools favor below normal
temperatures, so the mixed indications from the tools result in EC. For the
Great Lakes and Northeast, trends, dynamical model guidance, and statistical
tools are all largely in agreement for above normal temperatures. Across
Alaska, the signals are a bit more mixed as summer trends are not as strong as
winter trends, and some NMME models indicate below normal temperatures. More
recent model runs and some statistical tools (SST-CA and ENSO-OCN) support
higher odds over southern Mainland and eastern Alaska in the outlook.



Above normal precipitation is indicated from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio
Valley,
consistent with dynamical model guidance, though the guidance has shown
variability in recent runs for the Carolinas and Florida, so odds in those
places are low. Statistical tools and dynamical models show a consistent
signal
for below normal precipitation from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern
Plains, though an active MJO could introduce short-term wetness in mid to late
July (however this would be very atypical), so below-normal precipitation is
still favored, but probabilities are lower along the coast. Some dynamical
models indicate wetness into the Four Corners region, but half of the
statistical tools (CCA and SST-CA) do not. The precipitation OCN shows a weak
wet signal from Central California to Oklahoma in a broad swath, though
amounts
are low and the pattern is not similar to other tools, so equal chances is
indicated in the outlook.  NMME, C3S, and statistical tools support
above-normal precipitation for western mainland Alaska.

FORECASTER: Matthew Rosencrans

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1991 and 2020, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

An updated monthly outlook... for Jul will be issued on Wed June 30 2021

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1991-2020 base period.

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Jun 17 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

ENSO-neutral conditions are present across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, as
represented in current oceanic and atmospheric observations. The official CPC
ENSO forecast indicates that ENSO-neutral conditions are likely to persist
through the fall. Looking further ahead, El Nino is the least likely scenario
through the upcoming winter.



The July-August-September (JAS) 2021 temperature outlook favors above normal
temperatures for Alaska, the western half of the CONUS, the eastern quarter of
the CONUS, and the Northern Plains, with the largest probabilities (greater
than 60 percent) forecast across the Northeast. The JAS 2021 precipitation
outlook depicts enhanced probabilities of below normal precipitation amounts
across the Pacific Northwest, Rockies, and parts of the High Plains.
Above-normal precipitation is more likely from the Eastern Seaboard to the
Lower Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southern Plains. Above normal
precipitation amounts are slightly favored for parts of northwestern Alaska.
Equal chances (EC) are forecast for areas where probabilities for each
category
of seasonal mean temperatures and seasonal accumulated precipitation amounts
are expected to be similar to climatological probabilities.

BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS
Note:  For Graphical Displays of the Forecast Tools Discussed Below See:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/90day/tools/briefing__;!!DZ3fjg!qRny3yEULfdWG1Pgvv3Erf2ZqDzQd92qkGML1XrIL9M-3jWh3OvAnqUqsW4q6SdHzU_BFAil$

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

The coupled oceanic and atmospheric observations reflect ENSO-neutral
conditions. During the past four weeks, sea surface temperatures (SSTs)
returned to near average across most of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. In the
last two months, positive subsurface temperature anomalies extended across
most
of the Pacific Ocean. However, recently, negative anomalies have emerged in
the
Central Pacific at 50-200m depth. Beginning in mid-March, integrated
upper-ocean heat anomalies have been positive. Since early May, these positive
anomalies have weakened to near zero. During the past 30 days, suppressed
convection was located south of the Equator near the Date Line and over parts
of Indonesia. Enhanced convection was evident over the far western Pacific
Ocean. The RMM index recently emerged over Africa with enhanced convection
noted over the tropical Atlantic. A weakening of this signal is anticipated
and
models are predicting a potential new intraseasonal feature over the Western
Hemisphere by late June.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

A majority of the models in the IRI/CPC plume predict ENSO-neutral to continue
through the fall 2021. By the late fall and winter, La Nina chances increase
to
near 50 percent, reflecting the historical tendency for a second winter of La
Nina following the first, and also the predictions from the North American
Multi-Model Ensemble. However, these cooler conditions are predicted to exist
for a short duration (3 overlapping seasons) and these predictions are still
over 6 months into the future. In summary, ENSO-neutral is favored through the
Northern Hemisphere summer (greater than 60 percent chance for the JAS season)
and fall (50 percent chance for the SON season). El Nino is the least likely
scenario (less than 10 percent chance) through the upcoming winter.

PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Dynamical model forecasts from the NMME and Copernicus (C3S) multi-model
ensemble systems are used extensively for the first six leads when they are
available, as was the objective, historical skill weighted consolidation, that
combines both dynamical and statistical forecast tools.



Additionally, the official ENSO forecast depicts probabilities of El Nino that
are significantly less than climatological probabilities through the upcoming
winter. This anticipated lack of an El Nino signal played a role in the
construction of these outlooks. Anomalously wet (dry) soil moisture conditions
was also a factor in the temperature outlook across the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley (northern Great Plains) during summer and early fall.
At later leads, decadal trends in temperature and precipitation were
increasingly relied upon in creating the seasonal outlooks.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - JAS 2021 TO JAS 2022

TEMPERATURE

Above normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the forecast
domain during JAS, except for parts of the Southern and Central Plains and the
Lower and Middle Mississippi Valley, where equal chances (EC) of below, near,
or above normal temperatures are forecast. This EC area is due to weaker
signals among temperature tools coupled with abnormally wet soil moisture
conditions across most of this region and represents a reduction in above
normal temperature probabilities relative to last month's outlook.
Probabilities of above normal temperatures are increased relative to last
month
across the Northern Plains due, in part, to continued dry soils. Chances of
above normal temperatures are also increased for the Northeast due to
excellent
agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. Above normal
temperatures are favored throughout Alaska during JAS, but with a reduction of
probabilities across the Panhandle compared to last month where dynamical
model
support is the weakest.



From ASO through SON, above normal temperatures are favored across the entire
CONUS as soil moisture impacts begin to diminish. Thereafter, the forecast
pattern increasingly begins to reflect trends with above normal temperatures
favored across the southern and eastern CONUS through the fall, winter, and
next spring. Probabilities of above normal temperatures peak in the Southeast
during the winter, consistent with an anticipated absence of El Nino, and
again
later next Spring, as trends play a greater role. Conversely, below normal
temperatures are slightly favored for the Northern Plains late this upcoming
winter into early spring consistent with recent trends and corresponding to a
strong cold signal from ENSO composites. Elevated chances of above normal
temperatures return to the entire West Coast by late next Spring consistent
with trends. Forecast uncertainty is generally high across much of Alaska,
where warm trends conflict with colder ENSO composites and dynamical model
guidance to varying degrees. EC is forecast across much of southern Alaska
from
late fall through early spring where disagreements among these conflicting
tools are at its greatest. Otherwise above normal temperatures are generally
forecast for northern Alaska where the trend signal is the strongest.

PRECIPITATION

Model guidance remains consistent from previous months depicting elevated
probabilities of below normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest,
Rockies,
and northern to central High Plains during JAS. However, the strength of the
signal diminishes considerably farther to the south, resulting in a forecast
of
EC across much of the Southwest Monsoon Region. Farther to the east, above
normal precipitation is favored from the Southern Plains to the Northeast. The
highest confidence for above normal precipitation is across the Lower
Mississippi Valley, consistent with the strongest signal among dynamical model
guidance, and for parts of the Mid-Atlantic States and the Northeast, where
statistical tools depict the strongest signal. A small region of elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation is also indicated for parts of
northwestern Alaska, consistent with CPC's skill weighted consolidation tool.
EC is indicated for the rest of the forecast domain as signals for the various
dynamical and statistical tools are too weak or conflicting to issue a
forecast
with a sufficient degree of confidence.



As we progress further into late summer and into the fall, dynamical and
statistical guidance converge on a drier solution for the Southwest Monsoon
Region. This dry signal is consistent with the anticipated absence of El Nino
conditions and, consequently, the potential inhibition of tropical activity in
the Pacific. Looking further ahead the dry signal expands eastward to
encompass
the entire Southern Tier from coast to coast by late fall through most of the
winter, consistent with absence of El Nino. Thereafter, a region of elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation is indicated for parts of the
Mississippi and Ohio valleys late winter into early spring consistent with
trends. This region of favored above normal precipitation expands southward to
the Southern Plains and eastward to parts of the East Coast during the spring
consistent with trends and ENSO composites. Trends also favor dryness for
parts
of the western CONUS as we progress deeper in the Spring into next summer. As
was the case with temperature, uncertainty in the precipitation forecast
across
much of Alaska is quite high and EC is indicated across much of the state for
all forecast leads. However above normal precipitation is favored for parts of
the South Coast late in the summer into early fall consistent with ENSO
composites and the C3S. Above normal precipitation is also favored for
northern
Alaska beginning in the fall through early spring due to trends and for
eastern
Alaska during the winter due to a wet ENSO signal. Trends and ENSO composites
also lead to favored wetter than normal conditions for parts of eastern Alaska
next summer.

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Jun 17 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

ENSO-neutral conditions are present across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, as
represented in current oceanic and atmospheric observations. The official CPC
ENSO forecast indicates that ENSO-neutral conditions are likely to persist
through the fall. Looking further ahead, El Nino is the least likely scenario
through the upcoming winter.



The July-August-September (JAS) 2021 temperature outlook favors above normal
temperatures for Alaska, the western half of the CONUS, the eastern quarter of
the CONUS, and the Northern Plains, with the largest probabilities (greater
than 60 percent) forecast across the Northeast. The JAS 2021 precipitation
outlook depicts enhanced probabilities of below normal precipitation amounts
across the Pacific Northwest, Rockies, and parts of the High Plains.
Above-normal precipitation is more likely from the Eastern Seaboard to the
Lower Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southern Plains. Above normal
precipitation amounts are slightly favored for parts of northwestern Alaska.
Equal chances (EC) are forecast for areas where probabilities for each
category
of seasonal mean temperatures and seasonal accumulated precipitation amounts
are expected to be similar to climatological probabilities.

BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS
Note:  For Graphical Displays of the Forecast Tools Discussed Below See:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/90day/tools/briefing__;!!DZ3fjg!o8bHZLoPnSW1sycNAbJwNT4hebuScCQfnedtV4lNnf4JILZIpglUMnP9eFuoxrtt-vCF1_E_$

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

The coupled oceanic and atmospheric observations reflect ENSO-neutral
conditions. During the past four weeks, sea surface temperatures (SSTs)
returned to near average across most of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. In the
last two months, positive subsurface temperature anomalies extended across
most
of the Pacific Ocean. However, recently, negative anomalies have emerged in
the
Central Pacific at 50-200m depth. Beginning in mid-March, integrated
upper-ocean heat anomalies have been positive. Since early May, these positive
anomalies have weakened to near zero. During the past 30 days, suppressed
convection was located south of the Equator near the Date Line and over parts
of Indonesia. Enhanced convection was evident over the far western Pacific
Ocean. The RMM index recently emerged over Africa with enhanced convection
noted over the tropical Atlantic. A weakening of this signal is anticipated
and
models are predicting a potential new intraseasonal feature over the Western
Hemisphere by late June.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

A majority of the models in the IRI/CPC plume predict ENSO-neutral to continue
through the fall 2021. By the late fall and winter, La Nina chances increase
to
near 50 percent, reflecting the historical tendency for a second winter of La
Nina following the first, and also the predictions from the North American
Multi-Model Ensemble. However, these cooler conditions are predicted to exist
for a short duration (3 overlapping seasons) and these predictions are still
over 6 months into the future. In summary, ENSO-neutral is favored through the
Northern Hemisphere summer (greater than 60 percent chance for the JAS season)
and fall (50 percent chance for the SON season). El Nino is the least likely
scenario (less than 10 percent chance) through the upcoming winter.

PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Dynamical model forecasts from the NMME and Copernicus (C3S) multi-model
ensemble systems are used extensively for the first six leads when they are
available, as was the objective, historical skill weighted consolidation, that
combines both dynamical and statistical forecast tools.



Additionally, the official ENSO forecast depicts probabilities of El Nino that
are significantly less than climatological probabilities through the upcoming
winter. This anticipated lack of an El Nino signal played a role in the
construction of these outlooks. Anomalously wet (dry) soil moisture conditions
was also a factor in the temperature outlook across the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley (northern Great Plains) during summer and early fall.
At later leads, decadal trends in temperature and precipitation were
increasingly relied upon in creating the seasonal outlooks.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - JAS 2021 TO JAS 2022

TEMPERATURE

Above normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the forecast
domain during JAS, except for parts of the Southern and Central Plains and the
Lower and Middle Mississippi Valley, where equal chances (EC) of below, near,
or above normal temperatures are forecast. This EC area is due to weaker
signals among temperature tools coupled with abnormally wet soil moisture
conditions across most of this region and represents a reduction in above
normal temperature probabilities relative to last month's outlook.
Probabilities of above normal temperatures are increased relative to last
month
across the Northern Plains due, in part, to continued dry soils. Chances of
above normal temperatures are also increased for the Northeast due to
excellent
agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. Above normal
temperatures are favored throughout Alaska during JAS, but with a reduction of
probabilities across the Panhandle compared to last month where dynamical
model
support is the weakest.



From ASO through SON, above normal temperatures are favored across the entire
CONUS as soil moisture impacts begin to diminish. Thereafter, the forecast
pattern increasingly begins to reflect trends with above normal temperatures
favored across the southern and eastern CONUS through the fall, winter, and
next spring. Probabilities of above normal temperatures peak in the Southeast
during the winter, consistent with an anticipated absence of El Nino, and
again
later next Spring, as trends play a greater role. Conversely, below normal
temperatures are slightly favored for the Northern Plains late this upcoming
winter into early spring consistent with recent trends and corresponding to a
strong cold signal from ENSO composites. Elevated chances of above normal
temperatures return to the entire West Coast by late next Spring consistent
with trends. Forecast uncertainty is generally high across much of Alaska,
where warm trends conflict with colder ENSO composites and dynamical model
guidance to varying degrees. EC is forecast across much of southern Alaska
from
late fall through early spring where disagreements among these conflicting
tools are at its greatest. Otherwise above normal temperatures are generally
forecast for northern Alaska where the trend signal is the strongest.

PRECIPITATION

Model guidance remains consistent from previous months depicting elevated
probabilities of below normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest,
Rockies,
and northern to central High Plains during JAS. However, the strength of the
signal diminishes considerably farther to the south, resulting in a forecast
of
EC across much of the Southwest Monsoon Region. Farther to the east, above
normal precipitation is favored from the Southern Plains to the Northeast. The
highest confidence for above normal precipitation is across the Lower
Mississippi Valley, consistent with the strongest signal among dynamical model
guidance, and for parts of the Mid-Atlantic States and the Northeast, where
statistical tools depict the strongest signal. A small region of elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation is also indicated for parts of
northwestern Alaska, consistent with CPC's skill weighted consolidation tool.
EC is indicated for the rest of the forecast domain as signals for the various
dynamical and statistical tools are too weak or conflicting to issue a
forecast
with a sufficient degree of confidence.



As we progress further into late summer and into the fall, dynamical and
statistical guidance converge on a drier solution for the Southwest Monsoon
Region. This dry signal is consistent with the anticipated absence of El Nino
conditions and, consequently, the potential inhibition of tropical activity in
the Pacific. Looking further ahead the dry signal expands eastward to
encompass
the entire Southern Tier from coast to coast by late fall through most of the
winter, consistent with absence of El Nino. Thereafter, a region of elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation is indicated for parts of the
Mississippi and Ohio valleys late winter into early spring consistent with
trends. This region of favored above normal precipitation expands southward to
the Southern Plains and eastward to parts of the East Coast during the spring
consistent with trends and ENSO composites. Trends also favor dryness for
parts
of the western CONUS as we progress deeper in the Spring into next summer. As
was the case with temperature, uncertainty in the precipitation forecast
across
much of Alaska is quite high and EC is indicated across much of the state for
all forecast leads. However above normal precipitation is favored for parts of
the South Coast late in the summer into early fall consistent with ENSO
composites and the C3S. Above normal precipitation is also favored for
northern
Alaska beginning in the fall through early spring due to trends and for
eastern
Alaska during the winter due to a wet ENSO signal. Trends and ENSO composites
also lead to favored wetter than normal conditions for parts of eastern Alaska
next summer.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Jun 17 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR JULY 2021

The July 2021 outlook was prepared based on dynamical model and statistical
forecast guidance, current soil moisture/drought conditions, potential impacts
from the MJO, and newly derived long term trends from the 1991-2020 base
period.



ENSO neutral is likely to continue through the outlooks period. The MJO may
also influence the climate pattern. Model predictions for MJO indicate a
strengthening over Africa and the western Indian Ocean, though there is
another
area of upper-level divergence over the Western Pacific. If the signal
emerges,
it would increase the variability throughout the month. That potential
resulted
in some lower probabilities for some regions, as explained below. Drought is
largely entrenched over the western CONUS and Northern Plains, and the summer
months are prime months when current soil moisture  values can impact
temperature and precipitation in following months.



Above normal temperatures are favored along the Rockies and across the West,
with the highest odds in the Great Basin and Four Corners region. The deeply
entrenched drought, long-term trends, and numerical guidance (dynamical models
and statistical tools) all indicate above normal temperatures are most likely.
For the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, an active MJO could result in
more variable conditions, so the odds are more modest in those regions. Sea
surface temperatures are also likely to be below normal near the California
coast, moderating odds there as well.  Equal chances for above, near, and
below
normal are indicated across the Southern Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi
Valleys, and portions of the Southeast. Temperature trends as indicated in the
OCN are not as strong there. The suite of dynamical model guidance from the
NMME, C3S, and CFS all indicate a relative relaxation of probabilities for
above normal temperatures, while some statistical tools favor below normal
temperatures, so the mixed indications from the tools result in EC. For the
Great Lakes and Northeast, trends, dynamical model guidance, and statistical
tools are all largely in agreement for above normal temperatures. Across
Alaska, the signals are a bit more mixed as summer trends are not as strong as
winter trends, and some NMME models indicate below normal temperatures. More
recent model runs and some statistical tools (SST-CA and ENSO-OCN) support
higher odds over southern Mainland and eastern Alaska in the outlook.



Above normal precipitation is indicated from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio
Valley,
consistent with dynamical model guidance, though the guidance has shown
variability in recent runs for the Carolinas and Florida, so odds in those
places are low. Statistical tools and dynamical models show a consistent
signal
for below normal precipitation from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern
Plains, though an active MJO could introduce short-term wetness in mid to late
July (however this would be very atypical), so below-normal precipitation is
still favored, but probabilities are lower along the coast. Some dynamical
models indicate wetness into the Four Corners region, but half of the
statistical tools (CCA and SST-CA) do not. The precipitation OCN shows a weak
wet signal from Central California to Oklahoma in a broad swath, though
amounts
are low and the pattern is not similar to other tools, so equal chances is
indicated in the outlook.  NMME, C3S, and statistical tools support
above-normal precipitation for western mainland Alaska.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1134 AM CDT Thu Jun 17 2021

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTH CENTRAL WYOMING...

Some refinements were made to the isolated dry thunderstorm area
across portions of central/southern Nevada and southwest Utah. The
latest high-resolution CAMs and SREF guidance depict a lower
likelihood of dry thunderstorms in this region as compared to
previous runs. Otherwise, the balance of the previous forecast
remains on track. See the discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 06/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1250 AM CDT Thu Jun 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level high will remain over the Four Corners region today,
allowing for strong diurnal heating and the deepening of a thermal
trough over the Four Corners/Great Basin region. To the north,
pressure gradient winds will increase through the day as surface
high pressure builds over the Pacific Northwest with a lingering low
over the Plains. This will support elevated to critical fire weather
conditions across the northern Great Basin and into the northern
Rockies/High Plains.

...Central to Northern Rockies and Great Basin...
Dry conditions will persist for much of the northern Great Basin and
into the northern Rockies, and active fires within the region over
the past few days are indicative of receptive fuels. Afternoon RH
values in the single digits are expected across NV/UT, increasing to
the teens and low 20s with northward extent into northern MT and
western ND. The synoptic pressure gradient over the northern Great
Basin and central/northern Rockies will be augmented by early
afternoon as boundary-layer mixing transports stronger mid-level
flow to the surface. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph (gusting to
25-35 mph) will support areas of elevated conditions. Critical
conditions remain likely across south-central WY where terrain
influences will regionally strengthen winds to 20-25 mph (with gusts
up to 40-45 mph possible) along the I-80 corridor.

...Southwest...
Evening soundings from across the Four Corners region show mid-level
moisture atop of deep, well-mixed boundary layers with 100-500 J/kg
MUCAPE. This environment supported isolated to scattered
thunderstorms Wednesday afternoon, and despite some convective
overturning, mean easterly winds into NM/AZ will continue to supply
mid-level moisture and maintain favorable thermodynamic profiles for
thunderstorms this afternoon. Strong heating coupled with orographic
ascent will favor isolated, to perhaps scattered, thunderstorms
across the broader Southwest/Four Corners region. PWAT values
between 0.5 to 0.75 inches suggest a mix of wet and dry storms.

...Southern Arizona/New Mexico Border...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected this afternoon along
the southern AZ/NM border. Southeasterly winds are forecast to
increase to near 15 mph (with occasional gusts upwards of 25 mph) in
response to the deepening thermal low to the west. Single digit to
low teen RH values are expected, and fuels remain receptive per
recent fire activity.

...Northern Michigan...
A dry continental air mass has moved into the central Great Lakes
region on the eastern periphery of a surface high. The approach of a
surface low/trough to the northwest through the day will increase
southwesterly winds to 10-15 mph as RH values fall to near 20%.
10-hour fuel moisture values in the 5-6% range are noted, as well as
high ERC values per recent fuel analyses. Although winds should
generally remain below elevated thresholds, pockets of elevated fire
weather conditions are possible.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 17 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure predicted over western North America favors
anomalously warm, and potentially hazardous temperatures, across much of the
western and portions of the central contiguous U.S throughout week-2. There is
good model support for the development of surface low pressure during early
week-2 to elevate the potential of heavy rainfall over portions of the
Midwest.
An amplified mid-level pattern over the North Pacific favors enhanced onshore
flow to bring increased precipitation chances over parts of the southern
Alaska
Mainland.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for the Northern Intermountain region, Fri-
Sat,
Jun 25-26.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western CONUS, and the central
and southern High Plains, Fri-Thu, Jun 25-Jul 1.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Middle Mississippi
Valley, Ohio Valley, and the Great Lakes, Fri-Sun, Jun 25-27.

Flooding possible for portions of eastern Texas, southeastern Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY JUNE 20 - THURSDAY JUNE 24:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vYMqGrvkQ30R10KxGXkwDAx2RS1nvOPOL2JWNi8JGg3_Xe0npeqWW0WZm3MmUAU6xNw37jBa$

FOR FRIDAY JUNE 25 - THURSDAY JULY 01: Dynamical models continue to advertise
an amplified 500-hPa height pattern across the North Pacific consisting of
anomalous troughing centered over the Aleutians and anomalous ridging across
the northeastern Pacific with positive height departures overspreading much of
the western Canada and into the Pacific Northwest during early week-2.
Underneath this ridge, both the GEFS and the ECMWF ensembles favor the
development of a shortwave trough along the Pacific Coast towards the end of
the week-1 period, which is anticipated to bring a brief reprieve to the
anomalously warm temperatures forecast across portions of California and the
Southwest during week-1. By days 9 and 10 (Jun 26-27), subtropical ridging is
favored to retrograde to the west in conjunction with the development of
mid-level troughing predicted across the north-central U.S., leading to the
return of warmer temperatures across California and the Desert Southwest
throughout much of the period.



This evolution is reflected in both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools which
continue to depict a broad region covering much of the western and
south-central CONUS with at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile, and a slight risk of excessive heat remains
issued for the entirety of week-2. Relative to yesterday's outlook, the slight
risk area is expanded to include additional portions of the Central Plains
where there are increased signals for potentially hazardous heat.
Additionally,
higher probabilities (>40%) for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile and 95 degrees F are indicated in the reforecast guidance over
portions of eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon and western Idaho, and a
moderate risk is added to today's outlook over these areas. There remains an
elevated potential for maximum temperatures exceeding 90 deg F in the valleys
of the Rockies and Great Basin, 100 deg F over the Central and Southern High
Plains, and 110 deg F in the Desert Southwest, where combined with below
normal
precipitation predominantly favored across the western half of the CONUS
during
week-2, is expected to exacerbate moderate (D1) to exceptional (D4) drought
conditions being felt throughout many portions of the western CONUS.



With anomalous mid-level troughing anticipated to develop over the
north-central CONUS early in the period, there is an increased potential for
shortwave disturbances and frontal activity to bring enhanced precipitation
and
potentially heavy rainfall across portions of the Midwest. There is good
agreement between the GEFS and the ECMWF ensembles favoring a deepening area
of
low surface pressure over the region, with higher mean daily precipitation
totals compared to yesterday's guidance. Both reforecast tools indicate at
least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th
percentile and 1 inch focused over the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valley and
into the Great Lakes, and a slight risk of heavy precipitation is added to the
outlook for Jun 25 to 27. Elevated chances also exist in the reforecast
guidance for sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile centered in this
region, though these wind speeds do not meet hazard criteria. As the surface
low shifts eastward with time, enhanced precipitation remains likely over the
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, however these rainfall amounts
are not anticipated to exceed hazard thresholds by the middle of the period.



In the tropics, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) continues to eye a slowly
developing tropical disturbance in the Bay of Campeche that currently has a
90%
chance of formation during the next few days. There is continued support in
the
models which favor this system to track northward towards the central Gulf
Coast states, where the Weather Prediction Center forecasts 5-10 inches of
rainfall over southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama,
and the western Florida Panhandle through the end of week-1. River flooding
continues to be a concern across the Gulf states, where antecedent heavy
rainfall and soil moisture content registering in the highest percentiles
supports the continuation of a flooding possible hazard highlighted mainly
over
the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys and the Southeast.



Over Alaska, the amplified mid-level pattern forecast across the North Pacific
is expected to enhance onshore flow early in the period. With surface low
pressure also forecast, enhanced precipitation and increased wind speeds are
likely across the Southern Mainland and the Aleutians. However, reforecast
tools remain unsupportive of precipitation and winds reaching hazard
thresholds.

...Extreme heat over the Southwest/California through the weekend
and then subsiding next week while afternoon heat could approach
the century for interior Pacific Northwest early next week...

...Tropical system will likely spread heavy rainfall inland from
the Deep South to the Southeast later this weekend into Monday...


...Overview...

The extreme heat currently over the Southwest and California is
showing signs of moderation by early next week as an upper ridge
over the region gives way to a trough (likely with an embedded
low) that settles just off the West Coast.  However enough ridging
will persist over parts of the Great Basin/Northwest to support
very warm to hot afternoons over those areas.  A broad mean trough
will prevail farther east with the greatest depth/amplitude likely
to be over the east-central U.S. during the early-mid portion of
next week.  This trough and associated surface system/fronts will
support areas of active weather with potential for heavy rainfall.
 Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center continues to monitor a
broad area of low pressure over the Bay of Campeche.  During the
short-range time frame this feature should start to organize while
tracking northward and bring heavy rain into the Gulf Coast
region, reaching an inland position over the Deep South by the
start of the extended period early Sunday.  Expect the heavy
rainfall to move across the interior Southeast and the Carolinas
on Monday.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Global model solutions and ensembles this morning are actually in
fairly good agreement with one another through the medium-range
period.  The system of interest is the potential for tropical
cyclone formation over the western Gulf of Mexico during the
short-term period.  There remains quite a bit of uncertainty
regarding the structure of this system including possible
convective feedback as shown by the GFS while the ECMWF focuses
more on the broad circulation of the system.  In any event, once
the system moves inland, there is rather good model agreement on
taking the system across the Deep South on Sunday before recurving
it across the Carolinas on Monday.  The ECMWF is the most
aggressive in terms of keep a well-defined tropical low across the
Carolinas on Monday and then off the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.
This scenario is considered an outside chance at this point.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The record-breaking and dangerous heat continuing into the weekend
over the Southwest and California Central Valley should begin to
moderate a little on Sunday and then subside more dramatically
thereafter with high temperatures trending close to normal by
Tuesday-Thursday.  On the other hand persistence of upper ridging
will support well above normal temperatures from parts of the
Great Basin through the Northwest.  The most extreme anomalies
over the Northwest should be early in the week when parts of
Oregon and Washington could see highs up to 20-25F above normal.
Some daily records for highs/warm lows will be possible.  By next
Thursday highs of 10-15F above normal should be confined to the
Interior Northwest and northern Rockies.  The amplifying upper
trough to the east early-mid week will produce an area of below
normal temperatures progressing from the Plains into the
east-central U.S., moderating some as it reaches the East Coast
states.  Best potential for at least a day of temperatures 10F or
more below normal will be from the Dakotas into the central High
Plains and eastward into the Great Lakes.

Southern U.S. heavy rainfall and flooding concerns associated with
the tropical system expected to reach the Gulf Coast early in the
weekend should extend into the Southeast by Sunday.  Portions of
the South that have seen well above normal rainfall in recent
weeks will be particularly sensitive to the additional rainfall
from this system.  The amplifying upper trough over the
central/east-central U.S. and leading low pressure/frontal system
should spread a broad area of showers and thunderstorms across the
eastern half of the country.  Some of the rain may be heavy from
the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes as well as the Ohio Valley
or Tennessee Valley into the southern Plains.  The Storm
Prediction Center is also monitoring the potential for organized
severe threats given the vigorous nature of the system.  Thus far
guidance is maintaining some separation between the tropical
moisture over the south and the front that heads into the East by
next Tuesday.  Farther west, areas along eastern slopes of the
northern/central Rockies may see a period of organized rainfall
Sunday-Sunday night with the passage of a cold front and the
shortwave energy aloft feeding into the overall trough to the east.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu June 17 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 23 - 27 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast an amplified trough
over the North Pacific, centered over the western Aleutians, and a ridge with
above normal 500-hPa heights over the eastern Gulf of Alaska, extending to
the
Pacific Northwest. Downstream a ridge is forecast over the western CONUS,
while
an enhanced trough is predicted over the east-central CONUS with below normal
500-hPa heights.

The predicted troughing over the western Aleutians associated with southerly
to
southwesterly flow favors relatively warm conditions for northern and western
Mainland Alaska and parts of the Alaska Panhandle. Due to potential storm
systems development to bring more clouds, increased probabilities of below
normal temperature are favored over the southern coast of Alaska Mainland. A
predicted trough over the east-central CONUS favors enhanced probabilities of
near to below normal temperatures across most of the central and eastern
CONUS.
Above normal temperatures are also likely over much of the western CONUS,
parts
of the Southern Plains and the Florida Peninsula, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered over the western Aleutians favors above normal
precipitation over the Aleutians and much of Mainland Alaska. Anomalous
ridging
and northerly flow increase chances of near to below normal precipitation
across parts of eastern Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, the
northwestern
CONUS, Rockies, Northern Plains and southern Plains. Predicted troughing over
the east-central CONUS favors near to above normal precipitation across most
of
the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes except for the Middle
and Northern Atlantic Seaboard, where below normal precipitation is indicated,
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 25 - JUL 01, 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, becoming more zonal
over much of the CONUS but remaining amplified over the Northern Pacific,
while
ensemble spread and uncertainty increases.

Above normal temperatures are favored for parts of northern Mainland Alaska,
associated with mean southerly flow ahead of a mean trough over the western
Aleutians and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Probabilities of below normal
temperature are favored over southern Alaska Mainland due to potential storm
systems developing to bring more clouds. Near to above normal temperatures are
likely over the western half of the CONUS, the Northeast and parts of southern
Florida, under near to above normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal temperatures
are mostly favored over the remainder eastern half of the CONUS, as a trough
and storm systems are predicted to traverse the region.

The above normal week-2 precipitation probability is enhanced over much of
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians due to forecast troughing over the western
Aleutians with mean southerly flow. Near to below normal precipitation odds
are
increased for the Alaska Panhandle and most of  the western CONUS as well as
the Southern Plains , associated with mean ridging over the Gulf of Alaska and
the western CONUS. Near to above normal precipitation is favored across parts
of the central and eastern CONUS, consistent with the ERF consolidation tool.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Extreme heat over the Southwest/California through the weekend
and then subsiding next week while afternoon heat well up into the
90s expected for interior Pacific Northwest early next week...

...Tropical system will likely spread heavy rainfall inland from
the Deep South to the Southeast later this weekend into Monday...


...Overview...

The extreme heat currently over the Southwest and California is
showing signs of moderation by early next week as an upper ridge
over the region gives way to a trough (likely with an embedded
low) that settles just off the West Coast.  However enough ridging
will persist over parts of the Great Basin/Northwest to support
very warm to hot afternoons over those areas.  A broad mean trough
will prevail farther east with the greatest depth/amplitude likely
to be over the east-central U.S. during the early-mid portion of
next week.  This trough and associated surface system/fronts will
support areas of active weather with potential for heavy rainfall.
 Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center continues to monitor a
broad area of low pressure over the Bay of Campeche.  During the
short-range time frame this feature should start to organize while
tracking northward and bring heavy rain into the Gulf Coast
region, reaching an inland position over the Deep South by the
start of the extended period early Sunday.  Expect the heavy
rainfall to move across the interior Southeast and the Carolinas
on Monday.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Global model solutions and ensembles this morning are actually in
fairly good agreement with one another through the medium-range
period.  The system of interest is the potential for tropical
cyclone formation over the western Gulf of Mexico during the
short-term period.  There remains quite a bit of uncertainty
regarding the structure of this system including possible
convective feedback as shown by the GFS while the ECMWF focuses
more on the broad circulation of the system.  In any event, once
the system moves inland, there is rather good model agreement on
taking the system across the Deep South on Sunday before recurving
it across the Carolinas on Monday.  The ECMWF is the most
aggressive in terms of keeping a well-defined tropical low across
the Carolinas on Monday and then off the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.
This scenario is considered an outside chance at this point.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 06Z GFS/GEFS, the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, together with
some contributions from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  Increasing
weights toward the ensemble means were incorporated for Days 6-7
to handle the model uncertainty.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The record-breaking and dangerous heat continuing into the weekend
over the Southwest and California Central Valley should begin to
moderate a little on Sunday and then subside more dramatically
thereafter with high temperatures trending close to normal by
Tuesday-Thursday.  On the other hand persistence of upper ridging
will support well above normal temperatures from parts of the
Great Basin through the Northwest.  The most extreme anomalies
over the Northwest should be early in the week when parts of
Oregon and Washington could see highs up to 20-25F above normal.
Some daily records for highs/warm lows will be possible.  By next
Thursday highs of 10-15F above normal should be confined to the
Interior Northwest and northern Rockies.  The amplifying upper
trough to the east early-mid week will produce an area of below
normal temperatures progressing from the Plains into the
east-central U.S., moderating some as it reaches the East Coast
states.  Best potential for at least a day of temperatures 10F or
more below normal will be from the Dakotas into the central High
Plains and eastward into the Great Lakes.

Southern U.S. heavy rainfall and flooding concerns associated with
the tropical system expected to reach the Gulf Coast early in the
weekend should extend into the Southeast by Sunday.  Portions of
the South that have seen well above normal rainfall in recent
weeks will be particularly sensitive to the additional rainfall
from this system.  The amplifying upper trough over the
central/east-central U.S. and leading low pressure/frontal system
should spread a broad area of showers and thunderstorms across the
eastern half of the country.  Some of the rain may be heavy from
the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes as well as the Ohio Valley
or Tennessee Valley into the southern Plains.  The Storm
Prediction Center is also monitoring the potential for organized
severe threats given the vigorous nature of the system.  Thus far
guidance is maintaining some separation between the tropical
moisture over the south and the front that heads into the East by
next Tuesday.  Farther west, areas along eastern slopes of the
northern/central Rockies may see a period of organized rainfall
Sunday-Sunday night with the passage of a cold front and the
shortwave energy aloft feeding into the overall trough to the east.

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat will continue across a large
portion of the western U.S. and the central Plains...

...Severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall producing flash
flooding are possible throughout the Midwest today and Ohio Valley
on Friday...

...Tropical rains and an increasing threat for flash flooding are
expected along the northern Gulf Coast beginning Friday...

As a dangerous heatwave continues, Excessive Heat Warnings and
Heat Advisories remain in effect across much of California,
Nevada, Arizona, and Utah.  Temperatures are expected to once
again reach record-breaking highs across much of the region today,
with several records likely to fall on Friday and Saturday as
well.

Heat Advisories are also in effect for portions of the central
Plains today.  Well-above normal temperatures are expected today
across the region, with record-breaking highs expected from
Colorado to Iowa and Missouri.  While a front dropping into the
region is expected to offer some relief, temperatures are forecast
to remain well-above average on Friday and into the weekend.

Farther to the north, severe thunderstorms are expected late this
afternoon into tonight across portions of the upper Mississippi
Valley.  The Storm Prediction Center is indicating an Enhanced
Risk for severe thunderstorms across southern portions of
Minnesota and Wisconsin, and northern portions of Iowa and
Illinois, where conditions are likely to become favorable for
severe thunderstorms to develop.  These storms will have the
potential to produce damaging wind and large hail, as well as a
few tornadoes.  Heavy rainfall, resulting in localized flooding is
also possible.

Severe storms are likely to develop farther south and east on
Friday.  The Storm Prediction Center is indicating an Enhanced
Risk for severe thunderstorms across portions of Illinois,
Indiana, and Ohio.  Conditions across the region will likely
become favorable for severe thunderstorms to develop -- capable of
producing damaging wind, large hail, a few tornadoes, and
localized flooding.

Heavy rainfall and windy conditions are expected to develop along
the northern Gulf Coast on Friday before spreading north over the
weekend.  A broad area of low pressure over the southwestern Gulf
of Mexico continues to become better organized.  This system is
expected to move generally to the north, and a tropical or
subtropical depression is likely to form over the west-central
Gulf of Mexico tonight or early Friday.  The National Hurricane
Center has indicated that a Tropical Storm Warning will likely be
required for a portion of the northern Gulf Coast later today.
Regardless of development, heavy rainfall will be likely with the
potential for flooding increasing along the coast Friday and
Saturday.

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE FOUR CORNERS REGION...

An expansion of the scattered dry thunderstorm area was made across
portions of north-central New Mexico, and into portions of central
Utah, based on the depiction of scattered thunderstorm potential
indicated in the latest high-resolution guidance in consideration of
receptive fuels.

Otherwise, minor refinements were made to the isolated dry
thunderstorm area across portions of the West. The balance of the
previous forecast remains on track. See the discussion below for
more details.

..Karstens.. 06/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0232 AM CDT Thu Jun 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level moisture will continue to advect westward into the
Southwest over the next 48 hours, largely thanks to an upper-level
high anchored over the general Four Corners. This influx of moisture
combined with strong diurnal heating will result in a widespread
area of 100-500 J/kg MUCAPE rooted above deep, dry boundary layers,
conducive for dry thunderstorms. With dry fuels already present
across most of the Southwest, the dry thunderstorm potential will
present a fire weather threat. The presence of the upper-level high
will also limit mid and upper-level flow over the region, resulting
in only localized wind/RH driven fire weather concerns.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated to scattered dry thunderstorms are possible from central CO
westward into southeastern CA. Guidance is in very good agreement
that PWAT values will generally be limited to 0.5 to 0.75 inches
with increasing values from west to east. Confidence in the
potential for dry thunderstorms is fairly high, but convective
coverage is slightly less certain. Thunderstorm chances will be
highest along and east of the continental divide in CO, but an
easterly up-slope flow regime and PWAT values between 0.75 to 1.0
inch suggest that wetting rainfall is probable. To the west of the
divide, orographic lift and low-level parcels reaching their
convective temperatures will be the primarily driving factors. HREF
and SREF guidance show thunder probabilities between 30-50% across
the Four Corners, and nearly all CAM forecast soundings show
adequate instability to support convection in this region. As such,
confidence in scattered dry thunderstorms is highest over the higher
terrain of the Four Corners region.

...Southern Wyoming...
Although mid-level flow will generally be weak over the region,
localized elevated conditions are possible across the northern Great
Basin and northern Rockies where terrain-enhanced winds can reach
15-20 mph. Confidence in persistent elevated conditions is highest
across southern WY along the I-80 corridor where terrain induced
downslope slow will support 15-20 mph winds and RH values in the low
teens.

...West-central Minnesota...
Winds are forecast to increase to near 15 mph (with gusts upwards of
20-25 mph) ahead of a weak cold front Friday afternoon across
west-central MN. Fuels across the state remain very dry despite
recent rainfall. Localized fire weather conditions are possible
where breezy conditions can coincide with RH reductions down to 25%,
though confidence in the coverage and duration of these conditions
is low.

...Tropical system will likely spread heavy rainfall inland from

...Overview...

The extreme heat currently over the Southwest and California is
showing signs of moderation by early next week as an upper ridge

next week.  This trough and associated surface system/fronts will
support areas of active weather with potential for heavy rainfall.
 Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center continues to monitor a
broad area of low pressure over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.
During the short-range time frame this feature should start to
organize while tracking northward and bring heavy rain into the
Gulf Coast region, reaching an inland position over the Deep South
by the start of the extended period early Sunday.  Expect the
heavy rainfall to move across the interior Southeast and the
Carolinas on Monday.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Global model solutions and ensembles this morning are actually in
fairly good agreement with one another through the medium-range
period.  The system of interest is the potential for tropical
cyclone formation over the western Gulf of Mexico starting from
the short-term period.  There remains quite a bit of uncertainty
regarding the structure of this system including possible
convective feedback as shown by the GFS while the ECMWF flips
back-and-forth between focusing more on the broad circulation of
the system and convective feedback similar to the GFS.  In any
event, once the system moves inland, there is rather good model
agreement on taking the system across the Deep South on Sunday
before recurving it across the Carolinas on Monday.  The ECMWF is
the most aggressive in terms of keeping a well-defined tropical
low into the Carolinas on Monday and then off the Mid-Atlantic on
Tuesday.  This scenario is considered an outside chance at this
point.

Behind the tropical system, models show good agreement on the
progression of the cold front through the eastern two-thirds of
the country into midweek next week with the typically slightly
faster GFS/GEFS solutions.  In addition, there continues to be a
general model tendency to phase/merge the northern stream
secondary cool air reinforcement from Canada behind an
intensifying low pressure system moving across the Great Lakes
into Canada early next week.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 06Z GFS/GEFS, the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, together with
some contributions from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  Increasing
weights toward the ensemble means were incorporated for Days 6-7
to handle the model uncertainty.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The record-breaking and dangerous heat forecast to continue into
the weekend over the Southwest and California Central Valley
should begin to moderate a little on Sunday and then subside more
dramatically thereafter with high temperatures trending close to
normal by Tuesday-Thursday.  In fact, some light snow is even
possible across the highest elevations of northern Wyoming and
southern Montana early on Monday behind a cold front after
Sheridan, WY experienced all-time record high temperature of 107
degrees at a couple of days ago!  On the other hand, the
persistent upper ridging will support well above normal
temperatures from parts of the Great Basin through the Northwest.
The most extreme anomalies over the Northwest should be early in
the week when parts of Oregon and Washington could see highs up to
20-25F above normal, where afternoon high temperatures well up
into the 90s to near 100 degrees are forecast early next week.
Some daily records for highs/warm lows will also be possible.  By
next Thursday highs of 10-15F above normal should be confined to
the Interior Northwest and northern Rockies.  The amplifying upper
trough to the east early-mid week will produce an area of below
normal temperatures progressing from the Plains into the
east-central U.S., moderating some as it reaches the East Coast
states.  Best potential for at least a day of temperatures 10F or
more below normal will be from the Dakotas into the central High
Plains and eastward into the Great Lakes.

Southern U.S. heavy rainfall and flooding concerns associated with
the tropical system expected to reach the Gulf Coast early in the
weekend should extend into the Southeast by Sunday.  Portions of
the South that have seen well above normal rainfall in recent
weeks will be particularly sensitive to the additional rainfall
from this system.  The amplifying upper trough over the
central/east-central U.S. and leading low pressure/frontal system
should spread a broad area of showers and thunderstorms across the
eastern half of the country.  Some of the rain may be heavy from
the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes as well as the Ohio Valley
or Tennessee Valley into the southern Plains.  The Storm
Prediction Center is also monitoring the potential for organized
severe threats given the vigorous nature of the system.  Thus far
guidance is maintaining some separation between the tropical
moisture over the south and the front that heads into the East by
next Tuesday.  Farther west, areas along eastern slopes of the
northern/central Rockies may see a period of organized rainfall
Sunday-Sunday night with the passage of a cold front and the
shortwave energy aloft feeding into the overall trough to the east.

...Extreme heat over the Southwest/California through the weekend
and then subsiding next week while afternoon heat well up into the
90s expected for interior Pacific Northwest early next week...

...Tropical system will likely spread heavy rainfall inland from
the Deep South to the Southeast later this weekend into Monday...


...Overview...

The extreme heat currently over the Southwest and California is
showing signs of moderation by early next week as an upper ridge
over the region gives way to a trough (likely with an embedded
low) that settles just off the West Coast.  However enough ridging
will persist over parts of the Great Basin/Northwest to support
very warm to hot afternoons over those areas.  A broad mean trough
will prevail farther east with the greatest depth/amplitude likely
to be over the east-central U.S. during the early-mid portion of
next week.  This trough and associated surface system/fronts will
support areas of active weather with potential for heavy rainfall.
 Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center continues to monitor a
broad area of low pressure over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.
During the short-range time frame this feature should start to
organize while tracking northward and bring heavy rain into the
Gulf Coast region, reaching an inland position over the Deep South
by the start of the extended period early Sunday.  Expect the
heavy rainfall to move across the interior Southeast and the
Carolinas on Monday.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Global model solutions and ensembles this morning are actually in
fairly good agreement with one another through the medium-range
period.  The system of interest is the potential for tropical
cyclone formation over the western Gulf of Mexico starting from
the short-term period.  There remains quite a bit of uncertainty
regarding the structure of this system including possible
convective feedback as shown by the GFS while the ECMWF flips
back-and-forth between focusing more on the broad circulation of
the system and convective feedback similar to the GFS.  In any
event, once the system moves inland, there is rather good model
agreement on taking the system across the Deep South on Sunday
before recurving it across the Carolinas on Monday.  The ECMWF is
the most aggressive in terms of keeping a well-defined tropical
low into the Carolinas on Monday and then off the Mid-Atlantic on
Tuesday.  This scenario is considered an outside chance at this
point.

Behind the tropical system, models show good agreement on the
progression of the cold front through the eastern two-thirds of
the country into midweek next week with the typically slightly
faster GFS/GEFS solutions.  In addition, there continues to be a
general model tendency to phase/merge the northern stream
secondary cool air reinforcement from Canada behind an
intensifying low pressure system moving across the Great Lakes
into Canada early next week.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 06Z GFS/GEFS, the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, together with
some contributions from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  Increasing
weights toward the ensemble means were incorporated for Days 6-7
to handle the model uncertainty.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The record-breaking and dangerous heat forecast to continue into
the weekend over the Southwest and California Central Valley
should begin to moderate a little on Sunday and then subside more
dramatically thereafter with high temperatures trending close to
normal by Tuesday-Thursday.  In fact, some light snow is even
possible across the highest elevations of northern Wyoming and
southern Montana early on Monday behind a cold front after
Sheridan, WY experienced all-time record high temperature of 107
degrees at a couple of days ago!  On the other hand, the
persistent upper ridging will support well above normal
temperatures from parts of the Great Basin through the Northwest.
The most extreme anomalies over the Northwest should be early in
the week when parts of Oregon and Washington could see highs up to
20-25F above normal, where afternoon high temperatures well up
into the 90s to near 100 degrees are forecast early next week.
Some daily records for highs/warm lows will also be possible.  By
next Thursday highs of 10-15F above normal should be confined to
the Interior Northwest and northern Rockies.  The amplifying upper
trough to the east early-mid week will produce an area of below
normal temperatures progressing from the Plains into the
east-central U.S., moderating some as it reaches the East Coast
states.  Best potential for at least a day of temperatures 10F or
more below normal will be from the Dakotas into the central High
Plains and eastward into the Great Lakes.

Southern U.S. heavy rainfall and flooding concerns associated with
the tropical system expected to reach the Gulf Coast early in the
weekend should extend into the Southeast by Sunday.  Portions of
the South that have seen well above normal rainfall in recent
weeks will be particularly sensitive to the additional rainfall
from this system.  The amplifying upper trough over the
central/east-central U.S. and leading low pressure/frontal system
should spread a broad area of showers and thunderstorms across the
eastern half of the country.  Some of the rain may be heavy from
the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes as well as the Ohio Valley
or Tennessee Valley into the southern Plains.  The Storm
Prediction Center is also monitoring the potential for organized
severe threats given the vigorous nature of the system.  Thus far
guidance is maintaining some separation between the tropical
moisture over the south and the front that heads into the East by
next Tuesday.  Farther west, areas along eastern slopes of the
northern/central Rockies may see a period of organized rainfall
Sunday-Sunday night with the passage of a cold front and the
shortwave energy aloft feeding into the overall trough to the east.

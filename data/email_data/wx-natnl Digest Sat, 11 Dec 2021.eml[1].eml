Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1053 AM CST Fri Dec 10 2021

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS....

The overall forecast remains on-track with elevated and critical
fire weather conditions expected across the southern Plains this
afternoon. Observed surface gusts of 40-50 mph this morning suggest
strong low-level winds will continue through the day as the
diurnally warming and drying airmass results in surface humidity
values of 18-25%. While humidity will likely remain above critical
thresholds, surface winds are very strong and regional fuels remain
highly receptive to fire spread (ERC >90th percentile). Critical
probabilities have been adjusted eastward into western Oklahoma to
account for increasingly strong winds and lower humidity over dry
fuels. Fire weather conditions will quickly diminish overnight
behind an advancing cold front and wind shift moving through the
Plains. See the previous discussion for additional information.

..Lyons.. 12/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CST Fri Dec 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale trough will gradually amplify as it advances eastward
from the Intermountain West toward the south-central Rockies today.
Strong deep-layer west-southwesterly flow preceding the trough will
overspread the southern Rockies and adjacent High Plains by early
afternoon. As this occurs, a low-pressure system will evolve
eastward from eastern Colorado through Kansas, with an attendant
cold front moving southward across the southern High Plains during
the evening hours. The combination of the strong deep-layer flow,
the tight surface pressure gradient peripheral to the low, and dry
downslope flow will support Critical fire-weather conditions across
portions of the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
A few hours of Critical fire-weather conditions are expected from
far northeastern New Mexico into the northern Texas Panhandle today,
with Elevated conditions surrounding the Critical area. Surface
winds will gradually strengthen in response to the tightening
pressure gradient, with 25-30 mph sustained west-southwesterly winds
expected. In addition, forecast soundings depict very strong
boundary-layer winds, which may mix downward to support surface wind
gusts of 45-55 mph. One limiting factor is the potential for
initially widespread mid/high-level cloud coverage to stunt diurnal
RH reductions. However, present indications are that sufficient
afternoon clearing combined with downslope warming/drying will
result in 15-25 percent RH. Ongoing drought conditions combined with
very dry fuels across the southern High Plains will further
exacerbate the wildfire-spread threat. By the evening timeframe,
surface winds will shift from west-southwesterly to northerly behind
the cold front, with breezy/dry conditions persisting in its wake.

...Atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast by
early next week bringing a threat of heavy rain and heavy mountain
snow...

...Record warmth to spread from the central U.S. through the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Tuesday-Thursday...


...Overview...

Amplified upper troughing will dig through the West early next
week. This will promote increasing and widespread rains with local
runoff issues and terrain enhancing heavy snows over much of the
West/Rockies, first along the coast then progressing southward and
eastward, as an atmospheric river event ensues. As the main system
lifts northeastward through the Plains next Wed-Thu and spawns
cyclogenesis, wintry precipitation will spread along the north
side of the low track. Downstream, upper ridging will build from
the south-central U.S. to the East. Warm sector record warmth will
include temperatures upwards to 20-35F above normal Tue-Thu
spreading from the central U.S. to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
prior to the arrival of generally modest rainfall focused along a
cold front.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast clustering and spread through medium
range time scale is much better than normal, bolstering forecast

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moist onshore flow with an atmospheric river will cause widespread
precipitation in the western U.S. early next week. Heaviest
precipitation will spread southward across central and southern
California Mon-Tue and eastward over the Great Basin and Four
Corners states and Rockies through midweek. Enhanced totals are
likely along favored terrain, with heavy mountain snow especially
in the Sierra Nevada and then the central Great Basin and Rockies.
Heavy coastal to interior  rains are expected in California, even
down into Southern CA. Some locally higher rainfall rates may
cause some flooding issues, especially for sensitive burn scar
areas. Temperatures will become below normal in the West
underneath the upper trough, with temperatures 10-15F below
average for parts of California and Nevada late next week.

include temperatures upwards to 20-35F above normal Tue-Thu
spreading from the central U.S. to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0122 PM CST Fri Dec 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Far South Texas...
Strong northerly winds are forecast to increase early in the morning
behind the cold front moving across far south Texas Saturday. A
gradient of humidity is expected to develop, with RH as low as
18-25% possible along the TX/MEX border, and values increasing with
eastward extent. Some overlap with winds greater than 20 mph and
humidity near 20% may support locally elevated fire weather
conditions farther west through the afternoon. Considerable
uncertainty exists regarding the eastern extent of any fire weather
potential given humidity values well above critical criteria and
fuels generally unsupportive of fire spread. Ensemble guidance
depicts a small corridor immediately along the international border
that may support better sustained fire weather conditions. However,
confidence remains too low to add any probabilities at this time.

...Southern High Plains...
Ensemble guidance continues to highlight the potential for at least
locally elevated fire weather conditions within the post-frontal
airmass across the High Plains. Potential limiting factors include;
surface temperatures struggling to reach the mid 40s F, and only
modest southwesterly low-level flow through much of the day. Never
the less, very dry fuels and surface conditions with RH in the low
teens to single digits, as well as steadily increasing surface winds
may support localized fire weather potential late in the afternoon
across portions of eastern NM and the far western TX/OK Panhandles.
However, given the poor ensemble signal for widespread sustained
fire weather conditions, probabilities will be withheld for now.

..Lyons.. 12/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0203 AM CST Fri Dec 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
A dry post-frontal air mass will be in place across the southern
High Plains on Saturday, while surface lee troughing develops in
response to enhanced northwesterly flow aloft. Some enhancement to
the surface pressure gradient peripheral to the lee trough is
possible across the southern High Plains, though substantial spread
amongst the short-range model guidance casts uncertainty on where
the best overlap of critically low RH and breezy surface winds will
reside.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated to perhaps locally Critical fire-weather conditions will be
possible across the southern High Plains on Saturday afternoon,
though forecast uncertainty precludes the introduction of highlights
at this time. RH values will likely drop into the single digits to
middle teens, aided by downslope warming/drying amid a dry
antecedent air mass. If model guidance comes into better agreement
on a favorable overlap of these dry boundary-layer conditions and
breezy surface winds, delineations may be needed in future outlooks.

...A robust low pressure system will spread moderate to heavy snow
across the upper Midwest tonight, severe thunderstorms across the
mid-Mississippi to Ohio Valleys and record warmth into the
Mid-Atlantic on Saturday...

...A heavy precipitation event will overspread the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Rockies tonight into Saturday,
reaching northern California on Sunday...

A low pressure system currently over the central Plains will
continue to intensify as it tracks northeastward to the central
Great Lakes by Saturday morning.  Cold air already in place across
the northern U.S. will support a swath of moderate to heavy
snowfall from the central Plains through the upper Midwest into
tonight.  The snow is forecast to continue into Saturday across
the upper Great Lakes along with increasingly blustery winds as
the low continues to intensify and move into Canada later on
Saturday.  Meanwhile, warm and moist air from the Gulf of Mexico
will converge ahead of a pre-frontal dry line to result in strong
to severe thunderstorms along the Mississippi Valley tonight.  The
best chance of severe thunderstorms will likely be from the
mid-Mississippi Valley to Ohio Valley tonight into Saturday
morning.  Some of the thunderstorms will likely accompany with
heavy downpours that could result in local flooding issues.

The low pressure system will become quite large on Saturday as it
pull very warm air into much of the Eastern Seaboard.  In fact,
many locations over the Mid-Atlantic region will likely see record
high temperatures Saturday afternoon under a brisk southwesterly
winds.  Northern New England could see a brief period of wintry
precipitation Saturday morning before it changes over quickly to
rain with the passage of a warm front.  By Saturday night, a
strong cold front trailing from the deep storm in eastern Canada
will sweep across the entire East Coast, bringing sharply falling
temperatures and sudden onset of blustery winds.  In fact, high
winds will be mostly likely downwind from the lee sides of the
lower Great Lakes Saturday evening, possibly spreading through
northern New England Saturday night before the front moves out to
sea on Sunday as a high pressure system settles across the entire
eastern U.S.

Meanwhile, a heavy precipitation event will overspread the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Rockies tonight and into Saturday
before reaching northern California on Sunday.  Plenty of moisture
associated with an amplified upper-level trough and an associated
front will likely bring big snowfall totals down the spine of the
Cascades through Saturday, and then into the higher terrain of
northern California during the day on Sunday.  Coastal sections
will likely see up to a few inches of heavy rain along with strong
and gusty winds as this event unfolds.  The moisture will also
spread farther inland across the northern Rockies with areas of
heavy snow over the higher elevations of Idaho through the
weekend.  Parts of northwestern Montana and eastern Wyoming can
expect strong downslope winds to develop during the weekend where
a strong pressure gradient emerges.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri December 10 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 16 - 20 2021

There is very good agreement among the dynamical models regarding an amplif=
ied
500-hPa geopotential height pattern across the forecast domain. Anomalous
troughing and associated below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast for much=
 of
western North America, including over much of northern and eastern Alaska a=
nd
the western CONUS. Enhanced ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies a=
re
favored on both sides of this trough, across the north-central Pacific,
including much of southwestern Alaska, and over most of the CONUS from the
Plains eastward. The overall pattern is forecast to remain amplified
throughout
the period with strong ridging developing over western Alaska during the
middle
and latter parts of the period. As this ridge builds, a trough is forecast =
to
re-amplify downstream across the West Coast of the CONUS.

The anomalous ridging across the eastern and central CONUS supports enhance=
d
probabilities of above normal temperatures from the Central and Southern
Plains
to the East Coast. The highest probabilities (>90 percent) are located over
parts of the Gulf Coast Region, the Lower Mississippi Valley, and Southeast=
,
corresponding with large positive 500-hPa height anomalies and enhanced
southeasterly flow. Anomalous troughing supports increased chances of below
normal temperatures for much of the western third of the CONUS, the Norther=
n
High Plains, and southeastern Alaska. Near normal temperatures are favored =
for
much of the remainder of Alaska as a moderation in temperatures is likely
later
in the period. An exception is for the northwestern Mainland, where a colde=
r
than normal airmass may linger, due to the proximity of predicted Arctic
surface high pressure to the north.

Mid-level ridging over the eastern CONUS and associated surface high pressu=
re
favor increased probabilities of near to below normal precipitation across =
the
Eastern Seaboard. The potential for enhanced return flow moisture west of
surface high pressure combined with a strong surface low predicted near the
western Great Lakes early in the period, lead to elevated above normal
precipitation probabilities for the Southern Plains, the Mississippi, Ohio,
and
Tennessee Valleys, and the Great Lakes. Troughing over the western CONUS
favors
increased probabilities for above normal precipitation over much of the Wes=
t
Coast and Great Basin. Above normal precipitation is favored for much of
Alaska, due to predicted surface low pressure and enhanced Pacific Flow dur=
ing
the early and middle parts of the period.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
excellent model agreement regarding an amplified pattern forecast across No=
rth
America, and in the temperature tools, offset slightly by relatively higher
uncertainty in the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 18 - 24 2021

An amplified 500-hPa flow pattern is forecast to continue into week-2. Ridg=
ing
is forecast to gain strength over western Alaska during the middle of the
period. In response, troughing is forecast to re-amplify across the West Co=
ast
of the CONUS. Downstream ridging and positive height anomalies are favored =
to
persist over the central and eastern CONUS. However, mean troughing over
eastern Canada may limit the northward push of the ridge across parts of
northern New England.

The enhanced ridging over the eastern and central CONUS supports an
anomalously
warm pattern from the Southern and Central Plains to the East Coast during =
the
week-2 period. There is a region with probabilities greater than 80 percent
across the Lower Mississippi Valley and eastern portions of the Southern
Plains. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are comparatively lower
across parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast due to the proximity of mean
troughing over central and eastern Canada acting to suppress the forecast m=
ean
ridge over the eastern CONUS. Elevated below normal temperature probabiliti=
es
are favored across the much of the western third of the CONUS, parts of the
Northern Plains, and southeastern Alaska, associated with mean troughing.
Above
normal temperature probabilities are slightly elevated for southwestern
Alaska,
where a moderating trend is likely in association with a strengthening ridg=
e
by
the middle of week-2. As this ridge builds, a deepening trough predicted
downstream signals a potential trend toward a colder pattern across the Ala=
ska
Panhandle southward along the West Coast of the CONUS and eastward to parts=
 of
the Northern Plains.

Elevated probabilities of near to below normal precipitation are favored
across
the Southeast, associated with predicted mean surface high pressure. Increa=
sed
probabilities of above normal precipitation are indicated across parts of t=
he
Central and Southern Plains, much of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee
Valleys, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast, around the periphery of t=
his
surface high pressure. Increased troughing over the west favors elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation for most of the western third o=
f
the CONUS. Near to below normal precipitation is slightly favored across
eastern Alaska, as increased surface high pressure is predicted across much=
 of
the state in the wake of this mean trough. However, there are slightly
elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation for parts of western Alaska, du=
e
to
the potential for an increased southwesterly component of the overall flow
later in the period.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the ensemble means on the overall large scale 500-hPa patte=
rn,
offset by poor run to run continuity among the deterministic GFS.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

...Atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast by
early next week bringing a threat of heavy rain and heavy mountain
snow...

...Record warmth to spread from the central U.S. through the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Tuesday-Thursday...


...Overview...

Amplified upper troughing will dig through the West early next
week. This will promote increasing and widespread rains with local
runoff issues and terrain enhancing heavy snows over much of the
West/Rockies, first along the coast then progressing southward and
eastward, as an atmospheric river event ensues. As the main system
lifts northeastward through the Plains next Wed-Thu and spawns
cyclogenesis, wintry precipitation will spread along the north
side of the low track. Downstream, upper ridging will build from
the south-central U.S. to the East. Warm sector record warmth will
include temperatures upwards to 20-35F above normal Tue-Thu
spreading from the central U.S. to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
prior to the arrival of generally modest rainfall focused along a
cold front.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast clustering and spread through medium
range time scale is much better than normal, bolstering forecast
confidence. The WPC medium range product suite was primailry
derived from a seemingly reasonable and consistent composite blend
of the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means days 3-7
along with WPC continuity and the National Blend of Models.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moist onshore flow with an atmospheric river will cause widespread
precipitation in the western U.S. early next week. Heaviest
precipitation will spread southward across central and southern
California Mon-Tue and eastward over the Great Basin and Four
Corners states and Rockies through midweek. Enhanced totals are
likely along favored terrain, with heavy mountain snow especially
in the Sierra Nevada and then the central Great Basin and Rockies.
Heavy coastal to interior  rains are expected in California, even
down into Southern CA. Some locally higher rainfall rates may
cause some flooding issues, especially for sensitive burn scar
areas. Temperatures will become below normal in the West
underneath the upper trough, with temperatures 10-15F below
average for parts of California and Nevada next week.

300 PM EST December 10 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low (high) pressure continues to be anticipated across =
the
western (eastern) half of the lower 48 during week-2. The orientation of th=
e
mid-level low pressure favored across the West increases chances for
above-normal, and possibly heavy precipitation near the middle of week-2
centered over central California. This pattern is also likely to support mu=
ch
below normal temperatures across parts of the West until late week-2, with
possible heavy snowfall over the higher elevations of California. Meanwhile=
,
frontal activity across the southeastern quadrant of the contiguous U.S. ma=
y
support enhanced precipitation early in the period. . Outside the CONUS,
models
continue to show a ridge that looks a little sharper and stronger each day.=
 As
this develops, cold air in western Alaska should moderate toward the middle=
 of
week-2 as the chances for much below normal temperatures increases across t=
he
Panhandle

FOR SATURDAY DECEMBER 18 - FRIDAY DECEMBER 24: There is relatively good
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means, indicating a positivel=
y
tilted mid-level trough over the western third of the CONUS at the beginnin=
g
of
week-2, with its axis near the Pacific Coast. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs models generally point
toward a slightly deeper trough that is slowly progressive. Therefore, a
slight
risk of much below normal temperatures remains posted  across much of the
western CONUS which extends into late week-2. For part of this period, the
mid-level and surface pressure situation will favor heavy precipitation in
central California and adjacent areas around the middle of week-2. While th=
is
set-up seems less conducive to extremely heavy precipitation than expected =
in
week-1, reforecast tools are supportive of a slight risk of heavy
precipitation
during the middle of period. Given the expected heavy precipitation and
usually
cold temperatures, a slight risk of heavy snow remains issued  around the
middle of week-2 in the higher elevations of central and northern Californi=
a.
With increased chances for much below normal temperatures, the snow line ma=
y
reach the lower elevations of California.



Models are in excellent agreement about the very strong mid-level ridge
building from the north Pacific Ocean northward Alaska.The models have been
increasing the strength of this feature over the last several days, and now
the
ridge looks to extend northward through much of Alaska, and is much sharper=
 as
well. This will change the temperature pattern across the state. Early week=
-2,
unusually cold air lingering in western parts of the state will erode as th=
e
ridge pulls in milder air. But farther southeast, on the east side of the
ridge, cold air will filter into the Alaskan Panhandle and eventually the
northern High Plains.



There is relatively good model agreement indicating a surface high pressure
over central to western Canada that expands southward toward the end of the
period into the northern High Plains and adjacent Rockies. The accompanying
cold air mass increases the potential for much below normal temperatures fo=
r
the northern High Plains and adjacent Rockies during the latter half of wee=
k-2
and possibly beyond. The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below  0 degrees
Fin
northeastern Montana and North Dakota, and a slight risk of much below norm=
al
temperatures is posted for the region



Multiple model ensemble means and some deterministic solutions continue to
show
the potential for heavy rain along a frontal system moving slowly across th=
e
eastern Great Plains into the interior Southeast during the first half of
week-2. An unusually strong flow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is
expected to enhance the frontal rainfall as the system drifts slowly eastwa=
rd.
This supports a slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the lowe=
r
Mississippi Valley, interior Southeast, and lower Ohio Valley Dec 18 to 20,
when both the strength of the frontal system and the advection of humid air
from the Gulf of Mexico weaken. Drier air is anticipated to push into the
region behind the front, toward the middle of week-2, supporting a transiti=
on
to a drier pattern.

...Atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast by
early next week bringing a threat of heavy rain and heavy mountain
snow...

...Record warmth to spread from the central U.S. through the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Tuesday-Thursday...


...Overview...

Amplified upper troughing will dig through the West early next
week. This will promote increasing and widespread rains with local
runoff issues and terrain enhancing heavy snows over much of the
West/Rockies, first along the coast then progressing southward and
eastward, as an atmospheric river event ensues. As the main system
lifts northeastward through the Plains next Wed-Thu and spawns
cyclogenesis and an associated large enhanced wind field, wintry
precipitation will spread along the north side of the low track
across the northern Plains and Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes and
eroding high pressure dammed northern New England. Meanwhile
underneath, upper ridging will build from the south-central U.S.
to the East.  Warm sector record warmth will include temperatures
upwards to 20-35F above normal Tue-Thu spreading from the central
U.S. to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast prior to the arrival of
generally modest rainfall focused along a trailing cold front.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast clustering and spread through most of
the medium range remains much better than normal, bolstering
forecast confidence. The WPC medium range product suite was
primailry derived from a seemingly reasonable and consistent
composite blend of the GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means days 3-6 along with WPC continuity and the National
Blend of Models (NBM). Forecast spread increases a bit more
rapidily into Day 7, but the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means remain a
still compatible forecast option along with the NBM.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moist onshore flow with an atmospheric river will fuel widespread
precipitation in the western U.S. early next week. Heaviest
precipitation will spread southward across central to southern
California Tue and out across over the Great Basin, Four Corners
states and Rockies through midweek. Enhanced totals are likely
along favored terrain, with heavy mountain snow especially in the
Sierra Nevada and then the central Great Basin and Rockies. Heavy
coastal to interior rains are expected in California. Some locally
higher rainfall rates may cause some flooding issues, especially
for sensitive burn scar areas. Temperatures will become below
normal in the West underneath the upper trough, with temperatures
10-15F below average for parts of California and Nevada.
Downstream, deep midweek north-central U.S. cyclogenesis and
subsequent notheastward track into Canada will spread snow across
the northern Plains and Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes. Snows
will combine with enhanced winds around the large circulation and
the heaviest wrap-around focus may setup over the Upper Midwest.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1214 AM CST Sat Dec 11 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will progress across the East Coast as more zonal
flow aloft prevails over the central U.S. A 1036 mb surface high
across the central Rockies will encourage modest gradient-driven
surface westerly winds across the central and southern High Plains.
10-15 percent RH is expected to be common across southeast Colorado
into northeast New Mexico and the western Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles
by afternoon peak heating. Still, sustained surface wind speeds are
expected to remain below 15 mph on a widespread basis, with only
locally Elevated fire weather conditions expected along the southern
High Plains, hence no fire weather highlights introduced.

1239 AM CST Sat Dec 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN TEXAS AND
OKLAHOMA PANHANDLES...

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will build across the southeast U.S. as a mid-level
trough deepens along the West Coast tomorrow afternoon. Surface lee
troughing across the central/southern High Plains will encourage
downslope dry and breezy conditions supporting a wildfire-spread
threat. The latest guidance consensus depicts widespread 10-20
percent RH coinciding with 25 mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds across the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles by afternoon peak
heating, warranting Critical highlights. At least locally Elevated
fire weather conditions are expected farther north and east into
central Kansas/Oklahoma. However, guidance varies widely in terms of
how low RH will drop across the central Plains, precluding an
eastward extension of the Elevated area this outlook. Given
widespread 15-25 mph south-southwesterly surface winds across
central Kansas/Oklahoma tomorrow afternoon, Elevated highlights may
be needed pending lower RH trends in future guidance.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Ohio, Tennessee Valleys, and parts of the Southeast through
Sunday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Pacific Northwest and parts of Northern California through Sunday
morning...

...Heavy snow over the Upper Great Lakes through Saturday
afternoon; heavy snow for the Cascades, Sierra Nevada Mountains,
and Northern Rockies...

An area of deep low pressure over the Great Lakes will move
quickly into Southeastern Canada by Saturday evening. The system
will produce heavy snow over the Upper Great Lakes through
Saturday afternoon. Rain will start over most of Michigan=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
s
Lower Peninsula on Saturday morning that will change over to snow
by Saturday afternoon. Rain will also develop over parts of the
Northeast and change over to snow overnight Saturday before ending
over Northern New England by Sunday morning.  The snow will result
in reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions.

Moreover, showers and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead
of the cold front from the Ohio Valley to the Lower Mississippi
Valley.  Some of the thunderstorms will be severe.  Therefore, the
SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Ohio, Tennessee Valleys, and parts of the Southeast through
Sunday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes.  Showers and thunderstorms will also develop over
parts of the Mid-Atlantic on Saturday. The threat for severe
thunderstorms ends on Sunday morning as the front moves offshore.

In the meantime, the thunderstorms will contain areas of heavy
rain. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Southern Appalachians, Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys into the Lower Mississippi Valley through Sunday morning.
The associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain. The excessive rainfall threat ends on Sunday as the front
moves off the East Coast.

Meanwhile, a front moves onshore over the Pacific Northwest and
moves inland to the Northern Plains by Monday.  On Saturday, a
plume of moisture will stream into parts of the Pacific Northwest
and Northern California and slowly move southward over the coast
to Southern California by Sunday evening into Monday.  The system
will produce rain and higher elevation snow over the Northwest,
with snow extending inland to the Northern Rockies. Overnight
Saturday, the rain and higher elevation snow will expand into
parts of Northern California and Central California Sunday night
into Monday. During this long-duration event, the snow will be
heavy over the Cascades, Sierra Nevada Mountains, and Northern
Rockies. The snow will result in reduced visibility and hazardous
driving conditions.

Furthermore, the rain will be heavy at times along the coast.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
over parts of the Pacific Northwest and Northern California
through Sunday morning. The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable.  Similarly, the WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of Central
California from Sunday into Monday morning. Likewise, the
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable.

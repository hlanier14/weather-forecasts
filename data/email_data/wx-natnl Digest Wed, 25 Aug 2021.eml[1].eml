Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1055 AM CDT Tue Aug 24 2021

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The latest guidance continues to depict widespread Elevated
conditions across much of the central and western Great Basin for
this afternoon. Guidance consensus suggests central into eastern
Nevada and western Utah will be the most likely region to experience
widespread Elevated surface conditions, though fuels remain
marginally receptive to fire spread. Across central into western
Nevada, fuels are drier, but the limited time and space for Elevated
surface conditions overlapping receptive fuels preclude an Elevated
delineation. Similarly, across northern Wyoming, very isolated dry
thunderstorms are still possible later this afternoon and evening,
but the lack of greater expected coverage precludes fire weather
highlights here as well. More details on the dry and breezy
conditions across the Great Basin and very isolated dry
thunderstorms across northern Utah are available in the previous
forecast below.

..Squitieri.. 08/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CDT Tue Aug 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to translate into
the Canadian prairies through the day, resulting in generally
weakening flow aloft as a broad longwave trough settles over the
West Coast. The loss of upper-level support will limit the potential
for strong winds across much of the West outside of a strip over the
Great Basin and into the central Rockies where modest southwesterly
mid-level flow will linger. However, modest fuel receptiveness
across these areas suggest the potential for serious fire weather
concerns is low.

...Great Basin into the central Rocky Mountains...
Elevated wind/RH conditions appear probable this afternoon as deep
boundary-layer mixing and a nearly uni-directional wind profile
support 15-20 mph sustained winds with frequent gusts up to 25-30
mph. Despite relative humidity reductions into the single digits,
recent fuel reports indicate that fuels dryness is generally near or
just below seasonal averages with ERC values near the 50th
percentile for most locations. This precludes the introduction of
highlights at this time, but a few localized fire weather concerns
may emerge for locations with drier fuels.

...Northeast Wyoming...
Very isolated thunderstorms are possible late this afternoon into
the overnight hours as a stalled cold front begins to shift
northward as a weak warm front. Despite poor moisture recovery in
the lowest 1-2 km, improving mid-level moisture will boost PWAT
values to 0.75-0.8 inches and support a mix of wet and dry
thunderstorms. Modestly dry fuels across the northeastern quadrant
of the state - generally across the High Plains - are noted with
fine fuel moisture near 5%. A low-end dry thunderstorm concern may
evolve across this region, but confidence in the coverage and
propensity for dry thunderstorms is too low to warrant highlights.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 24 2021

SYNOPSIS: Early in the period, mid-level low pressure forecast over the
Pacific
Northwest is expected to promote below normal temperatures with the potential
for early season frost over parts of Washington and Oregon. There is
multi-model agreement supporting a slight risk of excessive heat focused over
the Central Plains at the outset of week-2. Tropical cyclone formation favored
in the Gulf of Mexico late in week-1 is expected to bring enhanced, and
possibly heavy rainfall over parts of southern Texas and Louisiana early in
the
period. Later in week-2, there is growing support in the guidance for
potentially heavy precipitation across portions of the Midwest. Enhanced
monsoonal moisture and precipitation may result in localized flooding over
parts of the Desert Southwest. Over Alaska, mid-level high pressure is
expected
to promote primarily above (below) normal temperatures (precipitation) during
week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Intermountain region, Wed-Thu, Sep 1-2.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Central Plains, Wed-Thu, Sep
1-2.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the portions of southern Texas and
Louisiana, Wed-Thu, Sep 1-2.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Central and Northern
Plains, Middle and Upper Mississippi Valley, and the Great Lakes, Thu-Sat, Sep
2-4.

Flooding possible across parts of the Desert Southwest.

FOR WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 01 - TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 07: Both the GEFS and ECMWF
continue to advertise anomalous 500-hPa ridging centered over the Gulf of
Alaska, with downstream troughing depicted across the Pacific Northwest by the
beginning of September. This mid-level feature is anticipated to bring a round
of below-normal temperatures to the northwestern CONUS early in the period,
where there is agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
highlighting an area over eastern Washington and Oregon with at least a 20%
chance nighttime minimum temperatures fall below the 15th percentile and 40
degrees F. This supports the potential for early season frost to impact
vegetation, and a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is issued for
the region from Sep 1 to 2. Farther east, there is better support in today's
guidance signaling possible excessive heat across the Central Plains early in
the period. Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict anomalously warm 850-hpa
temperatures mainly across the region where reforecast tools show an area from
eastern Colorado to the Middle Mississippi Valley with at least a 30% chance
of
maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 degrees F. The
excessive heat signal is also well reflected in calibrated heat tools which
also show elevated chances for heat index values exceeding the 90th percentile
over the Central Plains, and a slight risk of excessive heat is issued for the
region from Sep 1 to 2. As the troughing over the northwestern CONUS is
forecast to weaken by day 9 (Sep 2), the GEFS continues to favor increasing
mid-level heights over the Upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes by the
middle of the period. Anomalously warm temperatures are favored in both the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools, however, these tools maintain a low
probability of actual temperatures reaching hazard thresholds, and no
corresponding hazards are issued.



Across the tropics, despite the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) becoming
weaker
and more disorganized during the last week, Kelvin wave activity forecast over
the Western Hemisphere is expected to provide a favorable large-scale
environment for additional tropical cyclone (TC) activity across the Atlantic
and East Pacific during early September. In the Atlantic, the National
Hurricane Center (NHC) is currently monitoring a tropical wave in the eastern
Caribbean with a 60% chance of formation through the next 5 days. Model
guidance continues to be supportive of development by late week-1, as this
disturbance is expected to track across the Gulf of Honduras and into the Bay
of Campeche. This morning's 6z deterministic GFS and 0z ECMWF favor a more
northerly solution relative to previous model runs, taking this potential
system north of the Rio Grande and into southern Texas on day 7, resulting in
a
period of heavy rainfall persisting into the start of week-2. Compared to
yesterday, there is better agreement in today's reforecast tools showing at
least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th
percentile and 1 inch early in the period, with increased probabilities
extending further inland across southern Texas associated with this potential
system. Thus, the slight risk of heavy precipitation is maintained for Sep 1
to
2 and is expanded accordingly relative to yesterday's outlook. Later in the
period, the last several runs of the GFS and GEFS favor additional TC
formation
in the western Caribbean with several low centers tracking north into the Gulf
of Mexico. However, given the uncertainty at this lead and less support from
the ECMWF, no corresponding hazards are issued but this potential tropical
risk
will continue to be monitored in subsequent outlooks.



Farther north, there are increased signals for heavy precipitation across
portions of the Plains and Mississippi Valley tied to surface low development
and frontal activity. Despite less support from the GEFS, both the ECMWF
uncalibrated precipitation guidance and the ECMWF reforecast tool are
particularly pronounced with this signal, highlighting a region from the
Central Plains to the Upper Mississippi Valley with at least a 20% chance for
3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch through
the middle portion of the outlook period. Thus, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is added over the Central and Northern Plains, and the Middle
and
Upper Mississippi Valley from Sep 2 to 4. As above-normal precipitation is
also
favored during week-1, the continuation of above-normal rains in week-2 is
expected to benefit moisture starved soils where D0 to D4 drought conditions
are registered in the Upper Midwest.



In the eastern Pacific, the NHC continues to monitor an area of low pressure
to
the south of Mexico with a 90% chance of formation during the next 5 days.
Both
the GEFS and ECMWF are in agreement depicting a deepening low center near the
mouth of the Gulf of California, where combined with a thermal low forecast
over the Sonoran Desert, is favorable for the initiation of a Gulf Surge event
to advect moisture into the Desert Southwest early in the period. Reforecast
guidance also continues to indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile over the region and extending into
the Great Basin. Although rainfall amounts do not reach hazard thresholds in
these tools, the elevated signals for enhanced rainfall favor convective
episodes in the Desert Southwest during week-2 which may lead to localized
flash flooding. Therefore, a possible flooding hazard remains issued in the
outlook.



Over Alaska, the aforementioned mid-level ridging predicted over the Gulf of
Alaska early in the period predominately favors above-normal temperatures and
below-normal precipitation across much of the southern Mainland and Panhandle,
and no hazards are posted for the state during week-2.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain threat likely to extend into the
weekend...

...Heavy rain possible for parts of southeast Texas early next
week associated with tropical development...


...Overview...

Latest guidance maintains good continuity and agreement with the
mean pattern, showing the main band of westerlies extending from
the northeastern Pacific through the northern lower 48 and
southern Canada while ridging prevails from the Atlantic through
the eastern/southern U.S. A series of shortwaves emerging from
western North America and associated surface waves/fronts are
likely to promote a period of heavy rain potential over parts of
the Upper Midwest, extending from the short range period into the
weekend. Areas south of the fronts will see humid and very warm to
hot weather with some late-day showers and thunderstorms. Possible
tropical development over the northwestern Caribbean and western
Gulf of Mexico may bring enhanced moisture to the western half of
the Gulf Coast region by early next week.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models are still in the process of refining the details across the
northern tier. Models continue to show fairly good agreement on a
leading north-central Plains wave that may track northeast through
the Upper Great Lakes into Canada Friday into the weekend,
followed by a stronger system in response to trailing energy that
emerges from the Northwest. Some timing differences exist with the
latter energy especially after day 4, with the 00z ECMWF and UKMET
faster than the 06z GFS and 00z CMC. The ensemble means, albeit
weaker, show good agreement on a more middle ground solution.
Farther upstream a northeastern Pacific trough/embedded upper low
should arrive into the Northwest U.S. and western Canada by early
next week. Ensemble means have been fairly consistent with this
trough and provide a good anchor for its forecast. Recent
deterministic model runs have varied somewhat faster or slower but
with an overall average near the means.

The latest guidance continues to suggest the development of a
possible tropical system extending from the northwestern Caribbean
into the western Gulf of Mexico early next week. The CMC had been
consistently more south, bringing the low into central Mexico, but
the latest 12z run for today came way north bringing a low into
the central Texas coast late next Monday. This northward shift is
more in line with the 12z GFS (which has also trended north the
past few runs) and the more consistently north ECMWF. There
remains significant uncertainty in the ensemble guidance though so
confidence is low, but potential for more significant impacts to
parts of the Texas coast appears to be increasing. Consult the
National Hurricane Center's Tropical Weather Outlooks for the
latest information on this development potential over the coming
days.

The updated WPC forecast started with a composite of latest
deterministic models days 3-4. After that, increased contributions
from the ensemble means in an attempt to mitigate the differences
in northern stream energy lifting into central Canada and incoming
energy into the Northwest. For days 6-7, did maintain some smaller
portions of the ECMWF and GFS just to get some definition in the
forecast. This maintains good continuity with the previous WPC
forecast as well.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The signal for heavy rainfall persists over portions of the Upper
Midwest from the short range period into the weekend as multiple
impulses move through the area around the northern periphery of a
warm/moist air mass.  Multiple episodes and possible training
storms could lead to significant rainfall totals at some
locations.  Antecedent dryness in parts of the region could
initially blunt the effects of heavy rain but the multi-day nature
of the event and potential higher end rainfall totals in a short
duration are likely to overcome that with runoff issues becoming
problematic over some areas.  Well into the warm sector across the
central/southern parts of the East, more typical summertime
diurnally-favored convection should occur within the hot and humid
air mass.  A front settling into the Mid-Atlantic during
Friday-Sunday may provide some added focus for rainfall, while
upper level impulses could enhance convection over parts of the
South.  A cold front advancing from the Plains should bring a more
organized area of showers/storms into the East by Monday-Tuesday.
For the Gulf coast, expect rainfall to increase across parts of
southeast Texas Sunday onward as possible tropical development
most likely reaches the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Guidance has
trended north, increasing potential for heavy rainfall and
tropical impacts more north into the southern/central Texas Gulf
Coast region. Confidence in exact locations of the heaviest rain
remains low at best right now though.

Above normal temperatures will prevail from the Midwest into the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic through the weekend with
some moderation thereafter as a cold front emerges from the
Plains.  Through early Monday there should be decent coverage of
morning lows up to 10-15F above normal while isolated locations
could reach plus 10F anomalies for highs.  Some daily record warm
lows are possible.  In contrast the northern Rockies/Plains will
be rather cool late this week into the weekend with some locations
seeing one or more days with highs 10-15F below normal.  Highs of
5-10F above normal will spread from the Southwest into California
and parts of Oregon Friday-Sunday.  Then Southern Rockies moisture
reaching the Southwest and the upper trough nearing the Northwest
will support a gradual cooling trend.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions
made. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 08/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Tue Aug 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
Persistent southwesterly flow over the Great Basin and into the
central Rocky Mountains will maintain breezy conditions and the
potential for meeting elevated wind/RH criteria. Additionally, lift
ahead of a broad upper-level wave will introduce dry thunderstorm
chances to parts of the northern Rockies. Despite these concerns,
fuel conditions are generally not sufficiently receptive to support
widespread fire weather concerns.

...Great Basin into the central Rockies...
A belt of 20-30 mph mid-level flow is forecast to linger over
southeast NV northeastward into central WY. Modest pressure-gradient
winds near 15-20 mph will see frequent gusts up to 25-30 mph as
well-mixed boundary layers diurnally deepen and mix down stronger
flow aloft. RH reductions into the single digits to teens are
likely, so sustaining elevated wind/RH criteria appears probable.
However, ERC values are generally near or below the 50th percentile,
suggesting the overall fire weather concern is low. Fuel trends will
be monitored over the next 24 hours for the need for highlights.

...Southwest Montana...
A combination of weak orographic ascent and broad lift ahead of a
West Coast trough will support isolated showers and thunderstorms
over far southwest MT and adjacent areas of ID/WY Wednesday
afternoon. Forecast soundings show favorable thermodynamic profiles
for dry thunderstorms with PWAT values near 0.5-0.6 inches and well
mixed boundary layers up to 2-3 km. While dry thunderstorms appear
possible, fuels across southwest MT are generally not receptive (ERC
values well below the 50th percentile).

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue August 24 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 30 - SEP 03, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough near
northern
Mainland Alaska and a ridge over the northern Pacific and southern Mainland
Alaska, with positive 500-hPa height anomalies across much of the state.
Slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies extend across most of the eastern
CONUS in the ECMWF and GEFS ensemble mean forecasts. A weak trough is
predicted
over the northwestern CONUS in most model solutions, with associated slightly
below normal mid-level heights. Anomalous southerly flow and low surface
pressure are predicted over western areas of the Southwest, potentially
influenced by tropical activity in the East Pacific.

Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated over the northwestern
coast
of Mainland Alaska, with onshore flow and increased cloudiness. Above normal
temperatures are likely for the Aleutians, southern Mainland Alaska, and the
Alaska Panhandle, under predicted positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Above
normal temperatures are favored across much of the CONUS, due to predicted
500-hPa ridging and slightly above normal heights forecast over most areas.
Probabilities for above normal temperatures exceed 60 percent over the Central
Plains, supported by the temperature consolidation tool. Troughing and near to
slightly below normal heights favor enhanced probabilities of near to below
normal temperatures over the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, and parts of
the Northern Plains. Short term bias corrected temperature forecasts from the
GEFS and Canadian ensembles, and the raw ECMWF ensemble, indicate below normal
temperatures are likely along the Gulf Coast, while bias-corrected ECMWF and
GEFS ensemble model temperature forecasts based on multi-decadal reforecasts
predict likely above normal temperatures for the region. Near normal
temperatures are favored in this region, due to uncertainty and increased
cloud
cover.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over northwestern
Mainland Alaska due to increased potential for storm system development under
the predicted trough. Below normal precipitation is favored over southeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, under a predicted ridge. Below
normal
precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the Pacific Northwest, under
anomalous northwesterly flow, and consistent with the precipitation
consolidation forecast tool. Dynamical model precipitation forecast tools
support increased probabilities of above normal precipitation over most of the
eastern CONUS, including greater probabilities for above normal from the
Western and Central Gulf Coast northeastward along a predicted active storm
track.  Probabilities for above normal precipitation exceed 50 percent for the
western Gulf Coast region, due to potential impacts of tropical activity.
Above
normal precipitation is also favored for parts of the Northern Plains and
Southwest, supported by the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, offset
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 01 - 07 2021

During the week-2 period, a low amplitude 500-hPa circulation pattern is
predicted overall with increasing uncertainty. In general, the manual blend of
dynamical model forecasts indicates similar large-scale features to the 6-10
day forecast. A trough is forecast over parts of the Pacific Northwest, with
near zero or slightly negative 500-hPa height anomalies shifted to the south
and west relative to the 6-10 day period forecast. Slightly positive 500-hPa
height anomalies are forecast over most of the remainder of the CONUS in the
week-2 manual blend of 500-hPa height forecasts, except for parts of the
south-central CONUS, the Northeast region, and the southern Florida Peninsula.
Positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over Alaska in week-2.

Increased cloudiness favors below normal temperatures for northwestern
Mainland
Alaska. Forecast above normal 500-hPa heights increase chances for above
normal
temperatures over southern and central Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians, and the
Alaska Panhandle. Near to above normal temperatures are favored across much of
the CONUS, under slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies and supported by
the temperature consolidation tool. Near to below normal temperatures are
favored for the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies and the Northern Plains,
associated with a weak mid-level trough over the region early in the week-2
period. With potential increased cloudiness and near average heights, near
normal temperatures are favored for parts of the Southwest along the Mexico
border, the Rio Grande Valley, and the Gulf Coast region.

Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of northwestern Mainland
Alaska, due to potential storms. Below normal precipitation is favored for
southeastern Mainland Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle, under positive 500-hPa
height anomalies. Below normal precipitation is likely for much of the Pacific
Northwest, as well as the southern Florida Peninsula, consistent with the
precipitation consolidation tool. Although uncertainty increases in week-2
among dynamical model precipitation tools, near to above normal precipitation
is favored across much of the CONUS. Probabilities for above normal
precipitation are elevated for parts of the Southwest monsoon region, related
to the potential for tropical moisture surges. Above normal precipitation
probabilities are also increased for parts of the Northern Plains, western
Gulf
Coast, and Mid-Atlantic coast, supported by the precipitation consolidation
tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40% of
Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
fair agreement among the models on a changing large-scale circulation pattern,
offset by very weak height anomalies across the CONUS and increasing
differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast tools.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain threat likely to extend into the
weekend...

...Heavy rain possible for parts of southeast Texas early next
week associated with tropical development...


...Overview...

Latest guidance maintains good continuity and agreement with the
mean pattern, showing the main band of westerlies extending from
the northeastern Pacific through the northern lower 48 and
southern Canada while ridging prevails from the Atlantic through
the eastern/southern U.S. A series of shortwaves emerging from
western North America and associated surface waves/fronts are
likely to promote a period of heavy rain potential over parts of
the Upper Midwest, extending from the short range period into the
weekend. Areas south of the fronts will see humid and very warm to
hot weather with some late-day showers and thunderstorms. Possible
tropical development over the northwestern Caribbean and western
Gulf of Mexico may bring enhanced moisture to the western half of
the Gulf Coast region by early next week.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models are still in the process of refining the details across the
northern tier. Models continue to show fairly good agreement on a
leading north-central Plains wave that may track northeast through
the Upper Great Lakes into Canada Friday into the weekend,
followed by a stronger system in response to trailing energy that
emerges from the Northwest. Some timing differences exist with the
latter energy especially after day 4, with the 00z ECMWF and UKMET
faster than the 06z GFS and 00z CMC. The ensemble means, albeit
weaker, show good agreement on a more middle ground solution.
Farther upstream a northeastern Pacific trough/embedded upper low
should arrive into the Northwest U.S. and western Canada by early
next week. Ensemble means have been fairly consistent with this
trough and provide a good anchor for its forecast. Recent
deterministic model runs have varied somewhat faster or slower but
with an overall average near the means.

The latest guidance continues to suggest the development of a
possible tropical system extending from the northwestern Caribbean
into the western Gulf of Mexico early next week. The CMC had been
consistently more south, bringing the low into central Mexico, but
the latest 12z run for today came way north bringing a low into
the central Texas coast late next Monday. This northward shift is
more in line with the 12z GFS (which has also trended north the
past few runs) and the more consistently north ECMWF. There
remains significant uncertainty in the ensemble guidance though so
confidence is low, but potential for more significant impacts to
parts of the Texas coast appears to be increasing. Consult the
National Hurricane Center's Tropical Weather Outlooks for the
latest information on this development potential over the coming
days.

The updated WPC forecast started with a composite of latest
deterministic models days 3-4. After that, increased contributions
from the ensemble means in an attempt to mitigate the differences
in northern stream energy lifting into central Canada and incoming
energy into the Northwest. For days 6-7, did maintain some smaller
portions of the ECMWF and GFS just to get some definition in the
forecast. This maintains good continuity with the previous WPC
forecast as well.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The signal for heavy rainfall persists over portions of the Upper
Midwest from the short range period into the weekend as multiple
impulses move through the area around the northern periphery of a
warm/moist air mass.  Multiple episodes and possible training
storms could lead to significant rainfall totals at some
locations.  Antecedent dryness in parts of the region could
initially blunt the effects of heavy rain but the multi-day nature
of the event and potential higher end rainfall totals in a short
duration are likely to overcome that with runoff issues becoming
problematic over some areas.  Well into the warm sector across the
central/southern parts of the East, more typical summertime
diurnally-favored convection should occur within the hot and humid
air mass.  A front settling into the Mid-Atlantic during
Friday-Sunday may provide some added focus for rainfall, while
upper level impulses could enhance convection over parts of the
South.  A cold front advancing from the Plains should bring a more
organized area of showers/storms into the East by Monday-Tuesday.
For the Gulf coast, expect rainfall to increase across parts of
southeast Texas Sunday onward as possible tropical development
most likely reaches the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Guidance has
trended north, increasing potential for heavy rainfall and
tropical impacts more north into the southern/central Texas Gulf
Coast region. Confidence in exact locations of the heaviest rain
remains low at best right now though.

Above normal temperatures will prevail from the Midwest into the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic through the weekend with
some moderation thereafter as a cold front emerges from the
Plains.  Through early Monday there should be decent coverage of
morning lows up to 10-15F above normal while isolated locations
could reach plus 10F anomalies for highs.  Some daily record warm
lows are possible.  In contrast the northern Rockies/Plains will
be rather cool late this week into the weekend with some locations
seeing one or more days with highs 10-15F below normal.  Highs of
5-10F above normal will spread from the Southwest into California
and parts of Oregon Friday-Sunday.  Then Southern Rockies moisture
reaching the Southwest and the upper trough nearing the Northwest
will support a gradual cooling trend.

...Stifling heat and humidity throughout much of the central and
eastern United States, dangerous heat returning to the Southwest
by Wednesday...

...Scattered showers and a few severe thunderstorms possible from
the northern and central Plains into the Midwest over the next few
days, hit-or-miss showers and storm in the Southeast...

Sizzling temperatures look to bake much of the southern tier and
eastern half of the Lower 48 through mid-week thanks to an
expansive area of upper level ridging that is forecast to stretch
from Southern California to the East Coast. Heat Advisories have
been posted from the central High Plains to the Ohio Valley while
some have also been issued in parts of the Northeast. The hottest
conditions are presently located in the ArkLaMiss portion of the
Lower Mississippi Valley where Excessive Heat Warnings remain in
place through early thins evening. As ridging aloft over the South
Central U.S. bleeds into the Desert Southwest, oppressive heat is
set to transpire the second half of the week in southern Arizona
and far southern California. In advance of this impending heat
wave, an Excessive Heat Watch has been issued for these areas
beginning Wednesday morning and lasting into Friday. Some parts of
the country can expect temperatures to exceed the century mark,
most notably in the central High Plains and the Desert Southwest.
In fact, afternoon high temps may reach up to 115F both Thursday
and Friday in southeast California and southwest Arizona. While
only a handful of daily high temperature records are at risk of
being broken, a plethora of warm minimum temperature records are
likely to fall thanks to high humidity levels keeping overnight
temperatures very warm. These warm nighttime temperatures in the
70s and even near 80F can be particularly dangerous for those
without access to proper air conditioning. Unfortunately, the
large dome of upper level high pressure will continue to deflect
cold fronts attempting to usher in cooler and more refreshing
air-masses to the north for the time being, forcing much of the
South and east-central U.S. to stay hot and steamy through the end
of the work-week.

Elsewhere, two separate rounds of showers and storms are set to
impact the north-central United States over the next few days. The
first wave of low pressure and its associated frontal boundaries
are already responsible for segments of thunderstorms tracking
through the Upper Midwest this afternoon. These thunderstorms may
continue to progress east-southeast into the early evening hours
and potentially produce damaging wind gusts and tornadoes across
the Upper Midwest. A few isolated severe thunderstorms could
develop farther south and into the Central Plains as well. By
Wednesday, the same frontal boundary is expected to lift north as
a warm front over the central High Plains as an approaching upper
level trough over the West Coast (storm system number 2) enters
the Northern Rockies. This could spell more chances for spotty
severe storms throughout the northern and central High Plains.
While heavy rain could cause localized flash flooding, much of
this section of the country from the northern High Plains to the
Upper Midwest is experiencing severe to exceptional drought and
will welcome this rainfall. By Thursday however, widespread
showers and storms are likely to form over the Dakotas and Upper
Mississippi Valley. With recent rainfall saturating more of the
ground and a better setup for heavy rainfall coming together, a
day 3 Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall has been issued for parts
of these regions on Thursday. Farther south and east, typical
widely scattered summer thunderstorms are anticipated across the
Southeast and Gulf Coast with the main hazard associated with
heavy rain. The slow movement of these pop-up thunderstorms could
lead to localized instances of flash flooding.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1237 AM CDT Wed Aug 25 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Southwesterly flow will persist across much of the interior West as
an upper-level trough gradually shifts inland from the West Coast
through the day. Winds aloft will not be particularly strong, but a
belt of modest mid-level winds will support elevated wind magnitudes
at the surface across the eastern Great Basin and into the central
Rockies. Perturbations within the southwesterly flow regime will
also support isolated dry thunderstorm chances across parts of
southern Montana and northeast Utah. Unreceptive fuels across much
of the interior West will limit the overall fire weather threat
despite favorable meteorological conditions.

...Great Basin and central Rockies...
Elevated conditions were observed yesterday at several surface
stations across eastern NV, western UT, and southern WY with
sustained winds near 15-20 mph, gusts up to 35 mph, and RH
reductions down to 10% at times. With little appreciable change in
the overall synoptic regime, similar conditions are expected again
today for the same region. Recent fuel reports suggest that some
drying/curing has occurred over the past 24 hours, but has not been
sufficient to boost ERCs above normal seasonal values. While
elevated wind/RH criteria will likely be met this afternoon, the
fire weather threat will be limited to locally drier locations.

...Northeast Utah and Southwest Montana...
Guidance continues to show a reasonably good signal for isolated to
scattered convective showers and thunderstorms across northeast UT
and southwest MT this afternoon as weak perturbations within the
mean flow propagate through the central and northern Rockies. Slight
cooling aloft coupled with limited moisture return will yield
low-end instability with PWAT values between 0.5 to 0.7 inches -
supportive of at least an isolated dry lightning threat. However,
fuels across both regions remain unreceptive based on recent
reports, which mitigates a more robust fire weather concern and the
need for highlights at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Wed Aug 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
The potential for dry thunderstorms across the central Rockies and
adjacent High Plains will be the primary fire weather concern for
Thursday. Stronger synoptic lift is forecast to overspread the
inter-mountain West through the day as the upper-level trough
currently over the West Coast translates to the east. A few
localized areas of elevated wind/RH conditions may emerge, but will
most likely reside over areas with poor fuel readiness.

...Central Rockies to the Hi...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms appear probable from eastern UT
into CO and WY by the mid to late afternoon hours Thursday. Deep,
dry boundary layers, PWAT values between 0.5 and 0.7 inches, and
fast storm motions (near 40 knots in some solutions) may limit
rainfall amounts. Latest ensemble guidance suggests multiple rounds
of showers/thunderstorms over eastern UT and CO should result in
areas of wetting rain, but more isolated convection over
central/eastern WY may limit this potential. Fuels across much of
the central Rockies are unreceptive with ERC values near or below
the 50th percentile. Adjacent portions of the high Plains are drier
with ERC values closer to the 75th percentile. Although isolated dry
thunderstorms are possible across the broader region, eastern WY is
highlighted given the favorable overlap of dry fuels and dry thunder
potential.

...Eastern and northern Great Basin...
Breezy northwesterly winds may increase to 15-20 mph behind a weak
cold front Thursday afternoon for parts of eastern NV and through
the Snake River Plain of eastern ID. Strong diurnal heating will
likely result in RH reductions into the teens. While elevated
wind/RH conditions are possible, poor fuel readiness and limited
spatial coverage of these conditions suggests a limited fire weather
concern.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain threat likely to extend through
Saturday...

...Heavy rain threat for parts of the central/western Gulf Coast
early next week with possible tropical development...


...Overview...

The main band of westerlies will carry along two primary features
during the period.  The first, a shortwave that should progress
from the northern Rockies into the northeastern U.S./eastern
Canada, will push along a frontal system from the Plains/Upper
Midwest into the East with accompanying rain/storms.  The heavy
rain potential expected for multiple days over the Upper Midwest
should extend into Saturday and then taper off as the front moves
eastward.  An upstream trough with embedded upper low should reach
western Canada and the Northwest U.S. by next Monday-Wednesday,
with a leading frontal system pushing into the Northwest and
eventually the northern Plains.  Ahead of these systems, a front
settling over the Mid-Atlantic by the weekend may focus some rain
and thunderstorms.  Upper ridging will likely prevail across the
southern tier for most of the period plus much of the East during
the weekend.  Over the past day or so guidance has been changing
rapidly for a possible tropical system forecast to originate from
a Caribbean tropical wave, track into the Gulf of Mexico, and find
a weakness in the southern tier mean ridge aloft.  Trends are
steadily increasing the threat of a heavy rainfall event somewhere
along the central/western Gulf Coast early next week but with
limited confidence in specifics at this time.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The full range of model and ensemble guidance provides good
support for a consensus approach with respect to the northern
stream shortwaves and associated surface systems.  Most guidance
has been stabilizing and clustering better for the system emerging
from the Rockies/Plains and continuing eastward thereafter.
Models suggest that the upper trough reaching western North
America next week may consist of multiple pieces of energy,
favoring a trend toward some ensemble weight to downplay lower
confidence details.  Multiple UKMET runs through the 12Z cycle had
been out of sync with most solutions but the new 00Z run finally
agrees better with consensus.

Meanwhile the models and ensembles have displayed considerable
spread and trending for the tropical system that may develop from
the wave initially over the Caribbean.  Just 24-36 hours ago a
majority cluster was showing a track into Mexico south of the Rio
Grande but with a minority showing a farther north scenario.  Then
the average of 12Z-18Z guidance more emphatically brought the
track into southern Texas with the 12Z ECMWF even reaching over or
east of the Texas/Louisiana border.  The new 00Z GFS/CMC have now
trended toward the latest ECMWF runs (with timing differences).
The 00Z UKMET is in line with the previous farther west majority
through the end of its run.  Based on guidance available through
the 18Z cycle, the manual forecast emphasized an average among the
12Z CMC/12Z-18Z GFS and old 00Z ECMWF plus a compromise with
continuity that was similar in principle.  Consult the National
Hurricane Center's Tropical Weather Outlooks for the latest
information on this development potential over the coming days.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Latest trends are increasing the threat of a heavy rainfall event
somewhere along the central/western Gulf Coast around early next
week in association with tropical development that may track over
the Gulf and into the southern U.S.  The majority cluster of
guidance has been shifting rapidly to the right over the past
couple days so confidence is fairly low in where the ultimate
track may lie.  The heavy rain potential over parts of the Upper
Midwest should extend through Saturday ahead of a wavy frontal
system whose eastward progression should finally lead to a drier
trend later in the weekend and early next week.  Expect areas of
rain and thunderstorms of varying intensity to accompany this
front as it continues into the East.  A leading front draped over
the eastern Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic may promote periods of
rain/storms during the weekend.  Farther south away from these
fronts some diurnally-favored convection will be possible within
the hot and humid air mass.  One or more waves/fronts ahead of the
upper trough moving into western North America may bring some
rainfall into the northern tier by next Tuesday or Wednesday.
Scattered diurnal convection is possible over the southern
Rockies/Arizona through the period.

Areas from the Midwest into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and
southern Mid-Atlantic will be quite warm to hot ahead of the cold
front emerging from the Plains followed by a cooling trend after
frontal passage.  From the weekend into early next week there
should be decent coverage of morning lows 10-15F above normal
while a few locations could reach plus 10F or so anomalies for
highs.  Some daily record warm lows are possible.  The northern
Rockies/High Plains will see highs up to 10-15F below normal
Saturday followed by moderation of the cool air as it continues
eastward.  After a rebound to around normal, parts of Montana may
see below normal highs once again by next Wednesday.  Portions of
California/Oregon/Nevada should see highs 5-10F above normal
during the weekend followed by a cooling trend and then the
central High Plains should trend warmer to similar anomalies early
next week.

...Isolated severe thunderstorms and the potential for flash
flooding forecast across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest on
Thursday...

...Persistent heat and humidity continues throughout much of the
central and eastern United States, while dangerously hot
temperatures return to the Southwest...

Rain has been a hard find this summer throughout much of the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, but that is expected to change
over the next few days as multiple rounds of showers and
thunderstorms develop and traverse the north-central United
States. The features responsible for the active weather include a
slow-moving cold front entering the Upper Great Lakes today, with
the western section of this frontal boundary lifting as a warm
front over the Central Plains on Thursday. Meanwhile, an
upper-level trough over the Northwest, favorable jet stream
dynamics, and a plentiful amount of atmospheric moisture could
lead to thunderstorms turning severe and producing several inches
of rain. A few thunderstorms forming along the frontal boundary
today could pack damaging wind gusts and large hail between the
Northern Plains and Great Lakes. By Thursday, more widespread
activity is expected to be found between the Northern High Plains
and Upper Great Lakes. Severe weather is most likely across the
Northern High Plains, where the Storm Prediction Center has issued
a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe thunderstorms. Even though
much of this region is experiencing severe to exceptional drought,
multiple inches of rain could fall and lead to flash flooding
concerns for both rural and urban areas of the Upper Midwest. A
Slight Risk (level 2/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued from
eastern North Dakota to central Wisconsin in order to highlight
the potential hazard.

South of the aforementioned frontal boundary, much of the central
and eastern U.S. will deal with a few more days of sizzling heat
and humidity. An expansive upper-level ridge extending from the
Southwest all the way to the East Coast will fuel above average
high temperatures and high heat indices. Widespread high
temperatures into the 90s will be found throughout a large section
of the country, with triple digits possible over the
Central/Southern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley through
Thursday. While only a handful of daily record high temperatures
are forecast to fall, dozens of record warm minimum temperatures
could break through the end of this week across the eastern third
of the country. These warm overnight temperatures can make it
extremely dangerous for those without proper air conditioning.
Heat Advisories have been issued and extend from eastern sections
of the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast. Meanwhile,
dangerous heat is also making a return to the Southwest today and
is expected to last through at least Friday. High temperatures
here could reach close to 115F, increasing the threat of heat
related illnesses. Excessive Heat Warnings go into effect this
morning between the Low Desert of California and southern Arizona.


Elsewhere, scattered thunderstorms are possible across the
Southeast and Gulf Coast today, a few of which could lead to
isolated instances of flash flooding. Farther west, Air Quality
Alerts due to wildfire smoke remain in effect across parts of the
Great Basin and Northern/Central Rockies. Red Flag Warnings also
remain in effect across much of Wyoming and far northwest Colorado
as gusty winds and low relative humidity could contribute to
extreme fire behavior.

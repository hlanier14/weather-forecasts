Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1138 AM CDT Mon Jul 19 2021

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Northern California and southern Oregon...
Morning satellite imagery showed a well developed cloud shield
extending across portions of the previous outlook elevated area. The
eastern edge of this zone was trimmed to account for increased
chances of precipitation and cloud cover limiting prolonged elevated
fire weather conditions. Additionally, dry thunderstorm chances have
been extended westward slightly across portions of central Oregon to
match the latest guidance given very dry fuels and the potential for
lightning strikes this afternoon/evening.

Elsewhere, the forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
for the latest guidance. The critical area across the northern High
Plains was extended slightly southward to better match anticipated
overlap between dry and windy conditions. Please see the previous
outlook for more information.

..Lyons.. 07/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Mon Jul 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will gradually weaken across the northern Rockies as a
mid-level trough approaches from the Pacific Northwest. Surface
heating/lee troughing across the northern Rockies will induce a
pressure gradient over eastern Montana, with dry and breezy
conditions supporting wildfire spread expected during the afternoon.
Relatively rich mid-level moisture will continue to pivot around the
mid-level anticyclone and support isolated to scattered
thunderstorms across California to the northern Rockies given
adequate deep-layer lift by the Pacific Northwest mid-level trough.
Modest mid-level winds will also accompany the mid-level trough,
supporting patches of dry and breezy conditions along the West
Coast.

...Northern High Plains...
During the afternoon, 20 mph sustained southeasterly surface winds
will likely overlap with 15-20% RH for at least a few hours. While
the winds are somewhat marginal for Critical highlights, a Critical
area has been maintained for portions of eastern Montana into far
northeast Wyoming given the presence of Critically/record dry fuels.
Areas surrounding the Critical delineation may also experience
several hours of Elevated dry and breezy conditions.

...West Coast - Dry and Breezy Conditions...
As modest southwesterly mid-level flow overspreads the West Coast
through the afternoon, downward mixing within a deep boundary layer,
as well as downslope flow atop and to the lee of the Cascades and
northern Sierra, is expected to support Elevated winds/RH. Elevated
highlights have been added where the more favorable winds/RH are
expected to overlap the longest. Furthermore, at least locally dry
and breezy conditions are expected along the lee of the Coast
Ranges, into parts of the San Joaquin Valley by late afternoon based
on some of the latest high-resolution guidance. Elevated highlights
may be needed in future outlooks if a more widespread area of
favorable overlapping winds/RH becomes evident.

...California to the northern Rockies - Dry Thunderstorms...
Widespread 0.8-1.0 inch precipitable water values will overspread
much of the western/northwest U.S by afternoon, with adequate lift
and buoyancy supporting isolated to scattered thunderstorms. Though
high-based, these storms are expected to produce predominantly wet
strikes. Nonetheless, fuels are Critically/record dry across much of
the Northwest. Efficient lightning-induced ignitions are possible
with drier strikes on the periphery of storm cores, warranting the
maintenance of broad isolated dry thunderstorm highlights.

...Heavy rain and scattered flash flooding possible across the
Northeast, Gulf Coast, and Southwest...

...Above normal temperatures for the Northern Plains...

...Elevated to critical fire weather found throughout the northern
High Plains, northern Great Basin, as well as northern California
through Tuesday...

A slow moving front extending from the Mid-Atlantic to the
Southern Plains is expected spark showers and thunderstorms with
heavy rain throughout much of the south-central and southeastern
United States over the next few days -- flash flood watches cover
northernmost Alabama and south-central Tennessee. The main hazards
associated with these storms are expected to be from frequent
lightning and flash flooding.  This front and related rainfall
chances are forecast to linger over the region through midweek,
while slowly inching southward across Texas.  The Southwest
Monsoon should remain quite active for the foreseeable future and
bring much needed rainfall to this section of the country.
However, the potential for flash flooding will also continue for
isolated locations throughout the Southwest and central Great
Basin, especially over burn scars -- flash flood watches cover
portions of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah.

After Monday's excessive heat, cloud cover and a weak front in the
vicinity of the northern High Plains should drop temperature on
Tuesday, but highs will remain above average and into the
upper-90s over much of the Northern Plains.  Along with the above
average temperatures, the combination of extreme drought, gusty
winds, and lightning nearby thunderstorms could make conditions
ripe throughout the West for new wildfires to form and spread
uncontrollably. Areas of greatest concern today are expected to be
found between the northern High Plains and California, and where
lightning is most likely to spark wildfires over California and
the Northern Great Basin.  This threat persists over the next few
days as a Pacific front attempts to shift eastward with time.  Red
Flag Warnings stretch from far northern California through the
interior Northwest and Northern Continental Divide into northwest
South Dakota and northeast Wyoming.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 19 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is relatively good agreement among models indicating mid-level
high pressure across much of the lower 48, except for the northeastern
quadrant, which is anticipated to have mid-level low pressure. Excessive heat
continues to be the primary hazards concern for week-2 across the interior
western and central contiguous U.S. An occasionally  active North American
Monsoon circulation is forecast during week-2, which could support above-
normal
precipitation and possible flooding over the Four Corners region. Mid-level
height anomalies are predicted to be near to slightly above normal across
Alaska. No hazards are anticipated for the state during the period.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for parts of the Northern and Central Plains,
and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Tue-Wed, Jul 27-28.

Slight risk of excessive heat for eastern portions of the Great Basin, the
Rockies, Great Plains, and Mississippi Valley, Tue-Fri, Jul 27-30.

Possible flooding for portions of the Four Corners region.



DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY JULY 22 - MONDAY JULY 26:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pqKGmfPgCJtL86D2KTNaGDHbw7vHDcfm43bXR4Q_3lJgxVslkjulhQ20FQ7wo0Xtvoaw4kuM$

FOR TUESDAY JULY 27 - MONDAY AUGUST 02: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles are in relatively good agreement regarding the depiction of mid-
level
amplified ridging across the western two thirds of the CONUS, and troughing
across the northeastern quadrant. The 0Z GEFS ensemble mean indicates higher
positive mid-level height anomalies with more spatial coverage compared to the
ECMWF and Canadian, mainly across the Midwest from the beginning to middle of
the period. This difference is also seen in the GEFS reforecast tool, where it
shows areas east of the Mississippi Valley having a 20% chance or greater of
exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 Deg F (95 Deg F across southern
portions),
whereas the ECMWF reforecast tool has a weaker heat signal across the West and
limits the spatial coverage to the Mississippi Valley and westward. A slight
risk (>20% chance) of excessive heat is posted for parts of eastern portions
of
the Great Basin, the Rockies, Great Plains, and Mississippi Valley, July 27 to
30, where the reforecast tools indicate some higher (lower) elevation areas
possibly experiencing temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 (95)
Deg F. This highlighted risk area includes regions further south where the
uncalibrated ECMWF and GEFS ensembles show elevated probabilities of parts of
the Southern Plains experiencing heat index values exceeding 105 Deg F. Of
additional concern is episodes of increased humidity forecast across the
excessive heat risk areas. The 0Z GEFS shows the potential of nighttime
temperatures across the highlighted region approaching or exceeding 80 Deg F.
A
moderate risk (>40%) is designated for parts of the Northern and Central
Plains, and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, July 27 to 28, where the GEFS
(ECMWF) Reforecast Tool indicates at least a 40% (30%) chance of maximum
temperatures reaching excessive heat criteria. The GEFS indicates at least a
20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 95th percentile, with parts
of
the Dakotas potentially exceeding 100 Deg F, where a moderate risk of
excessive
heat is identified. Triple digit temperatures could approach record breaking
temperatures across some areas of the Dakotas.



There is fairly large variation in the models regarding the location of the
mid-level ridge center, its orientation across the West, and its temporal
evolution throughout the period. Models generally show the center being in a
favorable location for enhanced monsoonal moisture at various times during
week-2. The reforecast tools do not indicate 3-day accumulations exceeding the
85th percentile and half an inch, although uncalibrated model daily
precipitation totals show potential for episodes of enhanced precipitation,
likely associated with localized convection. Although accumulated
precipitation
amounts in the model guidance are not supportive of a heavy precipitation
hazard, localized convection could result in flash flooding across the
valleys.
A possible flood risk area is posted for parts of the Four Corners region,
based on where the uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF ensemble guidance shows the
greatest precipitation totals during the period. Flash flooding can occur even
in areas that do not receive any rain, and be a direct result of runoff from
precipitation upstream.



Surface high pressure remains forecast across the northeastern Pacific, into
parts of the Pacific Northwest. Thermal low pressure, however, is forecast to
be located south of the Great Basin, which would be less favorable to a tight
pressure gradient across coastal California. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th
percentile and 25 mph, although it is limited to northern coastal California.
Due to the anticipated synoptic features being less favorable for a high wind
event in addition to the significantly weaker signal in the reforecast tools
indicating a widespread high wind event, a high wind risk is not included in
today's outlook. Even if wind speeds do not reach hazards criteria, increased
wind speeds combined with anticipated dry conditions could promote the spread
of wildfires due to the ongoing hot and dry conditions in the area.



A low amplitude mid-level pattern is favored for Alaska during week-2 with
troughing in the Bering Sea and across western Mainland Alaska, favoring
increased chances for above normal precipitation across central and western
Mainland and the Aleutians. Precipitation totals over a 3-day period are
forecast to be under an inch for most areas in both reforecast tools,
precluding a related hazard from being designated. Mid-level ridging is
predicted for eastern Mainland, favoring above-normal temperatures for the
northern half of the Mainland. The reforecast tools indicate parts of the
central and northern Mainland having at least a 20% chance of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile. However, since temperatures in the
northern half of Mainland are not anticipated to exceed 85 Deg F and mean
week-2 temperature anomalies are not expected to exceed 4 Deg F, a temperature
hazard is not designated at this time.

...Heat will continue over the northern Plains and extend into the
Upper Midwest...

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show a persistent mean pattern
featuring an upper high dominating the central Rockies/High Plains
while successive shortwaves from northern/eastern Canada will tend
to maintain an upper trough across the northeastern quadrant of
the country.  A couple of upper troughs from the northeastern
Pacific are forecast to move onshore across British Columbia
against the strong upper high over the Rockies during the medium
range period, but bringing only a modest cooling trend to the
excessive heat over the northern Plains.  Multiple fronts with
attached low pressure waves reaching the East will bring episodes
of showers/storms while keeping temperatures near to slightly
below normal.  Farther south, a lingering upper disturbance moving
westward across the southern Plains into the southern Rockies will
promote periods of rain/thunderstorms and below normal high
temperatures over portions of the Desert Southwest and the Four
Corners where the monsoonal regime will remain active.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles this morning generally agree quite well for
the U.S. into the medium range period with reasonable increase in
model spread toward Day 7.  Guidance has generally abandoned the
idea of bringing an anomalous upper low east of Hudson Bay down
toward the Northeast U.S./eastern Canada by Friday-Saturday.  This
has hastened the eastward progression of the low over the Canadian
Maritimes as well as the frontal passages across the Northeast
behind the low.  Across the northern Plains, a frontal wave is
forecast to track across the region into the Great Lakes by the
weekend where the ECMWF and GFS indicating possibility of heavy
rain.  The Canadian has sped up this frontal wave.  Meanwhile, the
ECMWF now agrees with the rest of the guidance to retrograde the
weak upper low over the southern Plains toward the southern
Rockies this weekend.  This could bring additional instability
into the southern Rockies/Southwest later this weekend and may
have enhancing effects on the monsoonal rainfall already in place
across the area into early next week.

A general model compromise among the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used
to compose the morning WPC medium range
package.  A smaller weight was given to the 06Z GFS beginning on
Day 5 when the predicted flow pattern appears too fast across the
Northeast.  A greater weight toward the ensemble means was used
for Days 6-7 to handle the uncertainty.  The results only deviated
slightly in details compared with the previous forecast package.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Portions of the northern Plains into Upper Midwest will likely see
highs up to 10-15F above normal on multiple days.  Highest
anomalies and best potential for parts of eastern Montana and the
Dakotas to reach at least 100F should be during Thursday-Friday,
when plus 10F anomalies for highs may also extend into the central
Plains.  A front extending from Canadian low pressure will likely
bring temperatures down a little from west to east into the
weekend but perhaps by only a few degrees or so.  Northern High
Plains temperatures could rebound some next Monday as another
upper trough approaching the Pacific Northwest could give a
northward push to the front stalled over the northern Rockies/High
Plains.

Another period of enhanced monsoonal rainfall appears likely over
the Four Corners states from late this week onward.  Some moisture
could reach a little farther northward and westward as well.
Coverage and intensity of rainfall will depend in part on
specifics of low-predictability impulses tracking around the
central Rockies upper high, including possibly the small upper low
initially over the southern Plains.  Rain/thunderstorms could be
heavy at times with highest totals during the period currently
expected over central Arizona.  The unsettled regime will keep
highs up to 5-10F or so below normal over the southwestern U.S.
Over Texas expect rainfall to continue trending lighter and more
scattered with time while below normal highs trend somewhat closer
to normal.

Lingering moisture along and south of a dissipating southern tier
front may provide localized enhancement to diurnal
showers/thunderstorms into the end of the week.  Locations from
the Upper Midwest through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic should see at least a couple episodes of
rain and thunderstorms with fronts that reach the eastern U.S.
Models are providing a general signal that some of this activity
could be locally moderate to heavy but continue to vary
considerably for the details which may take into the short-range
time frame to come into better focus.  The upper trough over the
Northeast will keep highs over that region moderately below
normal, especially late this week into the weekend.  The remainder
of the East should see readings within a few degrees on either
side of normal.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon July 19 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 25 - 29 2021

Today's model solutions are in relatively good agreement on the predicted
500-hPa circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions
during
the 6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast above normal
500-hPa heights over the western Aleutians and amplified troughs near the
Bering Sea and over  the Gulf of Alaska. A ridge is predicted over the western
and central CONUS with positive height anomalies from the Northern Rockies
eastward to Northern Plains and western Great Lakes. Downstream, a trough is
predicted over the eastern CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights for parts
of
the Eastern Seaboard.

Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over most of northern
Mainland Alaska underneath predicted above normal heights, while near to below
normal temperatures are favored for the Alaska Panhandle and parts of southern
Mainland Alaska, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Above normal
temperatures are favored for parts of the western CONUS and Great Basin
expanding eastward to much of the central and southeastern CONUS due to the
persistent ridging over the region and also consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool. A predicted trough over the West Coast, as well as a weakness
in
the ridge over parts of the Southwest, favors enhanced probabilities of near
to
below normal temperatures from parts of the Southwest.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the Aleutians,
western Mainland Alaska and the southern Alaska Panhandle due to forecast
westerly surface flow and potential storm system development. Below normal
precipitation is likely for eastern and central Mainland Alaska underneath
forecast above normal heights. Below normal precipitation chances are
increased
over the Northwest eastward to much of the central and eastern CONUS due to
forecast ridging or surface high pressure over the region. The trough forecast
in the northeastern U.S. increases the likelihood of above normal
precipitation
for parts of the Northeast. The position of the predicted 500-hPa ridge and
low-level flow is favorable for increased monsoonal moisture and above normal
precipitation for much of the Great Basin.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 27 - AUG 02, 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally similar
to the 6-10 day period. The temperature probability forecast during the week-2
period is very similar to the 6-10 day period except that enhanced
probabilities of below normal temperatures were removed from the Southwest,
consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. The precipitation
probability forecast is also generally similar to the 6-10 day period with the
probabilities slightly reduced. However, enhanced probabilities of above
normal
precipitation were removed from the northeastern CONUS and expanded across
Mainland Alaska, consistent with the reforecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Heat will continue over the northern Plains and extend into the
Upper Midwest...

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show a persistent mean pattern
featuring an upper high dominating the central Rockies/High Plains
while successive shortwaves from northern/eastern Canada will tend
to maintain an upper trough across the northeastern quadrant of
the country.  A couple of upper troughs from the northeastern
Pacific are forecast to move onshore across British Columbia
against the strong upper high over the Rockies during the medium
range period, but bringing only a modest cooling trend to the
excessive heat over the northern Plains.  Multiple fronts with
attached low pressure waves reaching the East will bring episodes
of showers/storms while keeping temperatures near to slightly
below normal.  Farther south, a lingering upper disturbance moving
westward across the southern Plains into the southern Rockies will
promote periods of rain/thunderstorms and below normal high
temperatures over portions of the Desert Southwest and the Four
Corners where the monsoonal regime will remain active.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles this morning generally agree quite well for
the synoptic pattern across U.S. into the medium range period with
reasonable increase in model spread toward Day 7.  Guidance has
generally abandoned the idea of bringing an anomalous upper low
from east of Hudson Bay down toward the Northeast U.S./eastern
Canada by Friday-Saturday.  This has hastened the eastward
progression of the low over the Canadian Maritimes as well as the
frontal passages across the Northeast behind the low.  Over the
northern Plains, a frontal wave is forecast to track across the
region to reach the Great Lakes by the weekend where the ECMWF and
GFS indicate the possibility of heavy rain.  The Canadian model
has sped up this frontal wave.  Models then take the moisture
downstream toward the eastern U.S. where a round of rainfall
appears to move into the Appalachians and the East Coast early
next week.  Meanwhile, the ECMWF now agrees with the rest of the
guidance to retrograde the weak upper low over the southern Plains
toward the southern Rockies this weekend.  This could bring
additional instability into the southern Rockies/Southwest later
this weekend and may have enhancing effects on the monsoonal
rainfall already in place across the area into early next week.

A general model compromise among the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used
to compose the morning WPC medium range package.  A greater weight
toward the ensemble means was used for Days 6-7 to handle the
uncertainty.  The results only deviated slightly in details with
the previous forecast package.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Portions of the northern Plains into Upper Midwest will likely see
highs up to 10-15F above normal on multiple days.  Highest
anomalies and best potential for parts of eastern Montana and the
Dakotas to reach at least 100F should be during Thursday-Friday,
when plus 10F anomalies for highs may also extend into the central
Plains.  A front extending from Canadian low pressure will likely
bring temperatures down a little from west to east into the
weekend but perhaps by only a few degrees or so.  Northern High
Plains temperatures could rebound some next Monday as
southwesterly flow increases ahead of the next upper trough
approaching the Pacific Northwest.

Another period of enhanced monsoonal rainfall appears likely over
the Four Corners states from late this week onward.  Some moisture
could reach a little farther northward and westward as well.
Coverage and intensity of rainfall will depend in part on
specifics of low-predictability impulses tracking around the
central Rockies upper high, including possibly the small upper low
initially over the southern Plains.  Rain/thunderstorms could be
heavy at times with highest totals during the period currently
expected over central Arizona.  The unsettled regime will keep
highs up to 5-10F or so below normal over the southwestern U.S.
Over Texas expect rainfall to continue trending lighter and more
scattered with time while below normal highs trend somewhat closer
to normal.

Lingering moisture along and south of a dissipating southern tier
front may provide localized enhancement to diurnal
showers/thunderstorms into the end of the week.  Locations from
the Upper Midwest through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic should see at least a couple episodes of
rain and thunderstorms with fronts and low pressure waves that
reach the eastern U.S.  Models are providing a general signal that
some of this activity could be locally moderate to heavy but
continue to vary considerably for the details which may take into
the short-range time frame to come into better focus.  The upper
trough over the Northeast will keep highs over that region
moderately below normal, especially late this week into the
weekend.  The remainder of the East should see readings within a
few degrees on either side of normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0223 PM CDT Mon Jul 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Northern Washington and the Columbia Basin...
On the eastern edge of the trough over the Pacific Northwest, modest
mid-level flow will overspread much of Washington and Oregon.
Westerly surface winds of 15+ mph are forecast to develop through
the terrain gaps in the Cascades spilling over into the Columbia
Basin. Gusty winds will also be likely across the higher terrain
into northern Washington, beneath stronger winds aloft. The gusty
winds, dry fuels, and humidity values as low as 15-20% will support
elevated fire weather conditions for a few hours during the
afternoon.

Across the rest of the CONUS, minor adjustments have been made to
the Northwest dry Thunder area and the Great Basin elevated area to
better match latest guidance. The rest of the forecast remains
valid, see the previous discussion for details

..Lyons.. 07/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CDT Mon Jul 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper ridge across the Interior-West will continue to weaken as
a mid-level trough meanders eastward from the Pacific Northwest
tomorrow/Tuesday. Surface lee troughing will continue across the
northern High Plains, promoting modestly dry, breezy flow. Modest
mid-level flow will also support dry and breezy conditions across
higher-terrain areas of the Pacific Northwest. The mid-level trough
will also provide deep-layer ascent across the northwestern U.S,
that in tandem with mid-level moisture will continue to support
isolated to scattered thunderstorm development, with a couple dry
strikes possible.

...Northwestern U.S. - Dry Thunderstorm Potential...
By tomorrow/Tuesday afternoon, mainly wet thunderstorms are expected
to develop to the lee of the Cascades into Idaho and Montana given
1+ inch precipitable water values. Still, fuels across the region
are anomalously dry, with efficient lightning-induced fire starts
possible with any strikes peripheral to storm cores.

...Pacific Northwest - Dry and Breezy conditions...
Modest mid-level flow will continue to overspread the Pacific
Northwest, supporting 15+ mph sustained westerly downslope winds in
the higher terrain of and to the lee of the Cascades tomorrow
afternoon. 15-20% RH will coincide with the breezy conditions in
spots, with Elevated highlights introduced for areas most likely to
see overlapping favorable surface winds/RH for at least a few hours.

...Northern High Plains - Dry and Breezy Conditions...
As surface lee troughing continues across portions of Montana into
the northern High Plains, 15+ mph sustained south-southeasterly
winds amid 20% RH will be prevalent through the afternoon over fuels
very receptive to fire spread. At the moment, the expected winds/RH
warrant Elevated highlights. However, a Critical delineation may be
introduced in future outlooks if guidance trends any windier/drier
across the northern High Plains.

GFS indicate the possibility of heavy rain.  The Canadian model
has sped up this frontal wave.  Models then take the moisture
downstream toward the eastern U.S. where a round of rainfall
appears to move into the Appalachians and the East Coast early
next week.  Meanwhile, the ECMWF now agrees with the rest of the
guidance to retrograde the weak upper low over the southern Plains
toward the southern Rockies this weekend.  This could bring
additional instability into the southern Rockies/Southwest later
this weekend and may have enhancing effects on the monsoonal
rainfall already in place across the area into early next week.

A general model compromise among the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used
to compose the morning WPC medium range package.  A greater weight
toward the ensemble means was used for Days 6-7 to handle the
uncertainty.  The results only deviated slightly in details with
the previous forecast package.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Portions of the northern Plains into Upper Midwest will likely see
highs up to 10-15F above normal on multiple days.  Highest
anomalies and best potential for parts of eastern Montana and the
Dakotas to reach at least 100F should be during Thursday-Friday,
when plus 10F anomalies for highs may also extend into the central
Plains.  A front extending from Canadian low pressure will likely
bring temperatures down a little from west to east into the
weekend but perhaps by only a few degrees or so.  Northern High
Plains temperatures could rebound some next Monday as
southwesterly flow increases ahead of the next upper trough
approaching the Pacific Northwest.

Another period of enhanced monsoonal rainfall appears likely over
the Four Corners states from late this week onward.  Some moisture
could reach a little farther northward and westward as well.
Coverage and intensity of rainfall will depend in part on
specifics of low-predictability impulses tracking around the
central Rockies upper high, including possibly the small upper low
initially over the southern Plains.  Rain/thunderstorms could be
heavy at times with highest totals during the period currently
expected over central Arizona.  The unsettled regime will keep
highs up to 5-10F or so below normal over the southwestern U.S.
Over Texas expect rainfall to continue trending lighter and more
scattered with time while below normal highs trend somewhat closer
to normal.

Lingering moisture along and south of a dissipating southern tier
front may provide localized enhancement to diurnal
showers/thunderstorms into the end of the week.  Locations from
the Upper Midwest through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic should see at least a couple episodes of
rain and thunderstorms with fronts and low pressure waves that
reach the eastern U.S.  Models are providing a general signal that
some of this activity could be locally moderate to heavy but
continue to vary considerably for the details which may take into
the short-range time frame to come into better focus.  The upper
trough over the Northeast will keep highs over that region
moderately below normal, especially late this week into the
weekend.  The remainder of the East should see readings within a
few degrees on either side of normal.

...Heat will continue over the northern Plains and extend into the
Upper Midwest...

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show a persistent mean pattern
featuring an upper high dominating the central Rockies/High Plains
while successive shortwaves from northern/eastern Canada will tend
to maintain an upper trough across the northeastern quadrant of
the country.  A couple of upper troughs from the northeastern
Pacific are forecast to move onshore across British Columbia
against the strong upper high over the Rockies during the medium
range period, but bringing only a modest cooling trend to the
excessive heat over the northern Plains.  Multiple fronts with
attached low pressure waves reaching the East will bring episodes
of showers/storms while keeping temperatures near to slightly
below normal.  Farther south, a lingering upper disturbance moving
westward across the southern Plains into the southern Rockies will
promote periods of rain/thunderstorms and below normal high
temperatures over portions of the Desert Southwest and the Four
Corners where the monsoonal regime will remain active.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles this morning generally agree quite well for
the synoptic pattern across U.S. into the medium range period with
reasonable increase in model spread toward Day 7.  Guidance has
generally abandoned the idea of bringing an anomalous upper low
from east of Hudson Bay down toward the Northeast U.S./eastern
Canada by Friday-Saturday.  This has hastened the eastward
progression of the low over the Canadian Maritimes as well as the
frontal passages across the Northeast behind the low.  Over the
northern Plains, a frontal wave is forecast to track across the
region to reach the Great Lakes by the weekend where the ECMWF and
GFS indicate the possibility of heavy rain.  The Canadian model
has sped up this frontal wave.  Models then take the moisture
downstream toward the eastern U.S. where a round of rainfall
appears to move into the Appalachians and the East Coast early
next week.  Meanwhile, the ECMWF now agrees with the rest of the
guidance to retrograde the weak upper low over the southern Plains
toward the southern Rockies this weekend.  This could bring
additional instability into the southern Rockies/Southwest later
this weekend and may have enhancing effects on the monsoonal
rainfall already in place across the area into early next week.

A general model compromise among the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used
to compose the morning WPC medium range package.  A greater weight

uncertainty.  The results only deviated slightly in details with
the previous forecast package.

Portions of the northern Plains into Upper Midwest will likely see
highs up to 10-15F above normal on multiple days.  Highest
anomalies and best potential for parts of eastern Montana and the
Dakotas to reach at least 100F should be during Thursday-Friday,
when plus 10F anomalies for highs may also extend into the central

bring temperatures down a little from west to east into the

Plains temperatures could rebound some next Monday as
southwesterly flow increases ahead of the next upper trough

...Locally heavy rainfall threat in an active Southwest/Four
Corners Monsoon pattern...

...Heat will continue over the northern/central Plains into the
Upper Midwest...


...Overview...

During the Friday-Tuesday period expect only modest variations of
a similar theme for the mean pattern.  Upper ridging should remain
centered over the central Rockies/Great Basin into the weekend.  A
separate Gulf of Mexico ridge drifting northwestward may
ultimately merge with the Rockies ridge to yield a high center
over or near the central Plains by next week.  Mean troughing will
likely prevail over the Northeast Pacific and eastern North
America.  Features ejecting from the Pacific trough and rounding
the northern periphery of the ridge will bring a couple fronts
into the northern tier states but with only modest impact on the
persistent heat over the region.  To the south of the initial
upper high, a weak upper low over the southern High Plains/Rockies
along with other impulses should provide occasional enhancement of
monsoonal rainfall over the Four Corners/Southwest and nearby
areas.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Confidence remains above average for the expected large scale
pattern while there are ongoing uncertainties/trends for some of
the medium to smaller scale details that have lower
predictability.  An operational model blend of 12Z/18Z solutions
provided a good representation of consensus Friday into the
weekend.  Guidance has finally converged better for details of the
moderately deep trough over the Northeast on Friday and then
lifting away--ultimately leading to greater progression of the
main surface front into the Atlantic over the past couple days of
runs.  Meanwhile there is an ongoing trend for better defined low
pressure near the southern Mid-Atlantic and/or Southeast coast but
for now there is wide north-south spread (intermediate position
favored at this time).  Consensus has been more stable for the
system crossing central Canada and the trailing front extending
into the northern tier of the U.S.

During the first half of next week there is decent model signal
for an ejecting Pacific shortwave to support a southern Canada
wave that brings another front into the northern Plains.  The
weak/progressive nature of the feature leads to a fair degree of
model spread and run-to-run variability thus far, favoring an
average of 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z/old 00Z ECMWF runs along with the
18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means.  The 12Z ECMWF strayed to the fast side
of the envelope (new 00Z run slower like consensus) while the 12Z
CMC was on the slow side.  Meanwhile energy rounding the initial
Rockies ridge will reach the eastern North America mean trough
next week, bringing the associated cold front into the eastern
states while a leading wave/front cross the northeastern quadrant
of the lower 48.  After a lot of spread/variability for the
leading wave in recent days, guidance has lately stabilized upon a
fairly modest depiction but differences persist for specifics.  A
GFS/ECMWF model/mean combination provides reasonable continuity
for the main cold front.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Some areas of heavy rainfall will be possible on one or more days
within the Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon.  Currently expect the
best potential for highest totals to be over central Arizona late
this week.  There is still uncertainty over day-to-day specifics
given the low predictability of small scale impulses that will be
important for resolving the location and timing of significant
rainfall.  Some areas will be very sensitive to additional rain
given already wet soil from prior rainfall.  Overall expect the
core of greatest deep moisture and best rainfall potential to lift
northwestward early next week.  Elsewhere, an organized area of
rain and thunderstorms should progress from the Upper Midwest
through the Great Lakes and into the East, ahead of a
Canadian/northern tier front and leading wave/frontal system.
Some rainfall could be locally moderate to heavy.  Areas of rain
may accompany a wavy frontal system over the southern
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast coast late this week into the weekend while
Florida should see multiple episodes of showers/thunderstorms
during the period.

Northern/central portions of the Plains into the Upper Midwest
will likely see persistent heat through the period with
temperatures 5-15F above normal, including at least isolated
Plains locations reaching 100F on one or more days.  Fronts
reaching the northern tier will provide a little variability from
day to day but without any meaningful cooling trend.  On the other
hand the clouds and rainfall over the Southwest and vicinity will
tend to keep highs there 5-15F below normal, with a slight
northwestward progression of coolest anomalies possible by early
next week.  The upper trough over the Northeast late this week
into the weekend may keep highs 5F or more below normal.
Otherwise expect temperatures over most the East to be within a
few degrees on either side of normal.

of the lower 48.  After a lot of spread/variability for the
leading wave in recent days, guidance has lately stabilized upon a
fairly modest depiction but differences persist for specifics.  A
GFS/ECMWF model/mean combination provides reasonable continuity
for the main cold front.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Some areas of heavy rainfall will be possible on one or more days
within the Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon.  Currently expect the
best potential for highest totals to be over central Arizona late
this week.  There is still uncertainty over day-to-day specifics
given the low predictability of small scale impulses that will be
important for resolving the location and timing of significant
rainfall.  Some areas will be very sensitive to additional rain
given already wet soil from prior rainfall.  Overall expect the
core of greatest deep moisture and best rainfall potential to lift
northwestward early next week.  Elsewhere, an organized area of
rain and thunderstorms should progress from the Upper Midwest
through the Great Lakes and into the East, ahead of a
Canadian/northern tier front and leading wave/frontal system.
Some rainfall could be locally moderate to heavy.  Areas of rain
may accompany a wavy frontal system over the southern
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast coast late this week into the weekend while
Florida should see multiple episodes of showers/thunderstorms
during the period.

Northern/central portions of the Plains into the Upper Midwest
will likely see persistent heat through the period with
temperatures 5-15F above normal, including at least isolated
Plains locations reaching 100F on one or more days.  Fronts
reaching the northern tier will provide a little variability from
day to day but without any meaningful cooling trend.  On the other
hand the clouds and rainfall over the Southwest and vicinity will
tend to keep highs there 5-15F below normal, with a slight
northwestward progression of coolest anomalies possible by early
next week.  The upper trough over the Northeast late this week
into the weekend may keep highs 5F or more below normal.
Otherwise expect temperatures over most the East to be within a
few degrees on either side of normal.

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging across the western U.S. will continue to break down as
a mid-level trough slowly advances across the Pacific Northwest
through the period. Dry and breezy conditions may occur across the
higher elevations in the Pacific Northwest as accompanying modest
mid-level flow overspreads the area, while surface lee troughing and
associated dry and breezy flow will likely develop across parts of
the northern High Plains. Meanwhile, deep-layer ascent with the
Pacific Northwest mid-level trough will encourage thunderstorm
development (atop fuels very receptive to fire spread) across the
northern Rockies.

...Pacific Northwest...
Diurnal heating/mixing will support some downward momentum transport
of the modest mid-level flow in higher terrain areas of the
Cascades/northern Sierra, encouraging lee-side downslope flow. 15
mph sustained westerly winds are expected to overlap 15-20% RH
through the afternoon/evening hours, with Elevated highlights
introduced where the aforementioned surface wind/RH overlap is
expected to occur the longest.

...Northern High Plains...
As lee-troughing persists across the northern High Plains, 15 mph
sustained southeasterly surface winds coinciding with 20-25% RH will
result during the afternoon hours. Elevated highlights have been
introduced given very receptive fuels in place.

...Northern Rockies...
The approaching mid-level trough and diurnal heating will both
encourage scattered to potentially widespread thunderstorm
development across the northern Rockies through the afternoon and
evening hours. Precipitable water values over 1 inch suggest that
strikes will be predominantly wet, despite storms being potentially
high-based. The main motivation for introducing isolated dry
thunderstorm highlights continues to be the critically/record dry
fuels across the region, which may support efficient lightning-based
ignitions with strikes along the periphery of storm cores.

...Midsummer heat found throughout the northern and central
Plains...

...Elevated fire weather concerns continue across the northern
Rockies and northern Great Basin...

...Isolated chances for severe thunderstorms and flash flooding
possible for the Lower Great Lakes and Northeast today...

A persistent, but gradually weakening upper-level ridge over the
central U.S. will provide a continuing stretch of above average
temperatures across the northern and central Plains through at
least midweek. Widespread high temperatures into the upper 90s and
low triple digits are forecast here, which is slightly lower than
what was felt yesterday. These warm temperatures and lack of rain
will likely worsen the ongoing severe to exceptional drought found
throughout the region. Excessive Heat Warnings remain in effect
across eastern Montana.

Farther west, the combination of extreme drought, gusty winds, and
dry lightning will produce another day of fire weather concerns
for the northern Great Basin and northern Rockies. Thunderstorms
ahead of an advancing cold front entering the Pacific Northwest
today are likely to produce little rainfall, but lightning could
reach the dehydrated terrain and spark new wildfires. Red Flag
Warnings are in effect and stretch from northern California to
Wyoming.

It wouldn't be a mid-July day without thunderstorm chances across
parts of the Lower 48. The areas with the greatest chances of
seeing summer storms today include the Northeast, Lower Great
Lakes, Southeast, and Southwest. A cold front crossing the Lower
Great Lakes this afternoon may produce a few isolated severe
thunderstorms capable of triggering damaging wind gusts and hail.
This cold front and associated thunderstorms are forecast to shift
into New England and coastal sections of the Northeast on
Wednesday. For the Southeast and Gulf Coast States, a lingering
frontal boundary bisecting the region will be the focus for
additional rounds of slow-moving thunderstorms today. The main
concern with these storms will be associated with heavy rainfall
and scattered flash flooding. A Slight Risk (level 2/4) of
Excessive Rainfall has been issued for parts of northeast Georgia
and South Carolina, where brief downpours could produce over an
inch of rain in a relatively short period of time. Meanwhile, the
Southwest Monsoon is expected to continue with scattered chances
of thunderstorms through much of this week. As a result, isolated
instances of flash flooding will remain a possibility between the
Southwest and central Great Basin.

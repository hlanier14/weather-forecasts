...Holiday travelers thankful as a relatively tranquil stretch of
weather persists in the final days leading up to Thanksgiving...

...Chilly temperatures in the East, warmer in the Heartland;
Critical fire weather areas in the central Great Plains...

...Unsettled weather in the Northwest, mountain snow in the
Southern Rockies; Swath of showers and thunderstorms from the
mid-Mississippi Valley to south Texas Wednesday night and
Thanksgiving morning...

With Thanksgiving just a couple days away, Mother Nature is
providing a suitable weather pattern for travelers across the vast
majority of the U.S. mainland through Wednesday night. This is due
to a dome of Canadian high pressure in control of the weather
pattern across much of the East. This high pressure system has
engulfed much of the eastern third of the U.S. in an air-mass more
akin to what is typically observed in the heart of the holiday
season. Freeze Watches and Warnings have been issued in parts of
the Southeast while Winter Weather Advisories remain in effect
downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario early this morning. Daytime
highs will struggle to get out of the 40s in the Northeast today
while much of the Southeast sees high temperature departures
ranging between 10 and 20 degrees below normal. Another chilly day
is on tap up and down the East Coast on Wednesday before warmer
temperatures arrive on Thanksgiving. Speaking of "warmer
temperatures", an upper level ridge of high pressure traversing
the Nation's Heartland is responsible for a surge in abnormally
warm conditions from the Southwest to the Midwest today. The
warmest daytime high departures will be centered in the central
Plains where highs range anywhere from 15 to 30 degrees above
normal. In addition, Critical Risks for fire weather and Red Flag
Warnings have been issued in parts of the Great Plains due to
favorable fire weather prospects today. This dramatic warm-up will
be short lived, however, as another intrusion of cold Canadian
high pressure plunges into the northern Rockies and Plains on
Wednesday, then sweeps across most of the Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley by Thanksgiving. Most of the Intermountain West
and West Coast will also see temperatures plunge to below normal
levels mid-week before returning to more seasonally warm levels by
Thanksgiving.

The main culprit for unsettled weather into the middle of the week
is an upper level disturbance tracking through the Northwest this
morning. It is ushering a stream of Pacific moisture into the
Pacific Northwest that is responsible for areas of coastal/valley
rain and mountain snow today. Most accumulations are forecast to
be on the lighter side, although some of the higher elevations
(Cascades, Bitterroots, Lewis Range, Tetons) could pick up as much
as a foot of snow by the time the snow subsides Wednesday evening.
Farther south, a cold front crossing through the southern Rockies
may lead to spotty showers and accumulating mountain snow Tuesday
night. The aforementioned Pacific Northwest disturbance will head
east and cause an area of low pressure to form over the Great
Lakes. As its trailing cold front advances east through the
nation's mid-section mid-week, this sets the stage for scattered
showers to breakout from the Lower Great Lakes to the South
Central U.S. Wednesday night. Some thunderstorms may also develop
in the southern Plains Wednesday night into early in the day on
Thanksgiving. Look for showers and thunderstorms to push into the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys later in the day on Thanksgiving with
locally heavy rainfall possible in southeast Texas. The regions
most likely to stay dry on Thanksgiving are the Southwest,
Intermountain West, Midwest, and much of the East Coast.

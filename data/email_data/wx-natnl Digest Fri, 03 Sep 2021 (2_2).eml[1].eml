...Cooler and drier weather to support ongoing cleanup efforts in
the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic the next couple days...

...Rounds of showers and thunderstorms to drench parts of the
Nation's Heartland, severe weather and flash flooding is possible
in the Central Plains...

...Spotty showers and thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast and in
the southern High Plains; poor air quality due to ongoing bouts of
wildfire smoke to continue; hot and steamy in the South Central
U.S...

In wake of the devastating severe weather and historic flooding in
parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast left behind by Ida,
drastically cooler and drier conditions are expected to prevail as
a dome of high pressure builds in.  This stretch of fine weather
is forecast to continue into the start of the Labor Day weekend
for much of the Northeast. This is welcomed news for ongoing
cleanup efforts in the hard hit areas.  Nevertheless,  cautions
should still be taken as river and stream will take time to recede
from flood stages.

The weather pattern across the U.S. will generally be less active
than recent weeks.  The most active weather should be found across
the central Plains towards the Mid-Mississippi Valley where
thunderstorms could get enough organization near a wavy front to
result in an axis of heavy rainfall on Saturday.  Some of the
moisture can be attributed to the former Tropical Cyclone Nora.
In the shorter term, clusters of thunderstorms ahead of this wavy
frontal system would lead to areas of heavy rain across the
central Plains to the upper Midwest today, where localized areas
of flash flooding are also possible.

Elsewhere, a frontal boundary is expected to stall near the
central Gulf Coast and across northern Florida into Saturday.
Spotty showers and thunderstorms are expected mainly south of this
front.  A few of these thunderstorms may produce heavy downpours
within the strongest cells.

Meanwhile, the West Coast should remain mostly dry while Air
Quality Alerts persist across parts of the Pacific Northwest and
California and parts of Wyoming and Montana due to wildfire smoke.
 The Midwest and northern High Plains will join the Northeast in
experiencing a rather cool start to September.  The West Coast
begins a gradual warming trend today in the Pacific Northwest
which culminates in a rather hot second half of the holiday
weekend throughout the western third of the country.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
226 AM EDT Wed Sep 08 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Sep 11 2021 - 12Z Wed Sep 15 2021

...Overview...

Quasi-zonal flow over the CONUS next week amid a mostly dry
pattern should spell a relatively quiet period, but with
uncertainty in system details. The western Gulf/south Texas has
the best chance for appreciable rainfall depending on how much
moisture a possible tropical wave brings to the area. Temperatures
will be near to below normal along the U.S./Canadian border and
near the Gulf, but warmer than normal in between.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles showed decent longwave agreement with
continued spread in the shorter wavelength features. Continued to
favor a blended solution of the recent deterministic guidance to
start, minus the UKMET which was quite slow into the Northwest
this weekend, with increasing weight to the ensemble means (18Z
GEFS and 12Z ECENS) Mon-Wed as uncertainty grows.
Unclear/inconsistent trends or shifts in the guidance (not unusual
in lower amplitude flow) have made it difficult to favor one
solution over another.

In the Gulf of Mexico, the GFS remained the strongest with any
tropical entity (though likely just a weak surface reflection) and
thus rainfall. Favored a more modest depiction and subsequent QPF.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Daily showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to
the south of the boundary as it washes out early next week.
Frontal boundary over the northern tier will likely only support
light rainfall for the High Plains before a modest injection of
moisture from the south may promote more scattered showers across
the Great Lakes Monday night/Tuesday. This should slide into the
Northeast next Tuesday into Wednesday per current timing. Will
continue to adjust rainfall forecasts for the western Gulf,
particularly over south Texas/the lower Rio Grande Valley pending
any organization of favorable ingredients.

Temperatures will be above normal under the ridge and south of the
surface boundary this weekend from the southern Plains eastward.
High temperatures may be 5 to 15 degrees above normal where
several high temperature records will be challenged. This area of
warmth will temper a bit as it moves toward the Middle Mississippi
and Ohio Valleys next week and then to the Mid-Atlantic.
Temperatures along the Canadian border will linger near to below
normal through the period. Areas around the Gulf will see typical
mid-September temperatures in the upper 80s to around 90F.

0151 AM CDT Wed Sep 08 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NORTHEAST IDAHO INTO
SOUTHWEST MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
A series of mid-level impulses will traverse the northwest U.S.
while pivoting around an upper ridge/anticyclone centered across the
Interior West today. 30+ kt 500 mb flow will overspread the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Rockies in tandem with the mid-level
impulses, providing upper support for dry and breezy conditions
encouraging modest wildfire-spread potential.

...Portions of the Pacific Northwest into the Northern Rockies...
By afternoon, boundary-layer mixing will encourage downslope flow
along the lee of southern Cascades/northern Sierra in southern
Oregon, far northern California, far northwest Nevada, and the
Sawtooth Range in northeast Idaho. At least 15 mph sustained
westerly surface winds are expected to coincide with 15-20% RH for a
few hours across southern portions of the Pacific Northwest, and
parts of the northern Rockies, where Elevated highlights have been
maintained. A Critical area also remains across portions of
northeast Idaho into far southwest Montana given the likelihood for
20 mph sustained surface winds to overlap with 15-20% RH for several
hours, and given the presence of critically dry fuels.

0153 AM CDT Wed Sep 08 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST IDAHO INTO
SOUTHWEST MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
Widespread 30-40 kt 500 mb flow will pivot around a persistent
mid-level ridge/anticyclone across the Interior West while
accompanying a series of progressive mid-level impulses, and
overspread the Pacific Northwest, northern Great Basin, and northern
Rockies to the northern High Plains tomorrow/Thursday. Widespread
dry and breezy conditions are expected across a large part of the
northwest CONUS, where modestly to critically dry fuels are in place
to support wildfire-spread.

Elevated highlights have been introduced where 15+ mph surface
sustained westerly winds will overlap with 15-25% RH for at least a
few hours tomorrow afternoon. Critical highlights have been
introduced to portions of northeast Idaho into far southwest Montana
in proximity to the Sawtooth Range, as the strongest mid-level flow
is expected overspread this region, supporting surface winds
occasionally reaching 20+ mph. While favorable upper support for
surface wildfire-spread conditions will remain along the northern
periphery of the upper ridge, a very dry, mixed boundary layer
across western parts of the Great Basin is expected to compensate
and support Elevated conditions tomorrow afternoon and evening.

In addition, mid-level moisture (albeit meager) will meander
northward along the western periphery of the Interior West
anticyclone. Associated buoyancy is expected to remain scant across
Nevada into the southern Sierra, with only a sparse dry thunderstorm
possible tomorrow afternoon, precluding isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights at this time.

...Severe thunderstorms and heavy rain possible today from the
northern Mid-Atlantic to western New England...

...A heat wave in the western U.S. will gradually shift eastward
into the central/southern High Plains by Friday...

...Watching for the potential of tropical cyclone development near
the eastern Gulf Coast to the Southeast U.S. coast the next couple
of days...

A cold front extending southwestward from a low pressure system in
east-central Canada will move through the Great Lakes and into the
Appalachians today.  Showers and thunderstorms will be most active
ahead of the cold front.  In fact, thunderstorms could become
severe later today as they become organized across the northern
Mid-Atlantic to western New England, where a low pressure wave is
forecast to form along the front.  In addition, heavy downpours
can be expected with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy
rain will increase the threat of localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable from Wednesday through Thursday morning, especially
over areas recently impacted by the severe flooding due to Ida.
The front will make a slow but steady eastward progress across New
England on Thursday and should exit Maine by Friday morning.  A
decreasing threat of heavy rain and severe thunderstorms will
spread into New England on Thursday before the rain moving off the
coast by Friday morning.

Meanwhile, an upper-level high over the Great Basin will aid in
producing record high temperatures over the western States through
Thursday.  The persistent dry weather under the upper-level high
together with gusty winds will continue to raise the fire weather
threat and poor air quality from the Pacific Northwest to the
northern Rockies and into the central High Plains.  Excessive Heat
Warnings remain in effect over the Mojave Desert while Heat
Advisories are also posted over most of the interior Valleys of
California.  Record high temperatures can be expected each
afternoon at many locations, shifting into the central High Plains
by Friday.

Showers and thunderstorms will continue over parts of the
Southeast.  Also watching for the potential of tropical cyclone
development near the eastern Gulf Coast to the Southeast U.S.
coast the next couple of days.

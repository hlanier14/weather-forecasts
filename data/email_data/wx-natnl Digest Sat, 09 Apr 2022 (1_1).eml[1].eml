.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Fri Apr 08 2022/

...Synopsis...
A deep upper trough over the Great Lakes will drift slowly to the
east as a strong mid-level jet along the backside of the trough
overspreads the central CONUS. A second trough and strong mid-level
flow will move onshore across the Pacific Northwest and northern
Great Basin later tonight. Gusty northwesterly winds will be
widespread from the northern and central Plains to the Gulf Coast,
supporting a broad area of Elevated to Critical fire weather
conditions. Fire concerns will slowly diminish overnight as
southerly winds return.

...Central Kansas and Nebraska...
Dry donwslope flow will continue across the central Plains ahead of
the secondary trough approaching the Rockies. Enhanced by strong
diurnal/mechanical mixing, and the lingering surface pressure
gradient, widespread 20-25 mph surface winds are expected by early
afternoon. Coincident with 15-20% surface RH, the gusty winds and
extremely dry fuels will support widespread Critical Fire weather
conditions across the central Plains. Winds will begin to weaken
near sunset switching to southerly overnight, ending the risk for
sustained fire weather conditions.

...Western Oklahoma and the eastern Texas Panhandle...
Similar to the central Plains, widespread gusty northwesterly flow
will continue across the TX panhandle and western OK. Enhanced by
deep vertical mixing along the western periphery of the jet aloft,
sustained winds of 20-25 with gusts of 30-35 mph will likely support
widespread fire weather concerns within sub 20% RH. Given large
areas of exceptionally dry fuels where multiple fires have occurred
over the preceding days, several hours of critical conditions are
likely.

...Southeast Texas and southern Louisiana...
Strong northwesterly flow will continue along the backside of the
upper low from the Plains to the Gulf Coast. Unusually dry and windy
conditions will extend eastward across the Mississippi Delta into
portions of the Southeast where, despite recent rainfall, volatile
fuels are in place. Widespread surface humidity near and below 30%,
along with surface winds of 10-15 mph will support a broad area of
fire weather concerns from east TX, across LA and into southern MS
and AL. The highest confidence in sustained 20+ mph surface winds is
expected beneath the core of the upper jet across southeast TX and
southwestern LA. Here, hi-res ensemble and deterministic guidance
show several hours of favorable overlap between strong winds and low
humidity, supporting Critical fire weather concerns.

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

The ongoing forecast remains generally on track. Critical conditions
appear more likely in the lee of the Sangre de Cristo.

...South Florida...
With the mid/low-level jet moving overhead tomorrow, conditions will
be windier than usual across South Florida. Despite some areas of
recent precipitation, pockets of dry fuels remain. Some elevated
fire weather risk will exist during the afternoon.

...Northern California...
The surface and upper-level pattern will favor strong downslope
winds into the Sacramento Valley. The primary question has been how
dry fuels will be. Greenup is occurring in some areas, but very warm
temperatures have helped to dry some fine fuels and larger fuels
types are anomalously dry. Given this fuel information, fire weather
concerns will be elevated tomorrow afternoon.

..Wendt.. 04/08/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Fri Apr 08 2022/

...Synopsis...
Lingering northwesterly flow aloft on the backside of a large
eastern US upper low will diminish slowly overnight ahead of an
advancing trough across the western US. Low-level flow will turn
southwesterly and intensify, supporting dry and windy conditions
conducive to widespread fire weather concerns across the southern
Plains and Desert Southwest.

...southern High Plains into central New Mexico...
As the western US trough deepens and begins to move into the Rockies
early Saturday, low-level flow will quickly turn southwesterly and
intensify under the influence of a developing lee trough/low. Within
an already dry post-frontal air mass, the dry downslope trajectories
and diurnal mixing will further reduce minimum RH values to 4-12%
through peak heating across much of the southern Plains and
Southwest. In combination with the surface winds of 20-30 mph the
exceptionally dry airmmass will support widespread Elevated and
Critical fire weather conditions across portions of the southern
High Plains into central NM Saturday afternoon. Strong winds may
linger after sunset along with relatively poor humidity recoveries,
exacerbating fire concerns.

...Rockies and Great Basin...
Strong mid-level flow within a digging trough across the western US
will overspread Great Basin through Saturday. Surface flow will
respond accordingly, turning westerly and increasing ahead of a fast
moving cold front forecast to sweep through the Rockies. The strong
forcing for ascent may support a few high-based thunderstorms across
portions of WY where a dry strike or two is possible. While dry and
windy conditions are expected to be widespread, local fuels remain
mostly unreceptive to significant fire spread at this time.

...Active weather is likely next week, with heavy snow spreading
from higher elevations of the West into the north-central U.S. and
heavy rain and severe thunderstorm chances across the South...

...Overview...

The latest guidance continues to support an amplified and active
weather pattern across the lower 48 next week. A reinforced
western U.S. trough should finally emerge into the Plains by
around midweek and a vigorous low pressure system will develop
over the Plains/Upper Midwest. This is likely to bring an array of
significant weather across the CONUS, including heavy snow in some
higher elevations of the West early in the workweek, which is
expected to spread north and west of the surface low track into
northern/central parts of the Plains around midweek. In the warm
sector of the system, severe weather and heavy rain are likely in
southern/central parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley and
potentially eastward. By late week, the closed upper low may begin
to lift due to amplified ridging in the western Atlantic, while
additional (likely less amplified) troughing enters the West
around Friday/day 7.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Though model guidance is united in showing the developing western
trough becoming a closed upper low as it tracks into the central
U.S., ample differences remain with the timing and track of the
upper and surface low features. As the period begins Monday, GFS
runs from the 00/06Z as well as the 12Z model cycle remain
strongest with the initial shortwave over the Upper Midwest
compared to other guidance, affecting frontal position. Meanwhile
most guidance continues to show a small closed upper low near the
Pacific Northwest, though the ECMWF has been weaker but may have
strengthened a bit with the 12Z run. This also impacts the
strength and position of an associated surface low; the 12Z CMC
may be a good compromise between the stronger and farther north
GFS runs and weaker and farther south ECMWF runs.

Going into Tuesday and beyond, the initial shortwave differences
grow quickly and affect the main trough/low's axis and extent
southward. The GFS runs have remained the quickest and farthest
north with the developing upper low, while the EC has been
consistently deeper and slower. The CMC clusters better with the
ECMWF, and each model's ensemble members tend to cluster near its
deterministic run without considerable overlap. These differences
with the trough/low are also influenced by additional upstream
energy diving south from the Arctic/Alaska/northwestern Canada, a
low predictability feature that also shows quite a bit of
variability among guidance. The WPC forecast continued to favor a
slower solution with the upper low, more like the EC/EC
mean/CMC/CMC mean compared to the faster GFS/GEFS, considering
continuity as well as typical model biases. Perhaps by around day
6/Thursday or so, the ECMWF and CMC may be a bit too slow in
lifting the surface low out, but it should be a wrapped up system
so it is possible.

Farther upstream, there is considerable variability with the flow
behind the main low, with potential for a bout of low amplitude
ridging in the central U.S. late week (though this is particularly
seen in the GFS suite that was not favored) before another system
may enter the West. The ensemble means provided a fair starting
point for this uncertain flow pattern.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Early in the period expect the best rain/mountain snow focus to be
over the Pacific Northwest and central West Coast. However the
details of location and intensity are unusually uncertain for a
forecast only 3 days out in time as guidance varies widely for the
strength and track of arriving low pressure. Lighter activity
should prevail eastward through the northern Rockies. Then some
moisture should extend southward into the Sierra Nevada, with rain
and mountain snow extending across central and possibly some
southern parts of the West. By Tuesday, the southern Montana into
Colorado Rockies and north-central High Plains should begin to see
a favorable combination of upper trough dynamics and low level
upslope flow that would increase precipitation over those areas,
with the High Plains seeing some springtime snow in addition to
the Rockies. Potentially strong low pressure that may track from
the Plains into the Upper Midwest would extend snow farther
northeast across the northern tier along with strong winds,
possibly creating blizzard conditions. Meanwhile in the warm
sector, there will be increasing coverage and intensity of
rainfall over the eastern Plains/Mississippi Valley with the
establishment of moist low level flow from the Gulf of Mexico.
Persistence of the Gulf inflow should lead to a couple days or so
with a heavy rain threat over or near the Lower Mississippi Valley
with some potential for flash flooding. Also the Storm Prediction
Center is monitoring the potential for severe weather over parts
of the Plains and Mississippi Valley. Check their latest outlooks
for more information. The pattern certainly suggests a heavy
rain/severe weather/wintry weather threat, but details on where
these hazards occur and when remains uncertain still, with plenty
of forecast refinements to come.

The western U.S. should see several days of below normal
temperatures, with daytime highs 20+ degrees below normal shifting
eastward Mon-Wed. Some moderation is likely by later in the week
across the West, though still below normal with additional
troughing moving in. By next Thursday-Friday, the core of the cold
should be over the northern Plains with low temperatures 10-20F
below normal and highs even approaching 30F below average.
Meanwhile, ahead of the big storm, expect temperatures from the
south-central U.S. to the East to be above normal, but trending
back towards normal following passage of the cold front.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri April 08 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 14 - 18 2022

Today's model solutions generally agree on the overall predicted large-scal=
e
500-hPa circulation pattern over North America and surrounding regions duri=
ng
the 6-10 day period, while diverging on the location and amplitude of speci=
fic
features of the pattern. A trough and associated negative 500-hPa height
anomalies are predicted over the Aleutians by most model solutions, while t=
he
0Z GEFS ensemble mean places the center of negative 500-hPa height anomalie=
s
to
the south of the Aleutians. The manual blend of 500-hPa heights forecasts,
equally weighting the ECMWF and GEFS ensemble means, places the trough and
negative 500-hPa height anomalies over the Aleutians. Ridges are predicted
with
associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies centered over the Arctic Ocean=
 to
the north of the Chukchi Sea and over the North Pacific off of the west coa=
st
of the CONUS. A trough and associated negative 500-hPa height anomalies are
forecast over the north-central CONUS. The GEFS ensemble mean indicates a
positive tilt to the trough over the CONUS and negative mid-level height
anomalies over the west coast. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predic=
ted
over the Eastern Seaboard and over the Pacific Coast in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual blend
of
models.

Below normal temperatures are likely over most of the western and central
CONUS
under enhanced northerly mid-level flow. Near normal temperatures are favor=
ed
for parts of California, as a ridge is predicted to push eastward into the
CONUS late in the period. A ridge and slightly above average 500-hPa height=
s
lead to increased chances of above normal temperatures for the Eastern
Seaboard. Below normal temperatures are likely over interior and eastern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, while above normal temperatures a=
re
favored over parts of southwestern Alaska, supported by the temperature
consolidation tool.

Above normal precipitation is favored for eastern areas of the Northern Pla=
ins
and from the Mississippi Valley eastward across the eastern CONUS, ahead of
the
predicted trough over the central CONUS. Near normal precipitation is favor=
ed
in areas of high uncertainty across a large part of the northwestern CONUS,
with significant differences among dynamical model precipitation tools. Nea=
r
to
below normal precipitation is favored over much of the southwestern CONUS,
consistent with the consolidation precipitation tool. Above normal
precipitation is slightly favored across southern Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, while below normal precipitation is most likely over northern
Mainland Alaska, supported by the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 0z GF=

centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
only fair agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern a=

among the temperature and precipitation tools, in addition to uncertainty d=
ue
to a changing pattern.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 16 - 22 2022

During the 8-14 day period, the circulation pattern over the North American
region is generally consistent with an evolution of the predicted pattern f=
or
the 6-10 day period, with increased uncertainty and continued differences
between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means. A trough is predicted to amplify
over the Aleutians and the adjacent North Pacific, while the downstream rid=
ge
and trough are predicted to progress eastward over the CONUS. The GEFS
ensemble
mean predicts less eastward progression of the pattern than the ECMWF ensem=
ble
mean. The 500-hPa circulation pattern in the manual blend of models indicat=
es
positive 500-hPa height anomalies from the Pacific Coast to approximately t=
he
Rocky Mountains and negative height anomalies over most of the remainder of
the
CONUS, with near average 500-hPa heights over the Gulf Coast and Atlantic
Coast
of the Southeast.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored for the western CONUS from th=
e
Pacific Coast to the Rocky Mountains, under a ridge and above average 500-h=
Pa
heights. Below normal temperatures are likely over most of the remainder of
the
CONUS, associated with a trough and below normal 500-hPa heights over the
east-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures are favored for the Florida
Peninsula and for the Atlantic Coast of New England, consistent with dynami=
cal
model temperature tools. Elevated probabilities of above normal temperature=
s
are forecast for western Mainland Alaska and below normal temperatures are
forecast over eastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, supported b=
y
the dynamical model temperature tools.

Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the eastern CONUS, due to=
 a
predicted trough over the east-central CONUS. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored over much of the western CONUS extending eastward
into
much of the Great Plains, consistent with the precipitation consolidation t=
ool
and ECMWF precipitation forecasts. Above normal precipitation is favored
across
southern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, ahead of a predicted
trough.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
only fair agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern a=
nd
among the temperature and precipitation tools, in addition to uncertainty d=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

SYNOPSIS: Models have trended toward a more meridional, less progressive
pattern for week-2 than yesterday, particularly over the central and easter=
n
U.S. Surface low pressure is forecast to move across the Great Lakes early =
in
the period, potentially leaving a swath of heavy snow across the Upper
Mississippi Valley and adjacent Great Plains. The circulation around this
system could bring high winds to the Great Lakes and adjacent areas early i=
n
week-2. Meanwhile, a stalled frontal boundary may set up across the Southea=
st
and Eastern Seaboard, bringing the potential for multiple episodes of heavy
precipitation and high winds during most of week-2. Precipitation is also
favored to continue on the already-swollen Red River of the North and the
Illinois River to keep the flooding threat in place through week-2. Behind =
the
leading surface low pressure near the amplified upper-level trough, much be=
low
normal temperatures can be expected across the central U.S. early in the
period, potentially extending from the Rockies to the Eastern States as the
cold air drifts slowly southeastward in association with the slowly-moving
upper-level trough. Farther west, a building ridge may bring much above nor=
mal
temperatures into the central California valleys around the middle of week-=
2.
Models are in poor agreement on the evolution of conditions across Alaska, =
but
cold air initially in eastern Alaska should moderate by mid-week. Finally,
some
models and tools indicate that one or more surface storm systems could brin=
g
heavy precipitation and high winds to south-central Alaska and the Panhandl=
e,
most likely around the middle of week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across the central CONUS,
Sat-Tue, Apr 16-19.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across most of the Rockies,
central CONUS, Appalachians, and Southeast, Sat-Fri, Apr 16-22.

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures in the central and southern
California Valleys, Mon-Tue, Apr 18-19.

Slight risk of heavy snow over the Upper Mississippi Valley and adjacent
areas,
Sat-Sun, Apr 16-17.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of the southeastern quadrant of
the
CONUS, the lower Ohio Valley, and the Eastern Seaboard, Sat-Thu, Apr 16-21.

Slight risk for high winds from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Coast=
,
Sat-Wed, Apr 16-20.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across eastern Mainland Alask=
a
and the Panhandle, Sat-Sun, Apr 16-17.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for south-central Alaska and the Panhand=
le,
Mon-Tue, Apr 18-19.

Slight risk of high winds for south-central Alaska and the Panhandle, Mon-T=

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 16 - FRIDAY APRIL 22: Models are in fair to good agreeme=
nt
showing anomalous mid-level troughing in the central and eastern CONUS. Thi=
s
feature is more amplified and meridional than yesterday in most models, wit=
h
the 6z GFS and GEFS flatter than other solutions. A more amplified solution=
 is
preferred, given model trends and the preponderance of the most recent
solutions. Several potential hazards are associated with this feature, whic=
h
has the potential to set up a quasi-stationary frontal boundary over the
eastern CONUS with several impulses of surface low pressure tracking along =
the
front until late in the week. On days 8 and 9 (Apr 16-17), one system exiti=
ng
the Great Lakes into Canada could drop heavy snow on the Upper Mississippi
Valley and adjacent sections of the Great Lakes and Great Plains. There is
also
a slight threat of high winds associated with the circulation around this
feature. After this system exits, uncertainty in the exact timing and posit=
ion
of disturbances moving along the quasi-stationary boundary leads to slight
chances for one or more episodes of heavy precipitation and high winds unti=
l
late week-2.



Along and behind the trough that sets up over the central and eastern CONUS=
,
cold air will move through a large part of the CONUS, pushing from the Rock=
ies
to the southern and eastern CONUS as week-2 progresses. The GEFS and Europe=
an
reforecast tools both show odds of 40 to 80 percent that much below normal
temperatures (below the 15th percentile historically) will cover the centra=
l
CONUS during the first half of week-2, leading to a moderate chance for muc=
h
below normal temperatures across the middle of the CONUS through the first
half
of the period. With a more amplified mid-level flow expected than yesterday=
,
enhanced chances for much below normal temperatures don=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDt extend west of the
Rockies, but the cold air intrusion should last longer and press farther to
the
south and east during the last half of week-2. The European ensemble
reforecast
tool shows at least a 20 percent chance for temperatures to drop below 40 d=
eg
F
almost as far south as the central Gulf Coast and eastward into the Carolin=
a
Piedmont.



Farther west the favored more-amplified solution indicates a significant
mid-level ridge will build along the western CONUS, pulling relatively warm
air
into the West Coast States. The most anomalous conditions look to cover mos=
t
of
the California Valleys around the middle of week-2, enhancing chances for m=
uch
above normal temperatures. The European ensemble reforecast tool shows chan=
ces
reaching 60 percent that temperatures will top out among the warmest 15
percent
of historical occurrences. The flatter GEFS solution shows less anomalous h=
eat
in the region, but still with enhanced chances for much above normal
temperatures. Abnormal warmth should extend to the end of week-2, but
anomalies
are forecast to be lower later in the period.



Cold air is favored to be in place over eastern Alaska as week-2 starts,
creating a slight chance for much below temperatures early in the period
before
the cold air moderates and exits the state. For the remainder of week-2,
models
are in poor agreement on the mean mid-level pattern, creating a wide array =
of
solutions regarding the timing, strength, and position of one or more storm
systems that could form in the North Pacific. However, around the middle of
week-2, there is a bit more agreement that at least a moderately-deep low
pressure center will be close enough to the state to bring enhanced chances
for
heavy precipitation and high winds to south-central parts of the Mainland, =
and
the Panhandle.

...Upper-level low to produce snow and rain showers over parts of
the Great Lakes to Central Appalachians...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Plains and the Central Gulf Coast...

...Heavy snow for the Cascades...

Deep upper-level low over the Upper Great Lakes to the Central
Gulf Coast will aid in producing snow and rain showers over parts
of the Great Lakes to Central Appalachians through Saturday. The
snow and rain showers will slowly taper off from west to east
overnight Saturday into Sunday. The heaviest snow amounts will be
over the Central Appalachians and, to a lesser degree, downwind
from the Great Lakes. Some of the rain showers will have embedded
thunderstorms over the Ohio Valley into parts of the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic, with the greatest areal coverage on Friday and less
on Saturday.

Meanwhile, gusty winds, low humidity, and dry fuels have
contributed to the SPC issuing a Critical Risk of fire weather
over parts of the Plains and the Central Gulf Coast through
Saturday morning. However, the fire weather threat will be over
parts of the Southern High Plains and Southern Rockies on
Saturday. In addition, upper-level ridging over portions of
California and the Southwest will aid in producing tied or record
high temperatures over the area through Friday evening.

Furthermore, a front over Northern Plains to the Great Basin will
move eastward to Upper Midwest to the Southern Plains by Sunday
afternoon. As a result, light rain and snow will develop over
parts of the Northern Intermountain Region early Friday evening.
As the front passes, the snow levels will lower over the region as
snow develops over the Northern Rockies by Saturday morning. The
light snow continues over the Northern Rockies on Saturday.
Overnight Saturday, the snow will begin to move into the Central
Rockies. Nevertheless, light snow and rain showers will develop
over parts of the Northern/Central High Plains on Sunday morning,
expanding into the Upper Mississippi Valley by Sunday evening.
Furthermore, light rain and thunderstorms will develop over parts
of the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley by Sunday evening.

Moreover, a steady flow of moisture off the Pacific will produce
heavy snow over the Northern Cascades on Friday evening into
Saturday evening. The heavy snow will shift southward to the
Southern Cascades from Saturday evening into Sunday evening. The
moisture will also produce coastal rain over the Northwest through
Sunday.

...Active weather is likely next week, with heavy snow spreading
from higher elevations of the West into the Northern Plains and
heavy rain and severe thunderstorm chances across the South...

...Overview...

The latest guidance continues to support an amplified and active
weather pattern across the lower 48 next week. A reinforced
western U.S. trough looks to emerge into the Plains by around
midweek as a vigorous closed low and associated surface low
develop over the Plains/Upper Midwest. Initially, this should
bring heavy mountain snows out west, with heavy snow and possible
blizzard conditions spreading north and west of the low track into
the northern Plains. In the warm sector of the system, severe
weather and heavy to excessive rain is likely across parts of the
Deep South and potentially eastward. By late week, a blocky ridge
in the western Atlantic should steer the closed upper low in a
more northerly direction into eastern Canada as the next trough
moves into the West.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Though model guidance is united in showing the developing western
trough becoming a deep closed upper low as it tracks into the
central U.S., ample differences remain with the timing and track
of the upper and surface low features. For a few days now, the GFS
has been and continues to be a fast and north outlier, with the
ECMWF and CMC the farthest west/south with the surface low
Wednesday into Thursday. The last couple of runs of the ECMWF
however, including tonights new 00z run, seem to be trending
faster with the system. Not quite as fast still as the GFS, but
the two may be coming into somewhat better agreement and this
warrants watching. The ensemble means generally follow their
deterministic counterparts, which does not increase confidence in
one solution over the other. All of this seems to be related to
strength and interactions of pieces of energy embedded within the
larger Western U.S. trough as early as day 3/Tuesday. So perhaps,
once these details get resolved, models may start converging on a
solution as it moves farther downstream. WPC continuity has been
favoring the more southerly/slower track and so with no clear
indication to shift that thinking, tonights forecast also leaned
heavily on the ECMWF/CMC and respective ensemble means.

Also considerable differences late period regarding the next
system into the West. GFS runs much weaker/faster with energy
dropping out of the Gulf of Alaska into the Pacific Northwest.
ECMWF much stronger, with another compact closed low over the
Pacific Northwest by next Friday. Ensembles also show considerable
spread, so seems prudent to stick close to the ensemble means at
this point, especially given the late period timing.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Beginning Tuesday, mountain snow will be ongoing across the
Washington/Oregon Cascades as well as farther inland across the
intermountain West. Meanwhile, the low pressure system should
really begin to ramp up and so a favorable combination of upper
trough dynamics and low level upslope flow should increase
precipitation and a springtime heavy snow threat into the Rockies
and especially the northern High Plains. Strong low pressure looks
to track from the Plains into the Upper Midwest Wednesday into
Thursday with snow spreading into the northern Plains along with
strong winds, possibly creating blizzard conditions. Meanwhile in
the warm sector, there will be increasing coverage and intensity
of rainfall ahead of the attendent cold front from the Mississippi
Valley eastward. The greatest threat for heavy to excessive rains
and severe weather looks to converge over or near the lower
Mississippi Valley/Tennessee Valley with several days of
persistent gulf moisture and instability. Farther north, dynamics
wrapping around the low may support an additional area of modest
rainfall across the Upper Mississippi Valley. While this overall
pattern certainly suggests a heavy rain/severe weather/wintry
weather threat, but details on where these hazards occur and when
remains uncertain still, with plenty of forecast refinements to
come.

The western U.S. should see several days of below normal
temperatures, with daytime highs 20+ degrees below normal shifting
eastward with time. Some moderation is likely by later in the week
across the West, though still below normal with additional
troughing moving in. By next Thursday-Saturday, the core of the
cold should be over the northern Plains with low temperatures
10-20F below normal and highs even approaching 30F below average.
Meanwhile, ahead of the big storm, expect temperatures from the
south-central U.S. to the East to be above normal, but trending
back towards normal following passage of the cold front.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS....

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a large low/trough across the eastern CONUS will
continue to weaken as it shifts eastward toward the Atlantic Coast
today. In its wake, a second lower-amplitude trough and associated
jet across the Great Basin and western US will move eastward over
the Plains late today and tonight. Increasing ascent in the lee of
the Rockies will support robust surface cyclogenesis across the
central and southern High Plains. Southerly winds are forecast to
increase within the very dry airmass in place supporting increased
fire weather concerns.

...High Plains...
As the shortwave trough ejects east through the central Rockies and
onto the Plains later in the evening, lee troughing and cyclogenesis
will enhance southwesterly surface flow across the Southwest and
High Plains. Widespread downslope winds of 20-25 mph are expected
from central NM, eastward across OK/TX and into southeastern CO.
Warm temperatures and adiabatic drying will further desiccate an
already dry airmass supporting widespread single digit humidity
values. In addition to the favorable meteorological overlap,
prevalent dry fuels with substantial recent fire activity will be in
place. Widespread Critical fire weather conditions are expected
through the day and into this evening. Some threat for fire activity
may linger overnight across the northern TX/OK Panhandles given poor
humidity recoveries and the strengthening lee low across eastern CO.


With increased forcing aloft ahead of a cold front associated with
the approaching shortwave trough, isolated thunderstorms may develop
across parts of the central Rockies this afternoon and evening. Area
averaged model soundings show deep and well-mixed boundary layers
with PWATS generally less than 0.4 inches. The deep inverted-v
structure and dry lower atmosphere may support a few dry
thunderstorms across northern CO and central/eastern WY. Storm
coverage remains highly uncertain given the meager moisture and
buoyancy available. High elevation fuels also remain somewhat
unreceptive to starts given the early occurrence compared to
climatology. While no DryT area will be added, some risk for a few
dry strikes is possible within dry fuels at lower elevations.

...Florida...
Lingering northwesterly flow behind a cold front and the upper
low/trough will support a few hours of gusty surface winds (10-15
mph) across the southern Florida Peninsula. Despite recent rainfall,
local fuels remain dry, (ERCs 95th+ percentile) and diurnal RH
minimums are forecast to fall below 35%. The combination of dry and
breezy conditions within receptive fuels will support Elevated fire
weather Conditions.

...Northern California...
As the shortwave trough over the Great Basin shifts eastward,
mid-level flow will gradually become northwesterly ahead of an
upstream jet streak over the Pacific. The increasing northern
component in combination with a strong northerly pressure gradient
at the surface will support strong winds (15-25 mph) across the
Sacramento Valley. Downsloping within the post-frontal airmass will
support surface RH below 20% in combination with the strong surface
winds. While fuels are not overly dry, a few hours of elevated to
near Critical fire weather conditions appear likely.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS....

...Synopsis...
A low amplitude shortwave trough within broad southwesterly flow is
forecast to eject eastward across the central Plains through Sunday.
Behind the trough, strengthening mid-level winds will overspread
much of the Southwest and southern Plains. Enhanced by the flow
aloft and a strong surface low across eastern KS, low-level winds
will become quite strong within a very warm and dry airmass.
Volatile fuels and the dry/breezy conditions will support high-end
Critical fire weather conditions across parts of the southern Plains
Sunday.

...Southern Plains...
As the main shortwave trough shifts farther east into the Plains
Sunday, mid-level flow will gradually veer to westerly ahead of an
increasingly strong Pacific jet. As the strong flow aloft
overspreads the Southwest and southern Plains Sunday morning,
west-southwesterly surface winds should rapidly increase. Model
soundings show deep vertical mixing within an extremely dry air mass
near a pronounced low-level thermal ridge. Afternoon RH values of
5-10% are excepted to be widespread across portions of NM west TX
and far western OK. Within this corridor, surface winds of 20-30 mph
are expected. Gusts of 35-40 mph also appear possible given the deep
vertical mixing and increasing flow aloft. With fuels in the 90th+
percentile common across the Plains, widespread high-end critical
fire weather conditions are expected much of Sunday. A few hours of
locally extremely critical conditions may develop across eastern NM
where locally stronger winds appear more likely. Fire concerns may
linger after sunset as strong surface winds remain in place beneath
the low-level jet and humidity recoveries remain poor.

...Central Plains....
Downslope winds in the wake of the departing trough and
strengthening westerly flow are expected to spill out of the central
Rockies and onto the Plains. West to east surface pressure gradients
will support dry downslope flow and low RH despite falling
temperatures. Dry fuels suggest a few hours of Elevated fire weather
conditions are possible across the central High Plains Sunday.

...Northern California...
As flow aloft behind the shortwave trough farther east begins to
weaken, a second deeper trough will begin to emerge across the
eastern Pacific. Ahead of this feature, stronger northwesterly flow
aloft will nose inland across the Sacramento Valley supporting gusty
northwesterly winds for a few hours Sunday. Rain chances will begin
to increase late Sunday as the approaching trough deepens and
onshore flow strengthens. Prior to that, a few hours of locally
Elevated fire conditions may develop within dry fuels across
portions of northern California.

...Upper-level low to produce snow and rain showers over parts of
the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and interior Northeast through
Sunday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Central/Southern Plains through early next week...

...Heavy snow for the Cascades...

A deep upper-level low will push off into the western Atlantic
this weekend, putting an end to a period of sustained light
precipitation across the Great Lakes and Northeast. Light rain,
scattered to isolated thunderstorms and snow showers are likely to
persist across the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and interior Northeast
today before winding down on Sunday. Cool air will filter into the
eastern half of the country on the backside of the associated
surface cold front through Sunday.

Another deep upper trough centered over central Canada will eject
a pair of surface low pressure systems into the Great Plains
today. Some light rain/snow showers and thunderstorms are possible
along the Front Range through Sunday. By Sunday night the more
southern system will arrive over the Midwest, bringing with it the
chance for additional thunderstorm activity. The threat of severe
weather remains marginal for the midsection of the country this
weekend. Warm air will ride out ahead of this system and spread
from the Great Plains on Saturday to the Mississippi Valley on
Sunday. A colder airmass will settle over the Northwest this
weekend as the aforementioned cold front sweeps through the
Rockies today.

A sustained period of moderate to heavy rainfall and heavy
mountain snow are set to ensue over the Pacific Northwest this
weekend as onshore flow and a subsequent shortwave pull moisture
into the region. Some scattered to isolated thunderstorms are
possible over parts of the coastal and inland Pacific Northwest
today. Light to moderate snowfall is also expected over parts of
the Northern Rockies through the Weekend. The Cascades will
experience a weekend of heavy snow with accumulations of 1-2 feet
likely. A deep low pressure system is forecast to arrive over the
Pacific Northwest by Monday morning. This system is forecast to
carry a substantial amount of Pacific moisture, but there is some
lingering uncertainty with respect to its timing and track at the
moment.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0127 PM CST Mon Jan 24 2022

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Latest guidance continues to show
low probability for fire weather concerns across much of the CONUS.
See the previous discussion for additional details.

..Moore.. 01/24/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CST Mon Jan 24 2022/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough across the upper Midwest and Northeast will
intensify on Tuesday. In the West, a shortwave trough will move
southeastward from the Great Basin into the Southwest. The
intensifying trough in the East will help push a stronger surface
high pressure system into the Plains. High pressure will similarly
strengthen in the northern Rockies/Great Basin in the wake of the
shortwave trough. Colder temperatures and precipitation will
generally keep fire weather concerns minimal for most of the CONUS.
Dry conditions and breezy northerly/northeasterly winds are possible
in parts of southern California and the lower Colorado River Basin.
However, fuels in these locations are not currently receptive to
fire spread.

...Winter Coastal Storm Threat from the Mid-Atlantic to especially
New England Friday/Weekend...


...Overview...

Guidance still shows a mean upper level pattern that features
troughing over the East, varying degrees of ridging over the West,
and a developing northeastern Pacific trough that may approach the
West Coast early next week. Within this agreeable regime there are
lingering uncertainties regarding specifics of an eastern U.S.
amplified trough that has become more likely support a significant
and rapidly deepening western Atlantic coastal storm Friday into
the weekend with effects from the Mid-Atlantic to New England in
particular, as well as for a lead Pacific shortwave approaching
the West Coast by Sat. There are also lingering differences with
details of a later period northeastern Pacific trough, affecting
how much moisture reaches the Northwest. However, these
differences are now less profound than earlier.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Even though the large scale pattern evolution has been rather
consistent in recent guidance, embedded areas of uncertainty
involve aspects that are smaller in scale and have lead to lower
predictability. However, forecast spread has decreased with the
latest couple model and ensemble runs whose systems are now better
clustered, bolstering forecast confidence. The WPC medium range
product suite was mainly derived from a composite blend of the
GFS/ECMWF/Canadian Day 3-5 (Thu-Sat) along with supportive
ensembles and the National Blend of Models before transitioning to
just the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and NBM into Day 6/7 (Sun/Mon).
I did apply some manual adjustments to offset composite smoothing.
These were primarily to ensure sufficient coastal storm depth
consistent with overall support, trending deeper than WPC
continuity given improved forecast clustering, ensemble member
probabilities, and a deeper/closer track to the coast guidance
trends.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Key Messages for January 28-30 (Friday-Weekend) Winter Storm:
Confidence is increasing that a significant winter storm will
create considerable impacts Friday through the weekend from the
Mid-Atlantic through the Northeast. While uncertainty continues
with the track and intensity of this system, it is becoming more
likely that it will bring significant snow, sleet, and freezing
rain to the region, including the I-95 metropolitan areas.
Hazardous travel conditions are possible due to the combination of
snow, sleet, freezing rain, and wind. Close to the immediate
Atlantic coastline, strong winds combined with high astronomical
tides may lead to coastal flooding. Please continue to monitor for
future updates as this system develops.

Elsewhere, some locations near the West Coast may see an increase
in precipitation with an approaching shortwave/possible compact
upper low late week into the weekend. This energy should
eventually support some precipitation over the southern
Plains/western half of the Gulf Coast early next week. Flow ahead
of a northeastern Pacific upper trough should bring rain and
mountain snow into the Northwest into early next week. A wavy
frontal system should also bring mostly light snow to the Great
Lakes and Appalachians late this week. One or more trailing weak
waves may also produce scattered light snow over areas from the
extreme northern tier into the Great Lakes.

Mainly the East will experience periods with much below normal
temperatures (10-20F below normal). Much of the West should
continue to see moderately above normal temperatures (5-10F+
anomalies) while the northern and central Plains will likely see
multiple warm days with temperatures 10-20F above normal,
especially starting the weekend.

...Winter Coastal Storm Threat from the Mid-Atlantic to especially
New England Friday/Weekend...


...Overview...

Guidance still shows a mean upper level pattern that features
troughing over the East, varying degrees of ridging over the West,
and a developing northeastern Pacific trough that may approach the
West Coast early next week. Within this agreeable regime there are
lingering uncertainties regarding specifics of an eastern U.S.
amplified trough that has become more likely support a significant
and rapidly deepening western Atlantic coastal storm Friday into
the weekend with effects from the Mid-Atlantic to New England in
particular, as well as for a lead Pacific shortwave approaching
the West Coast by Sat. There are also lingering differences with
details of a later period northeastern Pacific trough, affecting
how much moisture reaches the Northwest. However, these
differences are now less profound than earlier.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Even though the large scale pattern evolution has been rather
consistent in recent guidance, embedded areas of uncertainty
involve aspects that are smaller in scale and have lead to lower
predictability. However, forecast spread has decreased with the

GFS/ECMWF/Canadian Day 3-5 (Thu-Sat) along with supportive
ensembles and the National Blend of Models before transitioning to
just the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and NBM into Day 6/7 (Sun/Mon).
I did apply some manual adjustments to offset composite smoothing.
These were primarily to ensure sufficient coastal storm depth
consistent with overall support, trending deeper than WPC
continuity given improved forecast clustering, ensemble member
probabilities, and a deeper/closer track to the coast guidance
trends.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1224 AM CST Tue Jan 25 2022

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will round the base of the larger-scale trough
across the upper Midwest and Northeast today. This will push colder
air into the Plains and force the cold front to near the Gulf Coast.
Farther west, another shortwave trough will move through the Great
Basin and into the Southwest. High pressure will similarly build at
the surface in its wake across the Great Basin. Cold temperatures
and areas of precipitation will generally keep fire weather concerns
minimal. Dry and windy northerly/northeasterly winds will return to
southern California and the lower Colorado River Basin. Winds of
15-20 mph and RH reductions to 15-20% are possible in some
locations. Fuels are not particularly supportive of fire spread,
however.

...Winter Coastal Storm Threat from the Mid-Atlantic to especially
New England Friday into the Weekend...


...Overview...

From late this week to the start of next week the models and
ensembles continue to show an upper level pattern consisting of a
mean trough over the East, varying degrees of ridging over the
West, and a developing northeastern Pacific trough that should
approach/reach the West Coast. Guidance expects the inland
progression of the Pacific trough by Monday-Tuesday to flip the
pattern somewhat, with decreasing heights over the West and rising
heights over the East. Perhaps due in part from improving
agreement for a lead Pacific shortwave/possible weak embedded low
nearing California by Saturday, there is likewise narrowing spread
of solutions for energy digging into an amplified U.S. trough that
looks increasingly likely to support a significant and rapidly
deepening western Atlantic coastal storm Friday into the weekend
with effects from the Mid-Atlantic to New England in particular.
Some differences persist for details of the upper trough moving
into the West.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Emerging trends from yesterday along both coasts of the lower 48
during the late week/weekend time frame held up fairly well in the
12Z/18Z cycle of guidance. Slower and more separated evolution of
the shortwave approaching California, likely yielding a weak upper
low, allows for a more persistent upper ridge over the West and in
turn somewhat stronger and slightly westward digging of shortwave
energy (which is finally reaching northwestern North America
today) into the East. Yet to be resolved is exactly when and where
eastern energy closes off an upper low, with 12Z/18Z GFS runs
doing so a bit later/northeastward than other models. In the new
00Z cycle the CMC has deviated significantly from other guidance
over the eastern Pacific, leading to question marks in its
forecast farther eastward--specifically a storm track a bit to the
east of consensus versus multiple prior runs that were on the
western side. Some important fine-scale details will still take a
while to be resolved satisfactorily. A multi-model blend with some
manual enhancement to maintain continuity in depth also provided
reasonable consistency for a track just offshore New England.

The relatively small and weak nature of the upper low that may
track into the Southwest this weekend could still lead to
predictability issues for a while. Trends over the past day have
been slower, delaying the development of any potential
precipitation along and north of the Gulf Coast. The new 00Z ECMWF
has trended faster though. There is still a wide array of possible
tracks after emerging from the Southwest early next week, with GFS
runs tending to be the farthest north and thus driest.

The upper trough eventually reaching into the western U.S. will be
from some combination of progressive North Pacific energy and flow
descending from Alaska. Differences by day 7 Tuesday are within
the realm of typical guidance spread/error at that time frame but
depend in part on whether there is a break in Pacific and
Alaska/Siberia upper ridging (GFS/GEFS keep it connected, most
other guidance shows a break), an issue that can ultimately lead
to more significant differences over the lower 48.

The aforementioned model blend used for the western Atlantic storm
worked well elsewhere for the first half of the period as well.
The forecast then transitioned toward half models/half means by
late in the period to resolve some of the timing and detail
differences that arise.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Key Messages for January 28-30 (Friday-Weekend) Winter Storm:
Confidence is increasing that a significant winter storm will
create considerable impacts Friday through the weekend from the
Mid-Atlantic through the Northeast. While uncertainty continues
with the track and intensity of this system, it is becoming more
likely that it will bring significant snow, sleet, and freezing
rain to the region, including the I-95 metropolitan areas.
Hazardous travel conditions are possible due to the combination of
snow, sleet, freezing rain, and wind. Close to the immediate
Atlantic coastline, strong winds combined with high astronomical
tides may lead to coastal flooding. Please continue to monitor for
future updates as this system develops.

Currently it appears that the upper trough/low that may track into
California and the Southwest this weekend could be weak enough not
to produce much if any precipitation over that region.  Its
strength and track thereafter will determine how much
precipitation may develop from the Gulf Coast northward by the
first part of next week. Confidence is very low given a wide array
of possibilities between meaningful amounts and dry conditions.
Ahead of the northeastern Pacific upper trough, moisture should
begin to move into the Northwest on Sunday and then continue to
spread across more of the West with time. Highest totals of
rain/mountain snow should be over the Pacific Northwest. A series
of waves/fronts may bring episodes of light and scattered snow
into parts of the Great Lakes.

Much of the eastern half of the country will be quite chilly
through the weekend, with Saturday-Sunday having the broadest
coverage of temperatures 10-20F below normal. Expect a warming
trend to bring readings back close to normal by Monday or Tuesday.
 Much of the Plains will see above normal temperatures (up to plus
10-20F anomalies) late this week into Monday, aside from a cool
Friday over far southern areas. Northern locations will see a
colder trend Monday-Tuesday while the relative warmth farther
south spreads a bit farther eastward. The West should see plus
5-10F or so anomalies through the weekend followed by a cooler
trend early next week as upper troughing moves in.

ensembles continue to show an upper level pattern consisting of a
mean trough over the East, varying degrees of ridging over the
West, and a developing northeastern Pacific trough that should
approach/reach the West Coast. Guidance expects the inland
progression of the Pacific trough by Monday-Tuesday to flip the
pattern somewhat, with decreasing heights over the West and rising
heights over the East. Perhaps due in part from improving
agreement for a lead Pacific shortwave/possible weak embedded low
nearing California by Saturday, there is likewise narrowing spread
of solutions for energy digging into an amplified U.S. trough that
looks increasingly likely to support a significant and rapidly
deepening western Atlantic coastal storm Friday into the weekend
with effects from the Mid-Atlantic to New England in particular.
Some differences persist for details of the upper trough moving
into the West.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Emerging trends from yesterday along both coasts of the lower 48
during the late week/weekend time frame held up fairly well in the
12Z/18Z cycle of guidance. Slower and more separated evolution of
the shortwave approaching California, likely yielding a weak upper
low, allows for a more persistent upper ridge over the West and in
turn somewhat stronger and slightly westward digging of shortwave
energy (which is finally reaching northwestern North America
today) into the East. Yet to be resolved is exactly when and where
eastern energy closes off an upper low, with 12Z/18Z GFS runs
doing so a bit later/northeastward than other models. In the new
00Z cycle the CMC has deviated significantly from other guidance
over the eastern Pacific, leading to question marks in its
forecast farther eastward--specifically a storm track a bit to the
east of consensus versus multiple prior runs that were on the
western side. Some important fine-scale details will still take a
while to be resolved satisfactorily. A multi-model blend with some
manual enhancement to maintain continuity in depth also provided
reasonable consistency for a track just offshore New England.

The relatively small and weak nature of the upper low that may
track into the Southwest this weekend could still lead to
predictability issues for a while. Trends over the past day have
been slower, delaying the development of any potential
precipitation along and north of the Gulf Coast. The new 00Z ECMWF
has trended faster though. There is still a wide array of possible
tracks after emerging from the Southwest early next week, with GFS
runs tending to be the farthest north and thus driest.

The upper trough eventually reaching into the western U.S. will be
from some combination of progressive North Pacific energy and flow
descending from Alaska. Differences by day 7 Tuesday are within
the realm of typical guidance spread/error at that time frame but
depend in part on whether there is a break in Pacific and
Alaska/Siberia upper ridging (GFS/GEFS keep it connected, most
other guidance shows a break), an issue that can ultimately lead
to more significant differences over the lower 48.

The aforementioned model blend used for the western Atlantic storm
worked well elsewhere for the first half of the period as well.
The forecast then transitioned toward half models/half means by
late in the period to resolve some of the timing and detail
differences that arise.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Key Messages for January 28-30 (Friday-Weekend) Winter Storm:
Confidence is increasing that a significant winter storm will
create considerable impacts Friday through the weekend from the
Mid-Atlantic through the Northeast. While uncertainty continues
with the track and intensity of this system, it is becoming more
likely that it will bring significant snow, sleet, and freezing
rain to the region, including the I-95 metropolitan areas.
Hazardous travel conditions are possible due to the combination of
snow, sleet, freezing rain, and wind. Close to the immediate
Atlantic coastline, strong winds combined with high astronomical
tides may lead to coastal flooding. Please continue to monitor for
future updates as this system develops.

Currently it appears that the upper trough/low that may track into
California and the Southwest this weekend could be weak enough not
to produce much if any precipitation over that region.  Its
strength and track thereafter will determine how much
precipitation may develop from the Gulf Coast northward by the
first part of next week. Confidence is very low given a wide array
of possibilities between meaningful amounts and dry conditions.
Ahead of the northeastern Pacific upper trough, moisture should
begin to move into the Northwest on Sunday and then continue to
spread across more of the West with time. Highest totals of
rain/mountain snow should be over the Pacific Northwest. A series
of waves/fronts may bring episodes of light and scattered snow
into parts of the Great Lakes.

Much of the eastern half of the country will be quite chilly
through the weekend, with Saturday-Sunday having the broadest
coverage of temperatures 10-20F below normal. Expect a warming
trend to bring readings back close to normal by Monday or Tuesday.
 Much of the Plains will see above normal temperatures (up to plus
10-20F anomalies) late this week into Monday, aside from a cool
Friday over far southern areas. Northern locations will see a
colder trend Monday-Tuesday while the relative warmth farther
south spreads a bit farther eastward. The West should see plus
5-10F or so anomalies through the weekend followed by a cooler
trend early next week as upper troughing moves in.

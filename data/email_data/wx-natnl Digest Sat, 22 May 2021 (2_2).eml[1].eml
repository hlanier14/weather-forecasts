Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Sat May 22 2021 - 12Z Mon May 24 2021

...Heavy rain and some gusty winds are expected across eastern
Texas today after a low pressure center makes landfall across
central Texas coast this morning...

...Thunderstorms could become severe ahead of a cold front through
the High Plains for the next few days...

...Late-season mountain snow is expected to pick up once again
across western Montana on Sunday...

...Critical Risks of fire danger remain in place for portions of
the Four Corners region...

Winds circulating around a large high pressure system centered
over the eastern U.S. will continue to direct a stream of tropical
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico toward the western Gulf states.
Meanwhile, a low pressure center that formed yesterday in the
western Gulf of Mexico is now making landfall on the central Texas
coast. The chance for the circulation to develop into a tropical
cyclone is diminishing. However, the interaction of the
circulation with land could trigger bouts of thunderstorms
containing heavy downpours as it tracks further inland today. The
low pressure area is expected to weaken and dissipate by tonight
but tropical moisture will continue to stream into eastern Texas
for the remainder of the weekend.  Additional showers and
thunderstorms can be expected to form anytime under this unstable
air mass.

Meanwhile, a low pressure system is forecast to develop and
intensify as it tracks generally northward across the Rockies
through the weekend. A strong cold front associated with the
system is expected to trigger thunderstorms across the High Plains
during the weekend. Some of these storms could become severe
especially during late afternoon into early in the evening. Behind
the cold front, a deep upper-level trough/low settling into the
western U.S. is forecast to bring temperatures below normal for
much of the western U.S. through the weekend. High temperatures
are forecast to be generally 15 to 25 degrees below average for
the Intermountain West, and parts of Montana could stay 25 to 30
degrees below average, with record lows possible. These cold
temperatures will continue to support wet snow for the higher
elevations from the Sierra Nevada to the Intermountain West and
northern Rockies today. However, as the aforementioned low
pressure system intensifies, the snow is forecast to redevelop and
become steadier on Sunday across the higher elevations of the
northern Rockies and especially over western Montana Sunday night.
The low pressure system should continue to track northward into
the Canadian prairies by Monday morning but the snow is forecast
to linger across the northern Rockies.  For the lower elevations,
a steady cold rain is expected on Sunday across the northern High
Plains with gusty winds as the low passes just to the east.

In stark contrast to the cold and snow in the West, very warm
temperatures are expanding into the eastern U.S. where afternoon
high temperatures reaching into the 90s are forecast during the
weekend.  For the upper Midwest, Great Lakes and northeastern
U.S., showers and thunderstorms are expected ahead of a cold front
before cooler and drier air from Canada moves into these areas
later on Sunday.

Farther south, gusty winds across the interior West together with
dry conditions will continue to elevate the risk of wildfires.
Critical fire risk is forecast for the Four Corners states through
the weekend.

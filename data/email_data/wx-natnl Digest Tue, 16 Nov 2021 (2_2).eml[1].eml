Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CST Tue Nov 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
Troughing over the northern Plains will continue eastward reaching
the upper Midwest and Great Lakes by early evening Day2/Wednesday.
At the same time, shortwave ridging will develop over much of the
western US as strong mid-level flow retreats northward. At the
surface, a cold front will move south across the southern Plains,
approaching the Gulf Coast by sundown. Dry and windy conditions
supporting elevated fire weather potential are expected across
portions of the central and southern High Plains Day2/Wednesday.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Frontal passage early in the day across the southern Plains will
usher in a cooler and drier airmass across portions of western KS/OK
and the TX Panhandle. Steepening low-level pressure gradients will
support strong northerly winds of 20-30 mph through much of the day.
High-resolution ensemble guidance also suggests the cooling and
drying airmass will favor relative humidity values near 20%.
However, considerable uncertainty on the coverage and duration of
lower relative humidity remains, given model variability on cloud
cover and the cooler temperatures. Fuels remain marginally receptive
to fire spread suggesting that while overall forecast confidence
remains low, widespread strong wind gusts and near-criteria humidity
may support some elevated fire weather potential through the
afternoon.

...A deep low pressure system is bringing potentially damaging
winds across the northern Rockies/High Plains today...

...Lake-effect snow/rain downstream of the lower Great Lakes
tapers off by tonight before a warm front spreads rain into the
area by late Wednesday...

...Increasing chance of rain moving into the mid-Mississippi and
Ohio Valley Wednesday night to Thursday morning associated with a
cold front...

The latest round of heavy rain and mountain snow across western
Washington state is rapidly tapering off as the associated deep
low pressure system moves swiftly through southwestern Canada.
Meanwhile, this intense storm is expected to trigger extreme
downslope winds sustained at 50 to 70 mph with gusts of 80-100 mph
possible today across mountainous terrain of western Montana.
While off to the east in the High Plains, sustained winds of 30 to
50 mph with gusts to 70 mph will expand eastward into western
North Dakota today behind a strong cold front.  As the deep low
pressure system continues to track across southern Canada the next
couple of days, winds will remain at elevated levels across the
northern Plains tonight and into Wednesday before slowly subsiding
Wednesday night when the storm weakens and moves farther away.

Precipitation associated with this deep low will initially be
modest across the northern Rockies, and virtually none across the
northern Plains.  Rain chances will finally increase tonight when
the cold front approaches the Midwest.  By Wednesday, a more solid
stretch of rain is expected to develop across the Mid-Mississippi
Valley through the Midwest into the Great Lakes.  By Thursday
morning, rain chances is forecast to increase further across the
Tennessee to Ohio Valley as the cold front continues to push
eastward.

Meanwhile, widespread above normal temperatures across much of the
Plains today will spread eastward toward the eastern U.S. for the
next couple of days ahead of the cold front.  The cold air over
the eastern U.S. will gradually moderate as a warm front
approaches.  Lingering lake-effect snow/rain downstream of the
lower Great Lakes should taper off by tonight before a warm front
spreads rain into the area by late Wednesday.  In contrast, much
colder air will expand quickly through the northwestern U.S.
before plunging into the central and southern Plains by Thursday
morning.

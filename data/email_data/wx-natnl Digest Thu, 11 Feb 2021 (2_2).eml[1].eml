.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1152 PM CST Tue Feb 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
The fire-weather risk initially centered over the southern High
Plains and vicinity on D1/Wed will become even more localized and
less concentrated on D2/Thu as Arctic air migrates even further
westward and synoptic support for stronger surface winds becomes
less pronounced.  The spatial extent of dry and breezy conditions is
localized enough to preclude any highlights for this outlook.

A relatively cold and stable airmass will continue to mitigate any
fire-weather concerns across much of the remainder of the country,
while onshore flow precludes any risk along the West Coast.

...Significant ice storm will continue tonight and Thursday from
the Mid-Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley...

...Heavy snow possible across the Pacific Northwest beginning on
Thursday and may extend into the lowlands of Washington and
Oregon...

...Bitter arctic air to remain entrenched across the central U.S.
through the rest of this week while slowing expanding southward...

A very cold and active weather pattern is set to continue across
the country to end the first full week of February, with a
plethora of winter weather hazards. First, the combination of a
stationary front stretching from the Southern Plains northeastward
into the Tennessee Valley and a strong arctic high pressure system
to the north will lead to a threat of significant freezing
rain/icing in between. Across portions of Arkansas eastward into
Tennessee and Kentucky, total ice accretion is likely to exceed a
quarter inch, while amounts in excess of half an inch are possible
in some locations. This amount of ice will likely lead to
hazardous travel conditions, power outages, and scattered tree
damage, and Ice Storm Warnings are in effect for these areas.
Accumulating freezing rain is also possible across central Texas
through early Thursday, and some ice amounts over a tenth of an
inch are forecast. Northeast of the freezing rain axis, a couple
of rounds of light snow are expected from portions of the Ohio
Valley and Central Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic through
Friday, and generally 2 to 6 inches of snow is forecast across the
northern portions of the Mid-Atlantic region. Additionally,
freezing rain is possible Friday across parts of the Central
Appalachians and into parts of Virginia and northern North
Carolina. Meanwhile on the warm side of the system throughout the
Southeast, showers and thunderstorms could lead to an inch or two
of rain through Friday, with locally higher amounts around the
central Gulf Coast region.

Impactful winter weather is also a possibility across the Pacific
Northwest beginning on Thursday. A low pressure system is forecast
to enter southern Oregon Thursday evening while simultaneously
interacting with very cold air draining into the region. This
combination may lead to not only heavy snow across the typical
mountainous locations, but in the lowlands as well. Snowfall
accumulation will be possible in both Portland and Seattle, but
exact amounts are uncertain at this time. Freezing rain could be
another threat in lower elevations of northwestern Oregon in
particular. Winter Storm Watches have been posted across the area,
with Winter Storm Warnings in the Cascades given greater certainty
on precipitation type. Another round of wintry weather is again
possible there by Friday and Saturday. Snow and mixed
precipitation are expected to spread across much of the Great
Basin and into the Rockies as well.

Meanwhile, the arctic airmass located over the central U.S. is not
leaving anytime soon and is actually forecast to slowly expand
over the next few days. High temperatures 20 to 40 degrees below
average will cover a widespread area from nearly the entire Great
Plains to the Great Lakes again on Thursday. By Friday these cold
temperatures could ooze southward to the Gulf Coast and as far
east as the Lower Mississippi Valley. Temperatures will also make
a nosedive across the Northwest, where several daily low records
could fall. Wind Chill Advisories and Wind Chill Warnings remain
in effect and stretch from Montana to northern Wisconsin. Light
wind combined with subzero temperatures could make it feel as cold
as -50 degrees in some spots. This bitter cold can be dangerous
and lead to frostbite in less than 10 minutes. Be sure to plan
ahead and dress appropriately if spending time outdoors.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 10 2021

SYNOPSIS: Strong mid-level low pressure is likely to promote much below nor=
mal
temperatures for much of the central and eastern U.S. during early week-2.
Forecast onshore flow is favored to bring above-normal precipitation over
parts
of the northwestern lower 48 and potentially heavy high elevation snow over
the
Pacific Northwest. Over Alaska, mid-level low pressure is expected to promo=
te
potentially hazardous below-normal temperatures over the northern Mainland
during week-2.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the Plains,
Mississippi
Valley, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes, Thu-Fri, Feb 18-19.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the central and
eastern U.S., Thu-Fri, Feb 18-19.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for nearly all of the central
and
eastern U.S., Thu-Sat, Feb 18-20.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Cascades in the
Pacific Northwest, Thu-Mon, Feb 18-22.

Slight risk of heavy snow for parts of the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, Centra=
l
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast, Thu-Sat, Feb 18-20.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of northern Alas=
ka,
Thu-Wed, Feb 18-24.

FOR THURSDAY FEBRUARY 18 - WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 24: Heading into the start of
week-2, there is good agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means
featuring an amplified trough centered over the Great Plains, with negative
height departures overspreading the majority of the CONUS. This mid-level
feature continues to be the focal point for hazardous weather concerns, as =
it
maintains increased chances for hazardously cold temperatures during
mid-February. However, consistent with recent trends in the guidance, this
anomalous troughing looks to deamplify during week-2, as models continue to
signal a broad scale pattern change with the development of subtropical
ridging
over the southern tier of the CONUS. This is anticipated to help moderate
temperatures for many areas over the CONUS that are likely to be affected b=
y
the anomalous cold earlier in the outlook period. Farther west, both the GE=
FS
and ECMWF week-2 mean 500-hPa height fields favor anomalous ridging over th=
e
northern Pacific with anomalous troughing prevailing across the higher
latitudes of North America. This predicted pattern is conducive for enhance=
d
onshore flow to increase the potential for heavy precipitation for parts of
western North America and the Pacific Northwest.



This morning's ensemble guidance depicts a broad area of surface high press=
ure
and anomalous cold temperatures mainly across the central CONUS with the
largest negative temperature departures (8 to 12 degrees C) favored across =
the
Southern Plains by the start of week-2. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools remain in good agreement showing a large coverage of elevated chances
(>40%) that minimum temperatures fall below the 15th percentile from the Hi=
gh
Plains to the Ohio Valley. Higher probabilities (>60%) continue to be focus=
ed
over the Middle Mississippi Valley with at least a 20% chance that overnigh=
t
temperatures fall below the bottom 2nd percentile of the climatological
distribution, suggesting the possibility of record breaking lows in the reg=
ion
during the first few days of the period.  Thus, the moderate and high risk
regions of much below normal temperatures are maintained for Feb 18 to 19. =
By
day 10 (Feb 20), the 0z and 6z GEFS depicts much of the surface high pressu=
re
to begin shifting eastward into the Atlantic, which is expected to set up a
return flow pattern and bring warmer temperatures across the Great Plains a=
nd
Mississippi Valley by the middle of the period. Aloft, anomalous troughing =
is
expected to weaken and lift out over the northeastern CONUS with the axis o=
f
the coldest temperatures following the trough during this time. As a result=
,
the slight risk of much below normal temperatures remains posted through Fe=
b
20
for most of the CONUS east of the Rockies.



With a frontal boundary expected to push deep into the Gulf of Mexico by ea=
rly
week-2, the potential exists for surface low to develop along the front and
track northeast. Several of the most recent deterministic runs of the GFS a=
nd
ECMWF support this development but vary on its track and timing early in th=
e
period. Ensemble guidance favors increased precipitation amounts throughout
the
eastern CONUS associated with this low, however reforecast tools are less
supportive of precipitation amounts exceeding hazards criteria, and no heav=
y
precipitation hazards are issued at this time. However, with anomalous cold
air
likely to be in place, increased snowfall is possible to the northwest of a=
ny
low that develops over the eastern U.S. A slight risk of heavy snow is issu=
ed
for Feb 18 to 20 from the Central Appalachians and the Ohio Valley to New
England as several ensemble members of the GEFS favor the low track across =
the
Northeast.



Across the Pacific Northwest, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favor enhan=
ced
onshore flow and increased chances for above-normal precipitation during
week-2. Although reforecast guidance indicates at least a 20% chance for
precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile, totals are not
expected to exceed hazards criteria for the region. However, the combinatio=
n
of
increased moisture and below-normal temperatures tied to mid-level troughin=
g
predicted in the region supports an elevated risk of heavy snow mainly acro=
ss
the Cascades and a corresponding hazard is issued for Feb 18-22. Determinis=
tic
solutions suggest locally heavy daily snowfall amounts may exceed 24 inches=
 in
the highest elevations. Additionally, strong surface pressure gradients are
evident in the ensemble guidance, and reforecast tools maintain at least a =
20%
chance for sustained winds to exceed the 85th percentile. However, sustaine=
d
wind values remain below hazardous thresholds, and no wind related hazards =
are
issued.



Anomalous mid-level troughing and below-normal temperatures continues to be
favored over Alaska throughout week-2. With northerly flow expected to prev=
ail
across the northern half of the Mainland, there is good agreement in the
reforecast tools indicating at least a 20% chance minimum temperatures fall
below the 15th percentile and below -40 degrees F across the Brooks Range a=
nd
the North Slope. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted =
for
the entirety of week-2. Farther south, guidance also supports increased sto=
rm
activity in the Gulf of Alaska to bring increased precipitation and high
elevation snow over parts of the coastal Mainland and the Panhandle. Howeve=
r,
precipitation amounts are not anticipated to be hazardous at this time.

...Arctic air forecast to set multiple cold temperature records
this weekend across the Plains and MS Valley but should gradually
moderate by early to middle of next week...

...Stormy pattern with multiple winter precipitation events...

Models and ensembles are in general agreement that a large dome of
arctic air will surge south across central U.S. into the weekend
as the center of a polar vortex slides eastward across the Great
Lakes.  Models have continued to make further adjustments to
important shortwave energies that rotate around the vortex.  Both
the 06z GFS and 12z Tue/00z Wed ECMWF models have come into better
agreement with each other as shortwave energy emerges from the
southern Rockies onto the southern Plains on Sunday, resulting in
an area of likely snow in northwest Texas across central to
western OK and KS. As this system ejects to the northeast on Mon
15 Feb., the area of heavy snow northwest of low extends across
mid MS Valley to the Great Lakes.  Further southeast, significant
mixed sleet and freezing rain area expected from the lower MS
Valley to the TN Valley, central Appalachians, and Piedmont of
NC/VA/Mid Atlantic. On Tue 16 Feb, the parent low moves across the
Great Lakes into Canada, with cold advection producing lake effect
snow in MI and northwest PA/western NY.  The low weakens, but not
before producing a round of snow in northern NY/northern New
England with potential for a change over to sleet/freezing
rain/rain in southern New England/southeast New York before the
system departs.
Widespread moderate rain is expected further south in the
southeast to the coastal mid Atlantic states.

Confluent flow in the west results in a series of progressive 700
mb waves that produce rounds of snow in the terrain, starting on
Day 4 Sat/early Sun from the WA/OR Cascades into the ranges of
northern CA and northern Great Basin. On Day 5, the first wave
crosses NM/southern CO, bringing snow to the mountains there
before the wave exits on the Plains.  The next Pacific northwest
disturbances brings snow back to the WA/OR Cascades.  On Monday
the water vapor transport onshore and inland combines with a wave
to produce snow starting with the WA/OR Cascades and continuing to
the ranges of ID to western WY and northern UT. On Tuesday 16 Feb,
the mid-upper level northwest flow brings moisture and
light-moderate snows from the northern to central Rockies and
Great Basin.

With the arctic high pressure system in the Plains, many cold
temperature records will be likely down the Plains and into the
lower to mid MS Valley this weekend to early next week.  Record
lows/low maxima should be most numerous on Sunday before the
airmass gradually moderates next week.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a blend of
the 12Z-00z ECMWF/00z EC Ensemble mean, and the 06Z GFS/GEFS Mean.
The large scale pattern looks similar across most models/ensembles
with a reamplifying 500 mb ridge off the west coast and persistent
central US upper trough, and ridge off the southeast coast.
The 00z Canadian deamplified the ridge off the west coast and
became a progressive outlier with systems across the country, so
was not included in the blend.

...Widespread record cold temperatures on Sunday across the Plains
and MS Valley will gradually moderate during next week...

...Stormy pattern will bring multiple wintry precipitation events
from coast to coast...

Models and ensembles continue to advertise a very active synoptic
pattern through the medium range period.  Although the large dome
of arctic air over the mid-section of the country will gradually
moderate by early next week, a broad longwave trough will remain
in place across the Plains with back-to-back energetic systems
tracking from coast to coast around this trough.

The medium range period will start with a developing low pressure
system over the southern Rockies, bringing mixed precipitation to
the region while spreading snow into the central to southern
Plains on Sunday.  All models have sped up the eastward progress
of this system with more snow spreading into the central High
Plains where many locations are forecast to experience record cold
sub-zero temperatures Sunday morning.  As this system taps in Gulf
moisture, indications are that it will develop into widespread
winter weather event from the southern Plains through the
Northeast Monday and Tuesday.  The GFS has come into better
agreement with the ECMWF in bringing the storm up the East Coast
on Tuesday with a split storm center tracking up on either sides
of the Appalachians.  On the other hand, the CMC continues to
favor an offshore track.  Meanwhile, widespread moderate rain is
expected further south near the southeast U.S. coast into Florida
near a stationary front.

By the middle of next week, there is decent model agreement for
the next shortwave to develop into another low pressure system
near the Gulf Coast that will eventually track into the East
Coast.  Although details are still elusive at this stage, it
appears that this system will bring another winter weather event
from the interior South moving toward the Northeast during the
middle of next week.

Meanwhile, the next Pacific system will likely bring the next
significant precipitation event into the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday.  The moisture and upper-level energy will track well
inland, reaching into the central Rockies by Tuesday with
relatively consistent model timing thus far.  Mountain snows are
expected from the Pacific Northwest to the central Rockies.
Energy ejecting into the southern Plains will be key to the
development of the aforementioned system tracking across the South
midweek.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 12Z ECMWF/EC ensemble mean, the 18Z GFS/GEFS,
together with a smaller contribution from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean and
the 01Z NBM. Mostly ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7 given
the
increasing model uncertainties.

blend of the 12Z ECMWF/EC ensemble mean, the 18Z GFS/GEFS,
together with a smaller contribution from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean and
the 01Z NBM. Mostly ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7 given
the
increasing model uncertainties.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A relatively focused, localized area of elevated fire weather will
develop across portions of northeastern New Mexico to the west of a
stationary boundary located across the New Mexico Plains.  Though RH
values will fall to around 10% during peak heating hours, relatively
weak surface flow will exist in the vicinity which should mitigate
the overall risk.  Elsewhere, a cold, stable airmass will reside
across much of the central and eastern U.S. while onshore flow
exists along the West Coast, limiting fire-weather concerns.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 AM CST Thu Feb 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Quiescent fire-weather conditions will continue in most areas
through the D2/Fri forecast period.  An expansive area of high
pressure centered over the northern High Plains will maintain a cold
airmass across much of the central and eastern CONUS.  Meanwhile,
low pressure centered over the Great Basin will maintain an onshore
flow pattern along the West Coast.  A dry airmass will reside across
drought-stricken Arizona and New Mexico, though wind speeds only
reach the 15 mph range and RH values will not fall below 20% in most
areas.  Only locally elevated fire-weather conditions are expected
from southwestern into central New Mexico, although the limited
extent of these conditions precludes any highlights at this time.

...Significant ice storm to gradually end today from the
Mid-Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley...

...A series of winter storms will result in widespread snowfall
across the higher terrain and into the lowlands of Washington and
Oregon through this weekend...

...Bitter arctic air to remain entrenched across the central U.S.
and continue expanding south...

A very cold and active weather pattern is set to continue across
the country to end the first full week of February, with a
plethora of winter weather hazards. First, a continuing ice storm
is impacting regions from central Texas to the Ohio Valley. A
mixture of sleet and freezing rain is forecast to gradually come
to an end today, but not before leaving a long swath of damaging
ice accumulations. The areas with the best chance to receive a
quarter inch or more of ice extends from the Ozarks to the I-64
corridor in eastern Kentucky. Ice accumulation exceeding a half
inch is possible in some locations. This amount of ice will likely
lead to hazardous travel conditions, power outages, and scattered
tree damage, and Ice Storm Warnings are in effect for these areas.
Accumulating freezing rain is also possible across central Texas
today, and some ice amounts over a tenth of an inch are forecast.
Northeast of the freezing rain axis, a couple of rounds of light
snow are ongoing from portions of the Ohio Valley and Central
Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic through Friday, and generally 2
to 6 inches of snow is forecast across the northern portions of
the Mid-Atlantic region. Additionally, yet another round of
freezing rain is possible beginning Friday evening across parts of
the Central Appalachians and into parts of Virginia and northern
North Carolina. Meanwhile on the warm side of the system
throughout the Southeast, showers and thunderstorms could lead to
an inch or two of rain through Friday, with locally higher amounts
around the central Gulf Coast region.

Impactful winter weather is also a possibility across the Pacific
Northwest starting today and lasting through Saturday. A low
pressure system is forecast to enter southern Oregon this evening
while simultaneously interacting with very cold air draining into
the region. This combination may lead to not only heavy snow
across the typical mountainous locations, but in the lowlands as
well. Significant snowfall accumulation will be possible in both
Portland and Seattle. Freezing rain could be another threat in
lower elevations of northwestern Oregon in particular. Another
round of wintry weather is again possible there by Friday and
Saturday. Snow and mixed precipitation are expected to spread
across much of the Great Basin and into the Rockies as well.

Meanwhile, the arctic airmass located over the central U.S. is not
leaving anytime soon and is actually forecast to slowly expand
over the next few days. High temperatures 20 to 40 degrees below
average will cover a widespread area from nearly the entire Great
Plains to the Great Lakes again on Thursday. By Friday these cold
temperatures could ooze southward to the Gulf Coast and as far
east as the Lower Mississippi Valley. Temperatures will also make
a nosedive across the Northwest, where several daily low records
could fall. Wind Chill Advisories and Wind Chill Warnings remain
in effect and stretch from much of the Northern Plains to Midwest.
Light wind combined with subzero temperatures could make it feel
as cold as -50 degrees in some northern spots. This bitter cold
can be dangerous and lead to frostbite in less than 10 minutes. Be
sure to plan ahead and dress appropriately if spending time
outdoors.

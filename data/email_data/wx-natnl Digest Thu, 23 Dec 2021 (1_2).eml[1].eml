Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1053 AM CST Wed Dec 22 2021

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EXTREME SOUTHEAST WYOMING INTO FAR
WESTERN NEBRASKA...

The only change to the Outlook was to connect the two Elevated Areas
along and immediately west of the I-25 corridor in CO. Here, RH
recoveries were very poor overnight, with the latest surface
observations showing RH values in the low teens to single digits. By
this afternoon, sustained westerly surface winds should approach 15
mph with 25-35 mph gusts primarily across terrain-favored areas.
Fuels across the region remain highly supportive of wildfire-spread,
with widespread ERCs in the 90th to 95th percentile or greater. The
localized nature of the threat precludes a Critical Area. For
additional details on the central and southern High Plains
fire-weather threat, see the previous discussion below.

..Weinman.. 12/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0127 AM CST Wed Dec 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will dominate much of the CONUS through today.
However, over 50 kts of 500 mb flow is expected to overspread the
central High Plains, where a mixed boundary layer will contribute to
downward momentum transport in terrain-favoring areas to support
favorable regional wildfire spread conditions. For much of the
grassland areas to the lee of the Rockies, fuels remain highly
receptive to wildfire spread.

Critical highlights remain in place to the lee of the Laramie Range,
where 20+ mph sustained westerly surface winds are expected to
overlap with 15 percent RH for a few hours during the afternoon.
Elevated highlights have also been added to southern portions of the
Colorado Front Range, where some of the latest high-resolution
guidance has come into consensus in up to 10-15 mph sustained
westerly winds overlapping with 10-20 percent RH by afternoon peak
heating. Finally, Elevated highlights have been expanded across
central and eastern New Mexico, where 15-25 mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds will occur amid 10-20 percent RH.
Locally Critical conditions may be observed to the immediate lee of
the Sacramento Mountains.

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes were made
with this update.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CST Wed Dec 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify along the West Coast, encouraging
the intensification of surface lee-troughing and associated dry flow
across the central and southern High Plains tomorrow/Thursday
afternoon. Elevated highlights have been added across northeast
Colorado, where 15 mph sustained southerly return flow is expected
to remain initially dry (i.e. 15-20 percent RH) for at least a few
hours during the afternoon. Elevated highlights have also been
introduced for portions of the southern High Plains, where 15-20 mph
sustained westerly winds are expected to develop to the west of the
surface lee trough axis amid 15-20 percent RH. In both Elevated
areas, finer fuels are at least modestly to highly receptive to
wildfire spread.

A very amplified Pacific-into-Alaska upper ridge persists into the
middle of next week and supports a deep upper trough that drifts
east from the West Coast through the Interior West, anchored by a
mean low over northwestern Canada. The trough will maintain a
lengthy period of chilly and wet/snowy conditions over The West
with the highest five-day liquid equivalents likely from the OR
Cascades through the Sierra Nevada. Individual shortwaves ejecting
from the upper trough and carried along in fast west-southwesterly
mean flow will support a series of waves/frontal systems to the
east from the CO Rockies, bringing snow to the northern tier and
rain for the central and southern sections of the CONUS.
Predictability for system details has been and probably will
continue to be low. Associated fronts will create a pronounced
temperature contrast, between well above normal readings over the
central and southern sections east o the Rockies and much below
normal temperatures slowly expanding over the northern Plains.

The forecast over The East Saturday night through Sunday remains
fairly uncertain as a wave shifts east from the Great Lakes to off
the Northeast. The 06Z and 12Z GFS remain the strongest with this
system and was thus limited in the model blend for Days 3/4.

Behind this leading system, the next well-defined shortwave
digging into the mean trough should extend nearly the length of
the West Coast by Saturday evening and eject east over the Rockies
through Sunday, bringing a system into the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes Monday. The 06Z/12Z GFS runs remain somewhat weaker and more
suppressed than most other guidance. Then the third wave tracks
east from the Rockies Monday night potentially reaching the Great
Lakes Tuesday night. Uncertainty reigns with the following wave
from the Gulf of Alaska Tuesday/Wednesday with the 06Z/12Z GFS
tracking it off the West Coast, the 00Z CMC stalling it near
Vancouver Island and the 00Z ECMWF over the interior Northwest.

The 00Z UKMET remained slower with the initial wave on Day 3, but
was not much different than the 00Z CMC there, so small
percentages of both were used on Days 3/4 before getting removed
in favor of more 06Z GEFS and 00Z ECENS means. The Days 6/7
forecast is rather uncertain with the trough expanding over the
west from two amplifying shortwaves, so the timing and strength of
these features will come into better focus through the next few
forecast cycles.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Shortwave troughs/energy rounding a persistent upper trough that
drifts inland from the West Coast Saturday through Monday will
periodically enhance the flow of moisture into the West.  Areas of
focused/terrain-enhanced precipitation will extend from the coast
into the Rockies. The best potential for episodes of moderate to
heavy precipitation and highest five-day totals will extend from
the OR Cascades and coastal ranges through central California and
the Sierra Nevada. At lower elevations of OR/CA, the continued
rainfall will increase the soil saturation and sensitivity to
local runoff. Meaningful precipitation will also be likely across
the highest terrain of the Great Basin and the central/northern
Rockies. Colder air filtering into the Pacific Northwest will
bring snow levels for Seattle and Portland to sea level by
Saturday while other parts of the West will also see lowering snow
levels as the upper trough axis nudges eastward.

Generally fast-moving waves will periodically spread precipitation
across the northern tier states and over parts of the East. The
majority of wintry weather should be confined to areas from the
northern Plains through the Great Lakes with some further changes
for New England. Precipitation coverage and amounts remain more
uncertain than desired so continue to monitor forecasts as details
gain better clarity. Depending on position of the mean frontal
boundary over the East and wave details, rainfall could trend
heavier over the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys into the Appalachians by
Tuesday-Wednesday.

The southern Great Plains will be at the center of the greatest
warm temperature anomalies this weekend with decent coverage of
max/min readings 20-30F or so above normal. Such temperatures will
break daily high max records across much of Texas Sunday. This
record setting warm air shifts east Monday/Tuesday with the most
likely max temperature records for the central Gulf coast with
temperature anomalies of plus 20F or greater extending northeast
from there across the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Anomalies should
become somewhat more suppressed and less extreme by next Wednesday
as the mean frontal boundary east of the Rockies pushes a little
farther south. Meanwhile the core of coldest northern tier air
will be over Montana and North Dakota through Monday temperatures
will likely be 20-40F below normal. The leading edge of this cold
airmass will make a gradual southeastward progress across the
central Plains early next week. Western U.S. temperatures will
trend colder with the Northwest seeing expanding coverage of highs
10-25F below normal next Monday-Wednesday. Increasing numbers of
locations along and just inland from the West Coast look see daily
records for low maxima Sunday through Tuesday.

FOR THURSDAY DECEMBER 30 - WEDNESDAY JANUARY 05: The 0z runs of the ECMWF,
GEFS
and Canadian are in good agreement favoring a highly amplified, negative
Pacific North American (PNA) pattern developing during week-1 and extending
into the week-2 period. Much of the outlook perspective centers around stro=
ng
anomalous mid-level troughing favored throughout the western U.S., as this
feature looks to remain the main culprit for multiple temperature, wind and
precipitation related hazards over the CONUS entering into the New Year.
Prevailing northwesterly flow tied to this troughing supports increased
chances
for anomalously cold temperatures across the western North America during t=
he
period. This continues to be reflected in the reforecast tools, which show =
a
broad region with at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling bel=
ow
15th percentile over the western third and north-central CONUS throughout t=
he
period. Many of these areas are anticipated to fall to below 20 deg F, with
the
interior West dropping below 0 deg F, and the north-central tier falling to
below -20 deg F. Compared to yesterday, both the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF
ensembles
show more of a eastward progression of the anomalous troughing into the Upp=
er
Mississippi Valley and into parts of the Great Lakes region, resulting in a=
n
eastward expansion of the slight risk of much below normal temperatures for
week-2 in today's outlook. Similarly, the moderate risk of much below norma=
l
temperatures is expanded eastward in today's outlook where reforecast tools
feature at least 40% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile throughout the northwestern and north-central CONUS during week-=
2.
Embedded within this region, higher probabilities (>60%) exist in the GEFS =
and
ECMWF reforecast tools, but differ in regards to timing during the course o=
f
the outlook period. The ECMWF is far more bullish than the GEFS in prolongi=
ng
the duration of the elevated hazardous cold potential, in part due to the
predicted weakening of the mid-level ridging downstream over the southern a=
nd
southeastern CONUS by the middle of the period. In consideration of the mea=
n
week-2 ECMWF reforecast tool being favored over the GEFS, the high risk of
much
below normal temperatures is extended through the middle portion of week-2
(Jan
2) in today's outlook. For the high risk area highlighted, reforecast tools
continue to maintain increased chances of minimum temperatures falling belo=
w
the lowest climatological percentiles, suggestive of possible near record
minimum temperatures during late December and the beginning of January.



The predicted mid-level troughing across the West is expected to support
enhanced moisture flow over portions of the western half of the CONUS. With
anomalously cold air already expected to be in place by the start of the
period, a pair of slight risk areas of heavy snow remain posted over the
higher
elevations of California and the Pacific Northwest, and farther east over t=
he
Four Corners region where reforecast tools show at least increased chance o=
f
3-day liquid equivalent accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile early i=
n
the period. Due to the reforecast tools indicating at least a 20% chance of
3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding one inch, and higher liquid
equivalent
totals in the raw ensembles over the Southwest, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is continued over the region from Dec 30 to Jan 1.



Farther east, lee cyclogenesis remains favored in the ensembles, as one or
more
surface lows may form over the central CONUS during the period. With return
flow favored along the western periphery of surface high pressure over the
western Atlantic, this increases the potential for heavy precipitation over
the
southeastern CONUS. There is good agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools depicting a region with at least a 20% chance of 3-day
precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch, supporting =
a
slight risk of heavy precipitation from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the
Appalachians (Dec 30-Jan 3).  Heavy snowfall is possible on the backside of
surface lows that form across the Plains and Mississippi Valley; however th=
ere
is insufficient agreement in the model guidance in regards to the timing an=
d
location of this potential, precluding any additional snow related hazards
being posted at this time.



At the base and ahead of the mid-level trough across the West, both reforec=
ast
tools continue to indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding t=
he
85th percentile, with surface analyses depicting strong pressure gradients =
in
the ensemble guidance through the middle of the period. Thus, a slight risk=
 of
high winds remains posted from the Great Basin eastward to the Great Plains=
,
and is extended through the middle portion of week-2 (Jan 3).  Enhanced win=
d
speeds are also possible along portions of the West Coast associated with
surface high pressure descending from the Canadian Prairies into the Interi=
or
West during the period, but this realization is less supported by the
reforecast tools.



Over the Central Pacific, guidance favors another Kona low developing to th=
e
west of the Hawaiian Islands during week-1, with much of the anomalous
mid-level troughing and surface low pressure expected to persist underneath=
 a
highly amplified ridge over the northern Pacific during week-2. This height
pattern is expected to promote above-normal precipitation over the central
Pacific, where reforecast tools show increased chances of precipitation
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile over parts of Hawaii throughout
the
outlook period. A continuation of above-normal and possibly heavy
precipitation
over the Hawaii islands may worsen already saturated soils and trigger
localized flooding due to antecedent rainfall over the Hawaii islands since
early December.



Across Alaska, prevailing northwesterly flow is expected to keep much of
eastern Alaska Mainland and the Panhandle on the cold side during week-2. B=
y
the middle of week-2, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favor the return of
positive mid-level height departures over the Bering Sea, which would help =
to
promote another period of arctic air descending into southeastern Alaska. T=
his
is reflected in the reforecast tools showing increasing probabilities in
excess
of 40% of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile during the
middle of the period, and a moderate risk of much below normal temperatures=
 is
issued from Jan 1 to Jan 3 for portions of the Panhandle. A broader slight
risk
area of much below normal temperatures remains posted over the Alaska
Panhandle
and is extended for the entirety of week-2 in the outlook.

...Active weather with heavy mountain snow and lower elevation
rain will engulf much of the western U.S. over the next couple of
days...

...Snow showers across Great Lakes through Thursday, then rain
mixes in on Friday; windy tonight across New England...

...Persistent warm and dry conditions over the central U.S. with
fire danger over the Front Range...

An active weather period has begun across the West, as a low
pressure system moves into the Pacific Northwest. Moderate to
locally heavy rainfall is likely tonight through Friday for the
lower elevations of the West, while heavy snowfall, currently
impacting the Cascades and Northern Rockies today, will expand
into the Sierra and Central Rockies tomorrow and Christmas Eve.
There's a chance for isolated thunderstorms along the West coast
with this system, but the threat for severe weather remains
marginal. 1-3 feet of snow can be expected across the western
mountains with the highest elevations receiving isolated amounts
of 4-6 feet, especially over the Sierra. Rain moves into Southern
California and the Desert Southwest by Friday where a couple of
inches of rain may cause troublesome travel conditions.

A deep low pressure system will depart into the Canadian maritime
this evening leaving light snow showers and gusty winds across
portions of the Lower Great Lakes and interior Northeast in its
wake. A Winter Storm Warning remains in effect for northern Maine
as a result. A quasi-stationary boundary will form along the Great
Lakes on Thursday and will be the impetus for light snow across
the region before a more dynamic system arrives on Christmas Eve.
Rain will mix in over parts of the Lakes and Ohio Valley while
freezing rain remains a possibility for parts of the Upper Midwest
and North Dakota on Friday.

An upper-ridge will move across the southern tier states over the
next few days. This area of high pressure will cause temperatures
across the Plains and Mississippi Valley to rise significantly
heading into the weekend. Temperatures will be anomalously warm
with highs between 25-35F degrees above average for many areas by
Friday. This translates into upper-60s to mid-80 degree days for
much of this region. A Critical Risk of Fire Weather remains in
effect for parts of the Front Range (southeastern Wyoming into
northwestern Nebraska) tonight, due to increased winds and dry
conditions beneath the area of low pressure moving across southern
Canada. Meanwhile, temperatures will begin to drop along the
Northern Rocky foothills on Friday as the cold front associated
with the aforementioned Canadian system swings through the region.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 28, 2021 - JAN 01, 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
strong ridging over the northern Pacific is forecast, leading to deep
troughing
downstream across the western CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights
extending
northeastward to the western Great Lakes. Anomalous ridging is likely farth=
er
to the south across parts of the Southern Plains and the eastern CONUS in
association with above normal 500-hPa heights.

Above normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased chances of above normal
temperatures across southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, while
below
normal temperatures are favored over parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska =
and
the Panhandle due to the influence of relatively cold surface high pressure
over parts of western Canada. Troughing over the western and north-central
CONUS favors below-normal temperatures over the western and north-central
CONUS. Conversely, ridging over the south-central and eastern CONUS leads t=
o
increased chances of above-normal temperatures from the Southern Plains to =
the
Eastern Seaboard.

Above-normal precipitation is likely for much of Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians related to  mean surface westerly flow predicted over the Bering
Sea.
Mean offshore flow leads to increased chances of below-normal precipitation
across the Alaska Panhandle. The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increa=
ses
chances of above-normal precipitation for the western CONUS and most of the
Great Plains. Above-normal precipitation is favored over the Mississippi
Valley
and the eastern CONUS ahead of the forecast troughing with potential storm
systems developing. Below normal precipitation is favored for the Florida
Peninsula, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 30, 2021 - JAN 05, 2022

The Week-2 forecasts are very similar to the 6-10 day period. There is good
model agreement on most features, which are expected to remain in place but
may
deamplify a bit toward the end of the period. Meanwhile the trough in weste=
rn
CONUS is expected to shift slightly eastward, bringing reduced precipitatio=
n
to
the West Coast.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A very amplified Pacific-into-Alaska upper ridge persists into the
middle of next week and supports a deep upper trough that drifts
east from the West Coast through the Interior West, anchored by a
mean low over northwestern Canada. The trough will maintain a
lengthy period of chilly and wet/snowy conditions over The West
with the highest five-day liquid equivalents likely from the OR
Cascades through the Sierra Nevada. Individual shortwaves ejecting
from the upper trough and carried along in fast west-southwesterly
mean flow will support a series of waves/frontal systems to the
east from the CO Rockies, bringing snow to the northern tier and
rain for the central and southern sections of the CONUS.
Predictability for system details has been and probably will
continue to be low. Associated fronts will create a pronounced
temperature contrast, between well above normal readings over the
central and southern sections east o the Rockies and much below
normal temperatures slowly expanding over the northern Plains.

The forecast over The East Saturday night through Sunday remains
fairly uncertain as a wave shifts east from the Great Lakes to off
the Northeast. The 06Z and 12Z GFS remain the strongest with this
system and was thus limited in the model blend for Days 3/4.

Behind this leading system, the next well-defined shortwave
digging into the mean trough should extend nearly the length of
the West Coast by Saturday evening and eject east over the Rockies
through Sunday, bringing a system into the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes Monday. The 06Z/12Z GFS runs remain somewhat weaker and more
suppressed than most other guidance. Then the third wave tracks
east from the Rockies Monday night potentially reaching the Great
Lakes Tuesday night. Uncertainty reigns with the following wave
from the Gulf of Alaska Tuesday/Wednesday with the 06Z/12Z GFS
tracking it off the West Coast, the 00Z CMC stalling it near
Vancouver Island and the 00Z ECMWF over the interior Northwest.

The 00Z UKMET remained slower with the initial wave on Day 3, but
was not much different than the 00Z CMC there, so small
percentages of both were used on Days 3/4 before getting removed
in favor of more 06Z GEFS and 00Z ECENS means. The Days 6/7
forecast is rather uncertain with the trough expanding over the
west from two amplifying shortwaves, so the timing and strength of
these features will come into better focus through the next few
forecast cycles.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Shortwave troughs/energy rounding a persistent upper trough that
drifts inland from the West Coast Saturday through Monday will
periodically enhance the flow of moisture into the West.  Areas of
focused/terrain-enhanced precipitation will extend from the coast
into the Rockies. The best potential for episodes of moderate to
heavy precipitation and highest five-day totals will extend from
the OR Cascades and coastal ranges through central California and
the Sierra Nevada. At lower elevations of OR/CA, the continued
rainfall will increase the soil saturation and sensitivity to
local runoff. Meaningful precipitation will also be likely across
the highest terrain of the Great Basin and the central/northern
Rockies. Colder air filtering into the Pacific Northwest will
bring snow levels for Seattle and Portland to sea level by
Saturday while other parts of the West will also see lowering snow
levels as the upper trough axis nudges eastward.

Generally fast-moving waves will periodically spread precipitation
across the northern tier states and over parts of the East. The
majority of wintry weather should be confined to areas from the
northern Plains through the Great Lakes with some further changes
for New England. Precipitation coverage and amounts remain more
uncertain than desired so continue to monitor forecasts as details
gain better clarity. Depending on position of the mean frontal
boundary over the East and wave details, rainfall could trend
heavier over the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys into the Appalachians by
Tuesday-Wednesday.

The southern Great Plains will be at the center of the greatest
warm temperature anomalies this weekend with decent coverage of
max/min readings 20-30F or so above normal. Such temperatures will
break daily high max records across much of Texas Sunday. This
record setting warm air shifts east Monday/Tuesday with the most
likely max temperature records for the central Gulf coast with
temperature anomalies of plus 20F or greater extending northeast
from there across the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Anomalies should
become somewhat more suppressed and less extreme by next Wednesday
as the mean frontal boundary east of the Rockies pushes a little
farther south. Meanwhile the core of coldest northern tier air
will be over Montana and North Dakota through Monday temperatures
will likely be 20-40F below normal. The leading edge of this cold
airmass will make a gradual southeastward progress across the
central Plains early next week. Western U.S. temperatures will
trend colder with the Northwest seeing expanding coverage of highs
10-25F below normal next Monday-Wednesday. Increasing numbers of
locations along and just inland from the West Coast look see daily
records for low maxima Sunday through Tuesday.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to indicate a highly amplified
Pacific-into-Alaska upper ridge to persist into the middle of next
week and support a deep upper trough that drifts east from the
West Coast through the Interior West, anchored by a piece of the
polar vortex that dips toward southern Canada.  The trough will
maintain a lengthy period of chilly and wet/snowy conditions over
The West with the highest precipitation amount from the Oregon
Cascades down through the Sierra Nevada.  Individual shortwaves
ejecting from the upper trough and carried along in fast
west-southwesterly mean flow will support a series of
waves/frontal systems to develop over the central Plains and then
track quickly toward the Great Lakes.  Predictability for system
details has been and probably will continue to be low.  The polar
vortex extension in Canada will likely support intrusion of arctic
into the northern Plains.  This will be contrasted with well above
normal readings over the Deep South into the eastern U.S. to the
south of the general storm track.

The WPC medium-range forecasts were composed based on a blend of
40% from the 18Z GFS/GEFS, 40% from the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, and 20%
from the CMC CMC mean.  An even blend of the deterministic and
ensemble solutions was used for Days 3 to 5 where model spread was
at manageable levels.  By Day 6, the deterministic solutions begin
to diverge while the corresponding ensemble means remain
compatible with one another.  A higher percentage of the ensemble
means was therefore incorporated for Days 6 and 7.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Shortwave troughs/energy rounding a persistent upper trough that
drifts inland from the West Coast Saturday through Monday will
periodically enhance the flow of moisture into the West.  Areas of
focused/terrain-enhanced precipitation will extend from the coast
into the Rockies. The best potential for episodes of moderate to
heavy precipitation and highest precipitation totals will extend
from the Oregon Cascades and coastal ranges down through central
California and the Sierra Nevada.  At lower elevations of OR/CA,
the continued rainfall will increase the soil saturation and
sensitivity to local runoff.  Meaningful precipitation will also
be likely across the highest terrain of the Great Basin and the
central/northern Rockies. Colder air filtering into the Pacific
Northwest will bring snow levels for Seattle and Portland to sea
level by Saturday while other parts of the West will also see
lowering snow levels as the upper trough axis nudges inland.

Generally fast-moving waves will periodically spread precipitation
across the northern tier states and over parts of the East.  The
majority of wintry weather should be confined to areas from the
northern Plains through the Great Lakes with some further changes
for New England.  The first round of wintry weather should be from
the holiday weekend into Monday.  A second round should follow on
Tuesday but model solution diverges regarding the associated low
pressure system tracking toward the Great Lakes.  Precipitation
coverage and amounts remain more uncertain than desired so
continue to monitor forecasts as details gain better clarity.
Farther south, there continues to be meaningful model signal for
an axis of enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley near/north of
a meandering front for early next week.

The southern Great Plains will be at the center of the greatest
warm temperature anomalies this weekend with decent coverage of
max/min readings 20-30F or so above normal.  Such temperatures
will at record levels across much of Texas on Sunday.  This record
setting warmth will shift east Monday/Tuesday with the most likely
max temperature records for the central Gulf coast with
temperature anomalies of plus 20F or greater extending northeast
from there across the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys.  Anomalies should
become somewhat more suppressed and less extreme by next Wednesday
as the mean frontal boundary east of the Rockies pushes a little
farther south.  Meanwhile the core of coldest northern tier air
will be over Montana and North Dakota through Monday temperatures
will likely be 20-40F below normal.  The leading edge of this cold
airmass will make a gradual southeastward progress across the
central Plains early next week. Western U.S. temperatures will
trend colder with the Northwest seeing expanding coverage of highs
10-25F below normal next Monday-Wednesday.  Increasing numbers of
locations along and just inland from the West Coast look see daily
records for low maxima Sunday through Tuesday.  The warmth in the
south with be in stark contrast with the frigid sub-zero readings
in the northern Plains.

focused/terrain-enhanced precipitation will extend from the coast
into the Rockies. The best potential for episodes of moderate to
heavy precipitation and highest precipitation totals will extend
from the Oregon Cascades and coastal ranges down through central
California and the Sierra Nevada.  At lower elevations of OR/CA,
the continued rainfall will increase the soil saturation and
sensitivity to local runoff.  Meaningful precipitation will also
be likely across the highest terrain of the Great Basin and the
central/northern Rockies. Colder air filtering into the Pacific
Northwest will bring snow levels for Seattle and Portland to sea
level by Saturday while other parts of the West will also see
lowering snow levels as the upper trough axis nudges inland.

Generally fast-moving waves will periodically spread precipitation
across the northern tier states and over parts of the East.  The
majority of wintry weather should be confined to areas from the
northern Plains through the Great Lakes with some further changes
for New England.  The first round of wintry weather should be from
the holiday weekend into Monday.  A second round should follow on
Tuesday but model solution diverges regarding the associated low
pressure system tracking toward the Great Lakes.  Precipitation
coverage and amounts remain more uncertain than desired so
continue to monitor forecasts as details gain better clarity.
Farther south, there continues to be meaningful model signal for
an axis of enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley near/north of
a meandering front for early next week.

The southern Great Plains will be at the center of the greatest
warm temperature anomalies this weekend with decent coverage of
max/min readings 20-30F or so above normal.  Such temperatures
will at record levels across much of Texas on Sunday.  This record
setting warmth will shift east Monday/Tuesday with the most likely
max temperature records for the central Gulf coast with
temperature anomalies of plus 20F or greater extending northeast
from there across the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys.  Anomalies should
become somewhat more suppressed and less extreme by next Wednesday
as the mean frontal boundary east of the Rockies pushes a little
farther south.  Meanwhile the core of coldest northern tier air
will be over Montana and North Dakota through Monday with with
frigid sub-zero temperatures which are 20-40+F below normal.  The
leading edge of this cold airmass will make a gradual
southeastward progress across the central Plains early next week.
Western U.S. temperatures will trend colder with the Northwest
seeing expanding coverage of highs 10-25F below normal next
Monday-Wednesday.  Increasing numbers of locations along and just
inland from the West Coast could see daily records for low maxima
Sunday through Tuesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 AM CST Thu Dec 23 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough is expected to amplify while progressing east
across the Interior West, encouraging surface lee-trough
intensification along the lee of the Rockies today. Breezy, dry
conditions are expected across the central and southern High Plains,
where critically dry fuels will foster a wildfire-spread threat.

Elevated highlights remain in place across parts of northeast
Colorado, where 15 mph southerly surface winds and 20 percent RH are
expected to coincide for at least a few hours during the afternoon.
Broader Elevated highlights have also been maintained across eastern
New Mexico into west Texas, where a broad swath of overlapping 10-15
mph westerly surface winds and 15-20 percent RH are likely. While
the surface winds may struggle to sustain above 15 mph in both
Elevated areas, the low RH and very dry fine fuels are expected to
compensate to support Elevated fire-weather conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0148 AM CST Thu Dec 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
Surface lee troughing will continue to intensify to the lee of the
Rockies as a mid-level trough impinges on the central U.S.
tomorrow/Friday. Modestly dry but windy conditions are expected
south of a cold front across the southern High Plains, where at
least some wildfire-spread concerns exist given very receptive fine
fuels in place. An Elevated area has been introduced to account for
widespread 25-30 mph sustained westerly winds, though RH may only
dip to 25 percent in spots by afternoon peak heating. Despite the
modestly dry air, the very strong winds atop critically dry fuels
are still expected to support high-end Elevated fire-weather
conditions for at least a few hours tomorrow afternoon. If guidance
trends any lower with RH, Critical highlights may be added in future
outlooks.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
251 AM EST Thu Dec 23 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Dec 23 2021 - 12Z Sat Dec 25 2021

...An active pattern will bring heavy mountain snow and
flood-inducing lower elevation rain to the western U.S. into the
weekend...

...Snow showers expected across the Great Lakes and Northeast
Thursday before switching to a rain/snow mix on Friday...

...Persistent warm and dry conditions over the central U.S. will
generate fire weather concerns over the Front Range on Thursday...

Throughout the short-range period much of the activity over the
CONUS will be focused over the western U.S. as multiple features
impact the region simultaneously. One such feature is a moderately
strong atmospheric river, which is transporting anomalously high
amounts of atmospheric moisture onshore by way of southern
California. Along the low lying coastal regions this anomalous
moisture will translate into heavy rainfall over the next couple
days, with some locations, including the terrain adjacent to the
Los Angeles and San Diego metro areas, forecast to receive 1 to 3+
inches of rain in 24 hours. Given the potential for flash flooding
as well as runoff over nearby burn scarred and hydrologically
sensitive areas, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight
Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of southwestern California
through Saturday morning. Further north, a cold front forecast to
move onshore this morning and progress slowly through the
Intermountain West over the next couple of days will interact with
the moisture supplied by the atmospheric river to produce heavy
snowfall over the high elevation terrain from the Cascades to the
Rockies. Over the Sierra Nevada there is potential for 5+ feet of
snow to accumulate through Christmas morning, while more moderate
totals of around 1 to 4 feet are expected across the rest of the
western mountain ranges. In preparation for the snow and potential
for hazardous travel conditions, a menagerie of Winter Storm
Watches and Warnings as well as Winter Weather Advisories have
been put into effect throughout the western U.S.

Meanwhile, a tight pressure gradient is forecast to develop on the
lee-side of the Rockies later today, generating strong winds with
gusts up to and exceeding 65 mph, particularly in the Southern
High Plains. Given the potential for these winds to be damaging,
blow down trees, cause power outages, and make travel hazardous,
High Wind Watches and Warnings have been put into for portions of
the Central/Southern Rockies and the High Plains. In addition to
the aforementioned hazards, strong winds can also contribute to
the spread of wildfires where very dry fuels are present and low
relative humidity values are expected. This combination of
conditions is forecast to occur over the Central/Southern High
Plains today, prompting the issuance of an Elevated Risk of Fire
Weather by the the Storm Prediction Center.

To the east, a quasi-stationary boundary extending through the
Great Lakes will be the focus for the development of light snow
from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast through Friday morning. As
a warm front approaches from the southwest a rain/snow mix will
emerge, allowing for freezing rain to form and a thin layer of ice
to accumulate over portions of the Upper Midwest, New York, and
southern New England.

To end the work week a warm, dry pattern will set up over the
central U.S., allowing daily high temperatures across the Plains
and Mississippi Valley to raise significantly. The greatest
departures from normal will likely be felt over the Southern
Plains, where temperature anomalies of 25 to 30 degrees above
normal are expected on Friday, translating to highs in the 70s and
80s. Conversely, temperatures along the East and West coasts are
forecast to be near or moderately below normal.

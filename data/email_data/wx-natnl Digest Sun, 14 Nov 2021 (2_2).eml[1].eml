...Heavy rain and mountain snow resumes over the Pacific
Northwest....

...An Alberta clipper will deliver rain/snow and gusty winds
across the Great Lakes today and then New England on Monday...

...Another Alberta clipper will bring light rain/snow for the
northern Plains to upper Midwest into Monday morning...

...A much stronger storm will spread mountain snows and high winds
across the northern Rockies to northern High Plains Monday night
to Tuesday...

A compact low pressure center that brought a quick dose of rain,
high elevation snow, and gusty winds through New England last
night is quickly moving off into the Canadian Maritimes early this
morning.  Clearing skies will quickly move into the Northeast
today as mixed rain and snow from an Alberta clipper moving across
the upper Midwest this morning spreads into the Great Lakes.
While the mixed rain and snow associated with this system will
mainly be light, its coverage will be widespread as the clipper
tracks across the Great Lakes today and then across New England on
Monday.  The western slopes of the central Appalachians will
likely see a few inches of snow while the lee side of the lower
Great Lakes should see locally higher amounts on Monday when
colder air  will be dragged across the warm lake waters behind the
system.  By Tuesday morning, the clipper should have moved far
away into the Canadian Maritimes that the lake-effect rain/snow
and mixed precipitation over interior New England will be tapering
off.

Over the Pacific Northwest, heavy rain has resumed as another
moist plume of Pacific air arrives well ahead of an active warm
front.  While it appears that this round of heavy precipitation
will be confined to the northwestern portion of Washington state,
the unrelenting surge of moisture will lead to a slight risk of
flash flooding today especially for the higher elevations of
northwestern Washington state.  A much stronger low pressure
system is forecast to form across British Columbia on Monday and
will likely move into Alberta, Canada by Tuesday morning.  Colder
air will be ushered into the Pacific Northwest with heavy snow
spreading into the Cascades.  The higher elevations of the
northern Cascades will likely see up to a couple of feet of heavy
snow.  In addition, high winds will overspread the Pacific
Northwest, northern Rockies, followed by the northern High Plains
Monday night into Tuesday when the low pressure system intensifies
very rapidly.  This system will also bring lighter amounts of
rain/snow across the northern Rockies Monday night into Tuesday.

Over the northern Plains to the upper Midwest, another Alberta
clipper is forecast to bring a round of light rain/snow across the
northern Plains to upper Midwest today into Monday morning before
the clipper is absorbed by the rapidly intensifying storm over
southwestern Canada.

The entire western U.S. will remain milder than normal for the
next couple of days before much colder air rushes into the Pacific
Northwest behind the big storm later on Monday.  Meanwhile, much
milder than normal conditions are expected over the northern High
Plains on Monday as warm downslope flow develops behind the
Alberta clipper.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1005 AM CDT Wed Oct 20 2021

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track. Morning surface observations show
gusty winds in the wake of a cold front across the central Plains.
However, cool temperatures are supporting high RH, which will
largely be maintained through the day as modest cold air advection
continues. Localized elevated conditions may evolve within the
higher terrain of the southern Rockies and perhaps southern Great
Basin, but will remain too brief and localized for highlights.

..Moore.. 10/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1151 PM CDT Tue Oct 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move from the Mid-Missouri Valley into the
Upper Midwest today. In the West, low-amplitude ridging will build.
At the surface, a cold front will progress to near the Ohio Valley,
arcing southwestward into the southern Plains. Warm and dry
conditions are likely in parts of the Great Basin and Southwest.
Fire weather concerns across the CONUS appear minimal through the
period as light winds and poorly receptive fuels are expected where
the driest conditions are forecast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0129 PM CDT Wed Oct 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track with most guidance showing low
probabilities for fire weather concerns. Any elevated conditions
that do develop will most likely be confined to the immediate lee of
the southern Rockies, but will remain very localized. See the
previous discussion below for details.

..Moore.. 10/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1153 PM CDT Tue Oct 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
For Thursday, upper-level ridging across the West is forecast to
amplify while broad cyclonic flow aloft will develop across the
eastern third of the U.S. At the surface, a similar, but weaker,
pressure pattern to Wednesday is expected. Cooler air will exist
across much of the Plains and into the East. Warm and dry conditions
are still expected in parts of the Great Basin and Southwest.
However, light winds and otherwise poorly receptive fuels will keep
fire weather concerns very low.

Valid 12Z Sat Oct 23 2021 - 12Z Wed Oct 27 2021

...Multi-day Heavy Rainfall and Mountain Snow Threat over the
West...

...Overview...

It remains highly likely that an active storm track over the
eastern Pacific in association with an anomalous upper level
trough will result in multiple rounds of impactful weather for the
West Coast and extending well inland across the Intermountain West
and Rockies. Lead shortwave impulses and weather focusing surface
lows/fronts will eject eastward across the Plains and then the
Midwest states and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, with the main upper
level trough/wavy front reaching the Plains by mid next week.
Elsewhere across the eastern U.S., a surface high should be in
place after the cold front exits the coast on Friday, followed by
an upper ridge axis developing ahead of the central-western U.S.
trough by the end of the forecast period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Despite high likelihood of the impending heavy precipitation event
over the West, it has become increasingly evident that run to run
model continuity has become increasingly problematic with local
focus with the protracted series of dynamic Pacific systems to
slam into the West Coast and subsequently progress downstream over
the central and eastern states. The GEFS/ECMWF ensembles show the
forecast spread, but at least the means are in good agreement and
provide good WPC product continuity. The 12 UTC model suite has
overall trended toward these means, but in particular the
GFS/Canadian.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of enhanced rains
are expected from Washington through especially California that
will likely be heavy at times with moist onshore flow ahead of
multiple Pacific storm systems. This will especially hold true for
Sunday and into Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume
shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest across California as
part of an atmospheric river event. Some locations may get on the
order of 4 to 8+ inches of rain over the entire forecast period,
particularly across favored windward terrain which may result in
some instances of runoff issues and/or flooding. Burn scars will
also be especially vulnerable. Heavy snows are likely for the
higher elevations of the Cascades and Sierra, with over a foot of
accumulation possible. Snow levels are expected to lower Sunday
into Monday as the core of the upper trough moves inland. Strong
winds are also possible for the coast and along the mountain
ridges.

Some of this moisture is expected to reach the Intermountain West
and the central/northern Rockies with significant snowfall for
some of these areas, with a cold front reaching the Plains by
Tuesday. Across the central to eastern U.S., a less certain but
wavy lead front lifting northward across portions of the
Midwest/Mid-Atlantic this weekend and into next week is expected
to produce scattered to numerous showers with the potential for a
few convective complexes that offer potential for locally heavy
downpours/runoff issues, especially over the Midwest.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region, with highs
running up to 15 degrees above normal ahead of the cold front.
Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for the West Coast,
influenced by the upper trough and mainly overcast skies with
highs decreasing to 10-20 degrees below normal.

...Multi-day Heavy Rainfall and Mountain Snow Threat over the
West...

...Overview...

It remains highly likely that an active storm track over the
eastern Pacific in association with an anomalous upper level
trough will result in multiple rounds of impactful weather for the
West Coast and extending well inland across the Intermountain West
and Rockies. Lead shortwave impulses and weather focusing surface
lows/fronts will eject eastward across the Plains and then the
Midwest states and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, with the main upper
level trough/wavy front reaching the Plains by mid next week.
Elsewhere across the eastern U.S., a surface high should be in
place after the cold front exits the coast on Friday, followed by
an upper ridge axis developing ahead of the central-western U.S.
trough by the end of the forecast period.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed October 20 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 26 - 30 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 6z GEFS, 0z ECMWF, and 0z Canadian ensemb=
les continue to depict
anomalous troughing stretching from Alaska into the Northeast Pacific and
western CONUS at the start of the 6-10 day period. This troughing is predic=
ted
to begin to lift out and retrograde, with model guidance indicating enhance=
d
ridging developing over the Southwest by the middle of the period. Ridging =
is
also initially forecast over the eastern half of the CONUS, but is forecast=
 to
be short-lived in most areas as all of the models have trended stronger wit=
h
shortwave troughing forecast to progress across the CONUS during the period=
,
with the deterministic 6z GFS and 0z ECMWF solutions depicting a highly
amplified trough digging into the eastern CONUS by the end of the period.
Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa height blend favors the en=
semble means, which are not
as
amplified as the deterministic runs, although they all depict a shift towar=
d
lower mid-level heights in the East compared with the enhanced ridging that
was
forecast yesterday. The manual blend now depicts near to below normal 500-h=
Pa
heights across most of the CONUS, with above normal heights favored across =
the
Southwest and southern High Plains due to the ridging favored to develop, a=
nd
also for parts of the Northeast due to the initial ridging becoming more
focused over the region.

Troughing and associated negative height anomalies forecast over the
northwestern CONUS favor increased probabilities for below normal temperatu=
res
west of the Rockies. Due to the enhanced ridging predicted downstream
initially, probabilities for above normal temperatures are elevated for muc=
h
of
the CONUS east of the Rockies, with the highest probabilities (greater than
60%) over parts of the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley. Max temperature
anomalies of 10-15 deg F are indicated over much of the east-central CONUS =
on
day-6, but moderation is favored thereafter as troughing builds across the
region. Increased chances of near to below normal temperatures are indicate=
d
for most of Alaska due to the amplified troughing forecast across the state=
.
The exception is over the northeastern Mainland, where increased probabilit=
ies
for above normal temperatures are depicted as a result of the increased
easterly flow forecast, resulting in enhanced positive temperature advectio=
n
of
the relatively warmer temperatures forecast downstream over Canada. This is
supported by both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools.

Troughing off the West Coast of the CONUS favors elevated probabilities of
above normal precipitation across much of the western CONUS. Atmospheric ri=
ver
guidance from both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict enhanced integrated
vapor transport from the Pacific. As the troughing retreats, the axis of
heaviest precipitation is forecast to shift more northward and a drying tre=
nd
is favored for the Southwest and southern California where there is a tilt
toward increased chances for near to below normal precipitation for the per=
iod
as a whole. Shortwave troughing forecast to traverse the CONUS favors enhan=
ced
frontal activity and potential surface low pressure developing over the
central
or eastern CONUS during the period, resulting in elevated chances for above
normal precipitation over much of the eastern half of the CONUS. Increased
ridging forecast across parts of the Southwest and southern High Plains fav=
ors
enhanced probabilities for below normal precipitation over these regions.
Enhanced odds of near to below normal precipitation are favored across much=
 of
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, displaced far enough from the mean storm
track. Increased probabilities for above normal precipitation are indicated
for
the Panhandle and southeastern Mainland as the axis of enhanced mid-level
moisture flow shifts farther to the north.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, given
overall
good model agreement, offset by higher amplitude troughing depicted in the
East
later in the period compared to yesterday.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 28 - NOV 03, 2021

Dynamical model guidance is slightly more amplified compared to yesterday i=
n
regards to the mean week-2 500-hPa height pattern. Weak ridging is forecast
across the interior western and central CONUS as the amplified troughing
initially over the region early in the 6-10 day period continues to retreat
over the Northeast Pacific. The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models all indica=
te
negative 500-hPa height anomalies across the eastern half of the CONUS, a
significant shift from yesterday, resulting from stronger troughing predict=
ed
over the region. As in the 6-10 day period, the deterministic 6z GFS and 0z
ECMWF are the most amplified with troughing in the East with the ensemble
means
less robust. For the week-2 period as a whole, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDs 500-hPa manual height
blend depicts negative height anomalies across the northwestern CONUS and m=
ost
of Alaska. Near to above normal heights are indicated for the Southwest
including most of California, the Rockies, and Great Plains, with slightly
below normal heights forecast across much of the eastern CONUS.

The troughing in the Northeast Pacific is forecast to continue to result in
enhanced probabilities of near to below normal temperatures over most of th=
e
western third of the CONUS. Increased ridging favors elevated chances for
above
normal temperatures expanding across the Rockies, Great Plains, and
Mississippi
Valley, with the highest probabilities (greater than 60%) depicted across
parts
of eastern New England underneath anomalous southwesterly mid-level flow. T=
he
reasoning for the temperature forecast across Alaska remains the same as in
the
6-10 day outlook, with generally increased probabilities for near to below
normal temperatures favored across most of the state due to the troughing
overhead, with portions of the northeastern Mainland maintaining a slight t=
ilt
toward enhanced above normal temperature probabilities due to continuing wa=
rm
advection.

Increased probabilities for above normal precipitation remain in place over
much of the northwestern quadrant of the CONUS due to continued atmospheric
river activity, although models suggest a gradual weakening of the integrat=
ed
vapor transport flux, along with a northward shift of the strongest mid-lev=
el
flow. This will favor relatively dry conditions across the Southwest, with
increased ridging resulting in a more expansive area of increased
probabilities
for below normal precipitation compared to yesterday, which includes the
Southwest, Four Corners Region, Central and Southern Rockies, and much of t=
he
Great Plains and Mississippi Valley. Troughing downstream favors enhanced
probabilities of near to above normal precipitation for the eastern third o=
f
the CONUS, with increased potential for frontal precipitation or surface lo=
w
development, with some uncertainty related to the overall magnitude of the
trough axis. The northward shift of the mid-level flow pattern across the
Pacific favors elevated probabilities for above normal precipitation across
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, with near to below normal
precipitation probabilities elevated across the remainder of the state. The
precipitation forecast across the CONUS and Alaska is generally consistent
with
both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...Back to back Pacific storms to bring heavy rain and mountain
snow to Northern California and the Pacific Northwest...

...Severe thunderstorms possible in association with a mature low
pressure system bringing rain to the Midwest, Eastern Seaboard,
and parts of the Southern Plains through Friday...

...Moderately warm temperatures expected in the East, cooler over
the Norther Plains and along the West Coast...

A series of Pacific storms will move onshore over northern
California and the Pacific Northwest during the latter half of the
work week, bringing some much needed rain to the regions. The
first, which had already pushed itself ashore earlier today, will
predominantly generate modest rainfall throughout northern
California and to the west of the Oregon and Washington Cascades.
Any snowfall will be isolated to higher elevations, particularly
above 5000 ft in the Cascades and above 8000 ft in the northern
Sierra Nevada. Precipitation will quickly diminish overnight as
the system rapidly decays, providing a brief reprieve before the
approach of the second storm on Thursday morning. Carrying within
it an abundance of moisture in the form of a moderately strong
Atmospheric River, this second system will deliver a considerably
greater amount of rain to the area, particularly in northern
California. While a welcome sight in light of the ongoing drought,
periods of heavy rainfall could be cause for concern, especially
in the mountainous areas of northern California riddled with burn
scars. Given the potential for rapid runoff and debris flows in
these sensitive areas, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of northern
California effective Thursday morning through Friday morning. In
addition to the rain some isolated heavy snowfall will be possible
over portions of the Cascades, Olympics, and northern Sierra
Nevada, with Mt. Shasta possibly receiving nearly 2 ft of snow.

Further east, a deepening low pressure system is moving through
the Upper Midwest, with its trailing cold front passing through
the Middle Mississippi Valley and the Southern Plains. Showers and
thunderstorms will remain primarily focused around the low
pressure center and its associated cold front as they progress
east, lift north into Canada Thursday evening, and move offshore
late Friday. Rainfall rates and totals are expected to be
relatively moderate with this system, however, the risk for the
development of severe thunderstorms will persist through Friday
morning. The areas at greatest risk for severe weather overnight
include southern Minnesota and northern Iowa, where a Marginal
Risk has been issued due to the possible formation of large hail.
On Thursday the severe weather potential will move east with the
progression of the storm system into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys
and Central/Southern Appalachians, where a Marginal Risk has been
issued to account for the possible development of isolated strong
to damaging wind gusts. Another Marginal Risk area has also been
put in place over west Texas, where any storms that form may pose
a hail and strong/gusty wind threat.

Temperatures will generally remain near or moderately above normal
throughout the country during the short range period. Exceptions
to this trend include regions that fall immediately behind the
progressing low pressure system and the West Coast. The former
will experience marginal to modest temperature drops as cool
Canadian air is ushered in behind the deepening low. The most
extreme anomalies are expected in the Northern Plains, where daily
highs are forecast to drop into the 40s, falling 20 degrees below
normal. As for the West Coast, persistent cloud cover from the
series of systems moving onshore will generally keep the region 10
to 15 degrees cooler than average for this time of year.

...Multi-day Heavy Rainfall and Mountain Snow Threat over the
West...
...Heavy Rainfall Threat over the Midwest...


...Overview...

It remains highly likely that an active storm track over the
eastern Pacific in association with an anomalous upper level
trough will result in multiple rounds of impactful weather for the
West Coast and extending well inland across the Intermountain West
and Rockies. Lead shortwave impulses and weather focusing surface
lows/fronts will eject eastward across the Plains and then the
Midwest states and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, with the main upper
level trough/wavy front reaching the Plains by mid next week.
Elsewhere across the eastern U.S., a surface high should be in
place after the cold front exits the coast on Friday, followed by
an upper ridge axis developing ahead of the central-western U.S.
trough by the end of the forecast period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Despite high likelihood of the impending heavy precipitation event
over the West, it has become increasingly evident that run to run
model continuity has become increasingly problematic with local
focus with the protracted series of dynamic Pacific systems to
slam into the West Coast and subsequently progress downstream over
the central and eastern states. The GEFS/ECMWF ensembles show the
forecast spread, but at least the means are in good agreement and
provide good WPC product continuity. The 12 UTC model suite has
overall trended toward these means, but in particular the
GFS/Canadian.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of enhanced rains
are expected from Washington through especially California that
will likely be heavy at times with moist onshore flow ahead of
multiple Pacific storm systems. This will especially hold true for
Sunday and into Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume
shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest across California as
part of an atmospheric river event. Some locations may get on the
order of 4 to 8+ inches of rain over the entire forecast period,
particularly across favored windward terrain which may result in
some instances of runoff issues and/or flooding. Burn scars will
also be especially vulnerable. Heavy snows are likely for the
higher elevations of the Cascades and Sierra, with over a foot of
accumulation possible. Snow levels are expected to lower Sunday
into Monday as the core of the upper trough moves inland. Strong
winds are also possible for the coast and along the mountain
ridges.

Some of this moisture is expected to reach the Intermountain West
and the central/northern Rockies with significant snowfall for
some of these areas, with a cold front reaching the Plains and MS
Valley Tuesday into Wednesday that may present an emerging and
expanding lead rainfall/convective focus. Across the central to
eastern U.S., a less certain but wavy lead front lifting northward
across portions of the Midwest/Mid-Atlantic this weekend and into
next week is expected to produce scattered to numerous showers
with the potential for a few convective complexes that offer
potential for locally heavy downpours/runoff issues, especially
over the Midwest.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region, with highs
running up to 15 degrees above normal ahead of the cold front.
Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for the West Coast,
influenced by the upper trough and mainly overcast skies with
highs decreasing to 10-20 degrees below normal.

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough in the upper Midwest will continue east today.
Broad cyclonic flow will develop through the period across much of
the eastern third of the CONUS. Within the intermountain region,
upper-level ridging will remain while an amplified upper trough
moves toward the Pacific Northwest. At the surface, a cold front
will move toward the east coast. Slower frontal progression will
occur in the southern Plains and Southeast. While areas of dry
conditions are expected from the southern Great Basin into the
Southwest, light winds and broad areas of poorly receptive fuels
will keep fire weather concerns low.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging across the central CONUS will lose some
amplitude on Friday. Cyclonic flow will increase to the east and
west of the upper ridge. At the surface, a cold front will move into
the central Great Basin by the end of the period. A slightly
better-defined surface lee trough in the Plains will allow some
breezy conditions to develop along with increased moisture. While
dry and windy conditions are likely ahead of the cold front in the
southern Great Basin, poorly receptive fuels will keep fire concerns
low. A narrow zone of dry westerly winds in eastern New Mexico may
develop to the west of better low-level moisture. However, winds
still appear likely to remain at or below 15 mph and peak for a
short duration.

...Multi-day Heavy Rainfall and Mountain Snow Threat over the
West...
...Heavy Rainfall Threat over the Midwest...


...Overview...

A quite active storm track over the eastern Pacific in association
with an anomalous upper level trough will result in multiple
rounds of impactful weather for the West Coast and extending well
inland across the Intermountain West and Rockies this weekend into
early next week. Lead shortwave impulses and convection focusing
surface lows/fronts will eject eastward across the Plains and then
the Midwest states and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic to the western
Atlantic, with the main upper level trough/wavy front reaching an
increasingly wet central to east-central U.S. into next Wed/Thu.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Despite high likelihood overall of the impending heavy
precipitation event over the West, run to run model continuity has
been problematic with local focus with the protracted series of
dynamic Pacific systems to slam into the West Coast and
subsequently progress downstream over the central and eastern U.S.
well into next week. Variability in the latest few model runs
seems be be slowly improving, mainly during the first half of this
forecast period, but recent GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means along with
the National Blend of Models remain much more run to run
compatible through medium range time scales and the latest were
primarily used to derive the WPC product suite. This also acts to
maintain good WPC product continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A lead and wavy lead front across portions of the
Midwest/Mid-Atlantic then western Atlantic this weekend and into
next week is expected to produce scattered to numerous showers
with the potential for a few convective complexes that offer
potential for locally heavy downpours/runoff issues, especially
over the Midwest Sunday to the Mid-Atlantic/New England Monday
with coastal low development. Forecast spread with this feature is
gradually decreasing with recent guidance runs, bolstering
forecast confidence to a degree.

Meanwhile across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of
enhanced rains are expected from the Pacific Northwest through
especially California that will likely be heavy at times with
moist onshore flow ahead of multiple Pacific storm systems. This
will especially hold true for Sunday and into Monday as a deep and
long fetch moisture plume shifts southward from the Pacific
Northwest across California as part of an atmospheric river event.
Some locations may get on the order of 4 to 8+ inches of rain over
the entire forecast period, particularly across favored windward
terrain which may result in some instances of runoff issues and/or
flooding. Burn scars will also be especially vulnerable. Heavy
snows are likely for the higher elevations of the Cascades and
Sierra, with multiple feet of max accumulation possible. Snow
levels are expected to lower Sunday into Monday as the core of the
upper trough moves inland. Strong winds are also possible for the
coast and inland, especially along mountain ridges. Some of this
moisture is expected to reach the Intermountain West and the
central/northern Rockies with significant snowfall for some of
these areas as shown in the WPC Winter Weather Outlook linked
below. The main associated cold front reaching the Plains by
Tuesday and onward across the east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday
that is expected to present an emerging and expanding lead
rainfall/convective focus. Additional upstream Pacific system
approaches should meanwhile keep an active pattern with periods
with enhanced precipitation chances going into the Pacific
Northwest well into next week.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region, with highs
running up to 15 degrees above normal ahead of the cold front.
Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for the West Coast,
influenced by the upper trough and mainly overcast skies with
highs decreasing to 10-20+ degrees below normal.

...Powerful Pacific storm to deliver heavy rain and gusty winds to
the Pacific Northwest, Slight Risks for Excessive Rainfall in
Northern California and far southwestern Oregon today...

...Severe thunderstorms possible in some eastern regions due to a
low pressure system tracking through the Great Lakes today;
scattered thunderstorms also possible in portions of the Southern
Plains today and Friday...

...Abnormally warm conditions in the Rockies and High Plains; warm
day along the East Coast today gives way to cooler temps by week's
end; cooler in the Midwest and along the West Coast...

A rapidly deepening cyclone in the northeast Pacific responsible
for the development of an atmospheric river aimed at the West
Coast and coastal British Columbia is set to produce unsettled
weather that will arrive in the Pacific Northwest later today. The
bouts of rain are a sight for sore eyes in the drought stricken
areas of the Northwest with beneficial rainfall totals ranging
between 2 to 5 inches in the higher elevations of Northern
California and southwestern Oregon. However, locally heavy
rainfall rates atop burn scarred areas could lead to flash
flooding, rapid runoff, and debris flows in these locations.
Slight Risks for Excessive Rainfall have been issued for a handful
of areas in Northern California and far southwestern Oregon along
with Flash Flood Watches in parts of the northern Sierra Nevada.
As the upper low associated with this Pacific storm moves ashore
Thursday night, snow levels will drop throughout the night and
into Friday as it also aids in pushing precipitation farther
inland. Despite the falling snow levels, snow totals will
generally be light with the lone exceptions being the highest
peaks of mountain ranges that include the northern Sierra Nevada,
the Shastas, and the Cascades. As the storm system pushes into the
northern Rockies and gradually weakens, the next Pacific low
pressure system is hot on its heels as it ushers in more unsettled
weather into the Pacific Northwest on Saturday.

Meanwhile, a vigorous upper level disturbance in the Midwest early
this morning will track east underneath a large upper low spinning
over northern Ontario. The surface low is forecast to strengthen
as it tracks through the Great Lakes and its associated cold front
sweeps across the Ohio Valley and Mid-South. Thunderstorms firing
out ahead of the cold front could be severe, prompting the Storm
Prediction Center to issue a Marginal risk for severe weather from
the eastern Great Lakes on south into the Tennessee Valley. Severe
storms are also possible in West Texas where a modestly unstable
air-mass will be in place. After spotty showers and thunderstorms
track through the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Thursday night, the
cold front reaches the East Coast by Friday afternoon. Some severe
storms could occur in eastern North Carolina and South Florida
Friday afternoon. Farther west, a warm front pushing north through
the Southern Plains could trigger hit-or-miss showers and
thunderstorms Friday afternoon and into Friday night.

Temperatures will be warmest in the Intermountain West and Great
Plains as upper level ridging builds aloft downwind of the robust
upper trough in the northeast Pacific. Fridays high temps will be
quite warm from the Southern Plains to the plains of Montana with
the hottest temperatures expected along the Rio Grande River where
highs could hit 90 degrees. The East Coast rebounds to more
September-like levels of heat today before the aforementioned cold
front sends a shot or more autumn-like conditions, currently
located in the Midwest, into the Great Lakes and Northeast for
Friday and into the upcoming weekend. Expect the Deep South to
remain on the abnormally warm side through the end of the
work-week. Lastly, the West Coast will contend with persistent
cloud cover thanks to the series of systems causing onshore flow.
Temperatures ranging between 5 to 15 degrees cooler than average
are expected with the coldest anomalies focused in Northern
California.

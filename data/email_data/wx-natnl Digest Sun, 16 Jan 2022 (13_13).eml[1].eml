Extended Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 19 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 23 2022

...Cooled South to East Coast Snow/Ice Threat with frontal/coastal
low genesis late week...

...Pattern Overview...

A mean upper ridge will amplify along/off the West Coast by
mid-later week. This will allow a series of northern stream
impulses carve out and reinforce a large mean trough downstream
over the central to eastern U.S. later week into the weekend. Of
the main shortwaves, the first should slide over the Great Lakes
into the Northeast Wednesday and Thursday, with the next tending
to dig more sharply into the South Friday and up off the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast coast Saturday. There is significant
forecast spread and run to run uncertainty with this latter
feature and associated mid-winter weather focus with frontal
wave/coastal low genesis.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Weather
Highlights/Hazards...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a model
and ensemble composite days 3-7. There is good agreement with an
organized low pressure system set to dig into the north-central
U.S. and subsequently track moving eastward along the
U.S./Canadian border Wed/Thu. This should bring some snow to the
Great Lakes then northern New England, with locally higher totals
expected near typical lake enhancement areas as cold high pressure
sweeps down across the central and eastern U.S. in the wake of the
low in a pattern with above normal predictability for these
features. The wavy trailing cold front on the leading edge of this
Arctic blast will gain some Gulf moisture to fuel an emerging area
of precipitation up from the South/Southeast. Guidance varies
however with potential focus due to ample run to run trough
track/separation uncertainty aloft later week into the weekend.
The pattern offers potential into later week for an enhanced swath
of overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity. A
cluster of multi-model ensemble members along with in particular
the 18 UTC GFS and now the latest 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian models,
are much more robust with frontal wave to coastal low/storm
genesis and mid-winter precipitation extent across the region and
up the East Coast at these longer time periods. However, the 00
UTC GFS has backed off. The preferred model and composite trends
WPC product continuity toward more organized and closer to the
coast genesis and track, but at this point not as strong as some
of the models. Meanwhile, The West could see some light
precipitation through the period, particularly over the Pacific
Northwest and into the Northern Rockies as weakening systems cross
the region, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.

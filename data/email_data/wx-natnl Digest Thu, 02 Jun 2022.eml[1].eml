Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CDT Thu Jun 02 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, temporary high pressure is forecast to build over
the Four Corners and southern Rockies ahead of a developing West
Coast trough. Flow aloft is forecast to remain relatively weak,
though a low amplitude shortwave trough within the flow is forecast
to shift eastward through the day. Lift from the trough and weak
upslope flow in the wake of a cold front should support a few dry
thunderstorms across portions of NM and southern CO.

...New Mexico and Southern Colorado Dry Thunderstorms...
As the low-amplitude trough interacts with the shortwave ridge,
subtle forcing for ascent should result in isolated to widely
scattered thunderstorms within the post-frontal upslope airmass
across portions of west-central NM and southern CO. Area model
sounding show PWAT values of 0.5 to 0.8 inches atop a mostly dry and
well-mixed boundary layer. The resulting profile should support
high-based storms with little rainfall efficiency and the potential
to produce dry lightning strikes. With area fuels receptive to
ignitions, Isolated Dry Thunder probabilities will be maintained.
Elsewhere, weak flow and favorable humidity recoveries should keep
critical fire weather concerns minimal.

0156 AM CDT Thu Jun 02 2022

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level shortwave ridging over the Four Corners is forecast to
de-amplify and shift eastward Friday under the influence of an
approaching Pacific Trough. Subtle height falls and an increase in
mid-level flow should result in the development of weak surface low
over the Great Basin. While weak, this low may support locally gusty
surface winds across portions of the Southwest. With warm
temperatures in place, a few hours of locally elevated fire weather
conditions may develop within dry fuels. Model guidance shows most
areas will not see surface winds greater than 15 mph, suggesting a
limited duration for any fire weather concerns. Additionally,
lingering moisture across central and eastern NM may support a few
thunderstorms in the afternoon. While lightning may occur with these
likely high-based and drier storms, coverage appears too low to
warrant dry thunder probabilities.

257 AM EDT Thu Jun 02 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Jun 05 2022 - 12Z Thu Jun 09 2022

...Overview...

As the medium range period begins Sunday, a tropical disturbance
for which the National Hurricane Center shows a high chance of
development should be east of the Florida Peninsula and pulling
away from the U.S., but with some showers and storms possibly
lingering over Florida and potentially up the Southeast coast
depending on how close the low tracks to land. Meanwhile farther
north, the lower 48 should see a fairly zonal pattern, but with
shortwaves and surface frontal boundaries providing foci for
thunderstorms and potential for heavy rainfall over much of the
central U.S. and possibly into the East.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance generally agrees the tropical low will be centered
east of Florida by Sunday morning, though its effects may be
lingering. The 12Z CMC was a fast solution while the newer 00Z CMC
has slowed down, even slower than other guidance, so the exact
timing is still uncertain. The ECMWF has been persistently the
deepest with the low, and thus shows more influence in the
midlevels with a closed 500mb low at times. The EC has also
indicated a slightly farther north track with the GFS runs farther
south. A composite blend of the deterministic guidance seems to
show a good compromise solution.

Other than that feature, the pattern over the U.S. should be
fairly zonal with shortwaves dominating the flow, spinning off
from an upper low offshore British Columbia and another upper low
initially in south-central Canada that will gradually lift
northeastward through next week. Model guidance is reasonably
agreeable with the overall pattern, and is even not too bad with
individual shortwaves through midweek. Previous model cycles of
the GFS in particular were showing some phasing of energy around
the northern High Plains through Tuesday and beyond, but now the
GFS/ECMWF/CMC are more agreeable with low amplitude ridging there
Tuesday in between shortwave features. These shift eastward
Wednesday-Thursday and the upstream shortwave does end up causing
some differences in the depth of troughing across the east-central
U.S. by Thursday, with the 12Z GFS among the strongest. Meanwhile
models also show good consensus for southern tier ridging, with
some typical timing and model variations with occasional closed
highs. Thus a blend of the 12Z/18Z GFS runs and the 12Z ECMWF,
CMC, and UKMET also worked well for the CONUS for the first half
of the medium range period, swapping the UKMET for the ECMWF mean
day 6 and adding in a small portion of the GEFS mean on day 7 as
well. Overall a bigger percentage of operational models than
normal could be maintained through the period with the reasonably
good consensus.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Though the bulk of the effects of the tropical disturbance will be
in the short range period, some showers and storms could be
present across Florida with lingering moisture and possibly reach
the Southeast coast. Continued convergence across South Florida
and the Keys could promote additional rain and thunderstorms there
through at least the first half of next week, but scattered in
nature. Meanwhile a weak to moderate atmospheric river this
weekend aimed at the Northwest U.S. will increase precipitation
chances there. This should be mainly rain as snow levels are
forecast to be high, with chances for snow only in the highest
peaks of the Cascades and northern Rockies. Parts of the central
U.S. can likely expect the most impactful rain, however.
Meandering frontal boundaries will provide areas of focus for
enhanced rainfall with convection in a pattern with plenty of
moisture. This looks to be most likely across northern/central
parts of the Plains and into the Middle Mississippi Valley and
possibly the Lower Ohio Valley. But unfortunately, models are
quite variable with the placement of heavy rainfall beyond that,
as the axes of enhanced rain will be highly dependent on where
individual boundaries set up. The ingredients are certainly in
place for heavy rainfall that could cause flash flooding, but the
details of areas with the greatest threat could take into the
short range to resolve, so held off on adding any Slight Risks to
the experimental Day 4-5 Excessive Rainfall Outlook for now as
they would almost certainly have to move around. Additionally,
models have trended heavier with rainfall moving into the
Northeast around Monday-Tuesday ahead of a cold front.

Expect the general pattern for temperatures next week to be cooler
than average in the northern tier and warmer than average in the
southern tier. The northern Plains in particular could see highs
10-20F and lows around 10F below average with periods of troughing
aloft. Meanwhile, much of the southern tier is forecast to see
above normal temperatures by around 5-10F but reaching +15F
anomalies in Texas for the first half of next week given an upper
high aloft. The West Coast should be a bit cooler than normal over
the weekend under the troughing influence, but moderating and
warming to above normal in California and into the Great Basin and
Southwest by around midweek.

257 AM EDT Thu Jun 02 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Jun 05 2022 - 12Z Thu Jun 09 2022

...Overview...

As the medium range period begins Sunday, a tropical disturbance
for which the National Hurricane Center shows a high chance of
development should be east of the Florida Peninsula and pulling
away from the U.S., but with some showers and storms possibly
lingering over Florida and potentially up the Southeast coast
depending on how close the low tracks to land. Meanwhile farther
north, the lower 48 should see a fairly zonal pattern, but with
shortwaves and surface frontal boundaries providing foci for
thunderstorms and potential for heavy rainfall over much of the
central U.S. and possibly into the East.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance generally agrees the tropical low will be centered
east of Florida by Sunday morning, though its effects may be
lingering. The 12Z CMC was a fast solution while the newer 00Z CMC
has slowed down, even slower than other guidance, so the exact
timing is still uncertain. The ECMWF has been persistently the
deepest with the low, and thus shows more influence in the
midlevels with a closed 500mb low at times. The EC has also
indicated a slightly farther north track with the GFS runs farther
south. A composite blend of the deterministic guidance seems to
show a good compromise solution.

Other than that feature, the pattern over the U.S. should be
fairly zonal with shortwaves dominating the flow, spinning off
from an upper low offshore British Columbia and another upper low
initially in south-central Canada that will gradually lift
northeastward through next week. Model guidance is reasonably
agreeable with the overall pattern, and is even not too bad with
individual shortwaves through midweek. Previous model cycles of
the GFS in particular were showing some phasing of energy around
the northern High Plains through Tuesday and beyond, but now the
GFS/ECMWF/CMC are more agreeable with low amplitude ridging there
Tuesday in between shortwave features. These shift eastward
Wednesday-Thursday and the upstream shortwave does end up causing
some differences in the depth of troughing across the east-central
U.S. by Thursday, with the 12Z GFS among the strongest. Meanwhile
models also show good consensus for southern tier ridging, with
some typical timing and model variations with occasional closed
highs. Thus a blend of the 12Z/18Z GFS runs and the 12Z ECMWF,
CMC, and UKMET also worked well for the CONUS for the first half
of the medium range period, swapping the UKMET for the ECMWF mean
day 6 and adding in a small portion of the GEFS mean on day 7 as
well. Overall a bigger percentage of operational models than
normal could be maintained through the period with the reasonably
good consensus.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Though the bulk of the effects of the tropical disturbance will be
in the short range period, some showers and storms could be
present across Florida with lingering moisture and possibly reach
the Southeast coast. Continued convergence across South Florida
and the Keys could promote additional rain and thunderstorms there
through at least the first half of next week, but scattered in
nature. Meanwhile a weak to moderate atmospheric river this
weekend aimed at the Northwest U.S. will increase precipitation
chances there. This should be mainly rain as snow levels are
forecast to be high, with chances for snow only in the highest
peaks of the Cascades and northern Rockies. Parts of the central
U.S. can likely expect the most impactful rain, however.
Meandering frontal boundaries will provide areas of focus for
enhanced rainfall with convection in a pattern with plenty of
moisture. This looks to be most likely across northern/central
parts of the Plains and into the Middle Mississippi Valley and
possibly the Lower Ohio Valley. But unfortunately, models are
quite variable with the placement of heavy rainfall beyond that,
as the axes of enhanced rain will be highly dependent on where
individual boundaries set up. The ingredients are certainly in
place for heavy rainfall that could cause flash flooding, but the
details of areas with the greatest threat could take into the
short range to resolve, so held off on adding any Slight Risks to
the experimental Day 4-5 Excessive Rainfall Outlook for now as
they would almost certainly have to move around. Additionally,
models have trended heavier with rainfall moving into the
Northeast around Monday-Tuesday ahead of a cold front.

Expect the general pattern for temperatures next week to be cooler
than average in the northern tier and warmer than average in the
southern tier. The northern Plains in particular could see highs
10-20F and lows around 10F below average with periods of troughing
aloft. Meanwhile, much of the southern tier is forecast to see
above normal temperatures by around 5-10F but reaching +15F
anomalies in Texas for the first half of next week given an upper
high aloft. The West Coast should be a bit cooler than normal over
the weekend under the troughing influence, but moderating and
warming to above normal in California and into the Great Basin and
Southwest by around midweek.

...Numerous areas of showers and thunderstorms to impact the
southern and eastern U.S. today with cooler temperatures arriving
to end the week...

Mid-Atlantic states today...

...A tropical depression or tropical storm is likely to develop
over the southeast Gulf of Mexico and approach south Florida by
this weekend...

...Very heavy rainfall and concerns for flash flooding will exist
over south Florida for Friday and Saturday...

A very warm, moist, and unstable airmass along and ahead of a cold
front moving southeast through southern and eastern portions of
the country will favor numerous showers and thunderstorms today
from the southern Plains and lower Mississippi Valley
northeastward across the Mid-Atlantic states and portions of New
England. Some localized areas of severe weather will be possible,
and the Storm Prediction Center has highlighted a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms for today and tonight across the Mid-Atlantic
region where thunderstorms will be capable of producing damaging
winds gusts and hail. The showers and thunderstorms along the cold
front will also be capable of producing locally heavy rainfall,
and a few instances of flash flooding cannot be ruled. On Friday,
the aforementioned front will be settling down into the Southeast
and some scattered showers and thunderstorms will continue. Behind
the front, cooler and drier air will be arriving from the Midwest
and this will sweep across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and
through most of the Mid-Atlantic and portions of the Northeast.

Meanwhile, a broad area of low pressure near the east coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula will be gradually advancing off to the northeast
and should cross through the far northwest Caribbean Sea through
tonight and the southeast Gulf of Mexico on Friday. This system is
likely to develop into a tropical depression or tropical storm as
it approaches south Florida by early Saturday. Regardless of
development, there is a likelihood of very heavy rainfall across
south Florida and the Florida Keys on Friday and Saturday that
will likely result in areas of flash flash flooding. This will
especially be the case across the more sensitive urban corridor of
southeast Florida. Currently, this system is expected to produce
as much as 4 to 8 inches of rain through Saturday with isolated
heavier amounts that may approach 10 inches. The Weather
Prediction Center has highlighted a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall across this region as a result.

Over the West, a weak ridge of high pressure will lead to mostly
tranquil and seasonal conditions. However, there will be a weak
Pacific storm system impacting the Pacific Northwest which will
bring some scattered showers and thunderstorms through Friday. The
moisture and energy with this system will stretch downstream
across areas of the northern Rockies and out into the northern
Plains and Upper Midwest going into the early part of the weekend.
Scattered areas of showers and thunderstorms are also expected
farther south across the central and southern Plains as southerly
flow returns and moisture begins surging back north.

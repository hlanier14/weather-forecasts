...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0107 AM CDT Tue May 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime with a shortwave trough across the
central US and ridging across the West Coast should persist through
the forecast period. Zonal northwesterly flow is expected across
much of the Great Basin and Southwest. At the surface, dry but
relatively cool and weak downslope winds are expected across the
Southern Rockies and Southwest while high pressure dominates the
Plains. A cold front sweeping across the Midwest will bring cooler
temperatures and widespread precipitation to the eastern Half of the
Country. The result should be limited overlap of favorable
conditions for fire weather across the CONUS through the period.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0108 AM CDT Tue May 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a broad trough over the Northeast is forecast to
deepen slowly through the day as high pressure along the west Coast
intensifies. The flow regime-will gradually amplify, with northwest
flow aloft expected over the southern Rockies and Southwest. At the
surface, high pressure is forecast to build across the Plains while
low pressure and widespread precipitation cover the east. With high
pressure and widespread precipitation dominating the central and
eastern CONUS respectively, fire weather potential will be
relegated to locally elevated conditions across portions of the
Southwest and southern Rockies.

...Southern Rockies and Southwest...
A belt of stronger mid-level flow associated with a shortwave trough
embedded within the northwesterly zonal regime may bolster low-level
downslope winds through the afternoon. Locally elevated fire weather
potential will be possible across northern New Mexico into the
western Texas Panhandle where the best overlap of 10-15 mph winds
and RH of 15-25% exists. Fuel conditions are somewhat limited, given
recent precipitation across the area. However, enough dry fuel mass
likely exists for marginally elevated fire weather potential.

...Severe thunderstorm and flash flood threats will affect
locations from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the Upper Ohio
Valley and East Coast Tuesday night and early Wednesday...

...Cooler and quieter weather will translate eastward from the
Mississippi River Valley to the Appalachians through Thursday, in
the wake of a cold front...

...Dry and unseasonably warm temperatures continue in the West...

Most of the active weather across the lower 48 will focus ahead of
a cold front that extended from Lakes Erie and Ontario into the
Lower Mississippi Valley as of Tuesday afternoon. Above average
temperatures and ample moisture ahead of the cold front will
support scattered to widespread thunderstorms from portions of the
Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, some of which will be severe. The
latest outlook from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) supports the
greatest threat for tornadoes, large hail and damaging
straight-line winds from central Louisiana to portions of
Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee through Wednesday morning. Many
of these same areas will also see scattered to numerous coverage
of flash flooding from some of the more intense thunderstorms.

The cold front will continue to move east through Wednesday,
clearing the coast of New England late Wednesday evening, while
stretching southwestward into the southeastern U.S. Thunderstorms
ahead of the cold front will continue to pose a threat for severe
weather for much of the East Coast on Wednesday, south of the
Mason-Dixon line, but the threat will be reduced (Marginal Risk)
in comparison to today's Enhanced Risk from SPC in place across
the South. Cooler and drier weather will follow behind the cold
front, from the Great Plains to the Mississippi River Valley for
Wednesday, reaching the East Coast for Thursday.

Across the western U.S., an upper level ridge will move eastward
while strengthening over the next 36 to 60 hours. The result will
be an expansion of above average temperatures on Wednesday from
California and Nevada into Oregon and Washington. Temperatures
will be roughly 10 to 20 degrees above average across the West
Coast states into Nevada on Wednesday, with the anomalous warmth
spreading eastward to the Continental Divide for Thursday. Chances
for precipitation will also diminish during the day on Wednesday
from the central Rockies to the northern High Plains. By Thursday
morning, the coast of northern California into the Pacific
Northwest will see a return of precipitation while also cooling
down in the wake of a Pacific cold front.

FOR WEDNESDAY MAY 12 - TUESDAY MAY 18: Today's model ensembles and tools of=
fer
a little more of a changeup compared to previous guidance. While the GEFS a=
nd
the ECMWF ensemble mean 500-hPa height anomalies had been fairly consistent
favoring anomalous troughing (ridging) developing across the western
(southeastern) CONUS, the latest ensembles appear more muted with these
mid-level features, suggestive of a reduced hazard potential in today's
outlook
for mid-May. By the start of the period, both the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF
ensembles depict weak anomalous troughing over the northeastern CONUS and
anomalous ridging upstream centered over the Eastern Pacific with positive
height departures overspreading portions over the western CONUS. There is a=
lso
agreement between the ensembles favoring low amplitude subtropical ridging =
to
promote elevated chances for above normal temperatures over the southern ti=
er
of the CONUS throughout the week-2 period, although this also appears less
amplified compared to yesterday.



Late in week-1, a stationary front is forecast to extend from the Southern
Plains to the Southeast, with surface high pressure descending from souther=
n
Canada. As this surface high is expected to shift eastward early in the
period,
return flow from the Gulf continues to be favored allowing for the advectio=
n
of
lower level moisture into portions of the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
Compared to yesterday, there are lesser daily precipitation amounts in the
GEFS
across the region through the middle of the period. According to the ECMWF,
though, much of the potential for heavy precipitation is maintained in toda=
y's
ensemble guidance with elevated probabilities exceeding 40% for 3-day rainf=
all
accumulations exceeding an inch, which are now more focused further south i=
n
the Southern Plains and into Lower Mississippi Valley where the stationary
front may persist. Here, there is good agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools indicating at least a 20% chance for 3-day precipitation
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch through the middle o=
f
the period. In light of some of the differences regarding heavy precipitati=
on
potential and a more deamplified pattern aloft in the ensemble guidance, th=
e
moderate risk region for heavy precipitation is removed, however, a slight
risk
is maintained across the southcentral CONUS through the middle of week-2.
Additionally, given the weaker signals for surface low pressure development=
 to
induce strong pressure gradients in the ensembles early in the period, the
slight risk of high winds is also removed from the outlook which is also
supported by reforecast tools. Should heavy precipitation be realized durin=
g
mid-May, this is expected to help continue to alleviate moderate to severe
drought conditions being felt in Texas, however, it also increases the risk=
 of
flooding further east into the Lower Mississippi Valley, where antecedent w=
et
conditions and high soil moisture percentiles have been registered during t=
he
last month.



Mid-level anomalous ridging continues to be favored over the western and
southern CONUS, and reforecast tools indicate elevated probabilities for
maximum daytime temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile mainly over part=
s
of
the West coast and Florida.  However, these temperatures are not anticipate=
d
to
exceed hazard thresholds, where these tools maintain reduced chances of
temperatures exceeding 95 degrees F over the Central Valley of California, =
as
well as over Florida. Over Alaska, anomalous mid-level troughing forecast o=
ver
the Aleutians is likely to bring enhanced onshore flow over parts of the
southern Mainland and the Alaska Panhandle. Although reforecast guidance sh=
ows
3-day amounts over the southwestern Mainland exceeding the 85th percentile,
these amounts are not likely to exceed hazard thresholds and no correspondi=
ng
hazards are issued.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
231 PM EDT Tue May 04 2021

Valid 12Z Fri May 07 2021 - 12Z Tue May 11 2021

19Z Update...

00Z/06Z guidance maintains the overall pattern evolution, with
good agreement among the GFS/ECWMF and Canadian (less so for the
UKMET). Trend has been for a bit quicker pace with the reinforcing
trough into/through the Great Basin next Mon/Tue, but at that lead
time it was still within the expected error bounds. Utilized a
consensus blend approach with increased ensemble weighting (evenly
between the GEFS/CMCE and ECENS mean) by next week, but retaining
the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF for some details. The previous
discussion from 07Z is below.

Fracasso


...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

An amplified upper level pattern will initially be in place across
the nation on Friday with well developed troughs near the West
Coast and East Coast, with an upper ridge over the Rockies that
weakens with time as it emerges over the Plains.  As the trough
over the Northeast lifts out, a more quasi-zonal pattern is
expected by the weekend across the central and eastern U.S., with
a second trough building across the West by early next week.  At
the surface, a quasi-stationary frontal boundary with multiple
waves of low pressure along it will be the main weather maker
during the medium range period.

Models and ensembles remain in above average agreement for the end
of the week, although there is some variance with the timing and
strength of smaller scale systems, but guidance composites tend to
mitigate these differences that is consistent with predictability.
 The GFS is now solidly in line with keeping the developing low
pressure system well offshore the East Coast and taking the storm
out to sea for Friday/Saturday, compared to the nor'easter type
solution portrayed in earlier model runs.  However, the GFS
becomes much faster with ejecting the western U.S. trough over the
Plains during the Monday/Tuesday time period, whereas the
CMC/ECMWF and ensembles are favoring a considerably slower
solution.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was based on a
CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend along with some of the ensemble means through
Day 5, and then primarily ECMWF/EC mean/GEFS means by days 6 and 7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best rainfall prospects will likely be from the Central Plains
to the Ohio Valley where multiple convective complexes are likely
in the vicinity of a slow moving front.  The potential exists for
2 to 4 inches of rain, with locally higher amounts, from eastern
Kansas to western Kentucky.  Some training of thunderstorms may
lead to instances of flooding, and this is something that will
continue to be monitored in the days ahead.  Widespread moderate
to locally heavy rain can also be expected from eastern Colorado
to central Montana as the upper trough/closed low builds in
overhead combined with moist upslope flow.  Dry conditions should
persist across most of the Intermountain West and the Desert
Southwest, as well as the northern Great Lakes.

Temperatures will likely be more reminiscent of March across the
western High Plains and adjacent portions of the northern Rockies
for the Sunday to Tuesday time period, with highs up to 20 degrees
below early May averages.  This equates to readings maxing out in
the mid 40s to mid 50s for many of those areas, and the higher
elevations of Wyoming, Montana, and northern Colorado can expect
some late season accumulating snow, perhaps exceeding six inches
for some of the higher ranges.  For the Desert Southwest and Great
Basin, the above average readings this week will likely persist
until Friday, after which a return to more seasonable conditions
can be expected.  However, it should remain warm and humid south
of the frontal boundary across the Deep South and Gulf Coast
region with highs up to 10 degrees above normal.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue May 04 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 10 - 14 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian dynamical models are in good agreement in
regards
to the 6-10 day 500-hPa geopotential height pattern. Troughing is predicted
over northeastern North America early in the period, with todays guidance
showing a more east and southward placement of negative height anomalies ov=
er
the eastern CONUS compared to yesterday. The mid-level flow is forecast to
become more zonal across the western CONUS, with ridging predicted over the
eastern Pacific, extending northward through much of Alaska. Todays manual
500-hPa height blend depicts near to above normal heights across much of th=
e
western CONUS, with the highest positive height anomalies forecast along th=
e
Pacific Coast. Below normal heights are favored across the Great Lakes and
Northeast, underneath the influence of the trough over eastern Canada. Near
normal heights are forecast across remaining areas of the central CONUS
through
the mid-Atlantic, with above normal heights becoming more favored across pa=
rts
of the Southeast and Florida. Above normal heights are depicted across much=
 of
Alaska, except over parts of the Aleutians, where near to below normal heig=
hts
are favored underneath troughing forecast over the Bering Sea.

Increased probabilities for below normal temperatures are highlighted acros=
s
much of the CONUS east of the Rockies as a cold front is forecast to move
through prior to the forecast period. Probabilities for above normal
temperatures are increased over parts of southern Texas, the Lower Mississi=
ppi
Valley, and Southeast, where mid-level flow is predicted to be more zonal a=
nd
weak positive height anomalies are favored. Near to above normal temperatur=
es
are favored over portions of the western CONUS, with the highest probabilit=
ies
for above normal temperatures forecast across Northern California due to
increased influence from the East Pacific ridge. Above normal temperatures =
are
favored across much of Alaska underneath increased ridging and enhanced
southerly surface and mid-level flow ahead of troughing and associated surf=
ace
low pressure predicted over the Bering Sea. The temperature forecast across
the
CONUS and Alaska is consistent with both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tool=
s.

Frontally focused precipitation is favored across parts of the central and
eastern CONUS, with probabilities for above normal precipitation increasing
for
areas further south, especially across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southeast where enhanced Gulf of Mexico moisture flow could further enhance
rainfall chances. Ridging and positive height anomalies along the West Coas=
t
of
the CONUS favor increased chances for below normal precipitation across
portions of the Pacific Northwest, California, the Great Basin, Southwest, =
and
the Rockies. Below normal precipitation probabilities are also elevated ove=
r
parts of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and
Northeast. These areas are forecast to be on the backside of the
aforementioned
cold front, more influenced by northwesterly mid-level flow and surface hig=
h
pressure. Probabilities for above normal precipitation are increased over m=
ost
of Alaska due to troughing predicted across the Bering Sea and an active st=
orm
track across the state.

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement in the model mid-level height forecast, offset by substantial
changes
in the CONUS temperature forecast compared to yesterday.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 12 - 18 2021

The predicted 500-hPa height pattern during the week-2 period is similar to
the
6-10 day period but with less amplification. Although the mean mid-level fl=
ow
across the CONUS is predicted to be predominately zonal, the ECMWF, GEFS, a=
nd
Canadian ensembles continue to depict increased ridging and positive height
anomalies across the eastern Pacific and negative height anomalies over
northeastern North America and the Northwest Atlantic. The persistence of
these
features is the primary focal point for the week-2 temperature and
precipitation outlooks. The manual blend for the period depicts near normal
500-hPa heights across the CONUS and Alaska for the period as a whole,
although
the ridging over the East Pacific teleconnects with troughing over the west=
ern
CONUS, which may result in occasional periods of below normal heights.

Probabilities for above normal temperatures are increased over parts of Tex=
as,
the Lower Mississippi Valley, and Southeast, consistent with the consolidat=
ion
forecast tool. Below normal temperature probabilities are increased across
much
of the northern tier of the CONUS. The highest probabilities are across the
Northeast, supported by the GEFS reforecast tool, analog guidance, and
teleconnection analysis with the negative height anomaly center over the
Northwest Atlantic. A slight tilt toward increased below normal temperature
probabilities also extends through parts of the Upper and Middle Mississipp=
i,
Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys. Probabilities for below normal temperatures ar=
e
highlighted across parts of the Northern Rockies and Plains, with the
increased
ridging in the East Pacific possibly resulting in more downstream troughing
and
associated cooler temperatures for parts of the western and central CONUS.
Enhanced probabilities for above normal temperatures are highlighted along =
the
West Coast of the CONUS underneath the influence of ridging in the eastern
Pacific. Probabilities for above normal temperatures also remain elevated
across Alaska underneath persistent southerly mid-level flow, and consisten=
t
with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools.

The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools are in good agreement in terms of the
week-2 precipitation forecast across the CONUS. Increased chances for above
normal precipitation remain favored for most areas from the Great Plains an=
d
east to the Atlantic Coast, given the similar flow pattern to the 6-10 day
period. Chances for intermittent troughing persist across the West and
periodic
shortwave disturbances are possible across the central and eastern CONUS, w=
ith
the highest chances closest to the Gulf of Mexico Coast due to enhanced
moisture availability. Below normal precipitation probabilities are increas=
ed
over much of the western third of the CONUS due to the influence from surfa=
ce
high pressure forecast over the East Pacific. Above normal precipitation
chances continue to be increased over much of Alaska due to troughing over =
the
Bering Sea and the ridging over the eastern Pacific favoring a more northwa=
rd
storm track across Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement in the dynamical models, offset by a predicted low amplitude
pattern and differences between the statistical and dynamical guidance
regarding the temperature forecast over the CONUS.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
349 PM EDT Tue May 04 2021

Valid 12Z Fri May 07 2021 - 12Z Tue May 11 2021

19Z Update...

00Z/06Z guidance maintains the overall pattern evolution, with
good agreement among the GFS/ECWMF and Canadian (less so for the
UKMET). Trend has been for a bit quicker pace with the reinforcing
trough into/through the Great Basin next Mon/Tue, but at that lead
time it was still within the expected error bounds. Utilized a
consensus blend approach with increased ensemble weighting (evenly
between the GEFS/CMCE and ECENS mean) by next week, but retaining
the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF for some details. The previous
discussion from 07Z is below.

Fracasso


...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

An amplified upper level pattern will initially be in place across
the nation on Friday with well developed troughs near the West
Coast and East Coast, with an upper ridge over the Rockies that
weakens with time as it emerges over the Plains.  As the trough
over the Northeast lifts out, a more quasi-zonal pattern is
expected by the weekend across the central and eastern U.S., with
a second trough building across the West by early next week.  At
the surface, a quasi-stationary frontal boundary with multiple
waves of low pressure along it will be the main weather maker
during the medium range period.

Models and ensembles remain in above average agreement for the end
of the week, although there is some variance with the timing and
strength of smaller scale systems, but guidance composites tend to
mitigate these differences that is consistent with predictability.
 The GFS is now solidly in line with keeping the developing low
pressure system well offshore the East Coast and taking the storm
out to sea for Friday/Saturday, compared to the nor'easter type
solution portrayed in earlier model runs.  However, the GFS
becomes much faster with ejecting the western U.S. trough over the
Plains during the Monday/Tuesday time period, whereas the
CMC/ECMWF and ensembles are favoring a considerably slower
solution.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was based on a
CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend along with some of the ensemble means through
Day 5, and then primarily ECMWF/EC mean/GEFS means by days 6 and 7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best rainfall prospects will likely be from the Central Plains
to the Ohio Valley where multiple convective complexes are likely
in the vicinity of a slow moving front.  The potential exists for
2 to 4 inches of rain, with locally higher amounts, from eastern
Kansas to western Kentucky.  Some training of thunderstorms may
lead to instances of flooding, and this is something that will
continue to be monitored in the days ahead.  Widespread moderate
to locally heavy rain can also be expected from eastern Colorado
to central Montana as the upper trough/closed low builds in
overhead combined with moist upslope flow.  Dry conditions should
persist across most of the Intermountain West and the Desert
Southwest, as well as the northern Great Lakes.

Temperatures will likely be more reminiscent of March across the
western High Plains and adjacent portions of the northern Rockies
for the Sunday to Tuesday time period, with highs up to 20 degrees
below early May averages.  This equates to readings maxing out in
the mid 40s to mid 50s for many of those areas, and the higher
elevations of Wyoming, Montana, and northern Colorado can expect
some late season accumulating snow, perhaps exceeding six inches
for some of the higher ranges.  For the Desert Southwest and Great
Basin, the above average readings this week will likely persist
until Friday, after which a return to more seasonable conditions
can be expected.  However, it should remain warm and humid south
of the frontal boundary across the Deep South and Gulf Coast
region with highs up to 10 degrees above normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0116 AM CDT Wed May 05 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An amplified mid-level flow pattern is forecast across the CONUS
through the Day1 forecast period. A broad cyclonic trough is
forecast to be centered over the Ohio Valley while a ridge of high
pressure builds across the Intermountain West. At the surface, a
cold front will slowly make its way off the eastern coast of the US
while a large are of high pressure is expected to remain stationary
across the central Rockies/Plains. With mid-level synoptic flow
displaced from much of the warmer and drier conditions across the
CONUS, little overlap of fire weather conditions is expected.
Localized gusty downslope winds across northern New Mexico may
support locally elevated fire weather potential this afternoon and
evening. However, above average fuel moisture from recent
precipitation should limit the threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0119 AM CDT Wed May 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A progressive mid-level flow regime will continue across the CONUS
as the western US ridge is compressed and pushed east by a shortwave
trough moving onshore across California. Troughing across the
eastern US will intensify, bringing cooler than average conditions
to much of the East. At the surface, low pressure and a cold front
will move onshore and across the Great Basin while high pressure
strengthens in the Midwest.

...Great Basin...
Ahead of a shortwave trough forecast to move onshore early in the
day, gusty southerly winds are expected across portions of the Great
Basin. Increasing flow aloft should bolster surface winds to 15-20
mph through the afternoon. Warm surface temperatures in the 70s to
80s F should allow for minimum surface humidity in the 10-20% range.
Weak mid-level moisture advection ahead of the trough and associated
cold front may also support a few high-based thunderstorms later in
the day. Locally elevated fire weather conditions and isolated
lighting appear possible, but above average fuel moisture gives
little confidence on the severity and spatial coverage at this time.

***Heavy rain expected for portions of the Central U.S. this
weekend and early next week***

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

The amplified upper level flow pattern during the short range
period is expected to become more quasi-zonal by this weekend as
the trough over the Northeast lifts out, and the central U.S.
ridge flattens out.  At the surface, a meandering frontal boundary
with multiple waves of low pressure along it will be the main
weather maker during the medium range period across the central
and southern tier states.

Models and ensembles are in relatively good agreement going into
the weekend, although there is some variance with the timing and
strength of smaller scale systems.  The GFS is more progressive
with the surface low crossing the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic
region through Monday morning, and the CMC is slower than the
model consensus.  The GFS is also stronger with the upper trough
across the western U.S.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was
based on a CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend along with some of the ensemble
means through Day 5, and then primarily ECMWF/EC mean/GEFS means
by days 6 and 7.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best rainfall prospects will likely be from the Central Plains
to the Ohio Valley, where multiple convective complexes are likely
in the vicinity of a stationary front and a wave of low pressure.
The potential exists for 2 to 4 inches of rain, with locally
higher amounts, from eastern Kansas to Kentucky.  Another zone of
heavy rain is also probable across portions of Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Tennessee for next Tuesday and Wednesday with
similar rainfall totals possible.  Some training of thunderstorms
may lead to instances of flooding, and this is something that will
continue to be monitored in the days ahead.  Widespread moderate
to locally heavy rain can also be expected from eastern Colorado
to central Montana as the upper trough/closed low builds in
overhead combined with moist upslope flow.  Dry conditions should
persist across most of the Intermountain West and the Desert
Southwest, as well as the northern Great Lakes.

Temperatures will likely be more reminiscent of March across the
central and western High Plains, and adjacent portions of the
northern Rockies for the Sunday to Tuesday time period, with highs
up to 20 degrees below early May averages.  This equates to
readings maxing out in the mid 40s to mid 50s for many of those
areas, and the higher elevations of Wyoming, Montana, and northern
Colorado can expect some late season accumulating snow, perhaps
exceeding six inches for some of the higher ranges.  Some of these
cooler temperatures should also be realized across Great Lakes and
Northeast U.S. courtesy of the upper trough and Canadian surface
high in place, although not as anomalous.

...Lingering showers and thunderstorms found across the East Coast
and Southeast today as a cold front exits the region...

...Unsettled weather enters the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Great Basin on Thursday night...

...Dry and unseasonably warm temperatures continue in the West as
cooler temperatures spread into the East...

After an active stretch of weather in the central and eastern
U.S., much quieter conditions are in store for a majority of the
Lower 48 through the end of the week. A cold front that currently
stretches from the Northeast through the Ohio Valley and
eventually into the western Gulf of Mexico is expected to exit the
East Coast this evening, while continuing to linger across
northern Florida on Thursday. Showers and thunderstorms will be
found along the frontal boundary up and down the East Coast. A few
thunderstorms could turn severe in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast,
with isolated damaging wind gusts and large hail the primary
concern. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk of
severe thunderstorms that extends from Delaware southwestward to
the central Gulf Coast. The slow-moving nature of the cold front
across the central Gulf Coast could lead to scattered instances of
flash flooding today as well. WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of
Excessive Rainfall across this area, with a small embedded Slight
Risk that includes coastal regions of southeast Mississippi,
Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle.

Elsewhere, a weak area of low pressure and associated cold front
is forecast to swing through the Central Plains today and into the
Ohio Valley by Thursday night. Only light showers and scattered
thunderstorms are expected, with light snow possibly mixing in
across the Dakotas this morning. For the Pacific Northwest, a fast
moving cold front will produce showers and high elevation light
snow between Thursday night and Friday morning, as well as the
Northern Great Basin/Northern Rockies by Friday.

Temperature-wise, using Cinco de Mayo standards it will be quite
spicy throughout the West and very mild in the East. High
temperatures are forecast to soar 10 to 20 degrees above average
throughout much of the western U.S. today before the warm
temperatures shift into the Intermountain West on Thursday. A few
daily temperature records could be set in the San Joaquin Valley
as highs reach into the upper 90s. Shifting east, the current warm
and humid airmass will be short-lived across the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast this morning as refreshing dry and cooler air enters by
tonight. Thursday will feature high temperatures nearly 10 degrees
below average from the Midwest through the Ohio/Tennessee valleys
and into the Northeast.

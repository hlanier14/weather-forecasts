Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1134 AM CDT Sat Jul 31 2021

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

Potential exists for a mix of wet/dry thunderstorms this
afternoon/evening, from portions of eastern Washington and northern
Idaho, southwestward into west-central Oregon and far northern
California. PWAT values in this region are forecast to be near or
exceeding 1 inch, and weak flow aloft should limit storm motions.
These factors would tend to favor wet thunderstorms, however, a few
peripheral dry strikes are possible, particularly over the Cascades
and in areas where fuels remain highly receptive. The area
delineating isolated dry thunderstorm potential has been expanded
accordingly.

Elsewhere, the balance of the previous forecast remains on track.
See the discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 07/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1243 AM CDT Sat Jul 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
The weak upper-level impulse that has brought widespread showers and
thunderstorms to the West over the past two days is noted over
northeast Nevada in early-morning IR imagery and radar mosaics. This
feature will continue to gradually shift to the north/northwest into
southeast Oregon and southwest Idaho today. Deeper monsoonal
moisture will accompany the impulse and support increasing
thunderstorm and wetting rainfall chances across Oregon and southern
Idaho. Isolated dry thunderstorms are possible closer to the
international border on the northern periphery of the monsoonal
moisture. Weak low pressure over the West will maintain weak
gradient winds at the surface and reduce the potential for robust
wind/RH-driven fire weather concerns.

...Eastern Washington and northern Idaho...
Despite an increase in column precipitable water over the past 24
hours, the observed 00z sounding from OTX reveals modest mid-level
moisture atop a dry boundary layer. Low-level trajectories emanating
from southwest Canada will maintain this dry layer through the day.
While boundary-layer heating/mixing may be muted by increasing cloud
cover, forecast soundings suggest increasing mid-level moisture will
support sufficient destabilization for at least isolated
thunderstorm chances by late afternoon. A mixture of wet/dry
thunderstorms appears likely for this region, but given antecedent
dry fuels, ongoing fire activity, and the dry conditions expected at
the surface outside of precipitation cores, an isolated
dry-thunderstorm risk area is introduced.

Localized elevated wind/RH conditions may occur this afternoon
across this region as well as across central MT. However, muted
daytime heating and generally weak pressure-gradient winds will
limit the coverage and duration of these conditions.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
224 PM EDT Sat Jul 31 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Aug 3 2021 - 12Z Sat Aug 7 2021

...Heavy rainfall threat for parts of the South and the
Southeast...

18Z Update:  Model and ensembles remain in very good agreement
regarding the synoptic scale features across the continental U.S.
next week.  The pattern will initially be a rather amplified one,
and then transitioning to a more quasi-zonal pattern by next
Saturday and this is where some more timing differences emerge.
The GFS becomes slightly quicker with the upper low across the
Pacific Northwest and also a bit more progressive with the trough
exiting the Northeast.  The CMC becomes stronger than the
consensus with a shortwave trough crossing the northern Plains,
but not considered an outlier solution.  In terms of the heavy
rainfall potential across the Southeast U.S., the strong model
signal for 3 to 6 inch totals with locally higher amounts remains
near the coast, although the forecast has trended down some across
interior portions of the Carolinas compared to last night.
Flooding could make weather headlines across portions of eastern
North Carolina and South Carolina, with the highest probability of
this for Wednesday and Thursday.  The previous forecast discussion
is appended below for reference. /Hamrick


...Overview...

Troughing will persist next week over the East, in between
flattening ridging out of western/central Canada and over the
Atlantic. This favors bouts of rainfall along a
slowly-moving/stalled front across the Carolinas back through the
Southeast into the southern Plains. Multi-day rainfall could
exceed several inches over parts of the Carolinas. The upper high
over the Southwest will meander in place, shifting the moisture
axis primarily to the Rockies and Front Range.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest models and ensembles remain in good agreement on the large
scale pattern through the period. Recent deterministic runs
continue to waver on how quickly (or slowly) to bring height falls
into the Pac NW later in the week with ECMWF/Canadian/ECENS mean a
little bit slower than the GFS and many GEFS members. The lack of
a clear upstream kicker over Alaska would favor the slower
solutions, but the upper low could unwind in pieces which would
send in some lower heights into WA/OR. Favored a blend of the
deterministic guidance days 3-5, trending toward the 12Z ECMWF and
the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECENS means by days 6 and 7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Focus for impactful weather will lie over the North/South Carolina
coast in the vicinity of the frontal boundary. With ample moisture
off the Atlantic, daily rounds of showers and storms will be
likely through the period. Guidance indicates several inches of
rainfall over a fairly large area which seems reasonable given the
setup. Less rainfall is expected farther west along the boundary
along the Gulf Coast back into Texas. Over the Northwest,
approaching system will eventually bring in some light rain to
coastal Washington by Friday into the northern Rockies (ID/MT) as
the front moves ashore.

Temperatures will be within a few degrees of normal over much of
the West with areas along the Canadian border likely to see
temperatures 5 to 10 degrees above normal from eastern Montana to
the western Great Lakes. Much of the East/Southeast will see near
to below normal max temperatures along and behind the cold front,
perhaps as much as 10 degrees below normal for early August on
some days over Texas/New Mexico and over the Carolinas. Low
temperatures will be closer to normal in the Southeast.

Extended Forecast Discussion

224 PM EDT Sat Jul 31 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Aug 3 2021 - 12Z Sat Aug 7 2021

...Heavy rainfall threat for parts of the South and the
Southeast...

18Z Update:  Model and ensembles remain in very good agreement
regarding the synoptic scale features across the continental U.S.
next week.  The pattern will initially be a rather amplified one,
and then transitioning to a more quasi-zonal pattern by next
Saturday and this is where some more timing differences emerge.
The GFS becomes slightly quicker with the upper low across the
Pacific Northwest and also a bit more progressive with the trough
exiting the Northeast.  The CMC becomes stronger than the
consensus with a shortwave trough crossing the northern Plains,
but not considered an outlier solution.  In terms of the heavy
rainfall potential across the Southeast U.S., the strong model
signal for 3 to 6 inch totals with locally higher amounts remains
near the coast, although the forecast has trended down some across
interior portions of the Carolinas compared to last night.
Flooding could make weather headlines across portions of eastern
North Carolina and South Carolina, with the highest probability of
this for Wednesday and Thursday.  The previous forecast discussion
is appended below for reference. /Hamrick


...Overview...

Troughing will persist next week over the East, in between
flattening ridging out of western/central Canada and over the
Atlantic. This favors bouts of rainfall along a
slowly-moving/stalled front across the Carolinas back through the
Southeast into the southern Plains. Multi-day rainfall could
exceed several inches over parts of the Carolinas. The upper high
over the Southwest will meander in place, shifting the moisture
axis primarily to the Rockies and Front Range.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest models and ensembles remain in good agreement on the large
scale pattern through the period. Recent deterministic runs
continue to waver on how quickly (or slowly) to bring height falls
into the Pac NW later in the week with ECMWF/Canadian/ECENS mean a
little bit slower than the GFS and many GEFS members. The lack of
a clear upstream kicker over Alaska would favor the slower
solutions, but the upper low could unwind in pieces which would
send in some lower heights into WA/OR. Favored a blend of the
deterministic guidance days 3-5, trending toward the 12Z ECMWF and
the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECENS means by days 6 and 7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Focus for impactful weather will lie over the North/South Carolina

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 PM CDT Sat Jul 31 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. Storms that develop over
portions of north-central Idaho and southwest Montana tomorrow
afternoon should propagate northward into northern Idaho and
northwest Montana by late evening. This activity has some potential
be initially dry, but forecast PWAT values of 1-1.5 inches should
generally limit dry thunderstorm potential in this region,
precluding any additional highlights at this time.

..Karstens.. 07/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Sat Jul 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
Rain chances will continue to overspread the Pacific Northwest
through the day Sunday as a weak upper-level impulse translates
north within the mean flow regime. While this will maintain
thunderstorm chances across the region, beneficial rainfall may help
mitigate fuel dryness to some degree. A weak surface low is forecast
to deepen east of the Cascades Sunday afternoon, which should
augment surface winds across the northern Rockies and may support
regional fire weather concerns outside of the corridor of better
rain chances. Elsewhere across the West, weak surface pressure
gradients and recent rainfall will limit additional fire weather
concerns.

...Central Montana...
Elevated wind/RH conditions are possible across parts of central MT
Sunday afternoon. Easterly winds are forecast to increase in
response to the deepening low over eastern OR/WA, and ensemble
guidance shows reasonable probabilities for sustained winds near 15
mph. Dry conditions are noted across this region with 10-hour fuel
moisture values near 5%, and afternoon RH reductions to 15-20%
appear likely as drier continental air filters in from Canada and
the northern Plains. While elevated conditions are probable, the
potential for critical wind speeds is low.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Sat Jul 31 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR AUGUST 2021

The updated monthly temperature and precipitation outlooks for August 2021 are
based on the latest dynamical model guidance, WPC temperature and
precipitation
forecasts during the first week of the month, the CPC 6-10/8-14 day
temperature
and precipitation outlooks, the CPC Week 3-4 outlooks, and initial conditions
such as anomalous soil moisture. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)
strengthened during late July with its enhanced phase currently across the
Pacific Ocean. Dynamical models are in good agreement that the MJO continues
an
eastward propagation over the Western Hemisphere during early to mid-August.
This would provide a more favorable large-scale environment for tropical
cyclone (TC) development across the East Pacific, earlier in the month,
followed by the Atlantic basin. Please refer to CPCs Global Tropics Hazards
for updates on the MJO along with TC development forecasts.



A highly amplified longwave pattern featuring a 500-hPa trough (ridge) over
eastern (western) North America is forecast to start the month of August.
However, ensemble means in recent days have trended towards a more rapid shift
in this pattern by the second week of August with a trough progressing inland
from the Northeast Pacific and anomalous ridging building over the higher
latitudes of eastern North America. During weeks 3 and 4 (Aug 14 to 27),
dynamical models generally agree with positive 500-hPa height anomalies across
the central and eastern CONUS, north of the 40th parallel. Despite the
relatively cool start to August, the positive 500-hPa height anomalies
beginning in week-2 and continuing into the latter half of month favor above
normal temperatures across the Midwest and Northeast. Compared to the initial
outlook released on July 15, the favored area of below normal temperatures
across the south-central CONUS is expanded westward across Texas due to the
likelihood of below normal temperatures during the first week to ten days of
the month and an increase in higher soil moisture. Above normal temperatures
remain favored for the western CONUS, although probabilities are reduced as a
trough is likely to progress inland into the Pacific Northwest during the
second week of the month. Also, the decrease in probabilities across the
Southwest is consistent with the latest model guidance and the introduction of
a favored area of above normal precipitation. The largest probabilities (more
than 60 percent) of above normal temperatures are forecast across the northern
Great Plains due to ongoing low soil moisture and predicted large positive
temperature anomalies during early to mid-August.



A stationary front is forecast to be the focus of heavy rainfall across the
Southeast during the first week of August. Although this wet signal diminishes
by the second week, probabilities of above normal precipitation are elevated
for this region at weeks 3 and 4. Therefore, above normal precipitation is
favored for the Southeast with the largest probabilities (more than 50
percent)
of above normal precipitation forecast across the eastern Carolinas where
rainfall amounts may exceed 5 inches during the first week of the month. This
favored area of above normal precipitation extends north to include the
Mid-Atlantic and eastern Corn Belt and west to the Lower Mississippi Valley
based on good consistency among daily CFS model runs and decadal trends.
Probabilities of above normal precipitation are slightly elevated across New
Mexico due in part to heavy rainfall at the beginning of August. Although a
lull in the Monsoon is expected during early August, enhanced monsoonal
moisture is expected to return by mid-month and the week 3-4 outlook, released
on July 30, favors above normal precipitation. The increased probabilities of
above normal precipitation forecast for the Southwest is supported by daily
CFS
model runs. Also, multiple tropical cyclones (TCs) are forecast to develop
across the East Pacific during early to mid-August and one of these TCs could
result in a northward surge of moisture from the Gulf of California. The most
likely area for below normal precipitation exists across the northern to
central Great Plains where little to no rainfall is forecast at the beginning
of August and a dry signal among most tools continues into the latter half of
the month.



The ensemble means are in excellent agreement and maintain good continuity
that
a deep, closed 500-hPa low persists over the eastern Bering Sea with below
normal 500-hPa heights extending east to Mainland Alaska during early August.
Therefore, below normal temperatures are favored for interior western and
central Alaska. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are slightly
elevated for southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle where
temperatures are more likely to average above normal at the beginning of
August
and later in the month. The persistent and amplified trough upstream favors
above normal precipitation throughout a majority of Alaska.





------------------Previous message (from July 15) is
below----------------------





The August 2021 temperature and precipitation outlooks are based on dynamical
model guidance including the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and
Copernicus Multi-Model Ensemble (C3S), statistical tools, current soil
moisture
conditions, and potential influences from modes of tropical variability. The
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) weakened during early July due to interference
with an equatorial Rossby wave and a couple of atmospheric Kelvin waves.
Dynamical models depict the MJO resuming an eastward propagation during the
latter half of July and this could eventually lead to a more favorable
large-scale environment for tropical cyclone (TC) development across the east
Pacific and Atlantic basins later next month. The MJO evolution and its
associated modulation of TC development will be reevaluated at the end of
July.



Anomalous 500-hPa ridging over the middle to high latitudes of western North
America has persisted since early June which resulted in much above normal
temperatures and record-setting heat across the western and north-central
CONUS. Periodic amplification of a downstream trough over the eastern CONUS is
a common feature this summer along with a weakness in the subtropical ridge
along the Gulf Coast. Although the anomalous ridging and associated above
normal temperatures are forecast to shift eastward during week-2 (Jul 22-28),
the week 3-4 dynamical models depict a retrogression of the ridge axis to
western North America heading into August Therefore, the temperature outlook
for the CONUS closely resembles observations during the past 30 days. Above
normal temperatures are favored throughout the western and north-central CONUS
and also along the East Coast. The largest probabilities (above 60 percent) of
above normal temperatures are forecast across the Northern Rockies and
Northern
High Plains, due to very low soil moisture (below the 5th percentile) and good
model agreement. Conversely, high soil moisture (above the 90th percentile)
across parts of the Southern Great Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley, and
Western Gulf Coast supports elevated probabilities of below normal
temperatures
for those areas. Also, favored wetness during August is consistent with this
forecast. Based on dynamical models and decadal trends, above normal
temperatures are favored for Southwest Mainland Alaska along with the
Aleutians
and Alaska Peninsula. Probabilities of above normal temperature are reduced
slightly for the Alaska Peninsula due to negative sea surface temperature
anomalies to its south.



The NMME and a lagged precipitation outlook from soil moisture support
elevated
probabilities of below normal precipitation from the Northern Rockies east to
parts of the Northern to Central Great Plains. Based on decadal trends and the
NMME, above normal precipitation is favored for the Mid-Atlantic, Eastern Corn
Belt, Tennessee Valley, and Lower Mississippi Valley. Although week 3-4
dynamical models depict an enhanced Monsoon during early August, equal chances
(EC) of below, near, or above normal precipitation are forecast for the Desert
Southwest ad Four Corners Region due to weak signals among the monthly tools.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, EC is necessary at this half month time lead for
the monthly precipitation outlook and adjustments are anticipated for the
updated outlook, released on July 31. The elevated probabilities of above
normal precipitation, forecast across northeast Mainland Alaska, are based on
the NMME and consistent with decadal trends.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1991 and 2020, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

The next monthly outlook...for Sep ... will be issued on Thu Aug 19 2021

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1991-2020 base period.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat July 31 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Excessive heat continues today over the interior Pacific
Northwest, the South-Central U.S., and the Deep South before a
cooling trend begins in on Sunday...

...Strong to severe thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall from
the Central Plains and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Southeast
this afternoon reaches the Gulf Coast for Sunday and Monday...

...More rounds of monsoonal moisture expected across the interior
western U.S. with flash flooding possible from the Great Basin to
the Rockies...

Oppressive summer heat has taken a vacation this weekend
throughout the Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast thanks to a
cold front ushering in a much cooler and drier airmass. Saturday's
stifling heat across the Deep South and Southeast will improve
slightly on Sunday but a hot and humid air-mass remains in place
to close out the weekend. However, a cold front responsible for
the injection of cooler and drier conditions in the Northeast this
weekend eventually reaches the Deep South by Monday. Muggy
conditions will likely persist along the Gulf Coast while
comfortable humidity levels stick around in the Northeast and
Great Lakes into start of the work-week.

Precipitation-wise, waves of low pressure developing along an
elongated frontal boundary draped from the central High Plains to
the Southeast is forecast to trigger organized thunderstorms that
could produce isolated tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large
hail today from Kansas to the Carolinas. In addition, heavy
downpours associated with these thunderstorms could lead to flash
flooding in the mid-Mississippi River Valley today. The threat for
severe weather and flash flooding pushes south and east on Sunday
as the cold front becomes positioned over the Deep South. Farther
north, a reinforcing shot of cooler air from Canada ushering in a
swath of showers and some storms across the Great Lakes today
reaches the Northeast by Sunday afternoon. This system will
attempt to merge with one of the aforementioned waves of low
pressure reaching the Mid-Atlantic coast by late Sunday and
produce a period of strong to possibly severe thunderstorms near
the Mid-Atlantic coast. By Monday, high pressure is in control
from the Midwest to the Northeast while scattered thunderstorms
set up shop along the Gulf Coast.

In the West, a ridge of high pressure aloft has anchored itself
over the region and continues to generate excessive heat this
afternoon across the interior Pacific Northwest. An influx of
monsoonal moisture being advected in from the Southwest should
cool down temps in the interior Pacific Northwest on Sunday.
Speaking of monsoonal moisture, there is no shortage of it across
the drought-stricken Intermountain West. However, there is such a
deep reservoir of monsoonal moisture available that showers and
thunderstorms are capable of producing heavy rainfall rates and
could trigger areas of flash flooding. Locations most at risk for
flash flooding are where antecedent soil conditions are overly
saturated or near burn scars. As a result, a handful of Slight
risks for Excessive Rainfall are in place from the Great Basin to
the central Rockies today. The Excessive Rainfall threat on Sunday
shifts a into areas such as Bitterroots and Snake River Valley as
well as the southern High Plains. More rounds of heavy showers and
storms are possible up and down the spine of the Rockies on Monday.

Lastly, Air Quality Alerts remain in effect for portions of
Montana, Wyoming, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and the Tennessee
Valley due to smoke associated with raging wildfires over western
North America being advected into the regions by prevailing
north-northwesterly winds.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0102 AM CDT Sun Aug 01 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will primarily be limited to northern Montana
today as a weak upper-level impulse continues to shift northward
through the Pacific Northwest. Showers and thunderstorms will
continue to overspread eastern WA/OR and much of ID, and while
wetting rainfall seems likely, a few dry lightning strikes are
possible. Conditions will generally remain dry along much of the
West Coast, but weak winds are expected outside of terrain-favored
locations due to a nebulous surface pressure pattern and modest flow
aloft.

...Northern Montana...
An east-to-west pressure gradient over the northern Plains will
continue to filter dry continental air into central MT today with RH
values in the teens to low 20s expected. East/southeasterly winds
are forecast to increase to near 15 mph as a diurnal mixing deepens
through the day. Modest boundary-layer flow will limit the potential
for critical conditions, though occasional gusts up to 20-25 mph are
possible. ERCs remain above the 90th percentile across the region
and will support elevated fire weather conditions.

...Pacific Northwest...
Early morning thunderstorms will likely persist for much of the day
across the Pacific Northwest as the upper-level impulse meanders
north. Regional soundings show an increase in PWAT values over the
past 24 hours due to the northward advection of deeper monsoonal
moisture. This trend will continue and increase the potential for
wetting rainfall - especially through northern ID where latest
ensemble guidance shows high probability for 0.1+ inches of
rainfall. Mostly wet thunderstorms are expected for northern
ID/eastern WA where fuels remain dry, but a few dry lightning
strikes are possible with the initial onset of thunderstorms and
outside of the heavier precipitation cores. A few dry strikes are
also possible along and immediately east of the Cascades where weak
lift and meager instability may support a thunderstorm or two. While
lightning strikes over dry fuels will be a concern, the threat for
widespread dry thunderstorms appears too low to warrant highlights.

...Heavy rainfall threat for parts of the South and the Southeast
Wednesday...

...Overview...

Troughing will persist through the week over the East, in between
flattening ridging out of the northern Rockies and over the
Atlantic. This favors a quasi-stationary boundary astride the East
Coast with embedded areas of low pressure that will promote bouts
of rainfall across especially the Carolinas but also up the coast
to New England. Multi-day rainfall could exceed several inches
over parts of the coastal Carolinas. A system over the Pacific
will slowly work its way into Washington/Oregon later in the week.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest models and ensembles remain in good agreement on the large
scale pattern through the period. Favored a blend of the
deterministic guidance (GFS/ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET) days 3-5,
trending toward the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECENS means by day 7 as the
models diverge on timing of the systems over the central CONUS.
Trends have been for a bit stronger lead-in system into northern
CA/southern OR by early Thu (touching off more showers for
northern ID) and a tad quicker with the upper low into British
Columbia. With support from the deterministic models in each area,
blended/middle ground solution was prudent.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Areas of the North/South Carolina coast in the vicinity of the
frontal boundary will see the highest chance for multi-inch
rainfall totals during the first few days of the period. With
ample moisture off the Atlantic, daily rounds of showers and
storms will be likely with a slow trend in decreasing
coverage/intensity by next weekend as the front washes out. Less
rainfall is expected farther west along the boundary along the
Gulf Coast back into Texas, but some could be enhanced over New
Mexico into southeastern Arizona as mid-level energy meanders over
the area. Over the Northwest, lead-in and Pacific system will
bring in some light rain to the northern Rockies and coastal
Washington, respectively, as the upper trough and surface front
into WA/OR move ashore.

Temperatures will be within a few degrees of normal over much of
the West but trending cooler in the Pacific Northwest as the front
moves ashore. Areas along the Canadian border from eastern Montana
to the western Great Lakes will likely see temperatures 5 to 10
degrees above normal under upper ridging. Much of the
East/Southeast will see near to below normal max temperatures
along and behind the cold front--perhaps as much as 10 degrees
below normal on some days over Texas/New Mexico and over the
Carolinas. Low temperatures will be closer to normal in the
Southeast owing to cloud cover but perhaps a few degrees below
normal in the mid-Mississippi Valley where skies will be clearer.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CDT Sun Aug 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The fire weather potential will generally be low for Monday thanks
to continued rain chances and weak flow at the surface. A few
regional fire weather concerns may evolve (as outlined below), but
confidence in these scenarios is too low to warrant risk areas.

...Central Montana...
A weak surface trough is forecast to shift from the Pacific
Northwest to the northern Rockies by Monday afternoon. This will
maintain dry east/southeasterly winds over the state, which should
result in RH values once again falling into the low 20s and perhaps
high teens. However, The synoptic pressure gradient is forecast to
weaken as a surface high over the northern MS River Valley shifts
east through the day. Consequently, the potential for widespread
sustained winds near or above 15 mph appears low. Elevated fire
weather conditions are possible if winds trend stronger than
currently expected.

...Central Oregon...
While some mid-level drying is expected through the day Monday,
forecast soundings suggest sufficient monsoonal moisture will remain
in place to support modest (around 250-500 MUCAPE) instability.
Thunderstorm chances will increase through the day as lift from an
approaching shortwave trough overspreads the region. PWAT values
generally above 0.75 inches and ensemble QPF guidance suggest mainly
wet thunderstorms are probable, though a dry storm or two is
possible on the periphery of the exiting moisture. One additional
mitigating factor is the potential for wetting rainfall over the
next 24 hours, which may reduce fuel receptiveness by Monday
afternoon. As such, the dry thunderstorm threat will be conditional
on 1) sufficient mid-level drying and 2) minimal rainfall today
(Sunday) over central OR.

...Strong to severe thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall from
the Central Plains and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Southeast
this afternoon reaches the Gulf Coast for Sunday and Monday...

...More rounds of monsoonal moisture expected across the interior
western U.S. with flash flooding possible from the Great Basin to
the Rockies...

A cool air mass will continue to make steady progress through the
central and eastern portions of the country today to offer relief
to the recent spell of oppressive heat.  Showers and thunderstorms
will signal the arrival of the cooler air across the central
Plains to the Tennessee Valley today behind a cold front with
multiple low pressure waves.  Hot and very humid conditions will
persist for one more day today across the Deep South where Heat
Advisories and some Excessive Warnings are currently in effect.
By Monday, more widespread showers and thunderstorms will keep
temperatures at bay through the Deep South as the front edges
closer from the north.  Meanwhile, a reinforcing cold front will
spread showers and some thunderstorms across the lower Great Lakes
today and into northern New England tonight.  This system will
attempt to merge with low pressure wave forecast to develop today
across the Carolinas to help trigger a period of strong to
possibly severe thunderstorms near the Mid-Atlantic coast.  A cool
and dry air mass across the northern Plains will be ushered into
the central U.S. and the Northeast behind the front to begin the
new work week.  Over the Mid-Atlantic region
however, the front is forecast to stall later on Monday which will
encourage the rain to linger and possibly redevelop near the
Carolina coast Monday night as another low pressure wave is
forecast to develop.

In the West, a ridge of high pressure aloft has anchored itself
over the region and continues to generate excessive heat this
afternoon across the interior Pacific Northwest. An influx of
monsoonal moisture being advected in from the Southwest should
cool down temps in the interior Pacific Northwest on Sunday.
Speaking of monsoonal moisture, there is no shortage of it across
the drought-stricken Intermountain West. However, there is such a
deep reservoir of monsoonal moisture available that showers and
thunderstorms are capable of producing heavy rainfall rates and
could trigger areas of flash flooding. Locations most at risk for
flash flooding are where antecedent soil conditions are overly
saturated or near burn scars. As a result, a handful of Slight
risks for Excessive Rainfall are in place from the Great Basin to
the central Rockies today. The Excessive Rainfall threat on Sunday
shifts a into areas such as Bitterroots and Snake River Valley as
well as the southern High Plains. More rounds of heavy showers and
storms are possible up and down the spine of the Rockies on Monday.

Lastly, Air Quality Alerts remain in effect for portions of the
interior Northwest, Arizona, Colorado, the upper Midwest, the
Tennessee Valley and South Carolina due to smoke associated with
wildfires over western North America being transported into the
regions.

In the Pacific Northwest, an influx of monsoonal moisture from the
south should help cool down the temperatures today across the
interior sections, breaking the recent spell of excessive heat.
Speaking of monsoonal moisture, there is no shortage of it across
the Intermountain West.  The associated rainfall is welcoming to
the drought-stricken West but the downpours associated with some
of the thunderstorms are capable of producing heavy rainfall rates
that could trigger areas of flash flooding.  Locations most at

overly saturated or near burn scars.  The Excessive Rainfall
threat today shifts into Idaho as well as the southern High Plains
where thunderstorm activities are forecast to be best focused.
More rounds of heavy showers and storms are possible up and down
the spine of the Rockies as well near the Southeast U.S. coast on
Monday.

Lastly, Air Quality Alerts remain in effect for portions of the
interior Northwest, Arizona, Colorado, the upper Midwest, the
Tennessee Valley and South Carolina due to smoke associated with
wildfires over western North America being transported into these
areas.

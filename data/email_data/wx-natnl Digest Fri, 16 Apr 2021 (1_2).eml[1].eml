30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR MAY 2021

The May 2021 outlooks are issued against the backdrop of a weakening La Nina
and an ongoing strong MJO event. The Nino 3.4 index currently stands at -0.5C,
which represents a significant weakening relative to the value during much of
the past winter when the average index value was near -1.0C. The oceanic La
Nina signal is generally forecast to weaken further in May and ENSO Neutral
conditions are expected to become the most likely scenario as we progress
deeper into Spring. Weakening La Ninas of this magnitude and evolution tend to
result in below normal heights at high latitudes during the month of May,
including most of Alaska. Farther to the south, above normal heights typically
dominate most of the CONUS under such conditions. However, complicating
matters
is an ongoing strong MJO event in the Western Pacific which would tend to
counteract this ENSO signal across much of the forecast domain. Specifically,
composites from strong (defined in this case as a Wheeler-Hendon Index
amplitude greater than 1.0) Western Pacific MJO events occurring this time of
year indicate increased troughing across much of the western CONUS and less
troughing across Alaska during the month of May relative to the underlying
ENSO
signal. It should be noted, however, that the sample size of these MJO
composites is relatively small, thus, reducing the reliability of the signal.
Analysis of the most recent monthly and subseasonal dynamical model guidance,
recent trends, as well as contributions from current environmental conditions,
including soil moisture, snow cover and depth, SSTs, and sea ice extent, were
also utilized in the production of these outlooks. These additional inputs
were
collectively used to resolve the competing background ENSO and MJO signals.



Above normal temperatures are favored for the southern two-thirds of the CONUS
and for much of the Northeast consistent with ENSO composites, trends, and
dynamical model guidance. However, the ongoing MJO event would temper
probabilities, resulting in generally weaker above normal temperature
probabilities from the Rockies westward. Probabilities of warmer than normal
conditions are the greatest (exceeding 60 percent) across the Southern Plains
where warm signals from ENSO composites, dynamical model guidance, soil
moisture, and trends converge with the greatest confidence. Confidence in
above
normal temperatures diminish farther to the north as the current strong MJO
event supports a cold signal across much of the northern tier, which also
coincides with areas where recent trends toward warmer than normal conditions
are at its weakest or absent altogether. This cold MJO signal directly
conflicts with dynamical model guidance, which favors above normal
temperatures
across almost the entire CONUS. For these reasons, equal chances (or EC) of
above, near, or below normal temperatures are indicated across most of the
northern tier of the CONUS. Enhanced probabilities of above normal
temperatures
are also absent for much of Alaska. Deep snow cover, lingering sea ice, and
cold ENSO signals will likely combine to counteract recent trends toward above
normal temperatures across much of the state. Enhanced probabilities of below
normal temperatures are indicated for much of southern mainland Alaska and the
Alaska Panhandle where cold signals from increased snow depth, sea ice, ENSO,
and dynamical model guidance from the NMME, C3S, and ECMWF converge. Above
normal temperatures are favored for parts of northern Alaska where trends are
the strongest. Above normal temperatures are also favored for the Aleutians
where SSTs are near to above normal and trends tilt toward warmer than normal
conditions.



The potential for enhanced north to south temperature gradients is likely to
promote an active pattern across parts of the central and eastern CONUS.
Specifically, dynamical model guidance from the CFSv2, combined ENSO/MJO
composites, and trends support a wet signal stretching from parts of the Corn
Belt eastward across the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic. Therefore, above
normal precipitation is favored for these areas. Enhanced above normal
precipitation probabilities also extend southward to include much of the
Southeast due to support from ENSO/MJO composites and trends. Conversely,
below
normal precipitation is favored across the Southern Plains where dry signals
from the NMME, C3S, ECMWF, soil moisture, and trends converge. Farther to the
west, uncertainty is high as the dry pattern forecast by dynamical model
guidance directly conflicts with a strong wet signal produced by MJO
composites
from northern California to parts of the Central and Northern Rockies.
Additionally, trends are not particularly strong across this region. For these
reasons, equal chances of below, near, and above normal precipitation are
indicated across most the western CONUS. Confidence is somewhat higher across
Alaska as dynamical model guidance and ENSO composites generally agree on a
dry
signal across the southwestern Mainland and the Alaska Peninsula. Conversely,
above normal precipitation is favored across parts of the Alaska Panhandle and
eastern mainland Alaska due to a combination of wet signals from ENSO
composites, trends, and dynamical model guidance.

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1981 and 2010, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

An updated monthly outlook... for May will be issued on Fri April 30 2021

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1981-2010 base period.

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Apr 15 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

La Nina conditions continue across the equatorial Pacific Ocean as indicated
by
oceanic and atmospheric conditions, while indications of a potential
transition
to ENSO-neutral during the May through July period are apparent. The chance of
a return to La Nina increases over the summer, such that La Nina becomes
slightly more favored than ENSO-neutral in autumn. In addition to the forecast
ENSO evolution described above, current anomalous soil moisture along with
numerical and statistical model guidance inform the seasonal temperature and
precipitation outlooks.



The May-June-July (MJJ) 2021 temperature outlook favors above-normal seasonal
mean temperatures for nearly all the contiguous U.S. and for Mainland Alaska
and the Aleutian Islands. Equal chances (EC) of above-normal and below-normal
temperatures are predicted for a region from far southeastern Mainland Alaska
to parts of the Pacific Northwest, including northwestern Oregon and western
Washington. Above-normal temperatures are most likely for the entire forecast
domain from the summer into the beginning of autumn.



The MJJ 2021 precipitation outlook favors above-normal seasonal total
precipitation amounts for central and eastern areas surrounding the Great
Lakes, the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic, and most of the Northeast, except for
northern Maine, as well as southward along the Eastern Seaboard and the
eastern
Gulf Coast. Above-normal precipitation is also favored for northwestern areas
of Alaska, including the north-central coast. Below-normal precipitation is
most likely for a region from the West coast across the Rockies to the central
and southern Great Plains, excluding areas of the Southwest that are
climatologically drier at this time of year. The area of likely below-normal
precipitation is forecast to slowly shift northward and eastward during the
summer seasons while above-normal precipitation continues to be favored along
the Eastern Seaboard and expands westward along the Gulf Coast over the same
period. An area of elevated probabilities for above-normal precipitation is
introduced for parts of the Southwest during the monsoon season.



Equal chances (EC) are indicated for areas where seasonal mean temperatures
and
seasonal total precipitation amounts are expected to be similar to
climatological probabilities.

BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

La Nina conditions continued but weakened during the last month in the
equatorial Pacific Ocean as shown by both oceanic and atmospheric indicators.
Equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies became less negative over
the central equatorial Pacific during the last month. The most recent weekly
value of the Nino3.4 SST index is -0.5 degrees C. SSTs and atmospheric
conditions are likely to be modulated by an ongoing MJO event over the next
few
weeks. Below the surface, the depth and magnitude of negative ocean
temperature
anomalies decreased and currently extend in a shallow layer to a depth of 50
meters from 175 E to 110 W. Positive subsurface oceanic heat content anomalies
are present below 50 meters to depths of 200 meters or more and have expanded
eastward in the western and east-central Pacific Ocean.



Suppressed convection persists across the equatorial Pacific surrounding the

Date Line, while enhanced convection weakened over the western Pacific but
remains over parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Recent monthly average
850-hPa winds continue to show enhanced easterly trade winds across the
western
and east-central equatorial Pacific. Westerly wind anomalies continued at
200-hPa over much of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These ocean and atmosphere
indicators show the coupled ocean-atmosphere system is consistent with
weakening La Nina conditions.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

Forecasts of the Nino3.4 SST index from the NMME show considerable spread in

ensemble members both across the modeling center forecasts and within each
modeling center ensemble by the start of summer. Most guidance favors a
continued decrease in the magnitude of negative SST anomalies over the next
three months, and the official consensus calls for ENSO-neutral with a
probability of 80 percent. Forecasts begin to diverge during the summer months
with some guidance favoring a decrease in Nino3.4 sea surface temperatures,
suggesting a return to La Nina conditions by autumn 2021. The CA and Markov
statistical models in the CPC Nino3.4 SST consolidated forecast indicate a
trajectory towards ENSO-neutral in the autumn, while the CCA predicts a steady
rise in Nino3.4 SST towards El Nino conditions over the summer and autumn
months.

PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Although equatorial Pacific SSTs continue to rise towards climatological
normal
values and are forecast to indicate ENSO-neutral oceanic conditions for MJJ
2021, typical impacts of La Nina are considered in preparing the MJJ 2021
seasonal outlook, as some impacts are likely to result at the start of the
season. Tools used to inform the outlooks include regressions of temperature
and precipitation on the Nino3.4 SST consolidation forecast and the CBaM
forecast tool, that statistically bridges dynamical model Nino3.4 SST anomaly
forecasts from the NMME with observed temperature and precipitation using a
Bayesian methodology.



Current anomalous soil moisture and snow cover are considered and contributed

to the outlook in some locations for the MJJ 2021 season. Dynamical model
forecasts from the NMME and Copernicus (C3S) multi-model ensemble systems are
used extensively for the first six leads when they are available, as was the
objective, historical skill weighted consolidation, that combines both
dynamical and statistical forecast tools. Due to the frequency of back-to-back
La Nina events in the historical record and the consensus ENSO outlook
slightly
favoring La Nina over ENSO neutral, potential impacts of redevelopment of La
Nina is considered in the autumn and winter seasons. Decadal timescale trends
in temperature and precipitation are utilized extensively to inform the
seasonal outlooks at all leads.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - MJJ 2021 TO MJJ 2022

TEMPERATURE

The MJJ 2021 temperature outlook favors above-normal seasonal mean
temperatures
for nearly all the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and for the Alaska Mainland and the
Aleutian Islands. The greatest probabilities for above-normal temperatures are
located over the Southwest in the Four Corners region, exceeding 70 percent,
due to multiple factors including very consistent dynamical model guidance,
low
soil moisture conditions, positive decadal temperature trends, and the support
of statistical forecast tools. Modestly elevated probabilities for above-
normal
temperatures extend eastward across the Southeast and northward along the
Eastern Seaboard to New England, supported by model guidance and positive
decadal trends. Greater uncertainty, related to the early impacts of La Nina
and an MJO event, lower historical forecast skill in model guidance, and
weaker
decadal temperature trends decrease probabilities for above-normal
temperatures
in the north-central CONUS. Consistent with possible lingering La Nina impacts
as indicated by ENSO regressions and hybrid statistical-dynamical "bridging"
tools, equal chances of above-normal and below-normal temperatures are
forecast
for southeastern areas of Alaska and parts of the Pacific Northwest, and the
probabilities of above-normal temperatures have been decreased for the
southern
Alaska Mainland. Negative trends in sea ice coverage and thickness and
positive
decadal temperature trends favor above-normal temperatures for northern areas
of Alaska.



Dynamical model guidance and statistical forecast tools, including those
derived from forecasts of the enhanced probabilities of ENSO-neutral or La
Nina
conditions and decadal timescale trends, favor continued elevated
probabilities
for above-normal temperatures for most of the forecast domain through the SON
2021 season with the greatest chances indicated for the western U.S. and along
the eastern seaboard with slightly lower probabilities for the north-central
CONUS.



Beginning in OND 2021 and continuing through FMA 2022, there is a gradual
increase in the area designated as EC, with an increased chance for La Nina
redevelopment with potential impacts over much of the northern tier of the
CONUS from the Pacific Northwest to the western Great Lakes, and later
southeast Alaska. Other areas of the forecast domain continue to favor likely
above normal temperatures, primarily due to positive decadal temperature
trends.

PRECIPITATION

The MJJ 2021 precipitation outlook favors above-normal seasonal total
precipitation amounts for central and eastern areas of the Great Lakes region,
the Ohio Valley, the Mid-Atlantic, and most of the Eastern Seaboard, excluding
northern Maine, based on the continued influence of La Nina early in the
season, positive precipitation decadal trends, other statistical forecast
tools
including the constructed analog from soil moisture conditions, and some
dynamical model forecasts from the NMME and C3S ensemble systems. There is
considerably greater agreement among dynamical models, however, for a region
of
likely below-normal precipitation from the central and northern Pacific coast
across the Rockies into the Central and Southern Plains. Higher probabilities
for below-normal over the Northern Rockies, exceeding 50 percent in some
areas,
are supported by typical La Nina impacts and dynamical model forecasts.



The area of likely below-normal precipitation is forecast to shift slowly
northward and eastward during the summer and southward into the west-central
CONUS during the autumn, consistent with dynamical model guidance. Above-
normal
precipitation is predicted to persist along much of the Eastern Seaboard
through the summer months, and an area of likely above-normal precipitation
continues for parts of the southeast Atlantic coast and the eastern Gulf Coast
into the early autumn, consistent with the impacts of the likely La Nina or
ENSO-neutral climate conditions, with very low probability of El Nino
conditions over the tropics.



Below-normal soil moisture in the Southwest and southern Rockies may allow for
more efficient heating of the land mass and potentially an enhanced monsoon
circulation. Elevated probabilities for above-normal precipitation are
predicted for parts of the southwest from JJA through ASO 2021, supported in
part by dynamical model forecasts.



Dynamical model guidance supports above-normal precipitation for parts of the
northwestern coast of Alaska from MJJ through ASO 2021, while decadal
precipitation trends related to positive trends in SSTs support above-normal
precipitation for the northern coast through OND 2021. The outlooks from OND
2021 through MJJ 2022 are primarily based on decadal precipitation trends.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1026 AM CDT Thu Apr 15 2021

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA INTO  CENTRAL NEW
MEXICO...

...Pacific Northwest...
Unusually dry conditions for April are expected across the western
portions of the Cascades. Modest easterly flow along the backside of
an approaching mid-level trough will support surface RH near 30%
with winds of 10-15 mph. Below average fuel moisture across much of
the region may support locally elevated fire weather conditions in
the low to mid elevations where pre-green up fuels are supportive of
spread.

The rest of the forecast remains on track with only minor changes.
See the previous discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 04/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Thu Apr 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough is expected to eject into the Plains states
during the day, with a belt of 60+ kt 500 mb flow expected to
overspread a deep, dry boundary layer across portions of the Lower
Colorado River Basin towards the southern High Plains. Rapid surface
low development is expected by afternoon, promoting very dry and
breezy conditions across portions of the Southwest, which will
support rapid wildfire spread.

...Eastern Arizona into New Mexico and Far West Texas...
The combination of boundary-layer mixing/downward momentum transport
of the stronger mid-level flow, and gradient wind given the
deepening surface low, are expected to contribute to widespread 25+
mph sustained westerly surface winds across eastern Arizona into New
Mexico and far west Texas. With widespread 10-20% RH in place
throughout the afternoon, and given dry fuels supporting wildfire
spread, Critical highlights have been maintained. At least Elevated
conditions are also expected farther west across northern portions
of Arizona.

FXUS21 KWNC 151801
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 15 2021

SYNOPSIS: Surface high pressure sourced from the high latitudes is forecast to
be over the Ohio Valley at the beginning of the forecast period. Ahead of this
feature, an advancing cold front may bring heavy rain from the Lower
Mississippi Valley through the Southern Appalachians. Mid-level low pressure
over the northeastern Pacific could result in one or more shots of enhanced
moisture for the Pacific Northwest and Northern California. Mid-level high
pressure is forecast over the Bering Sea, likely keeping Alaska relatively
warm
and dry throughout the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain shifting east-northeastward with time for the
Southern Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southeast, and
Southern Appalachians, Fri-Sat, Apr 23-24.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY APRIL 18 - THURSDAY APRIL 22:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vflPYuMoFyGyvSahozdU__DOjb5iar6HX0vcEwcCFBk-SuDmngXdnopM6agWJ0wIjHBE_TRv$

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 23 - THURSDAY APRIL 29: The slight risk of much below-normal
temperature hazard featured over the three previous outlooks is dropped today.
While below-normal temperatures continue to be forecast over the eastern half
of the CONUS as surface high pressure descends from Canada, the bulk of the
cold air appears likely to occur during Week-1. Concurrently, the Weather
Prediction Center is not highlighting it during Week-1 while local forecast
offices are only messaging localized frost concerns. In light of these
treatments, and increasingly modest signals related to anomalous cold during
Week-2, no much below-normal temperatures are indicated. As this cold air mass
moderates during the period, some heat-related signals are beginning to pop up
in GEFS-based guidance late in Week-2 across portions of the Southern Plains.
However, there is little consensus for heat advisory criteria to be approached
outside for guidance other than the GEFS, limiting confidence to introduce
excessive heat into the forecast. Above-normal temperatures also appear likely
across the western U.S. throughout much of Week-2, although daily highs are
likely to not be hazardous (values ranging from the mid 90s over the Desert
Southwest to mid 70s for lower elevations in the Northern Great Basin).



Model guidance has converged in support of heavy rain potential over the
southeastern quarter of the CONUS early in Week-2 that was highlighted
yesterday by the ECMWF model. This concern is tied to an advancing cold front
that was responsible for the much below-normal temperature hazards featured
earlier in the week. As a result, a slight risk of heavy rain (20% or greater
chance of 1 inch of rain within 24 hours) is posted stretching from the
Southern Plains east-northeastward through the Tennessee Valley and Southern
Appalachians on April 23-24. Much of this region is primed for flooding
concerns with currently observed soil moisture and river levels both well
above
normal. Interested parties are reminded to never drive into water of unknown
depth, and consider preparing for the event by referencing the National
Weather
Service's flood safety materials at:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/flood__;!!DZ3fjg!vflPYuMoFyGyvSahozdU__DOjb5iar6HX0vcEwcCFBk-SuDmngXdnopM6agWJ0wIjIls1L3Y$ .
By
the 25th the bulk of the rainfall with this system is likely to be off the
Mid-Atlantic coast.



The ECMWF has come around somewhat to yesterday's GEFS outlooks regarding
increased anomalous 500-hPa troughing off the Pacific Northwest during Week-2.
This is also manifested in emerging atmospheric river signals in the ECMWF
ensembles focused across northern California and Oregon on the 23rd through
25th. The GEFS also highlights this event, with a secondary pulse of Pacific
moisture possible on the 27th and 28th. Despite the atmospheric river signals,
widespread chances of seeing an inch of rain during 24 hrs in these windows
appear slim, so no heavy precipitation hazard is denoted.



Relatively warm and dry conditions continue to be favored across Alaska during
Week-2. While the above-normal temperatures are likely to accelerate melting
snow and ice across the state, the relatively dry conditions should at least
limit additional water being added to the hydrological system during river
break up season.

Extended Forecast Discussion

253 PM EDT Thu Apr 15 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 18 2021 - 12Z Thu Apr 22 2021

...Multi-day Heavy Rainfall Threat for Florida...

18Z Update: The 12Z deterministic guidance is in very good
agreement through most of the forecast period with a few
exceptions.  The UKMET is stronger and slower with the shortwave
crossing the northern Rockies on Monday, and the ECMWF becomes
more amplified with that trough across the Plains and Midwest
states by Tuesday/Wednesday.  The CMC becomes more out of phase
with additional shortwave energy across southern Canada for the
second half of the forecast period, and the 00Z run was not in as
much agreement as the 12Z run.  Except for some minor timing
differences, there were no major changes with this forecast cycle,
and a blend of the ECMWF and the past two runs of the GFS, along
with some of their respective ensemble means and the 13Z National
Blend of Models, was used as a baseline for the medium range
forecast.  The previous discussion is appended below for
reference. /Hamrick

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the very well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC
GFS/GEFS mean, the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models in a pattern with above normal
predictability days 3-7. This solution maintains good WPC
continuity and is in overall line with later 00 UTC guidance.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf of Mexico and Florida
this weekend and next week will be the focus for several rounds of
potentially heavy rainfall as upper impulses induce a series of
moisture and instability-focusing waves. The greatest risk will be
over northern and central Florida. This may be a significant
multi-day event leading to flooding issues.

Generally light precipitation will be possible near another
frontal system dropping south and eastward through the central and
eastern U.S. for the first half of next week. However, the
North-Central Rockies/High Plains could see moderate snow Sunday
and Monday with the frontal surge/upslope. Supporting the snow
chances will be colder than normal temperatures surging across the
central U.S., with periods of maximum temperatures 10 to 25
degrees below average.

Meanwhile upstream, warmer than average temperatures expected for
the West Coast underneath ridging may moderate early to mid next
week as an upper trough and frontal system digs southward over the
region, but precipitation should be minimal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Thu Apr 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Pacific Northwest...
Easterly flow behind a departing upper low will support dry and
breezy conditions across much of Oregon and Washington Day2/Friday.
Afternoon surface RH minimums around 25-30% are expected with warm
temperatures and the dry downslope air. Winds are not expected to be
overly strong, but 10-15 mph NE winds will support locally elevated
fire weather conditions through the afternoon give the anomalously
dry fine fuels in the lower elevations.

...West Texas and eastern New Mexico...
Elevated fire weather conditions are possible with the residual dry
airmass across far west Texas. Models have backed off on strong
winds suggesting a more localized threat. However, the dry airmass
with RH of 7-15% will likely support deep mixing which may bolster
low-level flow enough for a few hours of elevated conditions across
the region.

..Lyons.. 04/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Thu Apr 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow aloft is expected to persist across the southern
U.S., while a surface cold front surges southward across the Plains
states. Modestly dry and breezy conditions may accompany westerly
downslope flow ahead of the cold front across portions of far west
Texas into the Trans Pecos region, promoting modest wildfire-spread
potential.

...Portions of southwestern Texas...
By afternoon peak heating, 10-20% RH is expected in the vicinity of
the Davis and Chisos Mountains due to deep boundary-layer mixing.
Downslope westerly flow and the departure of a surface low to the
east will both encourage 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds,
coinciding with the favorable RH during the afternoon and preceding
cold frontal arrival. Elevated fire weather highlights have been
introduced since fuels are quite dry and receptive to wildfire
spread.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu April 15 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 21 - 25 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa pattern
across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period.
Dynamical models forecast a  closed 500-hPa low south of the Aleutians and
anomalous ridging over the western CONUS, extending northwest along western
coastal Canada and over Alaska. Downstream of this ridging, a large-scale
trough is predicted over the central and eastern CONUS. Above normal heights
are forecast over Alaska and the western CONUS, while below normal heights are
predicted underneath the mean trough over most of the eastern two-thirds of
CONUS

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across much of Alaska
associated with above normal heights, while forecast troughing and surface low
pressure lead to increased chances of below normal temperatures across parts
of
southeastern Mainland Alaska. Ridging favors above normal temperatures across
the western CONUS. Mean troughing predicted over the central and eastern CONUS
favors below normal temperatures for most of the rest of the CONUS. However,
above normal heights over the Florida Peninsula increase chances of above
normal temperatures consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

Predicted above normal heights favor near to below normal precipitation for
most of Alaska. Enhanced ridging over the western CONUS leads to elevated
chances of near to below normal precipitation over the western CONUS,
extending
eastward to the Northern Great Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and parts of
the Great Lakes region. Increased odds of above normal precipitation are
indicated across the southeastern CONUS, lower Mississippi Valley, and parts
of
the southern Plains, underneath predicted mean troughing.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset by increasing uncertainty in
regards to the precipitation forecast over the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 23 - 29 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is generally forecast to
deamplify and shift eastward compared to the 6-10 day period. A weakening
500-hPa ridge is forecast across the western half CONUS with near to above
normal heights, while a trough is forecast over the northcentral CONUS with
below normal heights. Near to above normal heights are forecast across much of
the reminder CONUS and Alaska.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across southwestern
Mainland Alaska, and parts of the Alaska Panhandle associated with above
normal
heights, while surface low pressure leads to increased chances of below normal
temperatures across southeastern Mainland Alaska and parts of the Alaska
Panhandle. Ridging favors above normal temperatures across the western half of
the CONUS. Elevated chances of near to below normal temperatures are forecast
across most of the remainder of the CONUS associated with mean troughing, but
agreement among temperature tools differ. Increased chances of above normal
temperatures are forecast for the Florida Peninsula, in association with above
normal heights.

There are elevated chances of below and near normal precipitation across
Alaska
due to predicted above normal heights. Slightly anomalous ridging across the
western CONUS elevates chances of near to below normal precipitation over much
of the western and central CONUS. However, above normal precipitation is
favored over the Pacific Northwest related to potential storm systems and
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool. Above normal
precipitation
is favored for much of the eastern CONUS due to the mean troughing.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty in regards to the temperature and precipitation
forecast
over the CONUS.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
403 PM EDT Thu Apr 15 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 18 2021 - 12Z Thu Apr 22 2021

...Multi-day Heavy Rainfall Threat for Florida...

18Z Update: The 12Z deterministic guidance is in very good
agreement through most of the forecast period with a few
exceptions.  The UKMET is stronger and slower with the shortwave
crossing the northern Rockies on Monday, and the ECMWF becomes
more amplified with that trough across the Plains and Midwest
states by Tuesday/Wednesday.  The CMC becomes more out of phase
with additional shortwave energy across southern Canada for the
second half of the forecast period, and the 00Z run was not in as
much agreement as the 12Z run.  Except for some minor timing
differences, there were no major changes with this forecast cycle,
and a blend of the ECMWF and the past two runs of the GFS, along
with some of their respective ensemble means and the 13Z National
Blend of Models, was used as a baseline for the medium range
forecast.  The previous discussion is appended below for
reference. /Hamrick

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the very well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC
GFS/GEFS mean, the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models in a pattern with above normal
predictability days 3-7. This solution maintains good WPC
continuity and is in overall line with later 00 UTC guidance.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf of Mexico and Florida
this weekend and next week will be the focus for several rounds of
potentially heavy rainfall as upper impulses induce a series of
moisture and instability-focusing waves. The greatest risk will be
over northern and central Florida. This may be a significant
multi-day event leading to flooding issues.

Generally light precipitation will be possible near another
frontal system dropping south and eastward through the central and
eastern U.S. for the first half of next week. However, the
North-Central Rockies/High Plains could see moderate snow Sunday
and Monday with the frontal surge/upslope. Supporting the snow
chances will be colder than normal temperatures surging across the
central U.S., with periods of maximum temperatures 10 to 25
degrees below average.

Meanwhile upstream, warmer than average temperatures expected for
the West Coast underneath ridging may moderate early to mid next
week as an upper trough and frontal system digs southward over the
region, but precipitation should be minimal.

...Appreciable snow develops over the Central Rockies into the
Central High Plains, ending overnight Friday;heavy snow will also
develop over the higher elevations of the Northeast...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southern Plains through Friday morning; there is a Moderate
Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Central Gulf Coast on
Friday...

...Critical Fire Weather conditions expected across the Southern
Rockies and the Southwest through Friday morning...

An upper-level low over the Central Rockies will slowly weaken
while moving eastward to the Ohio Valley by Saturday evening.  The
system will produce snow over parts of the Central Rockies/Central
High Plains and Great Basin on Thursday evening.  The snow will
end on Friday morning over the Great Basin while continuing over
the Central Rockies/Central High Plains through early Saturday
morning.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop over parts of the
Southern Plains through late Friday night.  The SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southern
Plains through Friday morning.  The main hazards associated with
the severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gust, and hail. In this area, there is a 10% or
greater probability of two-inch diameter hail.  The thunderstorms
will also produce heavy rain, but flooding is not expected on
Thursday evening.  However, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall over the Central Gulf Coast on Friday into
Saturday morning.  The heavy rain will produce scattered to
numerous instances of flash flooding, some of which could be
significant given the wet antecedent conditions across the area.


Meanwhile, a stronger upper-level low over the Lower Great Lakes
will move very slowly to the Northeast Coast by Saturday morning
and linger there through Saturday evening.  The storm will produce
higher elevation snow and rain over parts of the Northeast through
Saturday evening. Significant snowfall accumulations are expected
over the terrain of New England Thursday night into Friday. As the
western upper-level low moves eastward, rain will develop over
parts of the Central Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley on
Friday evening.

Elsewhere, lighter rain will impact portions of the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys, Southeast, and parts of the Lower Great Lakes and the
Central Appalachians on Saturday.  Over parts of the Southwest and
Southern Rockies, dry and windy weather will make for Elevated to
Critical fire weather conditions through Friday morning.  Red Flag
warnings are in effect for portions of the area.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 AM CDT Fri Apr 16 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
Moderate to strong mid-level flow is expected across the Southwest
as a mid-level shortwave trough shifts eastward. At the surface,
high pressure will build into the northern Rockies which will bring
dry and cool weather to much of the region and offshore flow to
California, Oregon, and Washington.

...Southwest...
Deep mixing is expected this afternoon as temperatures warm into the
upper 60s to mid 70s across southern Arizona and New Mexico into Far
West Texas. This deep mixing will bring strong winds to the surface
and result in 15 to 20 mph sustained winds despite a relaxed surface
pressure gradient. Relative humidity is expected to range from 8 to
13 percent.

...Portions of the Northwest...
Offshore flow is expected across Oregon and Washington through the
day today. This continental airmass will bring relative humidity of
15 to 20 percent to areas east of the Cascades and in the 20 to 25
percent in some areas west of the Cascades. Fuels in the higher
elevations are mostly still moist and in some places snow covered,
but the finer fuels at lower elevation are mostly cured after
limited precipitation for the past several weeks. Upper-level
support gives additional concern for a large fire threat as both
850mb and 500mb flow are forecast to be 40 to 50 mph and forecast
soundings show mixing to at least 850 mb. Thus, despite forecast
winds of 13 to 15 mph west of the Cascades from most forecast
guidance, would not be surprised to see sustained winds approaching
20 mph with higher gusts.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 AM CDT Fri Apr 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
On Saturday, some dry and breezy conditions will be possible from
the Great Basin into the Southwest. However, the strongest winds and
the driest fuels states will be in southeast Arizona where stronger
mid-level flow will be present and deep mixing may bring some of
these winds to the surface. Surface winds of 15 to 20 mph with
relative humidity of 8 to 15 percent is expected and thus an
elevated area is warranted.

Elsewhere, cool/moist conditions are expected with an overall low
fire weather threat.

...Multi-day Heavy Rainfall Threat for Florida...

...Overview...

Strong upper ridging over northwestern Canada (500mb height
anomalies around +3.5 sigma) as well as over the Bermuda Triangle
will favor renewed troughing over the central CONUS next week and
at times in the Northeast and Southwest via split flow. This will
bring cooler than normal temperatures to most of the lower 48 and
push most of the precipitation chances to the south; namely,
Florida. There, a wavy stationary boundary will promote periodic
rainfall which may be heavy at times.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

With the ECMWF and GEFS ensembles in relatively good agreement,
favored the deterministic models that fell within their overlap
the best during the period. This was mostly near the 18Z GFS and
next nearest to the 12Z ECMWF. Uncertainty in the northern stream
flow out of Canada later next week as well as the breakdown of the
upper ridge in the Pacific led to large differences in the upper
pattern over much of the CONUS and, as such, utilized a mostly
ensemble mean blend to mitigate future large changes. Ensemble
trends were toward stronger closed centers in the higher latitudes
suggesting punctuated zonal flow to its south (over the CONUS) and
limited predictability.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf of Mexico and Florida
will be the focus for several rounds of potentially heavy rainfall
as the parallel upper flow from the southwest bring in episodes of
moisture and rainfall. The greatest risk will be over northern and
central Florida where several inches are likely in some areas
during the period. ECMWF EPS EFI highlights the area along and
north of I-4 for anomalous rainfall early in the week, then
sinking southward. This may be a significant multi-day event
leading to flooding issues.

Generally light precipitation will be possible near another
frontal system dropping south and eastward through the central and
eastern U.S. for the first half of next week. However, the central
Rockies/western High Plains could see modest snow on Monday as a
cold front stalls in the area, yielding upslope snow potential.
Temperatures will be much colder than normal early in the week
with sub-freezing highs (15-30 degrees below normal). The cold
airmass will spill onto the southern Plains Tuesday where highs
may only reach the mid 50s over northern TX into OK, which may
challenge record cold highs.

Farther west, warmer than normal temperatures are expected for the
West Coast underneath ridging, though that may be tempered a bit
as a Pacific frontal system digs southward over the region.
Precipitation should be minimal and mainly over the mountains. The
East will see a couple chances of light rain and maybe some wet
snow in far northern areas, with temperatures near to slightly
below normal.

...Snow over the central High Plains gradually tapers off later
today while higher elevations wet snow spreads across the interior
Northeast...

...Focus of showers and thunderstorms shifts from the southern
Plains today to along the Gulf Coast during the weekend...

An upper-level low responsible for the snow across the central
Rockies and nearby High Plains will slowly weaken as it heads
toward the Ohio Valley during the next couple of days.  The snow
currently in these areas will gradually taper off as the day
progresses.  Some of the snow is expected to linger over the
Colorado Rockies and drift south into New Mexico during the
weekend near a frontal boundary.  Meanwhile, a swath of rain will
move eastward across the central Plains as some embedded strong
thunderstorms move through eastern Texas into the lower
Mississippi Valley.  As the upper low moves toward the Ohio
Valley, the focus of showers and thunderstorms will shift from the
southern Plains today to along the Gulf Coast during the weekend.
The highest chance for seeing heavy rainfall will be from central
to eastern Gulf Coast as a low pressure wave forms along a nearly
stationary front and tracks eastward.

Meanwhile, a compact coastal storm is developing just off the New
England coast as an upper-level low over the lower Great Lakes
moves very slowly to east.  The storm will result in gusty winds
and locally heavy rainfall across southeastern New England today.
Farther inland, the presence of colder air will result in higher
elevation wet snow across interior New England where 4 to 10
inches of accumulations are expected today.  The storm is forecast
to gradually move eastward into the Gulf of Maine on Saturday.

Elsewhere, lighter rain will impact portions of the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys, Southeast, and parts of the Lower Great Lakes and the
Central Appalachians on Saturday.  Over parts of the Southwest and
Southern Rockies, dry and windy weather will make for Elevated to
Critical fire weather conditions through Friday morning.  Red Flag
warnings are in effect for portions of the area.

By Sunday morning, the next surge of cold air from Canada should
reach the northern High Plains where mixed rain and snow develops
along with gusty winds and falling temperatures.

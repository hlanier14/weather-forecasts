Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
205 AM EST Sun Jan 09 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 12 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 16 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin on Wednesday with general
ridging over the western U.S. atop a closed southern stream low
near Baja California, while broad troughing ejects disturbances
eastward over the north-central and eastern U.S. during the
period. The southern stream low/trough should track eastward
likely by late Thursday/Friday and spread increasing precipitation
chances from the Four Corners states into the south-central U.S.,
which by the weekend could spread into the East ahead of an upper
trough that may consolidate in the central CONUS.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model agreement remains reasonably good for the early part of the
period Wednesday, but this consensus quickly devolves by
Thursday-Friday as a few features of concern show low
predictability. First, there are some differences among models
with the position of the initial Pacific upper low Wednesday, but
there is at least a consensus with the 12Z GFS/ECWMF/CMC in good
agreement, though especially the 12Z UKMET and to some extent the
18Z GFS were centered farther southwest. The 12Z UKMET shows the
feature basically eroding in place on Thursday rather than
tracking eastward inland, which is not favored at this time, as
other guidance (except the currently incoming 00Z ECMWF) shows the
energy moving across the Four Corners and Southern Plains, though
timing varies a bit. Upstream, more disagreement arises with the
handling of the next Pacific trough/upper low approaching the West
Coast Thursday-Friday. Most GFS runs have indicated a closed low
with this feature and a slower track towards the West Coast, with
recent runs showing a northeastward turn. Meanwhile guidance such
as the 12Z/00Z CMC and 12Z ECMWF have an open shortwave Thursday
that spills energy southeastward into the West by Friday, which
may be more reasonable, but ensemble members exhibiting a huge
variety in how this energy interacts and evolves with the first
feature and the overall ridging, so confidence is low.

Meanwhile in the East, shortwaves moving through the broad trough
also display some variety among models in terms of their track and
strength. One main outlier was the 18Z GFS by around Friday, which
consolidated energy to create a closed mid-upper low in the
western Atlantic and thus brought a deep surface low/nor'easter
close to the East Coast. This track close to land is not favored
and not supported by incoming 00Z model guidance either. Then a
strong bout of additional energy could make its way into the
Midwest on Saturday and expand troughing farther south as well,
but with some variability in the trough axis and thus the
associated cold frontal track and areas of possible precipitation
chances for the weekend.

The WPC medium range forecast blend was thus based on a blend of
the 12/18Z GFS, 12Z ECMWF, and 12Z CMC deterministic guidance
early on, phasing out the 18Z GFS by day 5 and lessening the
proportion of deterministic models in favor of the GEFS and EC
ensemble means that demonstrated okay agreement, albeit with
weaker features as usual. By days 6/7 used 60% means to lessen
individual model differences.

...Weather Highlights...

Moderate to heavy precipitation could continue on Wednesday in the
favored higher elevations of the Olympics and northern Cascades,
though the heaviest precipitation is forecast over Vancouver
Island as a weak atmospheric river takes aim at the region.
Meanwhile, the southern stream Pacific upper low influencing the
Southwest will spread precipitation to the Four Corners states and
then into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley by
Thursday and Friday as it tracks inland and a low pressure/frontal
system develops. Shortwaves moving through the northern stream
could spread light lake effect/enhanced snow to the Great Lakes
around midweek, but chances for wintry weather could ramp up by
the latter part of the week for the Midwest/Great Lakes underneath
the stronger shortwave energy dropping through the region. As the
split flow appears to phase by next weekend, precipitation should
spread to the Eastern Seaboard, with rain in the South and the
possibility for snow in the Northeast, but with uncertainty in the
details at this time.

After a chilly day in the Eastern Seaboard on Wednesday,
especially in the Northeast where lows will be 10-20F below
average, temperatures should moderate closer to normal or a bit
above there by the latter part of the week. The central U.S. will
see considerably warmer than normal conditions, with a widespread
area in the Plains/Mississippi Valley seeing highs 10-20F above
average, even warmer in localized areas. Meanwhile, lows will be
15-25F above normal in the Northern Plains. Then by next weekend,
as cooler high pressure systems build in behind cold fronts, highs
should be right around average for this time of year in most
places, with pockets that are a few degrees cooler than normal for
highs, while lows should be a few degrees milder than normal in
the East.

...Troublesome freezing rain to spread across parts of the
northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast today...

...Heavy rain possible across parts of the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys and Southern Appalachians to end the
weekend, while isolated severe thunderstorms may impact the
Central Gulf Coast States...

...Bitter cold temperatures located throughout the Northern Plains
and Upper Midwest to extend into the Great Lakes today and
Northeast by Monday...

As a potent cold front continues to push across the Midwest this
morning, widespread shower activity is found from the Lower
Mississippi Valley to the Lower Great Lakes. Rain is expected to
enter the Northeast early this morning, where surface temperatures
remain below freezing. This will create conditions conducive for
freezing rain to impact areas from the central Appalachians and
northern Mid-Atlantic to Interior sections of the Northeast and
New England. Light ice accretion below a tenth of an inch is
expected for most places, with greater potential for up to a
quarter of an inch found from central Pennsylvania to southern
Vermont. Meanwhile, a light mixture of sleet and snow is possible
across northern New England. Winter Weather Advisories have been
issued in order to highlight the potential weather hazards.
Residents in this region are urged to check the latest forecast
and road conditions before traveling. Even a glaze of ice can
create dangerous situations on roadways and walkways.

Farther south, the aforementioned cold front is expected to clash
with a warm and moist airmass in place over the Deep South.
Widespread rain showers and scattered thunderstorms will impact
parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valley and Southeast today, before the
cold front and most leftover precipitation exit the U.S. early
Monday morning. Isolated instances of flash flooding are possible
throughout the Lower Mississippi Valley this morning and Tennessee
Valley/Southern Appalachians by this afternoon as localized
rainfall totals potentially add up to as much as 2 inches. A slim
chance for severe weather also exists for the Central Gulf Coast
States between Louisiana and central Georgia today. Isolated
tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large hail are all possible as
thunderstorms develop along and ahead of the approaching cold
front.

A large arctic high pressure system building across the
north-central U.S. is partially responsible for a repository of
cold air found throughout the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
With blustery winds added to the equation, dangerously cold wind
chills are found in this region as well. Wind Chill Warnings are
in effect for north-central North Dakota and far northeast
Montana, with Wind Chill Advisories extending from north-central
Montana to northern Wisconsin. Here, wind chills this morning may
reach as low as minus 40 degrees and could cause frostbite on
exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes. Bitter temperatures are
expected to expand into the Great Lakes today behind the
aforementioned cold front and reach into the Northeast on Monday.
Low temperatures in these regions are forecast to reach into the
single digits, with subzero readings likely over the Interior
Northeast and New England on Tuesday morning. The cold weather
pattern and strong west-northwesterly winds will lead to
atmospheric conditions ripe for heavy lake effect snow downwind of
Lake Superior and Lake Ontario. Parts of the U.P. of Michigan and
Tug Hill Plateau of New York may experience localized snowfall
totals over a foot by Tuesday morning.

Elsewhere, quiet weather and a warming trend will be found
throughout the Great Plains leading into the beginning of the
workweek. Otherwise, dry conditions are expected for much of the
western U.S. outside of the Pacific Northwest as light
precipitation enters on Monday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CST Sun Jan 09 2022

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A large upper-level ridge will persist across the Intermountain
West, with surface high pressure encompassing much of the western
and central CONUS. Along the northern portion of the upper-ridge, a
belt of enhanced northwesterly midlevel flow will favor surface
troughing in the lee of the northern and central Rockies.

...Northern and Central High Plains...
In response to the surface lee troughing, breezy west-southwesterly
surface winds will be possible across parts of the northern and
central High Plains. Presently, RH appears to remain above critical
thresholds and fuels look unreceptive to wildfire spread.

...Southern California...
Breezy/gusty offshore flow will continue across parts of southern
California, though RH should generally remain above 25 percent. In
addition, fuels are expected to remain unsupportive of a substantial
fire-weather threat.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CST Sun Jan 09 2022

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level ridge will amplify over the Intermountain West,
with cool surface high pressure overspreading much of the western
and central United States.

...Southern Plains...
A modest pressure gradient along the southern periphery of the
surface high will support 15-25 mph northerly surface winds across
the southern Plains. However, relatively cool temperatures should
limit substantial RH reductions across the region. The best overlap
of breezy northerly winds and modestly low RH (20-25 percent) should
develop over parts of the southern TX Panhandle into the TX South
Plains, where a few hours of locally elevated fire-weather
conditions will be possible during the afternoon.

...Southern California...
Breezy/gusty offshore flow will develop across portions of southern
California in response to the building high pressure over the
Intermountain West. With that said, RH should generally remain above
25 percent. Upon collaboration with the local forecast offices,
fuels are expected to remain unsupportive of wildfire spread owing
to the substantial rainfall and cool temperatures through much of
December.

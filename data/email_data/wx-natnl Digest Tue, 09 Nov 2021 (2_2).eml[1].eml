...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low into later this week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later this week...


...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Anticipated flow transition will lead to development and passage
of an amplified upper trough over the central to eastern U.S.
Friday/Saturday as a potent surface low lifts northeastward
through the Midwest/Great Lakes into eastern Canada. An attendant
cold front will sweep eastward across the East, favoring a swath
of moderate to locally heavy rain as fueled by long fetch moisture
influx from the Gulf of Mexico and the western Atlantic. The
progressive nature of the front may limit runoff threat, but the
best potential may be over favored terrain of interior New
England. Enhanced wrap-around then lake effect snows are expected
from the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and into the northern
Appalachians/Northeast.
Cold air and return moisture flow with another potent upper
shortwave/surface system digging into the Midwest/Great Lakes
onward on the heels of the lead storm will favor local snows
across the region.

Meanwhile upstream, another long fetch plume of Pacific moisture
will feed into the Pacific Northwest, Friday into Saturday before
easing. Subsequent rounding flow with embedded shortwaves may also
support additional periods of enhanced precipitation later this
period. Overall, favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably similar larger scale
pattern evolution and forecast clustering has improved slightly
through this forecast period. Accordingly, the WPC medium range
product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend of best
clustered guidance from the GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble
means along with the National Blend of Models days 3-7
(Friday-next Tuesday). This strategy acts to maintain decent
system depths and detail consistent with a pattern with near
average predictability. WPC product continuity is also well
maintained.

...Rain and higher elevation snow over parts of the Pacific
Northwest, Northern/Central California, and Northern Rockies/Great
Basin...

...Temperatures will warm up over parts of the eastern third of
the country...

This afternoon, a front will come onshore over the Pacific
Northwest and move eastward to the Upper Great Lakes to the
Southern High Plains by Thursday.  The system will produce rain
and higher elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest, with mostly
rain over Northern/Southern California. The rain and snow expand
into the Northern Rockies and Great Basin this evening.  As the
system moves out of the Rockies, the rain will develop over parts
of the Northern Plains by Wednesday morning. The rain will move
into parts of the Upper Midwest with some light snow over northern
Minnesota on Wednesday evening into Thursday.  Showers and
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Middle Mississippi
Valley into the Southern Plains by Wednesday afternoon. The
showers and thunderstorms will move into the Lower Mississippi
Valley by Thursday morning.

Meanwhile, a front, farther inland, over the Great Lakes to the
Southern Plains will move eastward to off the Northeast Coast by
Wednesday, with the trailing front extending roughly southwestward
to parts of the Southern Plains. Ahead of the boundary,
temperatures will warm up over the eastern third of the country
today. Furthermore, the front will produce light rain over parts
of the Northeast to the Ohio Valley overnight tapering off over
Northern New England by Wednesday morning.  Another front will
begin to come onshore over the Pacific Northwest overnight
Wednesday into Thursday morning, bringing more heavy rain to the
Northwest.

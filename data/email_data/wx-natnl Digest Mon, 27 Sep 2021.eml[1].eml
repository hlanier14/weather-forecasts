1108 AM CDT Sun Sep 26 2021

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA INTO
SOUTH-CENTRAL KANSAS...

No changes necessary to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 09/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Sun Sep 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
Split mid-level flow is expected across the western and central US
as a strong shortwave trough moves onshore across portions of the
Pacific Northwest. At the same time, a weak upper low across the
Southwest will meander northward and re-enter the stronger mid-level
westerlies near the Four Corners. At the surface, a lee low will
move southeastward, supporting dry and windy conditions across the
southern Plains, while shower and thunderstorm chances increase
across the Southwest.

...Southern Plains...
Ahead of the area of low pressure moving southeastward across the
Great Plains, hot, dry and gusty southwesterly winds are expected
across portions of the Texas Panhandle, western Oklahoma and
southern Kansas. Surface temperatures near 90F (10-15 deg above
normal) will likely support widespread surface RH of 10-20% across
portions of Texas and Oklahoma through peak heating. A robust
morning low-level jet should linger through the day, enhancing
low-level winds to 20-25 mph in the afternoon.

Slightly stronger flow and somewhat higher gusts may persist farther
northeast near the low and trailing surface trough across portions
of eastern Kansas. Here, surface RH is expected to be higher due to
increasing low-level moisture advection from the Gulf of Mexico. By
mid afternoon, surface RH of 20-25% and winds of 20-30 mph will
likely develop over mostly dry fuels.

Persistent hot and dry conditions combined with little recent
rainfall suggest fuels remain mostly supportive of fire spread
across the southern Plains. However, some guidance depicts a greater
increase in mid and high cloud cover early in the forecast period
across portions of Texas and western Oklahoma. This casts some
uncertainty on diurnal RH minimums and curing of fine fuels. Despite
these concerns, model agreement is strong on the development of
gusty winds across much of the southern Plains supportive of
widespread elevated to critical fire weather conditions.

...Northern Great Basin...
On the southern fringes of the approaching upper trough, stronger
mid-level flow is forecast to cross the Sierra and move into
portions of the northern Great Basin. Downslope winds of 15-20 mph
are expected to overlap warm and dry surface conditions with RH of
10-15%. Local fuels remain receptive to fire spread suggesting
elevated fire weather conditions are likely from portions of
northern California, into northwestern Nevada and southern Oregon.

...Portions of the northern/central Rockies...
As mid-level flow increases ahead of the Pacific Northwest trough,
dry downslope flow should gradually develop across much of the
Intermountain west. Synoptic forcing remains rather broad,
suggesting portions of eastern Idaho, central Montana and southern
Wyoming, may experience stronger wind gusts and accompanying dry
fuels/surface conditions supporting local fire weather potential.
Terrain enhancement will likely support surface winds of 15-20 mph
with RH near 15-20%. In areas of dry fuels, locally elevated to
critical fire weather conditions can be expected for a few hours in
the afternoon and evening.

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWESTERN NEVADA...

Minor adjustments to the elevated area based on current ensemble
guidance. The forecast otherwise remains on track.

..Wendt.. 09/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Sun Sep 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong Pacific trough is forecast to continue inland across the
West Coast early Monday, bringing an increase in southwesterly flow
to much of the Great Basin and western US. At the surface, a dry
cold front across Oregon will move south, bringing an increase in
low-level winds and the potential for critical fire weather
conditions across portions of the Sierra and Great Basin.

...Northern Great Basin...
As the strong Pacific trough continues to move eastward through the
day, a 70-80 kt mid-level jet streak will begin to overspread
northern California and the Great Basin by midday. The increase in
strong southwesterly flow will support deep mixing and bolster
low-level winds to 20-30 mph through the afternoon. Dry downslope
trajectories off the High Sierra and a persistent warm and dry
airmass across much of the region will favor low humidity values of
10-15% from northern California, through northern Nevada and into
portions of southern Oregon. Fuels remain receptive to spread
suggesting widespread elevated to critical fire weather conditions
are likely.

A cold front will approach later in the afternoon and evening as the
trough ejects northeastward. Little precipitation is expected along
the front, but locally gusty winds and a change in direction
associated with the frontal passage may increase potential for
short-term fire weather concerns later in the forecast period. The
fire weather threat should gradually diminish behind the front after
dark, as a cooler and more moist airmass moves in.

Locally elevated fire weather conditions may also briefly develop
ahead of the cold front across portions of eastern Idaho and
southwestern Montana. Here, strong wind gusts of 20-25 mph appear
likely through the afternoon. However, confidence in widespread low
humidity is lacking. Nonetheless, fuels mostly support fire spread
suggesting some fire-weather threat before frontal passage in the
late afternoon/evening.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
257 PM EDT Sun Sep 26 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Sep 29 2021 - 12Z Sun Oct 03 2021

...Overview...

The Wednesday-Friday part of the forecast will feature an
amplified upper pattern as ridging in the east-central U.S.
separates an East Coast trough (most likely with an embedded
closed low over the Northeast) and mean troughing over the West.
Initial western trough energy should split, with the southern part
forming a Southwest upper low and the rest tracking into the
northern tier U.S./southern Canada. Heading into/through the
weekend the pattern should flatten somewhat as a Pacific shortwave
reaching western North America continues on toward the mean ridge
position and heights over a majority of the West generally rise.
Late this week the Southwest upper low and moist inflow will lead
to heavy rainfall potential over southern portions of the Rockies
and Plains.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Within the East Coast upper trough, guidance is slowly
consolidating toward the idea of the initial eastern Canada upper
low dropping into New England by around late Wednesday/Thursday
with a possible northeastward drift by Friday. New 12Z model runs
reinforce this scenario. GEFS means generally remain on the
northern side of the spread while the 06Z GFS displayed a
west-of-consensus wobble around Friday. Depending on specifics of
the upstream pattern, digging flow on the western side of the
upper trough could elongate the feature by Friday-Saturday. The
00Z ECMWF and 12Z UKMET are the proponents of that idea but the
new 12Z ECMWF has adjusted flatter.

Meanwhile the eventual combined evolution of shortwave energy
reaching the northern Plains/southern U.S. late this week along
with the ridge downstream has become increasingly problematic over
the past day, in terms of the range of potential surface patterns
and rainfall distribution late this week through next weekend.
Latest GFS runs have been cutting the shortwave energy into the
downstream ridge while also closing off an upper high over eastern
Canada, leading to a wet system affecting northern/central parts
of the East and ejecting the East Coast upper trough. With some
different specifics the 00Z CMC also brought a system into the
East, while the 12Z run abandoned that scenario. Remaining models
as well as the ensemble means (including at most only a faint hint
of GFS ideas in the GEFS mean) hold onto a more pronounced
east-central North America mean ridge aloft with surface high
pressure continuing to dominate over the eastern U.S. For the
purposes of a single deterministic forecast the preference is to
favor the ensemble mean/ECMWF scenario over the eastern half of
the country next weekend, which also maintains reasonable
continuity.

On average today's guidance is a tad weaker with the core of the
upper low expected to form over the Southwest by Thursday. A
moderate amount of spread develops for the upper low track by
Friday, at that point fairly typical for a forecast that far out
in time. However after Friday the guidance shows greater
divergence and run-to-run variability than seen yesterday. Now the
envelope ranges from lingering over the Arizona/New Mexico border
(00Z ECMWF) to shearing well northeastward into the Plains
(GFS/GEFS mean/CMC runs).

The main item of note for shortwave energy reaching the Northwest
around Friday is that the new 12Z CMC is quite extreme relative to
other guidance as the shortwave nears the coast and then forms a
rather deep upper low that ends up off the northern California
coast by Sunday. Consensus suggests only a small part of this
shortwave may get left behind somewhere over the eastern
Pacific/western U.S. while the rest continues onward to push a
cold front across the northern U.S./southern Canada.

The days 3-5 Wednesday-Friday operational model blend split the
GFS component among 00Z and 06Z runs since the 00Z run compared
somewhat better to other guidance for the New England upper low.
Preferences toward the ensemble means/ECMWF over the East after
Friday led to a rapid transition of the blend to 50-70 percent
total ensemble mean weight for days 6-7, continuing with more
ECens than GEFS due to the former better maintaining the New
England/Canadian Maritimes upper low. The forecast maintained some
00Z ECMWF input while decreasing GFS weight to a low enough level
not to affect the eastern U.S. pattern.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Central parts of the Plains will see showers and thunderstorms
around midweek as moisture pools ahead of a shortwave and frontal
boundary, and some rain could spread to the Upper Midwest on
Thursday and Friday. The greater chance for multi-day
accumulations of multiple inches of rain will be across the
southern High Plains beginning Thursday or Thursday night and
lasting into the weekend, as the upper low in the Southwest
provides moist inflow from the Pacific and the low-level pattern
brings a feed of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Uncertainty
over the eventual track and timing of the Southwest upper low
somewhat tempers confidence for the specifics of rainfall duration
and intensity. The Pacific Northwest can expect precipitation on
Wednesday into Thursday, with the highest totals in the Olympics
and northern Cascades, and some snow is possible at the highest
elevations. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are likely across
southern Florida as a couple of fronts move through. Areas of
light rain are possible across the Eastern Seaboard, most likely
over the Northeast, due to the upper low/trough. Over the
remainder of the East, high pressure should keep most areas dry
through most of next weekend aside from any rainfall accompanying
a front that could reach the Great Lakes by Sunday. However there
is a low-probability chance of more moisture extending into the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and beyond.

Mean ridging aloft and warm low level flow ahead of a couple
fronts will support above normal temperatures from the Dakotas
into the Upper Midwest through the period. Most days should
feature at least some locations with plus 10-20F anomalies and
daytime highs reaching into the 70s and 80s. On the other hand
much of the West will see well below normal temperatures on
Wednesday with coolest highs of 10-20F below normal likely to be
centered over the Great Basin. By late week and the weekend expect
the coolest anomalies for highs to settle into the southern
Rockies/High Plains due to the clouds/precipitation over the
region. Also next weekend the West Coast states and vicinity
should see temperatures rise to moderately above normal levels as
the western U.S. mean trough aloft weakens and possibly even gives
way to some degree of upper ridging. Fairly modest temperature
anomalies should prevail over the East with above normal readings
over the South mid-late week and below normal highs in the
Northeast for as long as the forecast upper low persists over the
region.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun September 26 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Southwest through Tuesday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern/Central Plains, Great Basin, Middle Mississippi
Valley, and Northern Rockies...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Central Plains and an Elevated Risk over portions of California,
Nevada, and Oregon...

Upper-level low and moisture over the Southwest will aid in
producing widely scattered showers and thunderstorms over the area
through Tuesday. Some of the thunderstorms will produce heavy
rain, but this will be isolated.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Southwest
through Tuesday morning.  The associated heavy rain will create
localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that experience
rapid runoff with heavy rain. The upper-level low will slowly move
northeastward to the Central Rockies by Tuesday.  Moisture will
flow northward over the Southern/Central Plains Monday into
Tuesday, setting the stage for showers and thunderstorms to
develop over parts of the Central and Southern Plains on Monday
evening and Tuesday evening.

Meanwhile, a front extending across the Upper Midwest will slowly
move eastward to the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Coast westward to the
Middle Mississippi Valley by Tuesday. Showers and thunderstorms
will develop along and ahead of the front starting on Monday
afternoon over parts of the Lower Great Lakes into the Northeast
that will settle into parts of the northern Mid-Atlantic and
Southern New England by Tuesday.

In the meantime, a front will move onshore over the Pacific
Northwest by Monday morning, moving inland to the Northern High
Plains to the Great Basin by Tuesday.  The system will start
producing rain over parts of the Northwest overnight Sunday and
slowly move over parts of Northern California by late Monday
morning.  The rain will continue to march inland to the Northern
Intermountain Region by late Monday while continuing over the
Pacific Northwest through Tuesday.

Additionally, upper-level ridging ahead of the boundary will allow
temperatures to become 10 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern/Central Plains, Great Basin, Middle Mississippi
Valley, and Northern Rockies over the Northern Rockies.  The warm
temperatures and gusty wind led to conditions favorable for a
Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the Central Plains and
an Elevated Risk over parts of California, Nevada, and Oregon
through Monday morning.  Therefore, Red Flag Warnings are up over
portions of California, Nevada, and Oregon.  Red Flag Warnings are
also up over parts of the Northern Rockies and the
Central/Southern Plains.  Furthermore, weak high pressure at the
surface and upper-level ridging over California will create light
wind over the San Joaquin Valley provides stagnant airflow.
Therefore, Air Quality alerts are over parts of California due to
wildfire smoke through Monday.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
242 AM EDT Mon Sep 27 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Sep 30 2021 - 12Z Mon Oct 04 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Thursday with an amplified upper
pattern across the contiguous U.S., as ridging in the east-central
U.S. separates a closed low centered over the Northeast and mean
troughing over the West. Initial western trough energy should
split, with the southern part forming a Southwest upper trough or
low and the rest tracking into the northern tier U.S./southern
Canada. Heading into/through the weekend the pattern should
flatten somewhat as a Pacific shortwave reaching western North
America continues on toward the mean ridge position and heights
over a majority of the West generally rise. Late this week the
Southwest upper low and moist inflow will lead to heavy rainfall
potential over southern portions of the Rockies and Plains.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 12/18Z model guidance continues to consolidate around the idea
of a closed upper low centered over the Northeast U.S. Thursday
with a gradual drift northward Friday and into the weekend. Some
differences remain with the roundness or narrowing of the low as
well as the timing of its movement north, with the 12Z GFS as well
as the GEFS means perhaps northern outliers by Saturday. The 18Z
and new 00Z GFS keep the low farther south. On the other hand, the
12Z UKMET split energy southward toward the Mid-Atlantic region by
Friday into Saturday, but its new 00Z run came in closer to
consensus. Thus leaned toward a 12Z EC/ECens mean/CMC and 18Z GFS
solution for the upper low in the East through the weekend.

In the West, guidance has tended to remain somewhat weaker with
energy and the potential for a closed southern stream low in the
Southwest for the latter part of this week. There is still
potential for a closed low at times, but some guidance
(particularly GFS runs) appear to keep the northern and southern
streams a bit more connected rather than closing off a low. But
overall a multi-model deterministic blend worked for this feature.

Meanwhile, a couple of rounds of shortwave energy in the northern
stream with the western trough continue to have some agreement
issues among the guidance. An initial shortwave could move through
the north-central U.S. and/or south-central Canada for the latter
part of the week, but with track and speed differences. Then with
the second shortwave, there is general agreement for it to move
into the Pacific Northwest on Friday, but with some differences
beyond that time. Initially the major outlier is the 12Z CMC,
which has the potent shortwave spinning southward and closing off
an upper low near northern California by early Saturday, unlike
other guidance, which eventually splits energy across the Pacific
but weaker and farther offshore. Through the weekend and into
early next week, the shortwave differences impact the central
CONUS quite a bit. 12/18/00Z GFS runs have energy from both
shortwaves interacting to produce troughing across the Dakotas and
Midwest by Sunday and even forming a closed low over those areas
by Monday. There is some semblance of a north-central U.S. trough
particularly in the GEFS means, with the 12Z EC ensemble mean
showing some mild evidence for it as well. Thus the forecast
trended in the direction of a trough, but not nearly as strong as
the operational GFS runs, and confidence is quite low by early
next week. The WPC forecast quickly trended toward using the
ensemble means by the latter part of the medium range period.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Southern parts of the Rockies and Plains can expect multiple days
of widespread and potentially heavy rainfall for the latter half
of the week, as the upper low in the Southwest provides moist
inflow from the Pacific and the low-level pattern brings moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico. The specifics of rainfall duration and
intensity remain somewhat uncertain given model differences in the
timing and track of the Southwest upper low, but the current
forecast shows 2 of 4 inches of rain with locally higher amounts
in the southern High Plains. Periods of rain are also possible
farther north toward the rest of the Plains and the Midwest in the
vicinity of a couple of frontal boundaries. The Pacific Northwest
should see precipitation lasting through Thursday, with
orographically enhanced amounts in the Olympics and northern
Cascades, and some snow is possible at the highest elevations.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are likely across southern
Florida as a couple of fronts move through. The rest of the East
should be generally dry underneath high pressure, other than
showers in the Northeast mainly Thursday due to the nearby upper
low, and some possible moisture approaching the Ohio Valley into
the Mid-Atlantic by Sunday.

Warmer than average temperatures are forecast across the
north-central tier of the CONUS through the period, with highs in
the 70s, even 80s in the Midwest underneath upper ridging. On the
other hand, high temperature anomalies of 10-20F below average
should be centered across central/southern portions of the Rockies
and High Plains given the clouds and precipitation over the
region. The West Coast should warm up above normal by the weekend,
while slightly below average temperatures are expected for the
Northeast for as long as the forecast upper low persists over the
region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN GREAT
BASIN...

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a strong trough over the Pacific Northwest is
forecast to stall across the Rockies as mid-level ridging builds to
the east. At the surface, a cold front will move onshore and across
the northern Great Basin late in the forecast period. At the same
time, a weak upper low over the southern Plains and Southwest will
continue to bring scattered showers and thunderstorms to portions of
the Plains.

...Northern Great Basin...
Increasing southwesterly flow aloft will move across the High Sierra
and spill into the northern Great Basin this afternoon and evening.
Regional model soundings show deep a deep and well-mixed boundary
layer supporting surface momentum transfer from a 70-80 kt jet
aloft. Strong surface winds of 20-30 mph and higher gusts will
overlap with the deeply mixed boundary layer where widespread
surface RH below 15% will be common. The favorable combination of
strong wind gusts, low surface RH and dry fuels should support
widespread elevated and critical fire weather conditions.

The fire weather threat should continue into the evening ahead of a
fast moving dry cold front moving out of southern Oregon. Strong
surface gusts greater than 30 mph will be possible along the front
as well as a direction shift to the northwest. Fire weather concerns
will gradually diminish behind the front later in the evening as
cooler temperatures and better RH recoveries develop.

Locally elevated fire weather conditions will likely extend into
portions of eastern Idaho and southwestern Montana ahead of the
front this afternoon. Here, less confidence exists on widespread
strong surface winds and gusts. Fuels however remain very dry,
suggesting some threat for locally elevated to near critical
conditions before frontal passage later in the day.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Mon Sep 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
The stalled mid-level trough over the northern Rockies is forecast
to weaken considerably through the forecast period as it phases with
the weak upper low moving across the southern Plains. A strong
surface low and cold front, associated with the trough, will move
south out of Alberta into eastern Montana by early afternoon. The
Strong wind ahead of and along the front, as well as dry surface
conditions, will support critical fire weather conditions across
portions of the northern Rockies/High Plains Tuesday.

...Northern Rockies...
As the main jet streak associated with the weakening upper trough
moves northward into southern Alberta/Saskatchewan, a lee low should
develop and rapidly deepen across eastern Montana early Tuesday. As
the low moves southeastward, it should continue to strengthen,
falling below 1000 hPa near midday. To the south across portions of
the western Dakotas and eastern Wyoming and Montana, low-level
isallobaric mass response from the rapid-deepening low and a
developing lee trough will support strong southerly surface winds
through the day. Model soundings show a deep and well-mixed boundary
layer with diurnal RH minimums of 10-20%. With the strong surface
pressure gradients and deep mixing to near 600 mb, boundary-layer
max winds of 20-25 mph and higher gusts should develop. Fuels remain
very favorable for fire spread, as little precipitation has allowed
them to reach near the 98th percentile of dryness over the last
several days. Thus, widespread elevated and critical fire weather
conditions are expected for a few hours through the afternoon.

...Northern California...
Dry post frontal northerly/northeasterly winds in the Sacramento
Valley may support local areas of elevated fire weather concern
Tuesday afternoon and early evening. While not expected to be overly
strong, the gusty winds and dry conditions will occur in areas of
high to extreme fuel dryness and several ongoing large fires. Some
increase in local fire danger appears likely despite limited spatial
coverage.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEASTERN WYOMING
SOUTHEASTERN MONTANA AND NORTHWESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...

...Synopsis...
The stalled mid-level trough over the northern Rockies is forecast
to weaken considerably through the forecast period as it phases with
the weak upper low moving across the southern Plains. A strong
surface low and cold front, associated with the trough, will move
south out of Alberta into eastern Montana by early afternoon. The
Strong wind ahead of and along the front, as well as dry surface
conditions, will support critical fire weather conditions across
portions of the northern Rockies/High Plains Tuesday.

...Isolated chances for flash flooding found across parts of the
Southwest and Four Corners region through Wednesday morning...

...Cold front to bring unsettled weather and cooler temperatures
for the Northwest today and Northern Rockies by Tuesday...

...Well above average and potentially record-breaking warmth found
throughout the central/northern Plains and Midwest...

An upper-level low pressure system advancing across the Southwest
will help produce a few more rounds of scattered showers and
thunderstorms as the monsoon season draws to a close. Given the
sufficient moisture in place, intense rainfall rates will be
possible and could create isolated instances of flash flooding. A
Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued
for parts of central Arizona and western New Mexico, as well as
the Four Corners region through Wednesday morning. Farther north,
a potent cold front in tandem with a deep upper-level trough is
currently approaching the Pacific Northwest and is expected to
swing into the northern Great Basin by this evening. Widespread
showers and much cooler temperatures will be found behind the cold
front. In fact, high elevation snow will be possible on Tuesday
across the Northern Rockies as the system advances eastward.
Another potential hazard to contend with across the western U.S.
over the next couple of days is the threat of critical fire
weather. Gusty winds combined with low relative humidity and dry
fuels may produce conditions ripe for wildfires to spread
uncontrollably throughout northern Nevada in particular.

For the central U.S., autumn is nowhere to be found as high
temperatures rise into potentially record-breaking territory today
and Tuesday. A strong upper-level ridge and persistent southerly
flow will allow for temperatures to rise into the 90s throughout
much of the Great Plains and parts of the Midwest. These warm
temperatures are likely to extend as far north as the Dakotas,
where temperatures are forecast to reach 20 to 30 degrees above
average. A dozen or so daily high temperature records could fall,
mostly found across the northern and central Plains. Elevated to
critical fire weather is also a concern for sections of the
northern High Plains on Tuesday as southerly winds increase in
intensity.

Elsewhere, a cold front dropping south across the Northeast and
Ohio Valley today could spark a few severe thunderstorms. By
Tuesday, this frontal boundary and isolated severe weather threat
will shift into the Mid-Atlantic. Gusty winds and large hail are
expected to be the primary potential weather hazard. Showers and
thunderstorms are also expected to increase in coverage across the
western Gulf Coast and Southern Plains early this week. A few
severe storms are not out of the question on Tuesday as
thunderstorms develop along a dryline situated between the
Oklahoma Panhandle and West Texas.

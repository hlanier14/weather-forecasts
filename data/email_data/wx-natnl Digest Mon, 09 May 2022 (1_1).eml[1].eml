Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 AM CDT Sun May 08 2022

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN NEW
MEXICO...SOUTHEAST COLORADO...WESTERN OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS
PANHANDLES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS...

*Widespread Extremely Critical fire weather conditions likely today
and into this evening.*

...Portions of the southern High Plains...
Morning surface observations showed poor overnight humidity
recoveries persisting across much of central into eastern NM and the
southern High Plains.  Widespread single digit RH values along with
wind gusts of 30+ mph already ongoing should continue to grow in
coverage across the region as strong upper level flow overspreads
the Southwest. Fuels remain very volatile and widespread extremely
critical fire weather conditions are expected to develop and
persists through much of the day today into overnight Monday. The
Extremely Critical area remains unchanged with only minor
adjustments to the eastern extent of the Elevated/Critical zones
where cooler and more moist conditions are being observed near a
cold front across northwestern OK.

...Central Florida...
Warm and dry surface conditions may develop for a few hours today
across the central FL Peninsula. Area RAP soundings show humidity
values in the 25-35% range may briefly overlap with wind gusts of
10-15 mph this afternoon. While fuels will be somewhat tempered by
recent precipitation, they remain dry enough to support some locally
elevated/critical fire weather potential.

..Lyons.. 05/08/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0123 AM CDT Sun May 08 2022/

...Synopsis...
Significant wildfire-spread concerns are expected across portions of
the Southern High Plains today. An 80+ kt mid-level jet streak will
impinge on the southern Rockies as a broad mid-level trough
continues to amplify across the western/central U.S. Rapid
surface-low intensification is also expected to occur across the
central High Plains. Strong gradient flow from the intensifying
surface cyclone, and downward momentum transport of the stronger
flow aloft via a well-mixed boundary layer, will both promote very
windy, dry surface conditions conducive to dangerous wildfire
spread.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
As the boundary layer mixes through the afternoon, widespread 25+
mph sustained west-southwesterly winds will develop as RH dips below
15 percent on a widespread basis. Widespread Elevated to Critical
fire weather conditions are expected to overspread much of the
Southwest into the southern High Plains. However, a corridor exists
across much of central/eastern New Mexico into southeast Colorado
and the western Texas Panhandle where 25+ mph sustained winds (with
higher gusts) will overlap with single-digit RH and anomalously dry
fuels for at least a few hours this afternoon. These dangerous
conditions will support very rapid wildfire spread with any new
starts and exacerbate existing fires, perhaps supporting extreme
fire behavior, warranting the expansion of Extremely Critical
highlights across the southern High Plains.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
249 PM EDT Sun May 8 2022

Valid 12Z Wed May 11 2022 - 12Z Sun May 15 2022

...Blocky pattern next week to support record heat over the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest along
with episodes of central U.S. convection and an emerging onshore
rainfall focus to the Carolinas...

19Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in excellent synoptic
scale agreement through the end of the week, with the main
exception being the UKMET that is more amplified with the trough
exiting the Desert Southwest and emerging over the western High
Plains by Friday, and also slightly faster with the inland
progression of the hybrid/closed low system approaching the
southeast U.S. coast.  Although some timing and magnitude
differences are more apparent with the north-central U.S. trough
and the storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest for next
weekend, there is still above average agreement on the overall
pattern with the deterministic GFS and ECMWF close to their
respective ensemble means.  In terms of QPF, there was enough of a
signal in the UKMET/ECMWF/CMC to add a small Slight Risk area for
excessive rainfall on Day 4 across portions of north-central
Minnesota.  Taking this into account, the WPC forecast was
primarily derived from a CMC/GFS/ECMWF blend with a little bit of
the UKMET, and then about 60% of the deterministic guidance and
40% of the means by next Sunday.  The previous forecast discussion
follows below. /Hamrick
---------------

...Overview...

Latest models and ensembles maintain the idea of a blocky pattern
through late week.  An upper ridge will support a prolonged period
of well above normal temperatures (challenging daily records over
some areas) over the Mississippi Valley/central-southern Plains
extending into New England.  At the same time, mean troughing
containing a couple separate features will produce chilly and
unsettled weather over the West while waves/fronts and a dry line
will promote episodes of rain and thunderstorms between these two
regimes.  A retrograding upper ridge over the Atlantic will likely
push an initial western Atlantic upper low back toward the
southern part of the East Coast, increasing rainfall over central
and southern portions of the East.  Most guidance suggests that
the pattern will open up during next weekend, leading to a ridge
building over the West and a mean trough axis reaching the
Plains/Mississippi Valley.  This would finally bring a drying
trend over the northern Plains and vicinity and increasing
rainfall coverage over the eastern half of the country.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance continues to display some meaningful differences with
important forecast details.  The interaction among an ejecting
western U.S. trough/possible embedded upper low and incoming
Pacific flow has been a persistent uncertainty over recent days,
with the character of the Pacific energy as it continues across
the lower 48 also in question.  Meanwhile the models appear to
have become a little worse over the past day in terms of spread
and run-to-run variability for the upper low expected to
retrograde into the Southeast.

On the positive side for the western evolution through late week,
previously fast GFS/slow ECMWF runs have now trended closer to
each other (GFS starting its slower trend in its 18Z run) in
bringing the initial California upper low into the northern Plains
by early Friday--leading to similarly deep surface low pressure in
18Z/00Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF runs.  CMC runs have tended to be an
eastern extreme with this system.  The new 00Z run is still well
east of those GFS/ECMWF runs but at least not to such a pronounced
degree as the prior 12Z version.  On the other hand the latest
UKMET runs have been tracking the upper low extremely far south
from late Thursday onward due to being flatter with the arriving
Pacific flow.  Based on guidance available through the 18Z cycle,
a blend emphasizing the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF (tempered a bit due to
uncertainty) offered the most reasonable starting point for the
forecast.  The new 00Z ECMWF is just a bit faster/weaker aloft,
resulting in weaker/eastward adjustment for the northern Plains
surface low.

By next weekend the operational models have been varying with the
details of the overall trough reaching the central U.S. as an
upper ridge builds into the West.  While not perfectly consistent
over the past couple days, the ensemble means have been more
stable than individual model runs so the preference was to add
steadily more ensemble mean weight later in the forecast.

As for the Atlantic upper low tracking into the Southeast, the
track and timing appear to have become more sensitive to embedded
shortwave details.  As of the 12Z/18Z cycles, the GFS/ECMWF and
their respective means provided the best clustering for most of
the period while the UKMET strayed farther west and the CMC was to
the east.  In the new 00Z runs the UKMET/CMC look more reasonable
into Friday while GFS is farther northeast, but then the CMC
strays increasingly northward.  The new 00Z ECMWF has also made a
pronounced northward adjustment from Friday onward.
Progression/opening of the low will depend on unresolved details
of the trough reaching the Plains/Mississippi Valley.

Above guidance comparisons/preferences led to starting the updated
forecast with a blend of the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF early in the period
followed by gradually more input from their ensemble means,
reaching a total of 40-60 percent by next weekend.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Strong upper ridging will lead to persistent much above normal
temperatures over the central-southern Plains and most of the
Mississippi Valley through the week, with some of this warmth also
extending through the Great Lakes and Northeast.  Expect a broad
area of highs/morning lows 10-20F above normal with some pockets
of anomalies reaching higher than that.  Numerous daily records
are likely through the week over the southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley, and may also extend into the central
Plains/Midwest especially around midweek.  Temperatures could also
challenge record highs over a few places in the Northeast late in
the week.  Highest heat index values will tend to be from the
Lower Mississippi Valley into southern Texas with maximum values
approaching or reaching 100F at some locations.  The excessive
heat, gusty winds, and dry conditions leading to an elevated fire
weather threat across parts of the southern High Plains into
midweek should moderate thereafter.  Weakening of the upper ridge
and an approaching cold front should help to start a cooler trend
over the Plains/Mississippi Valley by the weekend.

Over the West, the initial system beginning to push inland should
bring highs of 10-15F below normal to parts of Nevada and
California on Wednesday and then incoming Pacific energy will
bring a brief episode of minus 5-15F anomalies for highs over the
Northwest/northern Rockies Thursday-Friday.  Otherwise the region
will see a warming trend as an upper ridge builds in by next
weekend, bringing highs up to 10-15F or so above normal over and
just east of California at that time.  Highs over the Southwest
could even approach daily records at a few places on Sunday.
Periods of rain and higher elevation snow will tend to be light to
moderate, but a system arriving around Thursday may enhance totals
somewhat over favored terrain in the Northwest.

Between the two contrasting regimes through late week, the central
U.S. will see periods of rain and thunderstorms.  Initial focus on
Wednesday will be along a warm front lifting through the northern
Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley, followed by a system emerging
from the West and tracking over the northern Plains
Thursday-Friday. This system will then push a wavy north-south
front across the central U.S. with timing and wave details (and
thus specifics of highest rainfall totals) still dependent on
specifics of trailing dynamics flowing through the West.  These
fronts and the ejecting western system may produce some areas of
significant rainfall that would be a runoff threat over northern
tier areas that already have very wet soil.  Some areas over the
central U.S. may see a threat for strong to severe convection,
with details likely to become more clear over coming days.

The western Atlantic upper low forecast to retrograde into the
Southeast should start to spread moisture farther inland around
Friday.  Expect moisture to expand in coverage during the weekend
as the upper low lifts northward and opens up in response to the
upper trough reaching the central U.S.  Currently expect the
highest rainfall totals to be over portions of the Carolinas into
Virginia.

...Blocky pattern next week to support record heat over the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest along
with episodes of central U.S. convection and an emerging onshore
rainfall focus to the Carolinas...

19Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in excellent synoptic
scale agreement through the end of the week, with the main
exception being the UKMET that is more amplified with the trough
exiting the Desert Southwest and emerging over the western High
Plains by Friday, and also slightly faster with the inland
progression of the hybrid/closed low system approaching the
southeast U.S. coast.  Although some timing and magnitude
differences are more apparent with the north-central U.S. trough
and the storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest for next
weekend, there is still above average agreement on the overall
pattern with the deterministic GFS and ECMWF close to their
respective ensemble means.  In terms of QPF, there was enough of a
signal in the UKMET/ECMWF/CMC to add a small Slight Risk area for
excessive rainfall on Day 4 across portions of north-central
Minnesota.  Taking this into account, the WPC forecast was
primarily derived from a CMC/GFS/ECMWF blend with a little bit of
the UKMET, and then about 60% of the deterministic guidance and
40% of the means by next Sunday.  The previous forecast discussion
follows below. /Hamrick
---------------

...Overview...

Latest models and ensembles maintain the idea of a blocky pattern
through late week.  An upper ridge will support a prolonged period
of well above normal temperatures (challenging daily records over
some areas) over the Mississippi Valley/central-southern Plains
extending into New England.  At the same time, mean troughing
containing a couple separate features will produce chilly and
unsettled weather over the West while waves/fronts and a dry line
will promote episodes of rain and thunderstorms between these two
regimes.  A retrograding upper ridge over the Atlantic will likely
push an initial western Atlantic upper low back toward the
southern part of the East Coast, increasing rainfall over central
and southern portions of the East.  Most guidance suggests that
the pattern will open up during next weekend, leading to a ridge
building over the West and a mean trough axis reaching the
Plains/Mississippi Valley.  This would finally bring a drying
trend over the northern Plains and vicinity and increasing
rainfall coverage over the eastern half of the country.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance continues to display some meaningful differences with
important forecast details.  The interaction among an ejecting
western U.S. trough/possible embedded upper low and incoming
Pacific flow has been a persistent uncertainty over recent days,
with the character of the Pacific energy as it continues across
the lower 48 also in question.  Meanwhile the models appear to
have become a little worse over the past day in terms of spread
and run-to-run variability for the upper low expected to
retrograde into the Southeast.

On the positive side for the western evolution through late week,
previously fast GFS/slow ECMWF runs have now trended closer to
each other (GFS starting its slower trend in its 18Z run) in
bringing the initial California upper low into the northern Plains
by early Friday--leading to similarly deep surface low pressure in
18Z/00Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF runs.  CMC runs have tended to be an
eastern extreme with this system.  The new 00Z run is still well
east of those GFS/ECMWF runs but at least not to such a pronounced
degree as the prior 12Z version.  On the other hand the latest
UKMET runs have been tracking the upper low extremely far south
from late Thursday onward due to being flatter with the arriving
Pacific flow.  Based on guidance available through the 18Z cycle,
a blend emphasizing the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF (tempered a bit due to
uncertainty) offered the most reasonable starting point for the
forecast.  The new 00Z ECMWF is just a bit faster/weaker aloft,
resulting in weaker/eastward adjustment for the northern Plains
surface low.

By next weekend the operational models have been varying with the
details of the overall trough reaching the central U.S. as an
upper ridge builds into the West.  While not perfectly consistent
over the past couple days, the ensemble means have been more
stable than individual model runs so the preference was to add
steadily more ensemble mean weight later in the forecast.

As for the Atlantic upper low tracking into the Southeast, the
track and timing appear to have become more sensitive to embedded
shortwave details.  As of the 12Z/18Z cycles, the GFS/ECMWF and
their respective means provided the best clustering for most of
the period while the UKMET strayed farther west and the CMC was to
the east.  In the new 00Z runs the UKMET/CMC look more reasonable
into Friday while GFS is farther northeast, but then the CMC
strays increasingly northward.  The new 00Z ECMWF has also made a
pronounced northward adjustment from Friday onward.
Progression/opening of the low will depend on unresolved details
of the trough reaching the Plains/Mississippi Valley.

Above guidance comparisons/preferences led to starting the updated
forecast with a blend of the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF early in the period
followed by gradually more input from their ensemble means,
reaching a total of 40-60 percent by next weekend.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Strong upper ridging will lead to persistent much above normal
temperatures over the central-southern Plains and most of the
Mississippi Valley through the week, with some of this warmth also
extending through the Great Lakes and Northeast.  Expect a broad
area of highs/morning lows 10-20F above normal with some pockets
of anomalies reaching higher than that.  Numerous daily records
are likely through the week over the southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley, and may also extend into the central
Plains/Midwest especially around midweek.  Temperatures could also
challenge record highs over a few places in the Northeast late in
the week.  Highest heat index values will tend to be from the
Lower Mississippi Valley into southern Texas with maximum values
approaching or reaching 100F at some locations.  The excessive
heat, gusty winds, and dry conditions leading to an elevated fire
weather threat across parts of the southern High Plains into
midweek should moderate thereafter.  Weakening of the upper ridge
and an approaching cold front should help to start a cooler trend
over the Plains/Mississippi Valley by the weekend.

Over the West, the initial system beginning to push inland should
bring highs of 10-15F below normal to parts of Nevada and
California on Wednesday and then incoming Pacific energy will
bring a brief episode of minus 5-15F anomalies for highs over the
Northwest/northern Rockies Thursday-Friday.  Otherwise the region
will see a warming trend as an upper ridge builds in by next
weekend, bringing highs up to 10-15F or so above normal over and
just east of California at that time.  Highs over the Southwest
could even approach daily records at a few places on Sunday.
Periods of rain and higher elevation snow will tend to be light to
moderate, but a system arriving around Thursday may enhance totals
somewhat over favored terrain in the Northwest.

Between the two contrasting regimes through late week, the central
U.S. will see periods of rain and thunderstorms.  Initial focus on
Wednesday will be along a warm front lifting through the northern
Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley, followed by a system emerging
from the West and tracking over the northern Plains
Thursday-Friday. This system will then push a wavy north-south
front across the central U.S. with timing and wave details (and
thus specifics of highest rainfall totals) still dependent on
specifics of trailing dynamics flowing through the West.  These
fronts and the ejecting western system may produce some areas of
significant rainfall that would be a runoff threat over northern
tier areas that already have very wet soil.  Some areas over the
central U.S. may see a threat for strong to severe convection,
with details likely to become more clear over coming days.

The western Atlantic upper low forecast to retrograde into the
Southeast should start to spread moisture farther inland around
Friday.  Expect moisture to expand in coverage during the weekend
as the upper low lifts northward and opens up in response to the
upper trough reaching the central U.S.  Currently expect the
highest rainfall totals to be over portions of the Carolinas into
Virginia.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 08 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Sun May 08 2022

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL INTO
NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO...PORTIONS OF SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO AND THE
WESTERN PANHANDLES....
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS....

*Widespread critical to extremely critical fire weather conditions
are again expected Monday afternoon and evening across portions of
the central and northeastern NM onto the southern High Plains.*

...Central into northeastern NM, the Panhandles, and southeastern
CO...
Changes to the outlook include an expansion of the Extremely
Critical area northwestward along the Raton Mesa into portions of
southeastern CO. Higher confidence in terrain aided gusts in excess
of 35 mph has developed suggesting the potential for high-end
critical to extremely critical conditions for a few hours Monday
afternoon.

Farther east across portions of the OK/TX Panhandles, confidence in
sustained and gusting surface winds reaching Extremely Critical
criteria is lower as the upper jet is forecast to retreat
northwestward through the day. The greatest potential for
wind-dominated fire growth appears to remain closer to the corridor
of maximum surface winds farther northwest. However, very dry
surface conditions and occasional stronger gusts may still support a
few hours of high-end critical and locally extremely critical
farther east where fuels remain quite dry. The Extremely Critical
area was trimmed westward to account for the greater model
consensus.

..Lyons.. 05/08/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Sun May 08 2022/

...Synopsis...
Broad upper troughing will prevail across the western and central
U.S., with an embedded mid-level impulse ejecting into the northern
Plains and a second, less pronounced mid-level impulse impinging on
the Rockies tomorrow/Monday. The approach of this second impulse
will encourage surface low development across the central/southern
High Plains, supporting another dangerous day of dry/windy
conditions conducive to rapid wildfire spread across the
Southwest/southern High Plains.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Similar to today, boundary-layer mixing and gradient flow will
encourage the development of widespread 20+ mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds and 10-15 percent RH across much of
the Southwest into the southern High Plains tomorrow, warranting
both the maintenance and expansion of Elevated/Critical highlights.
Guidance consensus also depicts a corridor of 25+ mph sustained
winds (with higher gusts) overlapping with 10 percent RH (perhaps
locally lower in spots) and anomalously dry fuels, promoting
dangerous conditions supporting extreme fire behavior. Extremely
Critical highlights were introduced where the most volatile surface
meteorological conditions and receptive fuels will coincide for at
least a few hours Monday afternoon.

...Building Heat Wave to engulf much of the Nation's Heartland;
Extreme fire danger expected to persist from the Southwest to the
southern High Plains...

Pacific Northwest; stormy and wet in the Northern Plains...

An intensifying upper level level ridge atop the Nation's
Heartland and strong southwesterly flow extending from the Desert
Southwest to the Upper Midwest will lead to an ensuing heat wave
from the Southern Plains to the Midwest. Daytime highs in the 90s
are anticipated from central Iowa all the way south to the central
Gulf Coast and South Texas. "Deep in the Heart of Texas", highs
could surpass the century mark for a second straight day after
today. In these areas, Heat Advisories have been posted for parts
of South and West Texas. Daytime high temperature anomalies on
Monday will range between 20 to 30 degrees above normal from the
Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles to central Iowa. By Tuesday,
summer-like heat continues in the same areas but abnormally hot
conditions arrive in the Great Lakes. Daytime record high
temperatures are likely to be broken throughout much of the
South-Central U.S. both Monday and Tuesday. Meanwhile, the deep
upper trough in the Northwest and a strengthening upper ridge in
the Heartland fosters high winds throughout the Southwest. High
Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories have been issued from southern
California on east to the southern High Plains. The combination of
strong winds, very low relative humidity levels, and dry fuels,
has given way to a dangerous stretch of fire weather from eastern
Arizona to the southern High Plains. The SPC has issued an
Extremely Critical Risk of fire weather for portions of eastern
New Mexico, southeast Colorado, and the western portions of the
Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles today. On Monday, the Extremely
Critical Risk areas remains confined to some of the same areas,
but with a very large Critical Risk area still in place throughout
the same region. SPC does have a Critical Risk area out for
Tuesday as well, meaning the threat for dangerous fire weather
conditions will likely stretch into the middle of the work-week.

While the Nation's Heartland bakes in the first real taste of
summer for 2022, the West and East Coasts will remain on the
abnormally cooler side. The coolest conditions versus normal are
expected along the West Coast and extending into the northern
Rockies. Monday features both record cold max and min temps in
parts of northern California and the interior Pacific Northwest
with lingering pockets of possible record cold min temps in
northern California Tuesday morning. In addition to the cold,
unsettled weather will be common throughout the Northwest as the
region sits under the aforementioned upper low and rounds of upper
level disturbances bring occasional scattered showers and mountain
snow to the higher elevations of the Northwest. In particular, the
Shasta/Trinity range of northern California are under Winter Storm
Warnings where snow totals are forecast to exceed 6 inches. A
little farther east, the Northern Plains and Midwest will also
witness a pair of frontal systems triggering showers and
thunderstorms across these regions. Some storms could be severe in
the Northern Plains with the most active day being Monday in the
Midwest where a Slight Risk is in place in central Iowa, southeast
Minnesota, and southwest Wisconsin. Overall, 1 to 2 inches of rain
are expected in the central Dakotas. A Slight Risk for Excessive
Rainfall has been posted for parts of eastern South Dakota and
northwest Minnesota today and a Marginal Risk for much of North
Dakota and northern Minnesota.

Elsewhere, severe storms are forecast to fire along the dryline in
West Texas on Tuesday where a Slight Risk for severe weather is in
place. The most tranquil weather pattern will set up along the
East Coast where and elongated area of High Pressure will remain
entrenched throughout the first half of the work-week. A lingering
low off the Mid-Atlantic coast will still lead to choppy seas and
high surf up and down the Eastern Seaboard. Plus, chilly
temperatures for mid-May will stick around through Tuesday with
daytime highs struggling to get out of the 60s from southern New
England to the Virginia and North Carolina Tidewater regions. Even
the lows on Monday morning will be quite cold in the central
Appalachians where Frost Advisories are in effect. Warmer the
normal temperatures will first spill over into northern New
England by Tuesday. The East Coast as a whole will remain dry
through the first half of the week with the lone exception being
beaches from the DelMarVa on south along the Southeast coast where
occasional passing showers are possible.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST
NEW MEXICO INTO SOUTHEAST COLORADO AND THE WESTERN OKLAHOMA AND
TEXAS PANHANDLES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A broad cyclonic upper flow pattern will remain in place across the
western and central CONUS as an embedded mid-level impulse ejects
into the northern Plains today. Still, considerably strong mid-level
flow is poised to graze the Southwest into the southern High Plains
as a surface low develops over or near the Colorado Front Range.
Very dry and windy conditions will develop during the afternoon and
promote dangerous wildfire-spread potential, both with new fire
starts and with preexisting fires.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
By afternoon, boundary-layer mixing and development of the Colorado
surface low will encourage 20-25 mph sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds amid 5-15 percent RH across the southwest quadrant of
the U.S., where widespread Elevated/Critical fire weather highlights
are in place. An Extremely Critical delineation remains across
northeast New Mexico into southeast Colorado, where the latest
guidance consensus depicts the strongest winds/gusts to coincide
with near-single-digit RH and anomalously dry fuels for at least a
few hours. This volatile combination of windy and dry conditions
atop fuels experiencing an exceptional drought may foster extreme
behavior among ongoing fires, as well as promote the rapid spread of
new starts throughout the afternoon.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST...

...Synopsis...
While stronger mid-level flow will continue to shift northward into
the northern Plains through tomorrow/Tuesday, prevailing cyclonic
flow aloft and modest surface lee troughing across the High Plains
will trigger a mass response in the form of very dry westerly winds
across the Southwest. Given the presence of very dry fuels and no
beneficial rainfall in sight, significant wildfire-spread potential
will continue wherever drier/windier conditions materialize.

...Southwest...
The combination of downslope flow and the downward momentum
transport of the stronger mid-level flow (via boundary-layer mixing)
will support the development of widespread 15-25 mph sustained
westerly surface winds amid 10-15 percent RH. Elevated highlights
have been introduced wherever any dry/windy conditions are expected
to overlap fuels that are at least modestly receptive to wildfire
spread. Critical highlights were also introduced where the most
favorable surface wind/RH overlap will occur for several hours
tomorrow afternoon, and where fuels are critically to exceptionally
receptive to significant wildfire spread.

...Blocky pattern through late week to support record heat over
the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest
along with episodes of central U.S. convection and an emerging
onshore rainfall focus to the Carolinas...

...Overview...

The start of the period will feature a mean trough aloft over the
West, ridging that extends from the southern Plains through Great
Lakes/Northeast, and an upper low off the Southeast coast.
Temperatures will likely challenge daily records under and near
the upper ridge axis late this week while parts of the West will
see chilly weather with rain and higher elevation snow.  Between
these regimes, a storm system emerging over the northern Plains
may produce some areas of heavy rainfall where wet ground
conditions already exist.  Then during the weekend and early next
week most guidance shows the pattern transitioning toward a
western ridge/east-central U.S. trough configuration.  This
evolution should finally push the rainfall focus to the east of
the Plains.  The initial upper low tracking into the Southeast
around Friday due to a retrograding Atlantic ridge should quickly
lift northward and open up during the weekend, with associated
rainfall spreading into and north from the Carolinas.  The ridge
building over the West will lead to increasing coverage of very
warm to hot temperatures over the southern half of the West during
Saturday-Monday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Based on guidance available through the 12Z/18Z cycles, the 18Z
GFS and 12Z ECMWF/CMC provided the most compatible and consistent
cluster for the overall forecast through the period along with
reasonable support from the ensemble means.  The starting blend
used those three operational runs for about the first half of the
period and added in a moderate weight of 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means
thereafter.

GFS/ECMWF continuity and trends of other guidance still seem to be
pointing more toward some variation of a GFS/ECMWF scenario for
the vigorous system expected to emerge from the West and track
over the northern Plains into southern Canada late this week.
Aside from some detail variability, GFS/ECMWF runs converged
fairly well over the past day or so while the previously fast CMC
has been gravitating in their direction.  UKMET runs had been the
most extreme with a southern track of the western upper low/trough
but the new 00Z run is finally trending in a favorable direction.

Behind this system, models and ensembles still show a moderate
amount of spread for the character of trailing energy that
consensus shows flowing through the Northwest and then sharpening
over the Plains and east-central U.S. while ridging builds into
the West.  The favored model cluster mentioned above fit well
within the ensemble mean template but the new 00Z cycle has
introduced more spread in opposing directions, as the GFS has
trended flatter with the trough (due to stronger depiction of
shortwave energy reaching the West by Monday) while the CMC forms
a closed low farther south than other guidance.

Finally, latest trends for the upper low reaching the Southeast
coast around early Friday have been toward faster northward
progression after that time along with opening of the low by late
Saturday.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The strong upper ridge extending from the southern Plains through
the Great Lakes/Northeast as of Thursday will promote much above
normal temperatures from much of the Plains and Mississippi Valley
through the Great Lakes and Northeast late this week.
Highs/morning lows will be at least 10-20F above normal with some
embedded plus 20-25F anomalies possible from the central Plains
into Great Lakes, and locations across a fairly broad area may
challenge daily records.  After Friday expect the above normal
temperatures to be more confined to the Great Lakes/Northeast and
the far southern Plains/western Gulf Coast region.  There will be
a lingering potential for daily records over the Northeast into
Saturday and over eastern Texas and vicinity through the end of
the period.

The frontal system and upper dynamics crossing the Northwest late
this week will produce a brief period of enhanced rain and high
elevation snow as well as highs 5-15F below normal.  Meanwhile the
southern part of the West should moderate to slightly above normal
by Friday.  Then arrival of the upper ridge will extend the
warming trend over the West through the weekend.  Highs of 10-20F
above normal should expand from California eastward from Saturday
onward and some locations could reach record highs by
Sunday-Monday.  Northern areas of the West should be closer to
normal and one or more fronts may produce periods of light to
moderate precipitation over the Pacific Northwest.

Late this week the system emerging from the West and developing
over the northern Plains before tracking into southern Canada,
along with associated fronts, may produce areas of heavy rainfall
over parts of the far northern tier where some areas are quite
sensitive to added rain due to very wet ground conditions.  The
experimental Day 4 (Thursday-Thursday night) Excessive Rainfall
Outlook has introduced a Slight Risk area over parts of northern
North Dakota and Minnesota where there is the best overlap of
guidance signals for significant rain and instability, along with
high soil moisture.  Depending on system evolution, areas farther
west back to the northern High Plains could also see significant
rainfall.  Some locally moderate to heavy showers and
thunderstorms will be possible farther south along the wavy
trailing front (which may hang up for about a day as western
energy catches up to it) but so far with less agreement for
specifics.  The Storm Prediction Center is also monitoring the
potential for severe weather, so check the latest outlooks for
updated information.  Rainfall and the focusing front should
become more progressive from Saturday onward, leading to a drier
trend over the Plains.  Retrogression of the western Atlantic
upper low into the Southeast toward the end of the week should
spread rain into the Carolinas and vicinity by around Friday with
some of this moisture spreading northward thereafter. Highest
totals should be over or near the eastern Carolinas.  Amounts
farther north should trend lighter due to decreasing focus of
moisture as the upper low opens up while it lifts northward.

...Anomalous heat expected to spread from the central/southern
Plains toward the Midwest as critical to extreme fire danger
persists from the Southwest to the southern High Plains...

...Cold and mountain snows from the West Coast to the northern
Rockies and Pacific Northwest as a quick round of heavy rain,
thunderstorms and winds sweeps across the northern Plains today...

...Severe storms possible in West Texas on Tuesday; Continued
chilly and windy conditions along the East Coast with prolonged
high surf for coastal communities...

The anomalous heat that was building over the southern Plains
through this past weekend is forecast to spread further to the
north and northeast as a warm ridge aloft will continued to be
strengthened and then sustained by a persistently strong jet
stream from the Southwest.  Daytime highs well up into the 90s are
expected to expand northward through the central Plains today
behind a warm front and a dry line.  Parts of western Texas into
the Panhandle will once again see another afternoon with high
temperatures surpassing the century mark today. In fact, record
high temperatures are expected to shift north and east from the
southern Plains today to mainly over the lower and mid-Mississippi
Valley on Tuesday.  By Wednesday, highs in the 90s are forecast to
push northward into the central Plains and the Midwest.  In
addition, strong to high winds are expected to develop from the
central to southern Rockies to the nearby High Plains.  The
combination of strong winds, low humidity, and dry fuels will
continue to promote critical to extreme fire danger from eastern
Arizona to the southern High Plains.

In contrast to the anomalous heat in the midsection of the
country, the West and East Coasts will remain engulf in the
abnormally cooler side.  The coolest conditions versus normal are
expected along the West Coast and extending into the northern
Rockies.  Both record cold max and min temps are forecast for
parts of northern California and the interior Pacific Northwest
today with lingering pockets of possible record cold min temps in
northern California Tuesday morning.  In addition to the cold,
unsettled weather will be common throughout the Northwest as the
region sits under the aforementioned upper low and seemingly
unending series of upper level disturbances, bringing occasional
scattered showers and mountain snow to the higher elevations of
the Northwest, and down into the Sierra Nevada.  Meanwhile over
the northern Plains today, a rapidly deepening low pressure system
is forecast to bring a quick round of heavy rain, possibly severe
thunderstorms along with blustery winds across the region.
Overall, 1 to 2 inches of rain are expected in the central
Dakotas.  A Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall has been posted for
parts of eastern South Dakota and northwest Minnesota today and a
Marginal Risk for much of North Dakota and northern Minnesota.

Elsewhere, severe storms are forecast to fire along the dryline in
West Texas on Tuesday where a Slight Risk for severe weather is in
place. The most tranquil weather pattern will set up along the
East Coast where and elongated area of high pressure will remain
entrenched throughout the first half of the work-week.  A
lingering low off the Mid-Atlantic coast will still lead to choppy
seas and high surf up and down the Eastern Seaboard.  In addition,
chilly temperatures for mid-May will stick around through Tuesday
with daytime highs struggling to get out of the 60s from southern
New England to the Virginia and North Carolina Tidewater regions.
Even the lows on Monday morning will be quite cold in the central
Appalachians where Frost Advisories are in effect. Warmer the
normal temperatures will first spill over into northern New
England by Tuesday.  The East Coast as a whole will remain dry
through the first half of the week with the lone exception being
beaches from the DelMarVa on south along the Southeast coast where
occasional passing showers are possible.

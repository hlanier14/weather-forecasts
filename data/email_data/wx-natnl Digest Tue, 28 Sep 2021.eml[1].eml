Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CDT Mon Sep 27 2021

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST GREAT BASIN...

...Northwest Great Basin...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions remain likely this
afternoon across northwest NV into parts of southeast OR and far
southwest ID. The risks areas were adjusted based on morning
observations and recent hi-res guidance, but the general forecast
remains on track (as outlined in the previous discussion below).

...Idaho/Montana...
Latest surface observations show relative humidity values falling
into the low 20s and upper teens across northeast ID and southwest
to central MT. While winds are generally quiescent so far this
morning, a few sites at higher elevation show stronger winds gusting
to near 30 mph. Regional soundings show similar winds above a
nocturnal inversion, which will likely mix down to lower elevations
through the day and support areas of elevated conditions.

...Colorado...
An elevated risk area is introduced to portions of southeastern CO
where RH values are already in the teens and low 20s. Winds are
expected to increase to around 15 mph this afternoon amid deep
boundary-layer mixing, but the potential for critical conditions
appears low. Increasing cloud cover may limit the spatial extent of
elevated conditions, but a reasonable wind signal in ensemble
guidance, along with dry fuels and low humidity, warrant a small
risk area.

..Moore.. 09/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Sep 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a strong trough over the Pacific Northwest is
forecast to stall across the Rockies as mid-level ridging builds to
the east. At the surface, a cold front will move onshore and across
the northern Great Basin late in the forecast period. At the same
time, a weak upper low over the southern Plains and Southwest will
continue to bring scattered showers and thunderstorms to portions of
the Plains.

...Northern Great Basin...
Increasing southwesterly flow aloft will move across the High Sierra
and spill into the northern Great Basin this afternoon and evening.
Regional model soundings show deep a deep and well-mixed boundary
layer supporting surface momentum transfer from a 70-80 kt jet
aloft. Strong surface winds of 20-30 mph and higher gusts will
overlap with the deeply mixed boundary layer where widespread
surface RH below 15% will be common. The favorable combination of
strong wind gusts, low surface RH and dry fuels should support
widespread elevated and critical fire weather conditions.

The fire weather threat should continue into the evening ahead of a
fast moving dry cold front moving out of southern Oregon. Strong
surface gusts greater than 30 mph will be possible along the front
as well as a direction shift to the northwest. Fire weather concerns
will gradually diminish behind the front later in the evening as
cooler temperatures and better RH recoveries develop.

Locally elevated fire weather conditions will likely extend into
portions of eastern Idaho and southwestern Montana ahead of the
front this afternoon. Here, less confidence exists on widespread
strong surface winds and gusts. Fuels however remain very dry,
suggesting some threat for locally elevated to near critical
conditions before frontal passage later in the day.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 27 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is good multi-model agreement generally favoring mid-level
high
(low) pressure across the eastern two-thirds (western third) of the lower 48.
There is more uncertainty regarding the potential for mid-level low pressure
forming across the West, with the ECMWF ensemble mean indicating mid-level low
pressure being more amplified and extending further inland across the West
compared to the GEFS and Canadian. Overall the anticipated pattern favors
anomalously warm temperatures across much of the contiguous U.S., with more
uncertainty regarding the potential for anomalously cold temperatures across
the western portions of the lower 48. Temperatures are generally not
anticipated to reach hazardous criteria. There continues to be increased
potential for tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic, although no related
hazardous impacts are anticipated for the contiguous U.S. at this time.
Mid-level low pressure is predicted for much of Alaska, favoring cooler than
normal temperatures and above normal precipitation across the state.

HAZARDS

No hazards posted.

https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!rLrRWbWxdK27ccOIWLNg553wDVUOVHlsW9XRfW8jkZXPwzcwgC8z0EzloceZBVClIo2hersN$

FOR TUESDAY OCTOBER 05 - MONDAY OCTOBER 11: The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble means generally favor above (near) normal 500-hPa heights across much
of the northern (southern) half of the lower 48. Positive 500-hPa height
anomalies across the North-Central CONUS are more evident in the 0Z GEFS
ensemble mean compared to the 0Z ECMWF and Canadian counterparts. This
translates to the GEFS reforecast tool indicating elevated chances (greater
than 20%) of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile across
primarily the northern half of the CONUS during the period, whereas the ECMWF
reforecast tool is significantly weaker with this potential, showing only a
small portion of the North-Central CONUS reaching these values for a brief
period. Despite the GEFS indicating temperatures potentially exceeding the
85th
percentile, temperatures are not anticipated to reach hazards criteria, with
most regions having temperatures less than 85 Deg F. Additionally, embedded
shortwave troughs are anticipated to move throughout the longwave ridge
pattern, which would decrease chances for warmer temperatures lasting for a
long duration. Therefore, a related much above normal temperature hazard is
not
designated at this time.



Across the West, the ECMWF ensemble mean favors more  amplified troughing
extending further inland and for a longer duration compared to the GEFS and
the
Canadian. This is reflected in the ECMWF reforecast tool, which shows an area
across western CONUS with minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th
percentile and below freezing at the beginning of week-2, expands to the
Rockies westward by the middle of the period. The GEFS reforecast tool,
however, maintains chances of reaching these thresholds to less than 10%. Due
to significant model differences, a much below normal temperature hazard is
not
posted at this time.



Due to the anticipation of mid-level shortwaves being relatively transient, no
associated heavy precipitation hazards are expected at this time. As of 2pm
EDT, the National Hurricane Center (NHC), is monitoring Hurricane Sam
currently
located several hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles, in addition to
three
other disturbances that have potential for developing into a subtropical  or
tropical cyclone. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean, 6Z deterministic GFS and
associated forecast ensemble surface lows do not favor tracks that would
support associated hazards for the CONUS at this time but will be monitored in
the upcoming days.



In the East Pacific, the NHC is also monitoring a disturbance currently
located
southwest of Mexico, with a 40% chance (as of 11am PDT) of developing into a
tropical cyclone over the next 5 days. Should this disturbance form, there is
potential for this disturbance to track near the Gulf of California, which
could enhance some moisture into the Four Corners region during week-2. The
ECMWF reforecast tool shows a much stronger signal for a wetter pattern for
the
Four Corners compared to the GEFS reforecast tool. The ECMWF reforecast tool
shows at least a 20% chance of 3-day totals exceeding the 85th percentile and
half an inch across a broad area of the Four Corners, including a greater than
50% chance across some of these areas of receiving 3-day rainfall totals
exceeding the 85th percentile. The GEFS reforecast tool has a much weaker
signal, keeping chances of 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the
aforementioned thresholds to less than 30% and amounts remaining below half an
inch. Due to significant uncertainty with this feature, a heavy precipitation
hazard is not designated at this time.



For Alaska, mid-level troughing is generally favored for the state, with 500
hPa heights anticipated to be near normal. Overall, below normal temperatures
and above normal precipitation is predicted for many parts of the Mainland and
Panhandle for week-2. The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means favor a
surface low to form over the Bering Sea during week-2, extending across parts
of Alaska to the Panhandle, with a potential associated frontal boundary along
the Alaska Panhandle. The ECMWF reforecast tool shows at least a 20% chance
for
parts of the South Coast of Alaska receiving 3-day precipitation amounts
exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches. The GEFS reforecast tool, however,
does not show this signal, resulting in  too much uncertainty to designate any
precipitation related hazards at this time. Additionally, the wind reforecast
tools do not indicate increased potential for high winds associated with this
disturbance.

... Heavy rain threat over portions of the southern Plains late
this week into the weekend...

...Overview...

An amplified upper pattern will likely continue across the U.S.
mainland for much of the medium range period.  This pattern will
encourage returning moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to interact
with a stalled frontral boundary across the Plains.  A threat of
heavy rain appears most likely over portions of the southern
Plains late this week into the weekend as a shortwave is forecast
to lift across the region.  Meanwhile, a broad upper low will be
slow to exit the Northeast, as the next cold front is forecast to
move through the Northwest and then into the northern Plains by
early next week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Latest models and ensembles show fairly good agreement on the
slowly exiting broad upper low over the Northeast, as well as the
next trough moving into the Pacific Northwest.  It is the weaker
and more subtle upper trough extending across the Plains that the
models continue to indicated noticable differences and run-to-run
variabilities.  While the GFS exhibits run-to-run jumps, the ECMWF
has generally trended faster toward the mean GFS position of this
upper trough over the central Plains during the weekend.  A
general model blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS,
and some contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used to handle
this system.

Elsewhere, some additional timing issues are seen later this
weekend into early next week across the Ohio Valley where the
upper trough from the Pacific Northwest is forecast to reach the
northern Plains.  Meanwhile, near/just off the California coast,
models are indicating the formation of an upper low during this
period.  Models are showing fairly good agreement on its position.
 More of the ensemble means from the 00Z EC, 06Z GEFS, and the 00Z
CMC were used to compose the Days 6 and 7 forecasts.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Southern parts of the Rockies and Plains can expect multiple days
of widespread and potentially heavy rainfall for the latter half
of the week, as the upper low in the Southwest provides moist
inflow from the Pacific and the low-level pattern brings moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico. The specifics of rainfall duration and
intensity remain somewhat uncertain given model differences in the
timing and track of the Southwest upper low, but the current
forecast shows 2 of 4 inches of rain with locally higher amounts
in the southern High Plains. Periods of rain are also possible
farther north toward the rest of the Plains and the Midwest in the
vicinity of a couple of frontal boundaries. The Pacific Northwest
should see precipitation lasting through Thursday, with
orographically enhanced amounts in the Olympics and northern
Cascades, and some snow is possible at the highest elevations.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are likely across southern
Florida as a couple of fronts move through. The rest of the East
should be generally dry underneath high pressure, other than
showers in the Northeast mainly Thursday due to the nearby upper
low, and some possible moisture approaching the Ohio Valley into
the Mid-Atlantic by Sunday.

Warmer than average temperatures are forecast across the
north-central tier of the CONUS through the period, with highs in
the 70s, even 80s in the Midwest underneath upper ridging. On the
other hand, high temperature anomalies of 10-20F below average
should be centered across central/southern portions of the Rockies
and High Plains given the clouds and precipitation over the
region. The West Coast should warm up above normal by the weekend,
while slightly below average temperatures are expected for the
Northeast for as long as the forecast upper low persists over the
region.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon September 27 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 03 - 07 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast an amplified trough
over the Gulf of Alaska. Near to slightly below normal mid-level heights are
forecast over much of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle while above
normal mid-level heights are predicted over southwestern Mainland Alaska and
the Aleutians. A short wave trough over the eastern North Pacific is predicted
to progress eastward to the southern Pacific Coast of the CONUS. A strong
ridge
is predicted over the central CONUS, while a mean trough is predicted over the
Northeast. Above normal mid-level heights are forecast over most of the CONUS
except for parts of the Southeast.

Below-normal temperature probabilities are elevated across Alaska in
association with below-normal 500-hPa heights. Above-normal temperatures are
favored for most of the CONUS due to predicted 500-hPa ridging and above-
normal
heights. A predicted eastward progression of a short wave trough from the
southern Pacific Coast favors enhanced probabilities of near to below-normal
temperatures over parts of the Southern Rockies and Plains. Near to
below-normal temperatures are also favored over the Florida Peninsula
consistent with the operational auto blend tool.
Above-normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over southwestern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle due to forecasted storm system
development. Below-normal precipitation chances are increased over the
northern
tier of the CONUS in association with above-normal mid-level heights. The
short
wave trough forecast over the southern Pacific Coast supports an increased
likelihood of near to above-normal precipitation for the southwestern CONUS
and
parts of the Southern Plains. Near to above-normal precipitation probabilities
are enhanced over central and southern portions of the eastern CONUS,
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, offset
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 05 - 11 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is similar to the
6-10 day period, but generally forecast to shift eastward and deamplify. The
Northern Pacific troughing is forecast to shift eastward over the West Coast
and a flattening ridge is forecast over the central and eastern CONUS with a
trough moving offshore from the Northeast to the Atlantic.

500-hPa troughing is forecast over Alaska, favoring near to below-normal
temperatures for much of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Below-
normal
temperatures are favored over the coast of the Pacific Northwest associated
with the eastward progression of troughing and potential cloudiness. Near to
above-normal temperatures are favored across the remainder of the CONUS,
consistent with the consolidation tool. The highest above-normal temperature
probabilities are forecast over the Upper Mississippi Valley and western Great
Lakes during the week 2 period.

Troughing over the Gulf of Alaska and Mainland Alaska increases the chances of
above-normal precipitation over much of Mainland Alaska and parts of the
Aleutians. A short wave frontal boundary and potential tropical moisture lead
to enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitation across the Southwest
and Great Basin eastward to parts of the Central and Southern Plains.
Above-normal precipitation is favored over parts of the southeastern CONUS and
Mid-Atlantic Region, related to moisture flow from the Atlantic. Below-normal
precipitation is likely across parts of the Northern Rockies, Mississippi
Valley, Great Lakes and Northeast, consistent with the operational auto blend
tool.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, offset
by increasing uncertainty and differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools.


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

The general forecast remains on track for the northern High Plains.
Latest deterministic guidance continues to show the potential for
near-record high temperatures and windy conditions over the western
Dakotas and adjacent areas of WY/MT in proximity to an unseasonably
deep surface low. Bias-corrected ensemble guidance supports this
idea and maintains reasonable probabilities for 20 mph winds.
Critical conditions are possible across the eastern portion of the
Elevated risk area in the Dakotas under the axis of stronger
low/mid-level flow, but confidence in sufficient RH reductions
precludes an eastward expansion at this time. Other forecast ideas
expressed in the previous discussion (below) remain valid, including
concerns for elevated conditions through the Sacramento Valley of
CA.

..Moore.. 09/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0209 AM CDT Mon Sep 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
The stalled mid-level trough over the northern Rockies is forecast
to weaken considerably through the forecast period as it phases with
the weak upper low moving across the southern Plains. A strong
surface low and cold front, associated with the trough, will move
south out of Alberta into eastern Montana by early afternoon. The
Strong wind ahead of and along the front, as well as dry surface
conditions, will support critical fire weather conditions across
portions of the northern Rockies/High Plains Tuesday.

...Northern Rockies...
As the main jet streak associated with the weakening upper trough
moves northward into southern Alberta/Saskatchewan, a lee low should
develop and rapidly deepen across eastern Montana early Tuesday. As
the low moves southeastward, it should continue to strengthen,
falling below 1000 hPa near midday. To the south across portions of
the western Dakotas and eastern Wyoming and Montana, low-level
isallobaric mass response from the rapid-deepening low and a
developing lee trough will support strong southerly surface winds
through the day. Model soundings show a deep and well-mixed boundary
layer with diurnal RH minimums of 10-20%. With the strong surface
pressure gradients and deep mixing to near 600 mb, boundary-layer
max winds of 20-25 mph and higher gusts should develop. Fuels remain
very favorable for fire spread, as little precipitation has allowed
them to reach near the 98th percentile of dryness over the last
several days. Thus, widespread elevated and critical fire weather
conditions are expected for a few hours through the afternoon.

...Northern California...
Dry post frontal northerly/northeasterly winds in the Sacramento
Valley may support local areas of elevated fire weather concern
Tuesday afternoon and early evening. While not expected to be overly
strong, the gusty winds and dry conditions will occur in areas of
high to extreme fuel dryness and several ongoing large fires. Some
increase in local fire danger appears likely despite limited spatial
coverage.

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Southwest through Wednesday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern/Central Plains into the Upper/Middle Mississippi
Valley...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Great Basin...

Upper-level low and moisture over the Southwest will aid in
producing widely scattered showers and thunderstorms over the area
through Wednesday. Some of the thunderstorms will have heavy rain,
but this will be isolated.

Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Southwest through Tuesday morning. The
associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain. The upper-level low over the Southwest will slowly move
northeastward to the Central Rockies, becoming absorbed by a deep
upper-level trough over the Rockies by Wednesday.  The circulation
around the upper-level low will pull moisture will flow northward
over the Southern/Central Plains, setting the stage for showers
and thunderstorms to develop over parts of the Central and Western
Gulf Coast on Tuesday, expanding into the Central/Southern Plains
by Tuesday evening.

Meanwhile, a front extending across the Northeast to the Great
Lakes will settle southward to the Mid-Atlantic by Tuesday evening
and over the Carolinas by Wednesday evening.  The front will aid
in producing showers and thunderstorms along and ahead of the
front starting on Monday afternoon over parts of the Lower Great
Lakes into the Northeast that will move into parts of the
Mid-Atlantic to Southern New England by Tuesday afternoon then
dissipate by Wednesday morning.  Furthermore, the rain will
continue over parts of the Northern Intermountain Region to late
Wednesday morning.

In the meantime, a front extending from the Northern Rockies into
Northern/Central California will move slowly eastward to the
Northern Plains to the Southern Rockies by Wednesday.  The system
will start producing rain over parts of the Northwest/Northern
California that will expand into parts of the Northern
Intermountain Region by Tuesday morning.  The rain will continue
over the Pacific Northwest due to onshore flow through Wednesday
morning, then weakening as the onshore flow ends. However,
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will stream northward over the
Plains as the front moves onto the Northern/Central Plains,
producing showers and thunderstorms along and ahead of the
boundary through Wednesday.

Additionally, upper-level ridging ahead of the boundary will allow
temperatures to become 10 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern/Central Plains into the Upper/Middle Mississippi
Valley.  Moreover, gusty wind ahead of the front over the Great
Basin led to conditions favorable for a Critical Risk of fire
weather over parts of the Great Basin.  Therefore, Red Flag
Warnings are up over portions of California, Nevada, and the
Northern Intermountain Region.

... Heavy rain threat over portions of the southern Plains late
this week into the weekend...

...Overview...

An amplified upper pattern will likely continue across the U.S.
mainland for much of the medium range period.  This pattern will
encourage returning moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to interact
with a stalled frontal boundary across the Plains.  A threat of
heavy rain appears most likely over portions of the southern
Plains late this week into the weekend as a shortwave is forecast
to lift across the region.  Meanwhile, a broad upper low will be
slow to exit the Northeast, as the next cold front is forecast to
move through the Northwest and then into the northern Plains by
early next week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Latest models and ensembles show fairly good agreement on the
slowly exiting broad upper low over the Northeast, as well as the
next trough moving into the Pacific Northwest.  It is the weaker
and more subtle upper trough extending across the Plains that the
models continue to indicate noticable differences and run-to-run
variabilities.  While the GFS exhibits run-to-run jumps, the ECMWF
has generally trended faster toward the mean GFS position of this
upper trough over the central Plains during the weekend.  A
general model blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS,
and some contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used to handle
this system.

Elsewhere, some additional timing issues are seen later this
weekend into early next week across the Ohio Valley where the
upper trough from the Pacific Northwest is forecast to reach the
northern Plains.  Meanwhile, near/just off the California coast,
models are indicating the formation of an upper low during this
period. Models are showing fairly good agreement on its position.
More of the ensemble means from the 00Z EC, 06Z GEFS, and the 00Z
CMC were used to compose the Days 6 and 7 forecasts.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Portions of the southern Plains can expect multiple days of
widespread and potentially heavy rainfall for the latter half of
the week, as the upper low in the Southwest exits into the Plains
and interacts with tropical moisture coming from the Gulf of
Mexico. The specifics of rainfall duration and intensity remain
somewhat uncertain given model differences in the timing and track
of the upper low, but the current forecast calls for 2 of 4 inches
of rain with locally higher amounts extending through a good
portion of Texas.  Periods of rain can be expected farther north
across the rest of the Plains and the Midwest in the vicinity of
the stalled front, with a tendency for the rain to slowly shift
eastward into the Ohio Valley later in the weekend and early next
week.

The Pacific Northwest should see precipitation lasting through
Thursday before drier and cooler air usher in behind a cold front.
Orographically enhanced rain is expected in the Olympics with some
snow is possible at the highest elevations of the northern
Cascades. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are likely across
southern Florida as a couple of fronts move through. The rest of
the East should be generally dry under the influence of a high
pressure system other than showers in the Northeast due to the
nearby upper low on Thursday.

Warmer than average temperatures are forecast across the
north-central tier of the CONUS through the period, with highs in
the 70s, even 80s in the Midwest underneath upper ridging. On the
other hand, high temperatures 10-20F below average should be
centered over the central/southern portions of the Rockies and
High Plains given the clouds and precipitation over the region.
The West Coast should warm up above normal by the weekend, while
slightly below average temperatures are expected for the Northeast
with the lingering upper low.

... Heavy rain threat over portions of Texas late this week...

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Friday with a closed upper low
centered over the Northeast, while ridging in the east-central
U.S. separates it from mean troughing in the West. Moisture and a
stalled frontal boundary ahead of a southern stream trough should
produce heavy rainfall in the Southern Plains for the latter part
of the week. By early next week, model guidance is coming into
better agreement with shortwave energy over the north-central U.S.
(underneath an upper high moving across western and central
Canada), which should maintain a surface low pressure/frontal
system across the Ohio Valley.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

12/18Z model guidance continues to show good agreement with the
location of the closed upper low centered over southeastern Canada
and spreading troughing to the Northeast through the end of the
week, with perhaps some differences in the energy distribution
potentially narrowing the low or not early on, and somewhat minor
differences in the speed it lifts out by Monday/Tuesday. A
multi-model deterministic blend worked well for this feature.

In the West, troughing is expected for the end of the week in both
the northern and southern streams. With the northern stream
shortwave, model guidance is generally agreeable in its track
passing through the Northwest Friday/Saturday, while splitting
some energy off into the eastern Pacific offshore of California.
The 12Z CMC is the exception, which once again spins most of its
energy southward to create a closed low over Oregon for the
weekend. Meanwhile with the southern stream trough, while there
are some differences in its strength and whether or not a closed
low develops briefly, no guidance stood out particularly as being
an outlier, so a deterministic blend of models excluding the CMC
was able to be used in the West through the end of the week.

As the northern stream shortwave moves eastward early next week,
and the southern stream shortwave lifts northeastward, they should
generally produce lower heights/troughing in the north-central
U.S. while an upper high slides atop them into Canada. Detail
differences certainly remain, but the GFS runs have trended
somewhat weaker with energy and a closed low there while ECMWF
runs have trended somewhat stronger with energy in this area,
meaning that for the 12/18Z cycle, their patterns matched pretty
well. The latter part of the forecast period used a blend of the
deterministic GFS and ECMWF and the GEFS and EC ensemble means to
temper individual model differences.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Portions of the Southern Plains can expect multiple days of
widespread and potentially heavy rainfall for the latter half of
the week, as the upper low in the Southwest exits into the High
Plains and interacts with tropical moisture coming from the Gulf
of Mexico. The specifics of rainfall duration and intensity remain
somewhat uncertain given model differences in the timing and track
of the upper low, but the current forecast calls for 2 of 4 inches
of rain with locally higher amounts extending through a good
portion of Texas. Periods of rain can be expected farther north
across the rest of the Plains and the Midwest in the vicinity of
the stalled front, with a tendency for the rain to slowly shift
eastward into the Ohio Valley as the surface low pressure system
stalls by early next week. Meanwhile, a round of showers is
possible for the Northern Rockies/Plains on Friday as a front
passes through, scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible
for southern Florida through the period, and some moisture may
return to the Four Corners states by Monday/Tuesday.

Warmer than normal temperatures are forecast across the
north-central tier of the CONUS through the end of the week, with
highs in the 70s through the Midwest underneath upper ridging. On
the other hand, cooler than average temperatures (especially
highs) are expected for the Rockies into southern/central portions
of the High Plains. Friday should be particularly cool over New
Mexico/Colorado/Texas given the clouds and precipitation over the
region. The West Coast can expect temperatures a few degrees above
normal by the weekend, while slightly below average temperatures
are expected for the Northeast with the lingering upper low.

... Heavy rain threat over portions of Texas late this week...

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Friday with a closed upper low
centered over the Northeast, while ridging in the east-central
U.S. separates it from mean troughing in the West. Moisture and a
stalled frontal boundary ahead of a southern stream trough should
produce heavy rainfall in the Southern Plains for the latter part
of the week. By early next week, model guidance is coming into
better agreement with shortwave energy over the north-central U.S.
(underneath an upper high moving across western and central
Canada), which should maintain a surface low pressure/frontal
system across the Ohio Valley.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

12/18Z model guidance continues to show good agreement with the
location of the closed upper low centered over southeastern Canada
and spreading troughing to the Northeast through the end of the
week, with perhaps some differences in the energy distribution
potentially narrowing the low or not early on, and somewhat minor
differences in the speed it lifts out by Monday/Tuesday. A
multi-model deterministic blend worked well for this feature.

In the West, troughing is expected for the end of the week in both
the northern and southern streams. With the northern stream
shortwave, model guidance is generally agreeable in its track
passing through the Northwest Friday/Saturday, while splitting
some energy off into the eastern Pacific offshore of California.
The 12Z CMC is the exception, which once again spins most of its
energy southward to create a closed low over Oregon for the
weekend. Meanwhile with the southern stream trough, while there
are some differences in its strength and whether or not a closed
low develops briefly, no guidance stood out particularly as being
an outlier, so a deterministic blend of models excluding the CMC
was able to be used in the West through the end of the week.

As the northern stream shortwave moves eastward early next week,
and the southern stream shortwave lifts northeastward, they should
generally produce lower heights/troughing in the north-central
U.S. while an upper high slides atop them into Canada. Detail
differences certainly remain, but the GFS runs have trended
somewhat weaker with energy and a closed low there while ECMWF
runs have trended somewhat stronger with energy in this area,
meaning that for the 12/18Z cycle, their patterns matched pretty
well. The latter part of the forecast period used a blend of the
deterministic GFS and ECMWF and the GEFS and EC ensemble means to
temper individual model differences.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Portions of the Southern Plains can expect multiple days of
widespread and potentially heavy rainfall for the latter half of
the week, as the upper low in the Southwest exits into the High
Plains and interacts with tropical moisture coming from the Gulf
of Mexico. The specifics of rainfall duration and intensity remain
somewhat uncertain given model differences in the timing and track
of the upper low, but the current forecast calls for 2 of 4 inches
of rain with locally higher amounts extending through a good
portion of Texas. Periods of rain can be expected farther north
across the rest of the Plains and the Midwest in the vicinity of
the stalled front, with a tendency for the rain to slowly shift
eastward into the Ohio Valley as the surface low pressure system
stalls by early next week. Meanwhile, a round of showers is
possible for the Northern Rockies/Plains on Friday as a front
passes through, scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible
for southern Florida through the period, and some moisture may
return to the Four Corners states by Monday/Tuesday.

Warmer than normal temperatures are forecast across the
north-central tier of the CONUS through the end of the week, with
highs in the 70s through the Midwest underneath upper ridging. On
the other hand, cooler than average temperatures (especially
highs) are expected for the Rockies into southern/central portions
of the High Plains. Friday should be particularly cool over New
Mexico/Colorado/Texas given the clouds and precipitation over the
region. The West Coast can expect temperatures a few degrees above
normal by the weekend, while slightly below average temperatures
are expected for the Northeast with the lingering upper low.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Troughing over the Intermountain West will becoming increasingly
broad through the day as a secondary upper low over the southern
Plains moves northward and merges with the main trough across the
northern Rockies. As the primary mid-level jet associated with the
trough moves north into southern Alberta, a lee low/trough should
develop in response, across portions of eastern Montana/Wyoming. A
cold front trailing from the surface low is forecast to rapidly move
eastward across the Great Basin and Northern Rockies bringing cooler
temperatures and an increase in humidity. Gusty south/southwest
winds, and warm/dry conditions ahead of the front are expected to
support elevated to critical fire weather conditions through the
afternoon and evening.

...Northern Rockies and High Plains...
As synoptic lift from the trough and the rear quadrant of the
departing mid-level jet move across the northern Rockies, lee
cyclogenesis is expected early in the day across eastern Montana and
far western North Dakota. The increasing westerly flow aloft should
also aid in the development of a lee trough in eastern Wyoming and
the western Dakotas. The rapidly deepening low, below 1000 mb by
midday, will support strong mass response in the low levels, driving
20-25 mph southerly surface winds across much of eastern Wyoming,
and western South Dakota. Here, the warm temperatures and dry
downslope flow near the lee trough will support widespread diurnal
RH minimums of 10-20%. A lingering low-level jet may also bolster
surface gusts to 30+ mph through the afternoon given deep mixing
heights on regional model soundings. With very dry fuels in place
and ongoing drought conditions, fuels are highly receptive to starts
and fire spread. Widespread elevated to critical fire weather
conditions are expected through the afternoon and into the evening
hours. The approaching cold front will end the fire weather threat
after sunset as winds shift to the west northwest and RH begins to
increase.

...Central and southern California...
Gusty winds of 15-20 mph are expected in the post-frontal airmass
across much of the Central Valley and portions of southern
California this afternoon and evening. Low-level trajectories from
the west northwest will be less favorable for lower humidity given
the presence of a stronger marine layer farther inland. However, the
gusty winds and dry fuels may still support a few hours of locally
elevated fire weather conditions. The fire weather threat should
rapidly diminish overnight as RH recoveries near 50-60% are expected
to develop along with weaker winds.

0152 AM CDT Tue Sep 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad troughing will linger over much of the western US Wednesday,
supporting widespread shower and thunderstorm activity across the
central CONUS. To the east, high pressure will strengthen as
mid-level flow weakens and shifts to the north. At the surface,
gusty northerly winds through much of California will promote weak
to moderate offshore flow, along with warming and drying conditions.
Fire weather threats are expected to remain mostly local in nature,
though periodic elevated conditions are possible across portions of
southern California mainly late in the forecast period and into Day
3/Thursday.

...California...
In the wake of the cold front, gradient winds are forecast to remain
light and northerly through much of the day across central and
southern California. Warm and dry surface conditions are expected
with diurnal RH minimums near 20%. Poor RH recoveries should persist
into the overnight and early Day3/Thursday as east northeasterly
winds begin to increase in response to building high pressure across
the Great Basin. Weak offshore flow will likely develop across the
southern Coastal Ranges with some chance for locally elevated fire
weather conditions overnight.

...Severe thunderstorms possible across portions of the
Mid-Atlantic today...

...Increasing chances for thunderstorms and heavy rain found
throughout the central and southern Plains through midweek...

...Record breaking warmth and critical fire weather forecast
across the Northern Plains...

The weather pattern across much of the Lower 48 is set become
slightly more active to end the month of September. In the East, a
cold front dropping south across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
today will usher in cooler and more fall-like temperatures.
However, a few strong to locally severe thunderstorms may develop
along this frontal boundary this afternoon. Isolated thunderstorms
will have the potential to produce damaging wind gusts and large
hail. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level
2/5) of severe weather between northern Virginia and southern New
Jersey.

Farther west, a cold front currently pushing across the Northern
Rockies and Intermountain West is expected to continue marching
eastward until reaching the Northern Plains and Central Rockies by
Wednesday, followed by the Southern Plains on Thursday. Scattered
showers and much cooler temperatures are forecast behind the cold
front, with a few snowflakes mixing into the highest elevations of
the Rockies as well. Once the frontal boundary reaches the Great
Plains on Wednesday, it will clash with a warm tropical airmass
funneling out of the western Gulf of Mexico and spark numerous
clusters of the showers and thunderstorms. The main concern with
these storms across the Central Plains will be associated with
heavy rain and the potential for isolated instances of flash
flooding. By Thursday, the heavy rain threat will shift southward
and into the Southern Plains. Meanwhile, the aforementioned
tropical airmass will also help aid thunderstorm development
across Texas and Lower Mississippi Valley over the next few days
ahead of the approaching weather system. Slow-moving thunderstorms
along with intense rainfall rates could produce isolated flash
flooding. A few severe thunderstorms are also not out of the
question across central Texas and southwestern Oklahoma along a
dryline this afternoon.

One more day of record-breaking warmth is forecast throughout the
Northern Plains today as highs soar 20 to 30 degrees above
average. High temperatures are forecast to soar into the upper 80s
and 90s throughout much of the Great Plains and parts of the
Midwest. A dozen daily high temperature records could fall across
Nebraska and the Dakotas. By Wednesday, this wave of unseasonably
warm temperatures will shift out of the Northern Plains into the
Upper Midwest. In conjunction with the late-September heat, gusty
winds and low relative humidity will make for dangerous fire
weather conditions across the Northern Plains today. Red Flag
Warnings have been issued throughout southeast Montana, northern
Wyoming and the western Dakota in order to highlight the potential
for new wildfires to spread uncontrollably.

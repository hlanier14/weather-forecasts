Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
322 AM EDT Wed Jun 9 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Jun 9 2021 - 12Z Fri Jun 11 2021

...Locally significant flash flooding expected to continue for
portions of Arkansas and Mississippi on Wednesday...

...Persistent heat for much of the Great Plains along with threats
for severe thunderstorms across the northern High Plains into
eastern Montana...

The overall weather pattern will be rather slow to change through
the middle to end of the week across most of the nation.  A large
upper level ridge anchored over the Plains will keep a frontal
boundary from making much eastern progress across the
Intermountain West and the Rockies through early Thursday, before
making more progress on Friday.  Meanwhile, a cold front will make
slow progress southward across the Great Lakes and Northeast U.S.
through the end of the week, bringing some welcomed relief to the
recent hot weather for these areas by Thursday and especially on
Friday.  It will remain hot and humid with July-like conditions
across the remainder of the central and southern U.S. with highs
running 5 to 15+ degrees above seasonal averages in many cases,
with the greatest anomalies across the Northern Plains and the
Upper Midwest.  It will be pleasantly cool for this time of year
across the West Coast region since an upper level trough will be
situated across the eastern Pacific.

Additional rounds of heavy rainfall are in the forecast from the
Deep South to the Mid-Atlantic region, with scattered maxima of 1
to 3 inch totals with locally higher amounts possible over the
next two days from Kentucky to North Carolina.  The greatest
concern is expected to be across southeastern Arkansas and
northern Mississippi, where a High Risk of excessive rainfall is
in effect for Wednesday and Wednesday night.  This region has been
hammered by torrential rain and flooding over the past 1-2 days,
and the additional 2 to 4 inch rainfall totals on saturated ground
will greatly increase the flash flood threat.  Scattered to
numerous showers and storms are also expected across portions of
Idaho and western Montana near a slow moving front, and some 1
inch rainfall totals may become realized.

Strong to severe thunderstorms will be possible across portions of
Montana on Wednesday per the latest convective outlook from the
Storm Prediction Center, and a more organized severe weather
threat is likely across the Northern Plains as a strong
disturbance intercepts an increasingly unstable airmass.  There
will also be elevated fire weather concerns across much of the
Intermountain West, owing to a favorable combination of gusty
winds and very low humidity levels, along with ongoing severe
drought.

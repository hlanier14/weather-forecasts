The previous forecast remains on track, see the discussion below for
more details.

..Karstens.. 11/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1223 AM CST Tue Nov 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to move across the western CONUS today
into tonight, while an upper ridge will begin to build across the
eastern Pacific in the wake of the trough. At the surface, a weak
trough is forecast to develop across the central/northern High
Plains, while weak offshore flow may begin to impact portions of
southern California by early Wednesday morning. Relatively dry
conditions are expected across portions of the southern Rockies/High
Plains, but winds are expected to generally remain light where
receptive fuels are present, and the fire-weather threat should
remain low through the period.

...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low into later this week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later this week...


...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...

During the extended period, an amplified trough will pass from
central to eastern CONUS by the weekend as a robust surface low
lifts northeastward through the Midwest/Great Lakes into eastern
Canada. The associated cold front will sweep across the East and
will provide focus for a concentrated area of moderate to locally
heavy rainfall as moisture from the Gulf and western Mid-Atlantic
converge near the front. The speed of the front may limit the
severity of runoff and the flooding potential; however, the most
promising area for this will be over the favored terrain of
interior New England. Enhanced wrap-around then lake effect snows
are expected from the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and into the
northern Appalachians/Northeast. Another potent shortwave/surface
low pressure system is expected for the the Midwest and Great
Lakes later in the period, bringing another blast of cold air that
will favor snow across the region.

For the Pacific Northwest, a long fetch of Pacific moisture will
stream onshore into Saturday resulting in rain in the lower levels
and snow in the highest peaks. Additional enhanced precipitation
is expected as embedded shortwaves enter the region later this
period. Overall, favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The global guidance is in fairly good agreement with the
clustering and progression of the amplified trough that passes
over the eastern U.S. In maintaining consistency, the WPC medium
range product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend
of best clustered guidance from the GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means along with the National Blend of Models.

...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low into later this week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later this week...


...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...

During the extended period, an amplified trough will pass from
central to eastern CONUS by the weekend as a robust surface low
lifts northeastward through the Midwest/Great Lakes into eastern
Canada. The associated cold front will sweep across the East and
will provide focus for a concentrated area of moderate to locally
heavy rainfall as moisture from the Gulf and western Mid-Atlantic
converge near the front. The speed of the front may limit the
severity of runoff and the flooding potential; however, the most
promising area for this will be over the favored terrain of
interior New England. Enhanced wrap-around then lake effect snows
are expected from the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and into the
northern Appalachians/Northeast. Another potent shortwave/surface
low pressure system is expected for the the Midwest and Great
Lakes later in the period, bringing another blast of cold air that
will favor snow across the region.

For the Pacific Northwest, a long fetch of Pacific moisture will
stream onshore into Saturday resulting in rain in the lower levels
and snow in the highest peaks. Additional enhanced precipitation
is expected as embedded shortwaves enter the region later this
period. Overall, favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The global guidance is in fairly good agreement with the
clustering and progression of the amplified trough that passes
over the eastern U.S. In maintaining consistency, the WPC medium
range product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend
of best clustered guidance from the GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means along with the National Blend of Models.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST November 09 2021

SYNOPSIS: Surface high pressure is forecast to shift south from Canada into
the
Rockies and Great Plains from Nov 17 to 19. Below-normal temperatures are
forecast to accompany this surface high across parts of the western and
central
northern tier, but an early season Arctic air outbreak appears unlikely.
Except
for a brief period of lake-effect snow, no other precipitation hazards are
forecast during week-2 as zonal flow limits the strength of low pressure
systems traversing the central and eastern U.S. Surface high pressure with
below-normal temperatures is forecast to prevail throughout much of Alaska
during late November.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Mid-Atlantic
and
Southeast, Wed, Nov 17.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the western and
central U.S., Wed-Sat, Nov 17-20.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Great Plains and Midwest, Thu-Fr=
i,
Nov 18-19.

Slight risk of heavy snow downwind of Lake Superior, Thu-Fri, Nov 18-19.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY NOVEMBER 12 - TUESDAY NOVEMBER 16:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=

q7CqXAjwb_4$

FOR WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 17 - TUESDAY NOVEMBER 23: Although there are slight
timing differences, the GFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means depict surf=
ace
high pressure shifting south from Canada into the northern Rockies and Grea=
t
Plains early in week-2. Since a full-latitude ridge aloft is unlikely to
develop upstream over the east Pacific or western North America, a sustaine=
d
outbreak of anomalous cold is not expected at this time. However, this will=
 be
closely monitored since there are indications that positive 500-hPa height
anomalies may become more prevalent at the highest latitudes of the Norther=
n
Hemisphere which is favorable for Arctic air outbreaks. Based on the prefer=
red
GEFS probabilistic reforecast tool, a slight risk of much below normal
temperatures (Nov 17-20) is posted for areas that have at least a 20 percen=
t
chance of minimum temperature falling into the lowest 15th percentile. Earl=
y
in
week-2, there is an elevated chance of subzero temperatures across the
northern
high Plains.



Accumulating snow may occur across parts of the northern Great Plains and
Upper
Mississippi later next week to the northwest side of a surface low track.
However, large spread among ensemble members regarding the strength of this
low
pressure system along with an expectation of low amplitude flow, precludes
designation of a related heavy snow hazard. Behind an associated cold front=
,
gusty northwest winds support a slight risk of high winds (Nov 18-19) for t=
he
north-central U.S. Based on predicted surface flow and strong cold air
advection among recent model solutions, a slight risk of heavy snow is post=
ed
downwind of Lake Superior on Nov 18 and 19.



Anomalously cold temperatures are forecast to affect much of the eastern U.=
S.
during the early to middle part of next week. On the morning of Nov 17,
surface
high pressure is forecast to be centered over the Mid-Atlantic and Southeas=
t.
A
slight risk of much below normal temperatures (Nov 17) is posted for parts =
of
these areas where the GEFS reforecast tool depicts minimum temperatures hav=
ing
at least a 20 percent chance of falling to the lowest 15th percentile and
freezing.



Mid-level ridging upstream over the Bering Sea and surface high pressure to
the
north of Alaska favors below normal temperatures across much of the state.
Since the GEFS reforecast tool generally depicts minimum temperatures havin=
g
less than a 20 percent chance of falling to the lowest 15th percentile for
Mainland Alaska, no related temperature hazards are posted at this time. Th=
is
will be reevaluated in subsequent outlooks since the large-scale pattern is
favorable for much below normal temperatures. Later in week-2, increasing
onshore flow is expected to bring light to moderate snowfall to the Alaska
Panhandle.

The previous forecast remains on track. See the discussion below for
more details.

..Karstens.. 11/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1225 AM CST Tue Nov 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to amplify as it moves across the
central CONUS on Wednesday. An attendant surface low will deepen
over the central/southern High Plains during the day, before moving
into portions of the upper Midwest by early Thursday morning.
Meanwhile, in the wake of the trough, an upper ridge is forecast to
build into portions of the western CONUS. A surface ridge will
become established over the Great Basin, resulting in offshore flow
across portions of southern California.

...Southern/central High Plains...
Dry and breezy post-frontal conditions are expected across parts of
the southern and central High Plains on Wednesday. The greatest
relative fire-weather risk is currently expected over portions of
southeast NM into west TX, where sustained winds of 15-25 mph (with
higher gusts) and minimum RH values below 20% are forecast,
resulting in elevated to locally critical conditions. Some guidance
suggests the potential for elevated conditions further north into
parts of eastern CO and the TX/OK Panhandles, though uncertainty is
greater regarding the extent and duration of RH reductions in this
region, due to cooler post-frontal temperatures.

...Southern California...
Elevated wind/RH conditions may develop late Wednesday night/early
Thursday morning across terrain-favored portions of Santa Barbara
and Ventura Counties, as offshore flow becomes established across
the region. However, with potentially limited coverage/duration of
elevated conditions and a lack of more initially receptive fuels, no
highlights have been included.

...Persistent rain and higher elevation snow chances for the
Pacific Northwest and Rockies...

...Storm system to bring rain, thunderstorms, and a wintry mix to
the eastern half of the country....

...Seasonably warm weather forecast for the East and South, with
elevated fire weather conditions for portions of the Southern
Plains Wednesday...

Rain and higher elevation snow showers will continue for the
Central and Northern Rockies as a storm system continues through
the region. Accumulations should generally remain light overall.
However, some of the mountains in southwestern Montana,
northwestern Wyoming, and north-central Colorado will see a few
inches of snow through Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, another
series of storm systems will begin to impact the Pacific Northwest
Wednesday into Thursday bringing additional heavy rain and
mountain snow as an atmospheric river helps usher in increased
moisture across the region. A Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall
is in effect Thursday for the chance of 1-3 + inches of rain and
rain rates potentially exceeding 0.5 inches per hour.

A few lingering showers may continue along a frontal boundary from
the Northeast southwest through the Southern Plains overnight
Tuesday into Wednesday. However, precipitation will increase
significantly as the storm system currently moving through the
Rockies continues into the Plains Wednesday and intensifies as it
moves east across the country. Widespread rain and thunderstorms
are likely ahead of a cold front moving into the Midwest and
Southern Plains Wednesday and sweeping eastward into the Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Southeast on Thursday. A warm front moving
up the East Coast will also help increase rain and thunderstorm
chances for the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic on Thursday. Colder air
surging southward on the back side of the system will lead to a
wintry mix of rain and snow for the Northern Plains and Midwest
Wednesday night into Thursday.

Ahead of the cold front, seasonably warm high temperatures are
forecast for the East and South. Highs on Wednesday and Thursday
will generally be in the 50s and 60s in the Northeast and Midwest,
the 70s in the Southeast, and into the 80s for Texas, all around
5-10 degrees above normal. The warm weather will continue ahead of
the front for the East on Thursday as temperatures behind the
front drop into the 40s in the Upper Midwest, 50s in the Central
Plains, and 60s in the Southern Plains. In addition to the
seasonably warm temperatures, dry and breezy conditions ahead of
the cold front across southeastern New Mexico and southwest Texas
have prompted an Elevated Risk of fire weather from the Storm
Prediction Center for Wednesday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Tue November 09 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 15 - 19 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions depict a variable 500-hPa=
 flow pattern across most
of
the forecast domain during the 6 to 10 day period. The period begins with
ridging over the southwestern CONUS and a trough across the East. These
features quickly progress eastward during the period such that by day 8, th=
e
phasing of the overall pattern is nearly opposite, with troughing across th=
e
West and ridging over the East. The variable nature of the overall pattern
leads to higher than normal uncertainty across the CONUS. Agreement is bett=
er
across Alaska as an upstream ridge over Eastern Siberia will likely promote
troughing and anomalous northerly mid-level flow across most of the Mainlan=
d.
The 500-hPa manual height blend, based primarily on the ensemble means from
the
06z GEFS and 00z ECMWF, generally feature weak height anomalies across the
CONUS, consistent with the expected variable pattern. Above normal heights =
are
favored for western Alaska with near normal heights forecast across eastern
parts of the state.

Anomalous northerly mid-level flow forecast downstream of the eastern Siber=
ia
ridge leads to increased odds of below normal temperatures across most of
Alaska. A trough predicted over southeastern Alaska early in the period is
forecast to progress south and east toward the northwestern and north-centr=
al
CONUS, likely leading to a trend toward colder temperatures for these areas=
 as
time progresses. Near normal temperatures are favored for the northwestern =
and
north-central CONUS as warmth predicted early in the period may potentially=
 be
offset by a colder pattern late. Ridging early in the period leads to enhan=
ced
probabilities of above normal temperatures across the remainder of the West=
.
Conversely, a trough expected early in the period tilts the odds toward bel=
ow
normal temperatures across most of the Eastern Seaboard.

Anomalous northerly mid-level flow and offshore low-level flow are expected=
 to
combine to favor a dry pattern for most of Alaska.  Farther to the south,
onshore flow is expected, favoring an active pattern with elevated
probabilities for above normal precipitation forecast across the northweste=
rn
CONUS. Mean surface high pressure is forecast across much of the remainder =
of
the CONUS, favoring below normal precipitation. However, as surface high
pressure progresses eastward across the Southeast, return flow moisture is
possible across the western Gulf and Mississippi Valley. Near normal
precipitation is favored for these regions as dryness earlier in the period
may
potentially be offset by a wetter pattern late.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a variable pattern predicted across most of the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 17 - 23 2021

During the week-2 period, a low-amplitude mean 500-hPa pattern is forecast
across the CONUS due to the continued variable pattern forecast and resulta=
nt
high model uncertainty. The 00z ECMWF ensemble mean forecasts individual
ridges
and troughs to progress quickly across the CONUS during the period. However=
,
the GEFS depicts more persistent troughing across the northwestern and
north-central CONUS relative to the ECMWF.  Models are in better agreement
over
Alaska, as strong ridging forecast over eastern Siberia is forecast to
persist,
leading to mean troughing downstream across most of the state. Today=EF=BF=

manual
500-hPa height blend is based on the 06z GEFS, the 00z ECMWF ensemble mean,
and
the 00z Canadian ensemble mean. The resultant pattern features weakly cyclo=
nic
flow across most of the CONUS and more pronounced cyclonic flow over Alaska=
.

Surface high pressure over northwestern Canada and northeastern Alaska, fav=

increased easterly low-level flow and enhanced below-normal temperature
probabilities across much of Alaska. Potential increased troughing,
particularly in the GEFS solutions, leads to slightly increased odds of bel=

Above normal temperatures are favored to persist farther to the south acros=
s
the southwestern and south-central CONUS. Conversely, below-normal
temperatures
are favored over parts of the Southeast, due to a cool, stable airmass
forecast
early in the period.

Mean surface high pressure over northwestern Canada and northeastern Alaska
increases chances of below-normal precipitation across much of Alaska.
However,
a positively tilted trough is forecast to dig across the Mainland, leading =

a
potential for an increasingly active pattern downstream across the Panhandl=
e,
with associated elevated chances of above normal precipitation. Likewise,
predicted enhanced Pacific Flow increases odds for above-normal precipitati=
on
across the northwestern CONUS. Elevated probabilities of above-normal
precipitation are also favored across the Southern Plains, much of the
Mississippi and Ohio valleys, and the Great Lakes Region, associated with
potential return flow behind departing surface high pressure forecast over =
the
Southeast.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low into later this week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later this week...


...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...

During the extended period, an amplified trough will pass from
central to eastern CONUS by the weekend as a robust surface low
lifts northeastward through the Midwest/Great Lakes into eastern
Canada. The associated cold front will sweep across the East and
will provide focus for a concentrated area of moderate to locally
heavy rainfall as moisture from the Gulf and western Mid-Atlantic
converge near the front. The speed of the front may limit the
severity of runoff and the flooding potential; however, the most
promising area for this will be over the favored terrain of
interior New England. Enhanced wrap-around then lake effect snows
are expected from the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and into the
northern Appalachians/Northeast. Another potent shortwave/surface
low pressure system is expected for the the Midwest and Great
Lakes later in the period, bringing another blast of cold air that
will favor snow across the region.

For the Pacific Northwest, a long fetch of Pacific moisture will
stream onshore into Saturday resulting in rain in the lower levels
and snow in the highest peaks. Additional enhanced precipitation
is expected as embedded shortwaves enter the region later this
period. Overall, favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The global guidance is in fairly good agreement with the
clustering and progression of the amplified trough that passes
over the eastern U.S. In maintaining consistency, the WPC medium
range product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend
of best clustered guidance from the GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means along with the National Blend of Models.

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
into mid next week...

...Lake Effect/enhanced precipitation from this weekend through
mid next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...
The global guidance is in general agreement with the clustering
and progression of the amplified trough that slowly progresses
through the East into the Western Atlantic and a progressive
trough moving into the West.  While the 12z-18z GFS were a tad
strong with a shortwave moving along the central US/Canadian
border Monday into Tuesday, its overall pattern merges back
towards the consensus mid next week.  The WPC medium range product
suite was primarily derived from a blend of deterministic and
ensemble mean guidance along with the National Blend of Models.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...
An amplified trough will pass slowly through the eastern CONUS,
periodically reinforced by shortwaves rounding its southwest side.
 Its associated cold fronts sweep across the East Friday into
Saturday Enhanced lake effect snows are expected from the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes and into the northern Appalachians/Northeast.
Temperatures should be generally around 10F below average for
portions of the East Saturday through Tuesday. Moderation in the
East is expected on Wednesday as low pressure moves across central
Canada, with its cold front moving into the Upper Midwest, and the
surface ridge axis slides towards the Southeast coast.

For the Pacific Northwest, a long fetch of Pacific moisture with
moderate to heavy rainfall will stream onshore Sunday into
Wednesday resulting in rain in valleys and snow in the highest
peaks. Overall, favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades, as is usually the
case.  Until the Western trough moves into the area next Tuesday
and Wednesday, temperatures are expected to be 10-15F above
average before nudging slightly below average in the Northern
Continental Divide on Wednesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1236 AM CST Wed Nov 10 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to amplify as it moves across the
central CONUS today. A surface low will deepen over the
central/southern High Plains during the day, before moving into
portions of the upper Midwest by late tonight. Meanwhile, in the
wake of the trough, a surface ridge is forecast to build over the
Great Basin, resulting in the onset of offshore flow across portions
of southern California.

...Southeast NM/West TX...
Dry and breezy post-frontal conditions are expected across parts of
the southeast NM and west TX this afternoon. Sustained winds of
15-25 mph (with higher gusts) and minimum RH values below 20% are
expected, resulting in the potential for elevated to locally
critical fire-weather conditions in areas where receptive fuels are
available.

...Eastern CO...
Post-frontal downslope flow will result in relatively dry and breezy
conditions across parts of eastern CO this afternoon. Sustained
winds of 15-20 mph (with higher gusts) are possible, concurrent with
minimum RH values as low as 15-20%, resulting in a threat of
elevated fire-weather conditions.

...Southern CA...
Elevated wind/RH conditions may develop late tonight across
terrain-favored portions of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties,
within a developing offshore flow regime. However, with limited
coverage/duration of elevated conditions through the end of the
period and a lack of initially receptive fuels (based on latest fuel
guidance), no highlights have been included.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1236 AM CST Wed Nov 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Little change to the large-scale pattern is expected on Thursday,
with a deep mid/upper-level trough covering much of the Plains and
upper Midwest, while an upper ridge is maintained over the West. A
surface ridge will persist over the Great Basin, maintaining an
offshore flow regime across southern California.

...Southern California...
Offshore flow will result in potentially elevated wind/RH conditions
across portions of southern CA Thursday, especially across
terrain-favored areas. However, the extent and duration of elevated
conditions remains somewhat uncertain, with a tendency for the
strongest winds to occur overnight and during the morning, while RH
reductions supporting an elevated threat may be limited to the
afternoon and early evening. Another potential limiting factor will
be initially unfavorable fuels (per recent fuel guidance). While
some curing of fuels is expected with time, uncertainty regarding
the magnitude of the fire-weather threat remains too high to include
an Elevated area at this time.

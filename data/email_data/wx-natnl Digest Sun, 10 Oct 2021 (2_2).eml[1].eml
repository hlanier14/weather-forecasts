Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
423 AM EDT Sun Oct 10 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 10 2021 - 12Z Tue Oct 12 2021

...Severe weather and excessive rainfall expected tonight across
the southern Plains as the severe weather threat diminishes over
the northern Plains/upper Midwest...

...Some heavy rain and gusty winds expected over the North
Carolina coast this morning...

...Amplifying upper trough to inject some of the coldest air of
the season into the West early next week with heavy mountain snow
and much below normal temperatures likely...

An increasingly active weather pattern continues to take shape
across the U.S. mainland as a couple of strong upper-level troughs
are forecast to force their way eastward through the western half
of the country against the slow-moving regime near the East Coast.
 The first upper trough is responsible for the formation a pair of
low pressure systems across the mid-section of the country.  The
system moving across the northern Plains this morning is
responsible for triggering severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Dakotas into Minnesota.  This low will head into southern Canada
by tonight with the threat of severe weather quickly diminishing
over the upper Midwest.  In the wake of this system, another low
pressure system is forecast to form over the southern Plains
today, where a threat for severe weather will rapidly transpire
tonight over the region.  The Storm Prediction Center is
indicating a Moderate Risk for severe storms across central
Oklahoma for tonight.  The low pressure system will continue to
develop and track into the Great Lakes by Tuesday morning with the
threat of severe thunderstorms spreading further up the
mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes Monday into early
Tuesday.

Along the East Coast, the National Hurricane Center continues to
monitor a low pressure system forming near a stalled front just
off the North Carolina coast.  This system showed signs of
acquiring some tropical characteristics early this morning.
However, the main upper-level support is forecast to lift
northeastward away from the system during the next couple of days.
 Some heavy rain and gusty conditions can be expected along the
North Carolina coastal areas and may skirt the Virginia eastern
shores this morning before edging out to sea later today.  Some
showers are possible to extend further north into southern New
England on Monday as the associated frontal system will remain
slow to exit the East Coast.

Meanwhile, a frontal system tracking into the Pacific Northwest
this evening is associated with a deepening upper trough diving
south through British Columbia. The associated cold front is set
to usher in the coldest air of the season to date in the western
third of the country by Monday. In wake for the cold frontal
passage, high winds will ensue from the Great Valley of California
to the Desert Southwest. High Wind Watches have been issued in
advance due to the heightened risk for hazardous wind gusts.
Freeze Watches have also been posted for the western Nevada Basin.
As the front crosses the northern Rockies, plummeting snow levels
give way to periods of snow breaking out Sunday evening. By
Monday, as the trough continues to strengthen, so will the
evolving frontal system in the West, leading to heavy snow for the
many mountain ranges in the Intermountain West. Latest snowfall
forecast indicate anywhere from 6 to 12 inches (locally higher
amounts possible) may accumulate in the northern Rockies,
including ranges such as the Absarokas, Teton, Wind River, and Big
Horns. This upper trough becomes quite intense by early Tuesday,
setting the stage for copious amounts of snow in parts of the
Rockies and a potential severe weather outbreak in the southern
and central Great Plains.

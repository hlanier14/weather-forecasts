Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Fri Apr 15 2022

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A midlevel speed maximum embedded within broad westerly flow will
cross the central and southern Rockies today. In response, a lee
surface low will develop near southeastern CO and the TX/OK
Panhandles. The combination of very dry boundary-layer conditions
and breezy surface winds will result in enhanced fire-weather
conditions across parts of the central and southern High Plains
today.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
00Z soundings across the central and southern High Plains show a
very dry airmass already in place (10-15 percent RH), with poor
overnight recoveries expected. Downslope warming/drying accompanying
the midlevel speed maximum combined with diurnal heating/mixing will
result in widespread 10-20 percent RH across the central and
southern High Plains. At the same time, a tightening pressure
gradient peripheral to the developing lee surface low will favor
15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds. The strongest winds are
expected in the immediate lee of the central and southern Rockies,
where Critical highlights have been added. Fuels across the region
remain very dry (ERCs in the 90th-95th percentile), which will
further exacerbate the wildfire-spread threat.

...Central Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley...
A dry airmass will be in place across the central Appalachians into
the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley today, where 15-25 percent RH will
be possible during the afternoon. However, current indications are
that the overlap of breezy surface winds and low RH will be too
spatially limited for highlights at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Fri Apr 15 2022

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A midlevel shortwave trough will advance eastward across the
Southwest, while a cold front continues southward across the
southern Plains. While breezy post-frontal surface winds are
expected across the central and southern Plains, RH should generally
remain above 25 percent.

...Southwest...
Ahead of the approaching midlevel shortwave trough, 15-25 mph
southwesterly surface winds will develop amid 10-20 percent RH
during the afternoon. However, only modestly receptive fuels across
the region preclude the introduction of highlights at this time.

...Unsettled pattern continues in the South with isolated
instances of severe weather and flash flooding possible...

...Accumulating snowfall expected from the Sierra Nevada to the
Northern Rockies....

...Critical fire weather in the southern High Plains today;
contrasting temperatures this weekend with abnormally hot
conditions in the South and chilly conditions in the North...

The weather pattern this upcoming weekend in the Lower 48 features
abnormally warm temperatures across the South and more winter-like
conditions in the North, especially in the northern
Rockies/Plains. In between these two clashing air-masses is where
the most active weather is forecast to transpire. Focusing
initially on the Mid-South, areas of showers and thunderstorms
will envelope the region out ahead of a wave of low pressure in
the Southern Plains and a warm front lifting north through the
Lower Mississippi valley Friday afternoon. The Storm Prediction
Center (SPC) has issued a Slight Risk for parts of eastern
Oklahoma and western Arkansas where large hail, damaging winds,
and tornadoes are possible Friday afternoon and evening. There is
also a Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall from the Ozarks on
east into the heart of the Mid-South where localized flash
flooding may occur. By Saturday, the cold front pushes through the
East and the Deep South, with the latter having the best odds for
witnessing strong-to-severe thunderstorms. The SPC has an
expansive Marginal Risk area stretching from the Rio Grande on
east to the Southeast Coast. There is also a Marginal Risk for
Excessive Rainfall in the Lower Mississippi Valley on Saturday.
While severe storms are less likely, a few thunderstorms could
transpire along the I-95 corridor in the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic as the cold front traverses these regions Saturday
afternoon.

Farther north, a dome of Canadian high pressure settles in over
the northern High Plains today and into Saturday. Morning lows are
forecast to be in the single digits and highs struggling to break
the freezing mark in parts of Montana and the Dakotas, making it
feel more like mid-February rather than mid-April. There are also
much below normal temperatures in the Pacific Northwest with daily
temperature anomalies around 15 degrees below normal both Friday
and Saturday. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm system approaching the
West Coast this afternoon will usher in periods of valley/coastal
rain and mountain snow to northern California, the Sierra Nevada,
and southern Oregon tonight. As the storm tracks inland on
Saturday, the shield of precipitation will push into the northern
Rockies where accumulating snowfall is expected. In terms of
snowfall through early Easter Sunday morning, the heaviest totals
will be found in the Sierra Nevada and the Shastas of northern
California where snow totals surpassing a foot are likely in the
higher elevations. The Cascades could pick up light accumulations
while the Bitterroots may receive up to a foot of snow in spots.

Elsewhere, favorable fire weather conditions remain in place
across the central and southern High Plains today. A Critical Risk
area has been issued for southeast Colorado, northeast New Mexico,
and the farthest north and west portions of the Oklahoma and Texas
Panhandles. Farther south, South Texas becomes quite hot by
Saturday with daytime highs approaching the century mark in the
Rio Grande Valley. Easter Sunday in the South will feel more like
May with day time highs in the 80s and 90s from Florida and the
central Gulf Coast to the Southern Plains and Southwest. Across
the North, temperatures are forecast to feel more like March with
highs in the 40s and 50s from the Northwest and Midwest to the
Northeast.

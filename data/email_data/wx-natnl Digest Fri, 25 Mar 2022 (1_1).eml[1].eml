Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1137 AM CDT Thu Mar 24 2022

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS...

The overall forecast remains valid with minor adjustments. While
low-level winds may struggle to sustain Critical criteria across
South Texas, extremely dry fuels and low afternoon humidity should
support a few hours of Elevated to near Critical fire weather
conditions. Elsewhere, gusty northwest winds and dry surface
conditions may support a few hours of locally Elevated fire weather
potential across portions of the central High Plains. See the
previous discussion for more info.

..Lyons.. 03/24/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CDT Thu Mar 24 2022/

...Synopsis...
A long-wave trough will traverse the Mississippi Valley today, with
strong northwesterly flow overspreading a mixed boundary layer
across the central U.S. Dry and breezy conditions will develop
across the Plains as stronger flow aloft mixes down toward the
surface. Widespread 15+ mph sustained northwesterly surface winds
will develop across the central High Plains into southern Texas,
coinciding with 10-20 percent RH atop very dry fuels that are quite
receptive to fire spread, hence Elevated highlights. Critical
highlights also remain in place across Deep South Texas. The primary
driver for the Critical highlights is the extreme receptiveness of
the fuels, with forecast ERCs exceeding the 95th percentile. While
winds may struggle to sustain at 20 mph for lengthy periods of time,
the 15 percent RH and extremely dry fuels should compensate to
support conditions favorable for significant wildfire spread.

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast to shift westward over the
higher
latitudes of eastern North America at the beginning of April with mid-level
low
pressure prevailing across the central and eastern U.S. This pattern is lik=
ely
to promote below-normal temperatures for much of the Great Plains, Mississi=
ppi
Valley, and Corn Belt. Early in week-2, a low pressure system and trailing
cold
front are expected to progress eastward from the Mississippi Valley to the
East
Coast. Above-normal temperatures are favored for much of Mainland Alaska as
the
spring snowmelt and river breakup season typically begin later in April.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the central and
eastern U.S., Fri-Tue, Apr 1-5.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the central Rockies, Fri-Sat, Apr 1-2.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of the eastern U.S., Sat-Mon, A=
pr
2-4.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MARCH 27 - THURSDAY MARCH 31:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=

x4CiOUTShY3$

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 01 - THURSDAY APRIL 07: The GFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensem=
ble
means are in good agreement that positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the
higher latitudes of North America persist into the first week of April. The
GFS
ensemble mean depicts a negative phase of the NAO heading into week-2 with =
its
ensemble members favoring a trend towards neutral or positive by the end of
week-2. April temperature composites feature a positive correlation with a =
-
NAO
across the central U.S. which is consistent with dynamical model output,
raising forecast confidence in a cold start to the month. The antecedent
wetness and anomalously cold start to April are expected to slow early spri=
ng
planting across the Corn Belt. A slight risk of much below normal temperatu=
res
(April 1 to 5) is posted for parts of the Great Plains, Mississippi Valley,
Corn Belt, and Southeast based on where the GEFS and/or ECMWF reforecast to=
ols
depict minimum temperatures having a 20 percent chance of falling into the
lowest 15th percentile and below 40 degrees F. Emerging vegetation from the
Southern Great Plains east to the Tennessee Valley could be damaged by a fr=
ost
or freeze at the beginning of April.



A 500-hPa trough is forecast to shift eastward from the Rockies on April 1 =
to
the east-central U.S. by April 3. The 500-hPa pattern and 24-hour
precipitation
amounts from the ensemble means support a slight risk of heavy snow (more t=
han
6 inches) for the Colorado Rockies on Apr 1 and 2. As this 500-hPa trough
progresses eastward, a low pressure system and trailing front cold result i=
n
24-hour rainfall amounts exceeding 1 inch. Based on various precipitation
tools, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for the Lower
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic.

Following recent runoff from snowmelt across eastern North Dakota and weste=
rn
Minnesota, spring flooding began this week along the Red River of the North=
.
River levels are forecast to reach moderate flood stage and peak next week =
at
Fargo, North Dakota. Minor to moderate flooding is expected to continue
through
early April.



Model solutions are in good agreement with an amplified 500-hPa trough over
the
Bering Sea and Aleutians which would promote enhanced onshore flow across
southern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Although the uncalibrate=
d
ECMWF output and its reforecast tool favor local precipitation amounts to
exceed 2 inches, liquid equivalent, at the beginning of April, overall amou=
nts
are expected to remain below hazards thresholds. While there are increasing
chances that maximum daytime temperatures will rise above freezing in the
lower
elevations of the southern Mainland during week-2, it is worth noting that =
the
persistence of anomalously warmer and wetter conditions over the state bear=
s
close monitoring later in April as this may accelerate river ice breakup wh=
ich
raises concern for ice jams and potential river flooding.

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTH DAKOTA AND
NEBRASKA....

The overall forecast remains on track with a few adjustments. The
Critical area was shifted south with the greatest confidence in near
Critical sustained fire weather conditions across central and
southern Nebraska. While fuels are less supportive farther south,
greater overlap of strong winds and low humidity is expected than
farther north. Surrounding the Critical zone, confidence in
sustained Elevated conditions is lower due to cooler temperatures
and marginal RH. At least a few hours of locally Elevated conditions
appears possible with gusty winds in mostly dry fuels.

...Southeast...
Offshore flow in the wake of a strong cold front may support a few
hours of dry and windy conditions across portions of the Gulf Coast
and Florida. However, fire weather concerns are low given ample
recent precipitation and limited available dry fuels.

..Lyons.. 03/24/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Thu Mar 24 2022/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will build across the Desert Southwest, with a
well-defined mid-level trough cresting the ridge and traversing the
northern and central Plains tomorrow/Friday. A dry boundary layer
will develop during the afternoon and encourage downward mixing of
the stronger flow aloft to support dry and windy conditions
conducive to fire spread. Widespread 15-25 mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds will overlap with 15-25 percent RH from
the northern High Plains southeastward into eastern Nebraska and
South Dakota. Critical highlights have been introduced where RH may
dip to 15 percent by afternoon peak heating, and where fuels are
critically dry (i.e., observed ERCs exceeding the 90th percentile
and forecast 10-hour fuel moisture dropping below 10 percent).
Portions of eastern Nebraska may also experience Critical
meteorological conditions, but recent appreciable precipitation
accumulations may dampen the robustness of the wildfire-spread
threat to a degree.

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 27 2022 - 12Z Thu Mar 31 2022

...Record warmth and cold likely next week for different parts of
the Lower 48 in dynamic springtime pattern...


...Overview...

A strong upper trough and embedded closed low will progress
into/through the Southwestern states early next week before
lifting into the central Plains/Great Lakes by next Wed/Thu. This
will promote a rather wet pattern for the Southwest/Four Corners
region into the Plains and eventually the Southeast through the
week. Colder than normal temperatures within the trough may
feature record cold temperatures for parts of the Great Lakes and
Northeast (with snow over the northern tier) while ridging ahead
of the incoming western trough may feature record warmth over the
Interior West into the southern Plains.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Though the upper pattern falls in the usually more predictable
phase between zonal and blocky flow (inherently less predictable
for different reasons), there was an added complication to the
forecast; namely, separate northern and southern stream flow out
of the Pacific into the West. The 00Z/06Z GFS runs were quite
different than the preferred cluster of the 00Z
ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET/ECMWF ensemble mean in their handling of the
northern stream (much slower) so that it resulted in a stronger
and much slower system next week through the Plains. This was
evidenced by many 06Z GEFS members on the slower side but with
perhaps just as many quicker members nearer to the ECMWF/CMCE
consensus, which was near the largest overlap among the three
ensemble systems. Note that the 12Z GFS did quicken its pace
toward the ECMWF/Canadian-led cluster. By the end of the period, a
positively-tilted trough between the northern and southern streams
should move east of the Plains as a weaker shortwave comes into
the Pac NW. Despite the good agreement between the ECMWF and
Canadian even into next Thursday, increased the weighting of the
00Z ECMWF ensemble mean with time to account for uncertainty as
the system could still trend a bit deeper/slower as shown by some
of its ensemble members.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Light precipitation could linger across the Great Lakes region and
Northeast early in the period given strong cyclonic flow and
coastal low pressure systems. As the next system moves into the
western U.S. early next week, unsettled and active weather is
expected for the West Coast states Sunday, which could bring
mostly beneficial and welcome rains to the valleys. Higher
elevation areas of the Sierra could see see several inches or more
of snow. Current model guidance shows the heaviest rain totals for
southern California Sunday and Monday especially enhanced by
higher terrain, which could cause flooding issues if heavy rain
falls over burn scar areas. Rain and higher elevation snow will
spread across the Intermountain West and Rockies Monday and
Tuesday. As surface low pressure strengthens in the Plains and
tracks east, more widespread rain and thunderstorms are likely for
the southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley Tuesday and
Wednesday. Meanwhile on the northern side of the precipitation
shield, a wintry mix and accumulating snow are possible for the
northern tier around the Great Lakes and potentially into the
Northeast. Rainfall could remain heavy through the Southeast into
next Thursday.

Unseasonably warm temperatures are likely underneath upper ridging
from the western states into the Plains early next week, and
temperatures of 10-25F above normal will be common. Though
expansive record-breaking warmth will occur in the short range,
some record highs and high minimum temperatures could be set or
tied Sunday and Monday. Temperatures in the West will be near to
below normal as the cold front moves through. Much of the East
will see below normal temperatures early in the week, perhaps by
as much as 10-25F. Freezing temperatures overnight may dip into
parts of the Carolinas. A moderation in temperatures should
commence by Wednesday ahead of the storm in the Plains.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu March 24 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 30 - APR 03, 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement reg=
arding an amplified 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern across North America. Consistent with the negat=
ive
phases of the AO and NAO, there is a strong anomalous ridge across the west=
ern
Atlantic near Greenland and a trough to the south across the Northeast and
northwest Atlantic. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual blend depicts =
below normal 500-hPa
heights
across much of the CONUS with a mean trough over the central CONUS. Anomalo=
us
ridging is forecast to develop extending from Alaska to the West Coast, whi=
le
a
strong trough upstream over the Bering Sea is expected with below normal
heights favored across the Aleutians.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored over much of Alaska due to
forecast ridging to the south of the state. The exception is parts of the
northern Mainland, where increased probabilities for below normal temperatu=
res
are favored, supported by the uncalibrated ECMWF and GEFS ensembles.
Probabilities for near to above normal temperatures are increased across mu=
ch
of the western CONUS due to a more zonal flow pattern and relatively higher
mid-level heights. Increased probabilities of below normal temperatures are
favored for the Central and Southern Rockies, Great Plains and much of the
Great Lakes region in association with the forecast troughing over the cent=
ral
CONUS. Probabilities for near to above normal temperatures are increased
across
the eastern CONUS ahead of the troughing.

Enhanced probabilities for near to above normal precipitation are indicated
for
much of the CONUS east of the Rockies during the period. There is now good
agreement among the ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian models regarding cyclogenesis
across the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley, potentially increasing
precipitation chances across parts of the east-central CONUS during the
period.
Below normal precipitation probabilities remain increased across southern
Texas, consistent with the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are also favored for the western CONUS, as
troughing is forecast to move over the central CONUS. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are increased across parts of the Northern Plai=
ns,
supported by the consolidated forecast tool. Southwesterly flow across Alas=
ka
ahead of troughing over the Bering Sea favors a tilt toward increased near =
to
above normal precipitation probabilities across nearly all of Alaska.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by increasing uncertainty associated with temperatu=
re
and precipitation forecast tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 01 - 07 2022

During week-2, the negative NAO/AO signal is forecast to significantly weak=
en,
as 500-hPa heights return to near normal across much of the higher latitude=
s
of
the Atlantic. However, enhanced troughing is favored to propagate across th=
e
CONUS. Near to slightly below normal heights are indicated in the manual bl=
end
over much of the eastern and central CONUS. A more amplified 500-hPa patter=
n
is
forecast to persist across the North Pacific, with troughing over the Berin=
g
Sea and parts of Alaska, while weak ridging over the Northeast Pacific and =
the
West Coast, extending northward to the Alaska Panhandle and northeastern
Mainland Alaska.

Given the predicted troughing forecast to propagate across the CONUS, along
with a continuing negative NAO signature, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecas=
t
tools indicate elevated probabilities for near to below normal temperatures
across the central and eastern CONUS. Both reforecast tools continue to dep=
ict
increased probabilities for above normal temperatures across the West. Abov=
e
normal temperature probabilities are increased over the Florida Peninsula
supported by the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools. Elevated probabilities fo=
r
near to above normal temperatures remain favored for most of Alaska, due to
persistent southwesterly mid-level flow ahead of troughing forecast over th=
e
Bering Sea except parts of northern Mainland Alaska, where increased
probabilities for below normal temperatures are favored.

Increased chances for near to above normal precipitation are favored for th=
e
Central Plains and the eastern CONUS due to troughing forecast to propagate
across the CONUS, along with increased potential for surface low developmen=
t
and frontal activity. Both reforecast tools support enhanced below normal
precipitation probabilities across parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley an=
d
Southern Plains. Increased chances for below normal precipitation are
indicated
for the West as troughing shifts further inland across the CONUS allowing a
more northwesterly flow along the West Coast. Continued enhanced southweste=
rly
flow ahead of troughing over the Bering Sea favors increased chances for ne=
ar
to above normal precipitation across southern Alaska.

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted significant weakening of the AO/NAO signal during the period an=
d
offset by some differences in the calibrated and uncalibrated temperature
tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Mixed precipitation expected across northern New England
tonight into tomorrow...

...Critical fire weather conditions expected for parts of the
north-central Plains tomorrow...

...Record warmth likely across parts of the West into the weekend
as much colder temperatures spread across the Midwest...

Low pressure developing along the Mid-Atlantic coast today is
expected to track northeast along the New England coast overnight
into tomorrow, bringing more rain to southern New York and New
England.  Across northern New York and New England, a wintry mix
is expected.  Across the Adirondacks and much of northern New
England, some minor ice accumulations are possible with a few
inches of snow possible across northern Maine.

Behind this system, a series of cold fronts will move across the
Midwest into the East, bringing rain and snow showers, in addition
to colder temperatures across the region.  A strong upper level
disturbance associated with one of these fronts is forecast to
dive southeast from the northern Plains on Friday into the Ohio
Valley and lower Great Lakes on Saturday.  This will bring
significantly colder air down from the Upper Midwest into the Ohio
Valley and central Appalachians, with daytime temperatures on
Saturday expected to be 10-20 degrees below normal across the
region.  In addition to the colder temperatures, this system may
produce some significant snow accumulations across the higher
elevations of the central Appalachians.  Meanwhile, cold
northwesterly winds blowing across the northern Great Lakes will
likely encourage lake effect snow showers, with a few inches of
accumulating snow possible, especially across the U.P. and
northern Lower Michigan.

Farther to the west, dry conditions and gusty winds as a cold
front pushes through the region will produce critical fire weather
conditions across portions of the north-central Plains on Friday.
Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings have been issued for
portions of South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas, where any fires
that develop may spread quickly.

A strong and expansive upper level ridge will remain positioned
over the western U.S., supporting much above normal temperatures
across the western half of the country through this weekend.
Daytime highs for much of the West into the southern Plains are
expected to remain 10-20 degrees above normal through the end of
the week. Numerous daily record high temperatures are forecast
through Saturday across California, the Great Basin, and the
Southwest.

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTH-CENTRAL SOUTH DAKOTA AND
PORTIONS OF NORTHERN NEBRASKA....

...Synopsis...
An upper-level low will amplify as it moves into the Great Lakes
today. As this occurs, a strong mid-level jet will overspread the
northern Plains into the western Great Lakes. In addition, the
surface pressure gradient will tighten as a surface low deepens
across southern Canada. All of these factors will lead to windy
conditions from the northern Plains into the western Great Lakes,
with sustained winds 25 to 30 mph and some gusts to 40 mph possible.
Relative humidity is forecast to drop into the teens across portions
of South Dakota and Nebraska this afternoon with temperatures in the
low to mid 50s. Fuel guidance is not that dry in the region, but
most grasses are still dormant. Therefore, large fires will be
possible, especially in finer fuels.

0152 AM CDT Fri Mar 25 2022

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
On Saturday, an upper-level low will move from the Great Lakes into
the Northeast. A strong mid-level jet will traverse the Tennessee
Valley through the Carolinas on Saturday afternoon. In the wake of a
cold front, dry and breezy conditions are expected to develop across
South Carolina and possibly North Carolina. However, recent rainfall
should temper the fire weather threat. If fuels dry enough today
(Friday), some elevated fire weather conditions may be possible, but
these fuel conditions will need to be monitored over the next 36
hours.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Fri Mar 25 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Mar 28 2022 - 12Z Fri Apr 01 2022

...Overview...

An amplified upper trough and lingering wintry weather will exit
the northeastern U.S. by early next week, leaving a cooled airmass
down across the north-central through eastern states. The main
weather focus across the nation will shift to the West as a strong
upper trough and embedded closed low progress into/through the
Southwestern states early next week before lifting across the
south-central Rockies/Plains midweek. There is then a growing
guidance trend to increase phasing with northern stream trough
energies over the east-central U.S. into next Thursday/Friday that
would also promote more organized surface low and frontal
development and strength. Overall, this will favor rather
unsettled and wet pattern from CA and the Southwest to the
south-central Rockies early next week (including mountain snows)
that will emerge, expand in magnitude and spread from Plains to
the east-central and eastern/southeastern U.S. later next week as
Gulf moisutre increasing feeds into the system.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

A composite of reasonably well clustered guidance from the 18 UTC
GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian seems to offer a good forecast
basis Monday into Wednesday. Forecast spread increases by later
Wednesday into next Friday, but has improved a bit from yesterday.
Of the ensemble systems, the 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean provides
the most reasonable midpoint solution between more varied models
are these longer time frames.  The WPC medium range product suite
was primarily derived from preferred guidance along with the 01
UTC National Blend of Models. This solution seems in line with
latest guidance trends and maintains good product continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Model guidance shows the heaviest rain totals for southern
California into Monday especially enhanced by higher terrain,
which could cause flooding issues if heavy rain falls over burn
scar areas. Rain and higher elevation snow will spread across the
Intermountain West and Rockies Monday and Tuesday. As surface low
pressure strengthens in the Plains and tracks east, more
widespread rain and thunderstorms are likely for the
southern/eastern Plains and mid-lower Mississippi Valley Tuesday
and Wednesday. Meanwhile on the northern side of the precipitation
shield, a wintry mix and accumulating wrapping snows are possible
for the northern tier, mainly from the Upper Midwest the the Great
Lakes and northern tier of the Northeast. Rainfall could remain
heavy through the east and especiallly the Southeast later next
week.

...Overview...

An amplified upper trough and lingering wintry weather will exit
the northeastern U.S. by early next week, leaving a cooled airmass
down across the north-central through eastern states. The main
weather focus across the nation will shift to the West as a strong
upper trough and embedded closed low progress into/through the
Southwestern states early next week before lifting across the
south-central Rockies/Plains midweek. There is then a growing
guidance trend to increase phasing with northern stream trough
energies over the east-central U.S. into next Thursday/Friday that
would also promote more organized surface low and frontal
development and strength. Overall, this will favor rather
unsettled and wet pattern from CA and the Southwest to the
south-central Rockies early next week (including mountain snows)
that will emerge, expand in magnitude and spread from Plains to
the east-central and eastern/southeastern U.S. later next week as
Gulf moisutre increasing feeds into the system.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

A composite of reasonably well clustered guidance from the 18 UTC
GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian seems to offer a good forecast
basis Monday into Wednesday. Forecast spread increases by later
Wednesday into next Friday, but has improved a bit from yesterday.
Of the ensemble systems, the 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean provides
the most reasonable midpoint solution between more varied models
are these longer time frames.  The WPC medium range product suite
was primarily derived from preferred guidance along with the 01
UTC National Blend of Models. This solution seems in line with
latest guidance trends and maintains good product continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Model guidance shows the heaviest rain totals for southern
California into Monday especially enhanced by higher terrain,
which could cause flooding issues if heavy rain falls over burn
scar areas. Rain and higher elevation snow will spread across the
Intermountain West and Rockies Monday and Tuesday. As surface low
pressure strengthens in the Plains and tracks east, more
widespread rain and thunderstorms are likely for the
southern/eastern Plains and mid-lower Mississippi Valley Tuesday
and Wednesday. Meanwhile on the northern side of the precipitation
shield, a wintry mix and accumulating wrapping snows are possible
for the northern tier, mainly from the Upper Midwest the the Great
Lakes and northern tier of the Northeast. Rainfall could remain
heavy through the east and especiallly the Southeast later next
week.

00 UTC guidance has trended or maintained this scenario. The WPC

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Northern/Central Plains...

Low pressure over the Gulf of Maine moves briefly onshore over
Maine, then into the Canadian Maritimes overnight Friday. The
system will produce four to six inches of snow over Northern
Maine. In addition, there will be a zone of rain/freezing rain
between the snow/rain line through late Friday night, when the
snow/rain comes mainly to an end.

Multiple areas of upper-level energy over the Tennessee Valley and
Southeast will move northeastward off the East Coast by late
Friday night. Another area of upper-level energy over the Upper
Mississippi Valley will develop into an upper-level low by
Saturday morning over the Great Lakes. Then the energy will move
to the northeast into Southeastern Canada by Sunday morning as
additional upper-level energy moves over the Great Lakes. The
energy over the Upper Great Lakes will aid in producing rain and
snow over Midwest into the Ohio Valley and Lower Great Lakes and
higher elevations of Northern New England through early Sunday
morning.

Furthermore, weak onshore flow will aid in producing light rain
over parts of the Pacific Northwest early Saturday into Sunday. In
addition, the SPC has issued a Critical Risk of fire weather over
parts of the Northern/Central Plains on Friday into Saturday
morning due to gusty winds, low relative humidity, and dry fuels.
The threat of Critical fire weather decreases on Saturday into
Sunday morning. Moreover, an upper-level ridge over the Rockies
will allow temperatures to reach record high temperatures or tie
over the southwestern portion of the country through Sunday.

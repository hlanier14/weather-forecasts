Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Tue Jun 01 2021

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...Central California...
Gusty onshore and down-valley winds of 10-20 mph are expected to
continue this afternoon, aided by the development of a strong
thermal pressure trough expected to develop across central
California. While wind speeds will be marginal, the increase in flow
should be sufficient to support elevated fire weather potential
along the lee of the coastal ranges and the western rim of the San
Joaquin Valley. Very warm temperatures of 80-100 F will support low
surface humidity of 10-20% through peak heating. Terrain enhancement
through gaps may also support locally critical fire weather
conditions where fuel density permits.

Along the eastern rim of the Central Valley, upslope flow of 10-15
mph may support locally elevated/critical fire weather conditions
given the warm temperatures, low RH, and unseasonably dry fuels. The
eastern edge of the elevated area was trimmed to account for lower
fuel density within the central San Joaquin Valley.

..Lyons.. 06/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0115 AM CDT Tue Jun 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level troughing is expected across the central and eastern
CONUS as ridging aloft builds over the West Coast today. Similar to
yesterday, weak surface winds or appreciable rainfall accumulations
will hinder major wildfire concerns east of the Rockies. Along the
West Coast however, hot temperatures will promote at least some
wildfire concerns. Otherwise, locally dry and breezy conditions may
manifest this afternoon across terrain-favoring areas across the
Lower Colorado River Valley.

...Central California...
By afternoon peak heating, 100 F surface temperatures will support
thermal low development across the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valley
areas. By late afternoon, dry downslope flow along the lee of the
Coast Ranges will promote 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds
coinciding with 10-20% RH, atop very dry fuels across parts of the
lower Sacramento Valley, Bay Area, and San Joaquin Valley. The very
hot temperatures will also foster plume-dominated wildfire potential
across higher terrain areas. The summation of the aforementioned
favorable wildfire-spread conditions warrants the continuation of
Elevated highlights.

...Record Heat Likely Over Portions of the West to Northern
Plains...
...Multiple Day Heavy Rainfall Event Likely For Parts of Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The upper level pattern is expected to undergo a pattern change
through the period with ridging becoming more persistent and
anchored off the Southeast U.S. while larger scale troughing
settles over the Western CONUS. In between, lagging/residual
troughing in place and southerly flow will lead to a plume of
deeper Gulf of Mexico moisture and unsettled weather over the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley.

From a synoptic view, the latest model guidance is in reasonable
agreement and offers average to above average predictability for
this cycle. The deterministic and ensemble guidance all advertise
the western U.S. trough and eastern ridge developing over the
course of the period. The largest mass field differences were
noted to be across the Pacific NW with the timing and strength of
the shortwave energy as well as off the Southern California coast
with the potential development of a closed low. While days 3-5
were clustered fairly well, the ensemble means were used more
heavily on days 6-7 to mitigate some of this uncertainty.

Further east, weakness in the upper levels on day 3 over Texas
could transition into a more developed trough by this weekend. At
the surface, troughing or a frontal boundary may setup along the
Texas coast and with the increasing southerly flow, a plume of
deeper moisture is likely to override this. There are some
differences in the QPF placement, with the 00Z ECMWF further west
(slower) compared to the GFS and even the CMC (which is furthest
east). So despite the relatively good agreement in the large scale
mass fields, more mesoscale driven processes are likely driving
the larger QPF differences which are difficult to pinpoint this
far out.

Overall the WPC blend consisted of a near equal blend of the 00Z
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and 06Z GFS for days 3-5 followed by mostly
ECENS/GEFS means with some inclusion of the deterministic runs for
day 6-7 given some of the uncertainty, though the ECMWF remained a
larger proportion of the blend, especially for the QPF blend
across the Southern Plains and Lower MS Valley.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A multi-day heavy rainfall event is looking more likely across
portions of Texas, Louisiana, and into the ArkLaTex region with
the persistent source of deeper Gulf moisture interacting with a
upper level trough. Over the course of the period, several inches
of rain is expected and this region is already highly susceptible
to any kind of heavy rainfall given much above normal
precipitation over recent weeks. Elsewhere, conditions should dry
out across the East into the weekend, with showers lingering over
parts of the Southeast. Out West, a gradual increase of moisture
over the Pacific Northwest is expected, with some activity also
possible into the northern Rockies and eventually the northern
tier.

The greatest temperature departures will be found across the
Interior West, Northern Rockies, and Northern Plains Friday and
Saturday. Daytime highs are likely to reach 20F to near 30F above
normal with large areas possibly breaking records for the date.
The unseasonable heat will spread eastward toward the Great Lakes
and Northeast later in the weekend and early next week with highs
reaching 10-20F above normal. Further south across Texas, below
normal highs are likely with all the clouds, unsettled weather,
and widespread precipitation expected. For low temperatures, much
of the CONUS will see normal to much above normal readings, with
the greatest departures from normal confined to the Interior West,
Northern Plains, and Northeast.

the greatest departures from normal confined to the Interior West,
Northern Plains, and Northeast.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 01 2021

SYNOPSIS: Dynamical model guidance shows a region of mid-level high pressure
over eastern North America at the beginning of Week-2. This high is forecast
to
weaken throughout the period, but could still drive heat-related concerns
during the early to middle portion of Week-2. There are some signs of a
continuing wet pattern for areas adjacent to the western Gulf of Mexico
through
mid-June, but these signals lack clear ties to any large-scale circulation
features. Nevertheless, antecedent rainfall could result in river flooding
lingering for portions of Texas and Louisiana into the forecast period.
Mid-level low pressure is forecast near the Pacific Northwest coastline and
over the Bering Sea during Week-2, although the ongoing dry season presence in
these locations precludes any associated precipitation hazards.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northeast, Wed, June 9.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern and Central Plains,
Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Tennessee
Valley, Central Appalachians, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic, Wed-Sat, June 9-12.

Flooding possible for portions of Louisiana and East Texas.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY JUNE 04 - TUESDAY JUNE 08:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!qhz-rNrZ2FwmfjPSgKsWE-elUjTmkjQnOFQBsvLRFV3IOifRjfOgMXZSIZIljFx6ZSnXBF4T$

FOR WEDNESDAY JUNE 09 - TUESDAY JUNE 15: An anomalous ridge axis continues to
be forecast near the Ontario/Quebec border by the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble means at the beginning of the forecast period. This feature is
slightly weaker than yesterday's guidance, but substantial enough to drive
heat-related hazards along the northern tier of the CONUS. Unlike yesterday,
today's National Blend of Models does not indicate daily record high potential
across the Northeast, yet calibrated reforecast guidance shows at least a 10%
chance of temperatures being in the top 1% of climatological values by both
the
GEFS and ECMWF on June 9th. As such, a moderate risk of excessive heat
stretches across the aforementioned area from approximately Buffalo through
Boston and northward to the Canadian border. Reforecast guidance also supports
a slight risk of excessive heat extending from the Northern High Plains
eastward through the Atlantic Coastline on the 9th through 12th. By late in
Week-2, model guidance shows weakening height anomalies across eastern Canada,
particularly in the GEFS, resulting in the heat potential timing out from the
13th onward. High temperatures across the Northeast late in Week-1 and early
in
Week-2 are likely to be the warmest temperatures observed to date across the
region during 2021, potentially leaving vulnerable populations particularly
susceptible. For a refresher on heat safety, consider preparing for the heat
wave by reviewing
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat__;!!DZ3fjg!qhz-rNrZ2FwmfjPSgKsWE-elUjTmkjQnOFQBsvLRFV3IOifRjfOgMXZSIZIljFx6ZfA3-EAE$ .



Rainfall over the last 30 days ranges from 200-400% of normal across the
western Gulf Coast states as a result of multiple episodes of onshore flow.
Amazingly, portions of this region were experiencing severe drought (D3) as
recently as April 27th. Needless to say, the region is vulnerable to flooding
impacts from subsequent rainfall, and the Weather Prediction Center currently
anticipates another 2 to 5 inches of rain falling here prior to Week-2. This
could lead to possible flooding ongoing at the beginning of Week-2. Reforecast
guidance continues to highlight this region for possible additional heavy
rainfall (greater than 20% chance of exceeding the 85th climatological
percentile) during the early to middle portion of Week-2. Despite this, raw
model guidance suggests these signals to be transient in time and space,
suggestive of convection with limited predictability in the absence of any
significant synoptic feature. As a result, no heavy rain threat is indicated
on
today's forecast.



The one potential feature which bears monitoring for any heavy rainfall
potential is the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles suggesting the potential for a
tropical cyclone to develop along the east coast of Central America during
Week-2. While this is relatively early in the Atlantic season, the large-scale
environment is likely to be favorable for cyclogenesis given the intraseasonal
state as eastward-propagating features cross the Atlantic. If this system
develops far enough away from Central America, it may be able to maintain
itself while tracking northward toward the Gulf of Mexico. For more
information
on this system please see the Global Tropical Hazards product or subsequent
Week-2 U.S. Hazards outlooks.



Over the Pacific, the Week-2 mean circulations show anomalous 500-hPa ridging
south of the Aleutians and troughing off of Northern California. Given the
ongoing the dry season across Alaska and ensemble spread among guidance across
portions of the West, no associated precipitation hazards are anticipated from
this setup. Temperatures for the West are likely to be near to slightly
below-normal in this scenario with Alaska potentially experiencing slightly
above-normal temperatures.

...Record Heat Likely Over Portions of the West to Northern
Plains...
...Multiple Day Heavy Rainfall Event Likely For Parts of Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The upper level pattern is expected to undergo a pattern change
through the period with ridging becoming more persistent and
anchored off the Southeast U.S. while larger scale troughing
settles over the Western CONUS. In between, lagging/residual
troughing in place and southerly flow will lead to a plume of
deeper Gulf of Mexico moisture and unsettled weather over the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley.

From a synoptic view, the latest model guidance is in reasonable
agreement and offers average to above average predictability for
this cycle. The deterministic and ensemble guidance all advertise
the western U.S. trough and eastern ridge developing over the
course of the period. The largest mass field differences were
noted to be across the Pacific NW with the timing and strength of
the shortwave energy as well as off the Southern California coast
with the potential development of a closed low. While days 3-5
were clustered fairly well, the ensemble means were used more
heavily on days 6-7 to mitigate some of this uncertainty.

Further east, weakness in the upper levels on day 3 over Texas
could transition into a more developed trough by this weekend. At
the surface, troughing or a frontal boundary may setup along the
Texas coast and with the increasing southerly flow, a plume of
deeper moisture is likely to override this. There are some
differences in the QPF placement, with the 00Z ECMWF further west
(slower) compared to the GFS and even the CMC (which is furthest
east). So despite the relatively good agreement in the large scale
mass fields, more mesoscale driven processes are likely driving
the larger QPF differences which are difficult to pinpoint this
far out.

Overall the WPC blend consisted of a near equal blend of the 00Z
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and 06Z GFS for days 3-5 followed by mostly
ECENS/GEFS means with some inclusion of the deterministic runs for
day 6-7 given some of the uncertainty, though the ECMWF remained a
larger proportion of the blend, especially for the QPF blend
across the Southern Plains and Lower MS Valley.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A multi-day heavy rainfall event is looking more likely across
portions of Texas, Louisiana, and into the ArkLaTex region with
the persistent source of deeper Gulf moisture interacting with a
upper level trough. Over the course of the period, several inches
of rain is expected and this region is already highly susceptible
to any kind of heavy rainfall given much above normal
precipitation over recent weeks. Elsewhere, conditions should dry
out across the East into the weekend, with showers lingering over
parts of the Southeast. Out West, a gradual increase of moisture
over the Pacific Northwest is expected, with some activity also
possible into the northern Rockies and eventually the northern
tier.

The greatest temperature departures will be found across the
Interior West, Northern Rockies, and Northern Plains Friday and
Saturday. Daytime highs are likely to reach 20F to near 30F above
normal with large areas possibly breaking records for the date.
The unseasonable heat will spread eastward toward the Great Lakes
and Northeast later in the weekend and early next week with highs
reaching 10-20F above normal. Further south across Texas, below
normal highs are likely with all the clouds, unsettled weather,
and widespread precipitation expected. For low temperatures, much
of the CONUS will see normal to much above normal readings, with
the greatest departures from normal confined to the Interior West,
Northern Plains, and Northeast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 PM CDT Tue Jun 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...California and into the Cascades...
The forecast remains mostly on track for hot, dry, and breezy
conditions underneath the ridge of high pressure through much of
central California. The Elevated area was trimmed on the eastern
side to better account for limited fuels in the central San Joaquin
Valley. Upslope flow and local terrain effects may also support
locally elevated/critical conditions along the windward slopes of
the eastern Central Valley through the afternoon. Additionally, a
few slow moving thunderstorms may develop in the High Sierra into
the southern Cascades, posing a risk for a few lightning strikes
within receptive fuels through the afternoon.

..Lyons.. 06/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CDT Tue Jun 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough across the central CONUS will gradually shift
eastward towards the eastern U.S. as the upper ridge centered over
the West Coast drifts toward the Inter-mountain West tomorrow. A
combination of either showers/thunderstorms, moist low-level
conditions, or weak surface winds will continue to limit widespread,
significant wildfire-spread potential across the central/eastern
U.S. Similar to Day 1, locally dry, breezy conditions may occur over
terrain-favoring areas of the Lower Colorado River Basin tomorrow
afternoon. Also, hot surface temperatures along the West Coast will
support some wildfire-spread potential.

...Central into northern California...
Up to 100 F surface temperatures are expected again across portions
of the San Joaquin Valley and Bay Area. Thermal-low induced
downslope flow along the Coast Ranges will support periods of
overlapping 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds and 10-20% RH,
necessitating the introduction of Elevated highlights. More
localized, brief Elevated conditions may also occur along the lee of
the Southern Cascades and Klamath Mountains across far northern
California during the late afternoon, as shown by some of the latest
high-resolution guidance. Across much of California, the hot
temperatures will again support some plume-dominated wildfire
potential across higher-terrain areas.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue June 01 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 07 - 11 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast ridging over the
North
Pacific and the Aleutians. Downstream, a trough is predicted over the western
CONUS, and ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over
the
northeastern CONUS. Southerly low-level surface flow is predicted into the
central and eastern CONUS, around surface high pressure over the Atlantic
Ocean. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF ensemble mean
slightly greater than the NCEP GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to recent
model skill.

A predicted trough and negative 500-hPa height anomalies lead to likely below
normal temperatures over the West Coast. Below normal temperatures are also
favored over parts of Texas and Louisiana, as a trough and storm systems are
predicted to traverse the region. Probabilities of near to above normal
temperatures are enhanced for the remainder of the CONUS under near to above
normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal temperatures are favored for far southern
Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians and the Alaska Panhandle, while below normal
temperatures are slightly more likely for northwestern Mainland Alaska,
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the
northeastern
CONUS lead to increased probabilities of below normal precipitation for parts
of the northeastern CONUS. Increased probabilities of near to above normal
precipitation are indicated over the south-central and southeastern CONUS,
related to potential storm systems associated with shortwave troughs and
anomalous southerly surface flow. Below normal precipitation is likely over
most of the western and north-central CONUS, except for parts of the Pacific
Northwest eastward extending to the northern Upper Mississippi Valley, where
above normal precipitation is indicated, consistent with the ERF consolidation
forecast tool. Below normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased chances of above
normal precipitation over northern Mainland Alaska, while below normal
precipitation is favored over southern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle
as well as the Aleutians due to the predicted positive 500-hPa height
anomalies.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 09 - 15 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is generally forecast to
persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, while ensemble spread
and uncertainty increases. Ridging over the North Pacific and the northeastern
CONUS deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. Today's manual 500-hPa height
blend weights the ECMWF ensemble mean greater than the NCEP GEFS and Canadian
ensemble means, due to recent model skill.

The temperature pattern forecast over the CONUS for the week 2 period is
similar to the 6-10 day outlook period. Below normal temperatures are likely
over the West Coast under a predicted trough and negative 500-hPa height
anomalies. Below normal temperatures are most favored over south-central
CONUS,
as a trough and storm systems are predicted to traverse the region.
Probabilities of near to above normal temperatures are enhanced for the
remainder of the CONUS due to near to positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Near
to above normal temperatures are favored over Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians,
and the Alaska Panhandle due to above normal 500-hPa heights.

Near to below normal precipitation is likely over most of the northern CONUS,
except for western Washington and Oregon, where above normal precipitation is
indicated, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool. Chances of
above normal precipitation are enhanced over much of the south-central and
southeastern CONUS, related to potential storm systems associated with
shortwave troughs and anomalous southerly surface flow. Below normal
precipitation is favored for southern Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians and the
Alaska Panhandle, due to positive 500-hPa height anomalies.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Record-breaking heat found across the western United States
through Thursday...

...Flash flooding across portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley
through Wednesday morning...

The western United States high temperatures are forecast to soar
well above average from the Desert Southwest to the Pacific
Northwest as upper-level ridging develops over the west through
Thursday.  Highs are expected to reach into the triple digits
across the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys of California and
portions of southwest Oregon and the Desert Southwest. High
temperatures into the 90s should spread as far north as central
Washington and potentially north-central Montana on Wednesday.
Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories are issued for areas
where heat-related illness is possible if simple precautions are
not taken over parts of California and Nevada.

Farther east, a weak area of low pressure over northeast Texas is
forecast to move east-northeast, entering the Ohio Valley by
Thursday morning slowly. Showers and thunderstorms will develop
along and ahead of an associated cold front as in influx of
moisture streams northward from the Gulf of Mexico. Flash flooding
will remain a concern on Tuesday across the Lower Mississippi
Valley through Wednesday morning. WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
Excessive rainfall that stretches from southern Missouri to
Louisiana. Urban areas, roads, and small streams are most
vulnerable to flash flooding.  By Wednesday, showers and
thunderstorms are forecast to shift into the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys while also lingering throughout central and southern
Texas. By Thursday morning, the showers and thunderstorms will
move into parts of the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast.

...Record Heat possible from parts of the Northern Plains into the
Northeast....

...Multiple Day Heavy Rainfall Event Likely For Parts of Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

A large scale trough entering the Northwest U.S. at the start of
the period (Saturday) should finally suppress the strong Western
U.S. ridge that will be anchored over the region during the now
short range period. Settling and amplification of this trough
across the West into early next week will result in rising heights
for the East and a shift of much above normal
temperatures/possible record heat across much of the northern
tier. Meanwhile, in between, lagging/residual troughing in place
over the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley will promote
unsettled weather and potentially heavy rainfall over an already
overly saturated region through the weekend.

Overall, the guidance shows reasonable agreement to warrant a
general model blend for days 3 and 4. After this, more significant
and typical differences in the details of individual systems
begins to increase. While all of the guidance suggests
amplification of the Western U.S. troughing through the period
(and resulting build of the East ridge), there are some timing and
intensity differences regarding individual systems dropping into
the mean trough which translates to greater structure
uncertainties late period. As such, a quick increase towards the
ensemble means for days 6-7 was imperative to help mitigate the
differences. Farther east, the models show fairly good agreement
with the presence of the Southern Plains low/trough, but placement
and timing (the ECMWF is a bit west/south, and the CMC farther
east) remain in question. These smaller scale details seem to be
driving some fairly large QPF differences across parts of Texas
into the Lower Mississippi Valley regarding placement and
intensity of the heaviest rainfall axis, details of which are
difficult to resolve this far out. Thus, prefer a blend towards
the ensemble means at this point which represent a good middle
ground solution.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A multi-day heavy rainfall event is looking more likely across
portions of Texas, Louisiana, and into the ArkLaTex region with
the persistent source of deeper Gulf moisture interacting with a
Southern Plains upper level trough and frontal boundary reflected
at the surface. Models continue to suggest the potential for
several inches of rain, or more, within a region which has seen
well above normal precipitation over recent weeks. Elsewhere, much
of the East should remain dry although showers may linger over
parts of the Southeast. Out West, a gradual increase in moisture
over the Pacific Northwest is expected, with some activity
reaching into the northern Rockies and eventually the northern
Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley.

For temperatures across the CONUS, much above normal temperatures
will shift from the Great Basin/northern Plains this weekend, into
the Upper Great Lakes and Northeast early next week. Daytime highs
15 to 20 degrees, locally higher, above the average may approach
or exceed both daytime high and warm overnight low records for a
number of locations across the northern tier. Farther south, below
normal highs are likely the first half of the period, at least,
across much of Texas and Louisiana due to continued unsettled
weather and clouds. The West Coast should trend cooler through the
period as amplified troughing becomes established over the region.

...Record Heat possible from parts of the Northern Plains into the
Northeast....

...Multiple Day Heavy Rainfall Event Likely For Parts of Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

A large scale trough entering the Northwest U.S. at the start of
the period (Saturday) should finally suppress the strong Western
U.S. ridge that will be anchored over the region during the now
short range period. Settling and amplification of this trough
across the West into early next week will result in rising heights
for the East and a shift of much above normal
temperatures/possible record heat across much of the northern
tier. Meanwhile, in between, lagging/residual troughing in place
over the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley will promote
unsettled weather and potentially heavy rainfall over an already
overly saturated region through the weekend.

Overall, the guidance shows reasonable agreement to warrant a
general model blend for days 3 and 4. After this, more significant
and typical differences in the details of individual systems
begins to increase. While all of the guidance suggests
amplification of the Western U.S. troughing through the period
(and resulting build of the East ridge), there are some timing and
intensity differences regarding individual systems dropping into
the mean trough which translates to greater structure
uncertainties late period. As such, a quick increase towards the
ensemble means for days 6-7 was imperative to help mitigate the
differences. Farther east, the models show fairly good agreement
with the presence of the Southern Plains low/trough, but placement
and timing (the ECMWF is a bit west/south, and the CMC farther
east) remain in question. These smaller scale details seem to be
driving some fairly large QPF differences across parts of Texas
into the Lower Mississippi Valley regarding placement and
intensity of the heaviest rainfall axis, details of which are
difficult to resolve this far out. Thus, prefer a blend towards
the ensemble means at this point which represent a good middle
ground solution.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A multi-day heavy rainfall event is looking more likely across
portions of Texas, Louisiana, and into the ArkLaTex region with
the persistent source of deeper Gulf moisture interacting with a
Southern Plains upper level trough and frontal boundary reflected
at the surface. Models continue to suggest the potential for
several inches of rain, or more, within a region which has seen
well above normal precipitation over recent weeks. Elsewhere, much
of the East should remain dry although showers may linger over
parts of the Southeast. Out West, a gradual increase in moisture
over the Pacific Northwest is expected, with some activity
reaching into the northern Rockies and eventually the northern
Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley.

For temperatures across the CONUS, much above normal temperatures
will shift from the Great Basin/northern Plains this weekend, into
the Upper Great Lakes and Northeast early next week. Daytime highs
15 to 20 degrees, locally higher, above the average may approach
or exceed both daytime high and warm overnight low records for a
number of locations across the northern tier. Farther south, below
normal highs are likely the first half of the period, at least,
across much of Texas and Louisiana due to continued unsettled
weather and clouds. The West Coast should trend cooler through the
period as amplified troughing becomes established over the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0205 AM CDT Wed Jun 02 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad upper troughing will prevail across the central and eastern
CONUS as a mid-level ridge continues to slowly propagate eastward
from the West Coast towards the Inter-mountain West today. Beneath
the mid-level ridge, hot surface temperatures will contribute to
some wildfire concerns across central California. Also, an impinging
mid-level trough towards the end of the period will promote enough
lift for isolated thunderstorms across portions of southern Oregon
into northern California late in the day. Brief, locally dry and
breezy conditions may also be expected across terrain-favoring areas
of the Lower Colorado River Basin. Otherwise, weak surface winds,
moist low-level conditions, or appreciable rainfall accumulations
will dampen significant wildfire-spread concerns east of the
Rockies.

...Central California into southern Oregon...
As temperatures peak near 100 F across portions of California
tomorrow, heat low development is likely in the inner valley areas.
Dry downslope flow is expected along the immediate lee of the Coast
Ranges bordering the lower Sacramento Valley, Bay Area, and San
Joaquin Valley, which may promote low-end Elevated conditions by
afternoon peak heating. Unseasonably dry fuels are the primary
motivator for maintaining Elevated highlights. In addition,
plume-dominated wildfire potential will exist across the higher
terrain areas of the Coast Ranges and windward side of the Sierra
given near-record temperatures coupled with upslope flow and
receptive fuels.

...Northern California into southern Oregon...
By late afternoon/early evening, at least isolated thunderstorm
development is possible along the California/Oregon border. These
storms are expected to be relatively slow moving, with the latest
guidance consensus showing 0.8-1.0 inch precipitable water values,
with some of the storms likely being wet in nature. Nonetheless,
fuels across far south-central Oregon into far northeast California
are quite receptive to fire spread, with lightning induced ignitions
possible where dry strikes may overlap the most receptive fuels. An
isolated dry thunderstorm area was delineated where the best overlap
of dry strikes/receptive fuels is expected.

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will continue to meander eastward across the
eastern CONUS as an upper ridge expands across the central CONUS,
and another mid-level trough impinges on the Pacific Northwest
tomorrow. Very warm surface temperatures are expected across
portions of central California, with wildfire-spread potential
expected to be slightly more localized compared to previous days.
Very localized wildfire spread is also possible to the lee of the
Cascades and Sierra in advance of the approaching trough, given
thunderstorm potential. Otherwise, brief bouts of dry, breezy flow
may occur across terrain-favoring areas of the Lower Colorado River
Basin, with minimal concerns for major wildfire spread east of the
Rockies given accumulating rains, weak surface winds, or moist
low-level conditions.

...Portions of the Pacific Northwest into northwest Nevada...
With the approach of the upper trough, deep-layer ascent and
buoyancy will become adequate enough to support isolated to
scattered thunderstorm development across eastern portions of the
Pacific Northwest into the northwestern Great Basin tomorrow
afternoon and evening. While the storms are expected to be
relatively high-based, precipitable water values above 0.75 inches
and slow storm speeds will result in wetting rains. Fuels across the
Pacific Northwest into northern parts of the Great Basin are drier
than average, but do not appear critically receptive to fire spread.
While a couple fire starts are possible where a dry strike may occur
within a locally drier fuel bed, the lack of more widespread
receptive fuels precludes an isolated dry thunderstorm area at this
time.

...Portions of Central California...
As the upper trough slowly shifts eastward towards the Interior
West, the more extreme (100+ F) surface temperatures are expected to
be confined mainly to portions of the lower San Joaquin Valley late
tomorrow afternoon. As such, downslope flow along the lee of the
Coast Ranges is also expected to remain a bit more localized
compared to previous days, with Elevated highlights being withheld
this outlook.

...Record-breaking heat found across the western United States to
spread into the Northern Plains by Thursday...

...Scattered showers and thunderstorms forecast throughout the
Southern Plains and eastern third of the country over the next
couple of days; severe weather possible in the Mid-Atlantic on
Thursday...

Persistent upper-level ridging over the western U.S. will bring at
least an additional two days of potentially record-breaking heat
from the Southwest to the northern Great Basin. High temperatures
are forecast to reach the upper-90s and triple digits across a
wide spanning region from the Desert Southwest to the northern
High Plains. The largest temperature anomalies compared to average
will be situated over interior sections of Oregon and Washington,
where high temperatures are forecast to soar to near 30 degrees
above the normal high for this time of year. Excessive Heat
Warnings and Heat Advisories stretch from southern California to
northern Washington and Idaho. Extreme heat in these locations
will significantly increase the potential for heat related
illnesses. Additionally, much of the Southwest and West is
experiencing severe to exceptional drought conditions, which will
undoubtedly be exacerbated by the current heat wave. By Thursday
evening a weak cold front is expected to reach the Pacific
Northwest and offer some relief from the early-season heat, along
with a few isolated showers and thunderstorms. As the
aforementioned upper-level ridge slowly slides eastward, well
above average temperatures will spread into the Northern Plains to
end the workweek.

For the Southern Plains and areas east of the Mississippi River,
scattered showers and thunderstorms may interrupt outdoor
activities both today and Thursday. A weak area of low pressure
currently located over the Lower Mississippi Valley is forecast to
swing northeast and into the Lower Great Lakes by Thursday. At the
same time, an associated warm front to its east will lift
northward and usher in a warm and humid airmass to nearly the
entire East Coast. Thunderstorms will also form along a slow
moving cold front trailing the system from the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys to southern Texas. Much of the scattered showers and
thunderstorms will result in a marginal flash flood and severe
weather risk. The only exception will be found throughout the
Mid-Atlantic on Thursday, where a few storms ahead of the
previously mentioned cold front may produce damaging wind gusts
and isolated tornadoes. SPC has highlighted a region between
south-central Virginia and southeast Pennsylvania, including
Washington D.C. and much of central/southern Maryland, as having
the greatest risk of severe weather.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0933 AM CST Tue Feb 16 2021

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Morning surface observations through
the lower CO river valley show winds increasing amid surface
pressure falls over the Four Corners. Cold air advection just above
the surface along with diurnal heating will allow for steep
low-level lapse rates favorable for supporting wind gusts up to
30-40 mph this afternoon. Relative humidity values near 15-20%
remain likely, but recent fuel analyses continue to show unready
fuels over the region.

..Moore.. 02/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CST Tue Feb 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
With continued, but weakening, high pressure across areas east of
the Divide, cold temperatures and precipitation are expected to keep
fire weather concerns very low today. Broad upper-level troughing
will continue over most of the U.S. with shortwave trough moving
through this parent trough and into the southern Plains. This
shortwave will keep strong mid-level flow across the Colorado River
Valley. RH in southern Nevada into southwestern Arizona could fall
as low as 15-20%. Localized elevated conditions are possible as
surface winds increase to 15-25 mph in conjunction with a deepening
surface trough in the High Plains to the east. However, sparse,
marginal fuels preclude highlights.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1234 PM CST Tue Feb 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Guidance continues to show the
highest probabilities for any elevated, and perhaps localized
critical, wind/RH combinations over the lower CO river valley and
into southern AZ. Winds between 15-25 mph with 15-20% relative
humidity remain likely and may extend as far east as the southern
AZ/NM border. However, these conditions will remain over a region
with sparse and largely unreceptive fuels, especially towards the
AZ/NM border where scattered rain/snow is ongoing.

..Moore.. 02/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1259 AM CST Tue Feb 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
Similar surface and upper-level patterns to Tuesday are again
expected on Wednesday. Cold temperatures and precipitation will
greatly limit fire weather concerns across the U.S. As with Tuesday,
dry and windy conditions are again possible in portions of the lower
Colorado River Valley into southern Arizona. With sparse and
marginal fuels, no highlights will be added.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 16 2021

SYNOPSIS: A region of mid-level low pressure is forecast over Alaska at the
start of the period. This low appears likely to descend toward the Northern
Rockies by the middle of the period. Outside of this feature, the high-
latitude
circulation generally favors a mild pattern for much of North America with the
coldest air confined to the high latitudes. A surface low pressure system
appears likely to form over the Plains early in the period and track toward
the
Great Lakes, with another system possibly doing the same toward the end of
Week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of interior
mainland Alaska, Wed, Feb 24.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for much of mainland Alaska,
Wed-Fri, Feb 24-26.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Northern California, Fri-Sun,
Feb
26-28.

Slight risk of high winds shifting northeastward with time from the Four
Corners through the Midwest, Wed-Fri, Feb 24-26.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 19 - TUESDAY FEBRUARY 23:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!p3FQCTNHS69MiuwEwdV3kiZ7w4F7yCX2i-A_OPbH-kNDWfsRnAgARptsJzANu21WVGYsrKZk$

FOR WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 24 - TUESDAY MARCH 02: Week-2 across the CONUS looks to
be entrenched within the shift to a milder pattern at its outset, with Weather
Prediction Center daily minimum and maximum temperature anomalies on Day-7
being positive from coast to coast. This corresponds to a building subtropical
ridge across the Southeast and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) trending positive,
helping to keep Arctic air confined to the polar latitudes. By late in Week-2
the GEFS supports a return to an AO- state, although the recent Week-2
outlooks
have been strongly biased too negative, as latest observations have been more
than 1 standard deviation above the ensemble mean perspective 14 days out.
Should colder air manifest over the CONUS during Week-2, it is likely sourced
from anomalous 500-hPa troughing initially forecast over Alaska that descends
to the northwestern CONUS by the middle of the period.



The troughing forecast over Alaska is anticipated to yield a moderate risk of
much below-normal temperatures on the 24th for a region encompassing the
Brooks
Range and portions of the Yukon Valley to its immediate south. Here reforecast
guidance continues to show a better than 40% (50%) chance of daily minimum
temperatures falling below -40 degrees in the GEFS (ECMWF). These
probabilities
drop roughly 20% the following day with continued moderation through the
middle
of Week-2, resulting in a broader portion of mainland Alaska forecast to have
a
slight risk of much below-normal temperatures on the 24th through 26th. The
area highlighted for a moderate risk is one of the colder regions in Alaska,
such that temperatures of at least -40 degrees seem unlikely to set daily
record lows. With cold air across mainland Alaska early in the period and
models hinting at some component of northerly flow, localized gap wind
potential exists for climatologically favored regions adjacent to the Gulf of
Alaska. Given the scale of this potential coupled with uncertainty on the
exact
flow orientation, no associated areas are highlighted for high winds on the
forecast map. Models continue to spin up surface cyclones over the Bering Sea
and Gulf of Alaska during Week-2, but none of these appear likely to meet
hazards criteria for high winds (exceeding 50 knots) or heavy precipitation
(1.5+ inches of rain or 15+ inches of snow in 24 hours).



Models show the troughing and some cold air potential settling southeastward
from Alaska by the middle of the period. Reforecast guidance supports an
associated slight risk of much below-normal temperatures sliding eastward with
time from the Pacific Northwest and Northern California through the Great
Basin
and Northern Rockies on the 26th through 28th. Model discrepancies on how
rapid
this evolution occurs persist from yesterday, with the GEFS continuing to cool
this area more rapidly and more broadly than the ECMWF does.  Within the
highlighted area the greatest temperature departures are likely over the
Northern Rockies, as some of the low-level flow will be off the Pacific and
help to moderate the temperature departures for points further west. Normally
onshore flow would support concerns for heavy precipitation, but the general
orientation out of the northwest limits subtropical moisture availability and
likely ushers in a persistent "showery" period that is somewhat typical for
the
Pacific Northwest rather than any discrete atmospheric river potential.



In advance of the cooler pattern out West, today's GFS and ECMWF deterministic
runs have been forecasting lee cyclogenesis over the Central or Southern
Plains
near the start of Week-2. This system is forecast to track northeastward with
time toward the Midwest, and an associated slight risk of high winds
accompanies its forecast track on the 24th through 26th. The GFS runs
primarily
support strong winds confined to the backside of the system, while the ECMWF
deepens the low more rapidly which could yield high winds in the warm sector
from the low-level jet. The ECMWF forecast would also have some potential for
heavy snow on the backside of the surface low, although the lack of this
feature in the ensemble mean and differences with the GFS preclude any snow
hazard being introduced. Late in the period there are some signs of an active
storm track continuing through the Midwest that could bring heavy rainfall to
the Ohio Valley which may wind up on the forecast map in subsequent days.

...Much below normal temperatures over the Great Plains moderate
as they shift east this weekend...

...Active weather continues across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies through the period...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...
The very anomalous trough and associated cold airmass currently
over the central CONUS will moderate as it shifts east this
weekend. The trough axis currently over the west-central CONUS is
reinforced/amplified through Thursday night before shifting east;
pushing off the East Coast late Friday night. Ridging currently
building off the West Coast flattens and shift onshore Thursday,
re-amplifying over the eastern CONUS through the weekend. The
flattening of the western ridge is due to a potent low lingering
over the Gulf of Alaska Thursday and Friday which directs a trough
that crosses the CONUS Friday night through early next week. This
initial trough passage Friday night resumes an active weather
period for the Pacific Northwest which continues well into or
through next week in persistent onshore flow with repeating
shortwave troughs/impulses.

Global deterministic guidance remains in decent synoptic
agreement, though timing differences are noted with the two main
troughs in the medium range. The 06Z and 12Z GFS made the first
wave ejecting east from the central CONUS on Friday more
progressive than the 00Z (and now 12Z) ECMWF/CMC/UKMET. Therefore
less weight was given to the GFS than recent shifts for the Day
3/4 timeframe. However, the next system crossing the West Coast
Friday night and ejecting east of the Rockies on Sunday is now in
good agreement for strength and timing between the 12Z GFS and
ECMWF which are slower than the more progressive 12Z UKMET and
CMC, so a preferred multi-model blend on Days 3/4 becomes more
focused on the ECMWF/GFS through Days 4/5 before increasing the
contribution to the ECENS/GEFS means through Day 7.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Lingering lake effect and terrain enhanced snow can be expected
Saturday in typical snow belts under the upper trough trailing the
exiting low over the Northeast. The next wave pushing onshore
Friday night brings an active first half of the weekend to much of
the Intermountain West with following onshore flow continuing
rainfall along coastal portions of Washington/Oregon with heavy
mountain snow in the Cascades and Northern Rockies at least
through the middle of next week. Wintry precipitation will cross
the central/northern Plains Saturday night/Sunday as a frontal
system moves through with rain developing as Gulf moisture is
tapped over the mid/lower MS Valley in the Sunday night timeframe.

Temperatures will remain dangerously low Friday morning across the
battered southern Plains and west Gulf coast with min temps 25 to
30 degrees below normal with dozens more daily records expected to
be broken. This airmass shifts east over the weekend, but modifies
with min temperatures Saturday generally 20 to 25 degrees below
normal from the western Gulf Coast (where a few more record lows
can be expected) up through the Midwest. By Sunday morning,
temperatures are expected to be 15 to 20 degrees below normal over
the upper OH Valley, to the central Appalachians with the
anomalous temperatures generally offshore by Monday. Meanwhile,
expect a warming trend from west to east under the ridge with
above normal temperatures for most of the CONUS by Monday with a
warming trend continuing into the week.

...Lingering areas of snow and freezing rain over Lower Great
Lakes and New England this evening...

...Frigid Arctic air and dangerously cold wind chills to persist
in the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley through midweek...

...New winter storm to impact Southern Plains to Northeast through
Thursday; system arrives in Pacific Northwest by Friday...

The winter storm that dumped multiple inches of snow and ice
across the Southern Plains to the Northeast over the last few days
will exit into Nova Scotia and the Canadian Maritime tonight. Snow
and ice impacts will subsequently come to an end. Winter Storm
Warnings and Advisories remain in effect for northeastern Maine.
Frigid arctic air will remain over the central CONUS over the next
couple of days as high pressure slowly begins to meander eastward.
High temperatures are likely to between 25-40 degrees below
average for much of the Central/Southern Plains as well as
Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley on Wednesday and Thursday. Hi/Lo
records maybe broken across many parts of the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley over the next couple of days, as a
result. These relentless cold conditions over the aforementioned
areas will pave the way for yet another round of wintry weather
beginning this evening.

An area of low pressure will develop over southern Texas this
evening. This low pressure will go onto produce heavy snow and ice
from the Southern Plains, through the Mississippi Valley tomorrow
and into the Northeast by Thursday. An area of 3-6 inches of snow
are possible for much of Oklahoma and Arkansas through tomorrow.
Between 0.1 to 0.25 inches of freezing rain may fall over eastern
Texas through northern Louisiana/southern Arkansas/western
Mississippi. Winter Storm Warnings, Advisories, Watches, and Hard
Freeze Warnings are currently in effect for parts of the Southern
Plains, and Lower Mississippi Valley. Rain along with scattered to
isolated thunderstorms will develop within the warm sector of this
system and impact an area stretching from the Gulf coast to the
Southeast and eventually the Northeast coast over the next couple
of days. Rainfall totals will generally remain below an inch while
some parts of the Deep South may see more than that. This winter
storm will move into the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
by Wednesday evening and Thursday. Parts of the Central
Appalachians may receive between 3-6 inches of snow during this
period. Parts of central/southern Virginia and North Carolina will
be the focus for significant freezing rain accumulations, where
between a tenth and a quarter of an inch of ice may fall on
Thursday. Meanwhile, a new system is forecast to arrive over the
Pacific Northwest region on Thursday, bringing with it the chance
for another round of mountain snow and lower elevation rain.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Tue February 16 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 22 - 26 2021

Today's model solutions depict a transitional 500-hPa pattern across much of
North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period. The AO index
has been negative for most of this winter, consistent with the cold
temperatures we've seen across the Northern Tier for weeks. Very recently,
however, the AO index has risen dramatically to become near zero, and is
forecast to become slightly positive over the next couple of weeks. This
change
would result in a significant transition of the large-scale pattern and
temperature forecast. Because the large-scale pattern is forecast to
transition
during the 6-10 day period, subtle differences in the timing of this
transition, and amplitude of developing features, may have a large impact on
the temperature and precipitation pattern forecast across the domain,
increasing uncertainty during the 6-10 day period. Today's latest GFS,
Canadian, and European ensemble means predict negative height anomalies over
parts of the northern CONUS, though each model differs in the placement and
amplitude of troughing associated with these negative height anomalies. Though
today's Canadian and European ensemble means favor the trough farther east
over
the CONUS, when compared to the GFS ensemble mean, a teleconnection based off
the large positive height anomaly center south of the Aleutians supports
keeping the trough further west, which is better aligned with today's GFS
ensemble mean. Analogs based off of today's Autoblend 500-hPa height forecast
also favors less troughing, and more warming, in the eastern CONUS. For these
reasons, today's manual 500-hPa blend favors the GFS ensemble mean solution,
which depicts large negative height anomalies across most of Mainland Alaska
and over much of the northern half of the CONUS, with positive height
anomalies
elsewhere.

Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are enhanced across much of Alaska
as  a lobe of the Polar Vortex and associated below normal heights are
forecast
to extend across most of the state. As troughing and below normal heights
retreat northward to higher latitudes, a dramatic warmup from current levels
is
likely across much of the north-central CONUS, eastward to the Northeast, as
the flow pattern becomes more zonal. Farther to the south, near normal
temperatures are favored for parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley, eastward
to the Mid-Atlantic Region, associated with negative temperature anomalies
predicted behind a passing cold front during the first half of the period.
Note
that a portion of this area was favored below normal in yesterday's 6-10 day
outlook, but more of the warming expected during the forecast pattern
transition falls within today's 6-10 day period than yesterday's. As surface
high pressure builds into the Great Basin, cold air inversions are possible,
leading to slightly elevated chances of below normal temperatures across parts
of the region. Below normal temperatures are also favored across the Pacific
Northwest as a few shortwave troughs are forecast to affect this region.

An increased pressure gradient is expected to promote enhanced Pacific flow
across the northwestern CONUS, leading to elevated chances of above normal
precipitation across much of the Northern Tier. Farther to the south, surface
high pressure and rising 500-hPa heights favor drier than normal conditions
across much of the Southern Tier, especially from parts of California eastward
to the Four Corners Region, directly downstream of ridging over the Eastern
Pacific. Strong ridging across the Aleutians is forecast to push the storm
track further north than is typical, which results in a few storm systems
bringing precipitation to regions of Alaska that typically receive lower
precipitation amounts. This favors near normal precipitation along the
southern
coast of Mainland Alaska, and above normal precipitation further to the north.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 60% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
a predicted transitional pattern across much of the forecast domain and some
significant differences in temperature and precipitation tools over the
eastern
CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 24 - MAR 02, 2021

During the week-2 period, a significant 500-hPa pattern shift is forecast to
take shape across the forecast domain. Anomalous ridging is predicted to shift
eastward over the Eastern Pacific, pushing above normal heights right up to
the
west coasts of Canada and the U.S. Downstream troughing is forecast to deepen
in western parts of the CONUS, while ridging is expected to strengthen over
parts of the Southern Plains, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic Region. This pattern
is supported by a teleconnection based off the Eastern Pacific positive height
anomaly center, as well as analogs based off today's Autoblend 500-hPa height
forecast. This, combined with better agreement among today's dynamical models,
results in higher confidence during the week-2, which is atypical.

Forecast height rises lead to increased chances of above normal temperatures
across the Aleutians, Alaska Peninsula, and coastal southwestern Mainland
Alaska. Downstream troughing favors below normal temperatures for the
remainder
of Alaska, extending southward across the western CONUS. Above normal
temperatures are likely for the eastern half of the CONUS as forecast ridging
builds and periods of southerly low-level flow moderate temperatures.

Several predicted storm systems progressing over the top of the Eastern
Pacific
ridge increase the likelihood of above normal precipitation for the Aleutians,
Alaska Peninsula, and Mainland Alaska. Shortwaves forecast to drop southward
from Canada and progress eastward around the western trough favor above normal
precipitation from the Northern Rockies eastward into the Great Lakes Region.
With anomalous ridging predicted just off the West Coast, near to below normal
precipitation is favored along the coast, with below normal precipitation
favored across much of the southern tier associated with a predicted quiet
southerly storm track. Probabilities of below normal precipitation are largest
across the Southeast coast, which is centered beneath the forecast
strengthening ridge.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 60% of Today's
operational 0z GFS centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

...Much below normal temperatures over the Great Plains moderate
as they shift east this weekend...

...Active weather continues across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies through the period...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium range period begins with troughing exiting the East
Coast, finally bringing an end to the record cold airmass that has
plagued the Central U.S. for several days. The next shortwave
though, should enter the Northwest this weekend, eventually
amplifying across the Central U.S. and into the East early next
week. This initial trough will resume an active weather period for
the Pacific Northwest which looks to continue into next week with
persistent onshore flow and repeating shortwave troughs/impulses.

Synoptically, deterministic guidance remains in decent agreement
through much of the period. Some timing/detail differences still
need to be resolved with the main trough crossing the CONUS
Sunday-Tuesday, which also sends a surface low from the Central
Plains into the Great Lakes and the Northeast. The CMC remains on
the faster side of the guidance so it was not included in
tonight's blend. There's also question late period on how much the
northern stream energy amplifies off the Northeast, with the
latest run of the ECMWF the most bullish on this (also reflected
in the QPF over northern New England). Details with strength and
timing of various shortwaves/energy crossing the Pacific Northwest
also gets fuzzy late period, so the day 6-7 blend leaned more
heavily on the ensemble means while early period a general blend
of the GFS/ECMWF/UKMET worked well.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest into the Rockies will be the most active as
a couple of fronts and almost continuous onshore flow contributes
to daily bouts of coastal rain and heavy mountain snow. The cold
front/surface low crossing from the central Plains to the
Northeast should have some wintry precipitation associated with it
on the northern side of the precipitation shield, with light to
moderate rain likely farther south. Some lake effect snow can be
expected on the backside of this system as it exits the Northeast
next Tuesday within persistent north/westerly cold flow.

Below normal (10-20F) temperatures will persist into Saturday for
portions of the southern Plains to Mid-Atlantic but should quickly
moderate back to normal by early next week. A warming trend is
expected across the West into the Northern Plains the first half
of the period, especially for the Southwest where daytime highs

Temperatures in the central and northern Plains are also expected
to trend warmer through much of the period.

...Much below normal temperatures over the Great Plains moderate
as they shift east this weekend...

...Active weather continues across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies through the period...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium range period begins with troughing exiting the East
Coast, finally bringing an end to the record cold airmass that has
plagued the Central U.S. for several days. The next shortwave
though, should enter the Northwest this weekend, eventually
amplifying across the Central U.S. and into the East early next
week. This initial trough will resume an active weather period for
the Pacific Northwest which looks to continue into next week with
persistent onshore flow and repeating shortwave troughs/impulses.

Synoptically, deterministic guidance remains in decent agreement
through much of the period. Some timing/detail differences still
need to be resolved with the main trough crossing the CONUS
Sunday-Tuesday, which also sends a surface low from the Central
Plains into the Great Lakes and the Northeast. The CMC remains on
the faster side of the guidance so it was not included in
tonight's blend. There's also question late period on how much the
northern stream energy amplifies off the Northeast, with the
latest run of the ECMWF the most bullish on this (also reflected
in the QPF over northern New England). Details with strength and
timing of various shortwaves/energy crossing the Pacific Northwest
also gets fuzzy late period, so the day 6-7 blend leaned more
heavily on the ensemble means while early period a general blend
of the GFS/ECMWF/UKMET worked well.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest into the Rockies will be the most active as
a couple of fronts and almost continuous onshore flow contributes
to daily bouts of coastal rain and heavy mountain snow. The cold
front/surface low crossing from the central Plains to the
Northeast should have some wintry precipitation associated with it
on the northern side of the precipitation shield, with light to
moderate rain likely farther south. Some lake effect snow can be
expected on the backside of this system as it exits the Northeast
next Tuesday within persistent north/westerly cold flow.

Below normal (10-20F) temperatures will persist into Saturday for
portions of the southern Plains to Mid-Atlantic but should quickly
moderate back to normal by early next week. A warming trend is
expected across the West into the Northern Plains the first half
of the period, especially for the Southwest where daytime highs
average 10 degrees above normal through the middle of next week.
Temperatures in the central and northern Plains are also expected
to trend warmer through much of the period.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The broad trough across the Continental Divide will slowly shift
eastward today. A strengthening mid-level jet is expected to impact
portions of the Desert Southwest. At the surface, a pressure trough
will deepen within southern Arizona and New Mexico ahead of an
advancing cold airmass in the Plains. Typical dry conditions in the
lower Colorado River Valley and vicinity are probable during the
afternoon with RH falling to around 15% in some locations. The
strong jet aloft and surface pressure gradient will increase surface
winds to 15-25 mph. Sparse and marginally dry fuels preclude
highlights. High pressure in the Great Basin will drive offshore
flow in southern California, though fuel conditions will limit any
concern. Elsewhere across the CONUS, fire weather concerns will be
minimal.

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
High pressure from the northern Rockies into the Plains will be the
primary surface feature for Thursday's forecast. A prolonged period
of cold temperatures and precipitation will keep fire weather
concerns quite low across most of the country. For early Thursday
morning, the offshore pressure gradient in southern California will
be maximized. While winds will be moderate with humidities reduced
to around 20% in spots, marginally receptive fuels will limit a more
robust risk for fire ignitions and spread.

...Over 100 million Americans are under Winter Storm Warnings,
Winter Storm Watches, or Winter Weather Advisories as another
round of impactful winter weather tracks from the Southern Plains
to the East Coast...

...Developing winter storm to produce heavy snow and treacherous
ice accumulations from the South Central U.S. to Mid-Atlantic...

...Arctic air-mass to begin loosening its grip over the Heartland,
but more bitterly cold temperatures expected to continue...

...Showers and thunderstorms to track across the Southeast;
Pacific storm system ushers in valley/coastal rain and heavy
mountain snow the to Northwest...

A potent upper level trough tracking into the Southern Plains is
responsible for areas of snow and freezing rain enveloping much of
the South Central U.S. this morning. As the trough advances east,
so will the shield of snowfall as it extends from Arkansas and the
Mid-South to the central Appalachians with accumulations of 3 to 6
inches likely. Heavier amounts over 8 inches are possible in parts
of south-central Arkansas. Just south of the snow zone,
significant ice accumulations is expected from east Texas and the
Lower Mississippi Valley to the Virginia and North Carolina
Piedmont by Wednesday night. Ice accumulations of a quarter to a
half inch are forecast in parts of east Texas, northern Louisiana,
southern Arkansas, and western Mississippi with crippling totals
over a half inch also possible. The same range of ice
accumulations are anticipated in the North Carolina and Virginia
Piedmont Wednesday night into Thursday with even some localized
amounts as high as three-quarters of an inch. In the areas that
contend with these devastating ice accumulations, residents can
expect dangerous travel conditions, numerous power outages, and
extensive tree damage. Meanwhile, periods of moderate-to-heavy
snow will breakout across the northern Mid-Atlantic Thursday with
some locations switching over to sleet and/or freezing rain. Heavy
snow may work its way as far north as southern New England
Thursday afternoon and persist into Thursday night. While snowfall
totals are subject to how much sleet and freezing rain mixes in,
the sheer amount of wintry precipitation will cause treacherous
travel conditions and many travel delays. The heaviest snow totals
are likely to occur in the Appalachians of Virginia and West
Virginia where as much as a foot is possible.

The dangerous Arctic blast over the Nation's Heartland begins to
moderate in the coming days. While that means the number of record
cold maximum and minimum temperatures will not be as common (the
bulk of which occurring in the South Central U.S.), temperatures
themselves will still remain 20 to 35 degrees below normal
throughout the Plains, Mississippi Valley, and lower Great Lakes.
Morning lows in the single digits or below zero look to continue
both today and Thursday in parts of the Great Plains. Bitterly
cold temperatures have pushed east into the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast ahead of the impending winter storm that arrives
Thursday morning. High temperatures will struggle to eclipse the
freezing mark both today and Thursday in these regions. The
warmest location in the country is the state of Florida where
highs look to soar into the 80s on Thursday.

Elsewhere, within the warm sector of the impending winter storm
will be widespread showers and thunderstorms tracking across the
Southeast. Heavy rainfall is possible and some thunderstorms could
be severe, which has led to the issuance of a Slight Risk area
along the central Gulf Coast today and from the Florida Panhandle
to southern Georgia on Thursday. Out West, areas of mountain snow
across the Intermountain West will dissipate as high pressure over
the West Coast moves in Wednesday night. After a day of tranquil
weather on Wednesday, a Pacific storm system ushers in another
round of valley/coastal rain and mountain snow on Thursday.
Locally heavy rainfall is possible in far northwestern California
and far southwestern Oregon on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Cascades
are likely to receive another foot of snow from this system with
heavy snow working its way into the northern Rockies Thursday
night and continuing into Friday morning.

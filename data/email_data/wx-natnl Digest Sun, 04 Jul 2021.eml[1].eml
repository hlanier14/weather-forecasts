Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1155 AM CDT Sat Jul 03 2021

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

Trimmed the western extent of the IsoDryT area across northern
California and central Oregon based on forecast soundings and
morning CAM guidance. Otherwise, no changes were made.

..Bentley.. 07/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Sat Jul 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level anticyclone across the western half to two-thirds
of the United States will continue to establish itself, despite a
modest short-wave trough across the Northern Plains impinging upon
the mid-level anticyclone. Here the ridge is expected to amplify
somewhat across the Northern Rockies as mid-level flow across
coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest becomes slightly cyclonic.
This is in response to a series of mid-level short-wave troughs
moving through southwest Canada.

At the surface, a weak cold front will move into the northern High
Plains during the afternoon and evening hours as the aforementioned
mid-level trough moves through the region.

... Northern California and Oregon east to southwest Montana ...

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will once again be possible
across much of the interior portions of the western United States on
Saturday, as strong diurnal heating combines with a relatively moist
airmass. Given the relatively moist airmass across the West,
thunderstorms may tend to be more wet than dry, especially farther
south. The most likely area for dry thunderstorms appearing to be
across portions of northern California into southwestern Montana,
with lesser thunderstorm potential across Oregon. Despite several
days of isolated thunderstorms, the combination of slightly lower
precipitable water values and warmer/drier afternoon conditions
should limit the ability of some thunderstorms to produce wetting
rains. Elsewhere, dry, receptive fuels will pose at least some risk
for lightning-induced fire starts, especially with lightning strikes
occurring outside precipitation cores.

... Eastern Montana into western North Dakota ...

Dry, northwest low-level flow is anticipated this afternoon in the
wake of a weak short-wave trough. Winds my approach 20 mph by
afternoon, with minimum relative humidity falling into the low
teens. The result will be elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions.

...Elsa is forecast to impact Florida and the Southeast through
the middle of next week with heavy rainfall and potential for high
winds...

...Repeating heavy rain is likely to persist over southern Texas
through much of next week as low pressure lingers...


...Overview...

In a fairly typical summer pattern, expect a strengthening upper
ridge to prevail over the Great Basin/Desert Southwest while
varying degrees of mean troughing align over the east-central U.S.
A leading shortwave crossing the northeast quadrant of the lower
48 will push along a wavy cold front during most of next week. A
trailing Pacific shortwave rounding the upper ridge should amplify
into the Midwest/western Great Lakes toward the end of the week,
supporting another area of low pressure and associated frontal
system. The primary features of interest at lower latitudes will
be Tropical Storm Elsa which should impact Florida and parts of
the Southeast through the middle of next week, and a slow-moving
upper trough/low that could produce heavy rainfall as it slowly
drifts over Texas and into northern Mexico.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Overall a 00Z/06Z model blend transitioning to a model/ensemble
mean blend provided a good starting point to reflect the most
common themes of guidance while downplaying details that have
lower confidence/predictability. For Elsa, the 06Z GFS provided
the best template relative to latest National Hurricane Center
advisories valid Tuesday-Thursday. ECMWF/UKMET runs are somewhat
slower while the CMC is holding onto its recent typical fast bias.
Over the past day or so the ECMWF has trended considerably toward
the GFS for track while the GFS has trended weaker. Meanwhile
there is good agreement in principle for the shortwave crossing
the northeastern quadrant of the lower 48 and a second shortwave
amplifying into the Midwest after rounding the western upper
ridge. In both cases but especially for the latter, there are
detail differences that have a meaningful effect on the surface
evolution--but low predictability 5-7 days out in time. The blend
approach reflects the most agreeable aspects of synoptic evolution
while awaiting better clustering for specifics.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough drifting southwest over southern Texas into
northern Mexico through next week will support a repeating heavy
rain threat over that region most days, with multi-inch totals
expected and localized five-day totals over a foot likely (though
the heaviest looks to be just south of the Rio Grande). Farther
northwest, late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are
likely to continue through Wednesday over the Central/Southern
Rockies. Any activity thereafter should be much lighter and more
scattered. Around midweek Elsa will bring the potential for heavy
rainfall, flooding, and high winds to parts of Florida and areas
northeastward over the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic. Though
somewhat less dramatic than in previous days, considerable spread
still exists for Elsa's strength/track/timing along with
associated effects. Monitor products from the National Hurricane
Center for the latest information regarding Elsa. The wavy front
pushing east from the Midwest/Great Lakes will produce periods of
rain that could be locally moderate/heavy. After midweek the
tropical moisture from Elsa could increase rain totals in the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast depending on Elsa's track/strength and any
frontal interaction. The system forecast to reach the
Midwest/Great Lakes toward the end of the week may be accompanied
by meaningful rainfall as well.

Expect the heat wave over a significant portion of the West to
continue through next week as the Great Basin/Southwest upper
ridge restrengthens. The Northwest and northern Great Basin should
see highs 10-15F above normal most days with locally higher
readings possible early and late in the period. For a brief time
around Wednesday-Thursday some locations may be a little less
above normal as a Pacific shortwave rounding the upper ridge
brings a weak cold front through. Some daily records for
highs/warm lows will be possible ahead of this weak front, while
such potential could also be worth monitoring as the upper ridge
rebounds late in the week. The southern High Plains/Texas will
likely see highs 5-12F below average for most of the week due to
cloudiness and rain from the persistent upper level disturbance
there.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
249 PM EDT Sat Jul 03 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Jul 06 2021 - 12Z Sat Jul 10 2021

...Elsa is forecast to impact Florida and the Southeast through
the middle of next week with heavy rainfall and potential for high
winds...

...Repeating heavy rain is likely to persist over southern Texas
through much of next week as low pressure lingers...


...Overview...

In a fairly typical summer pattern, expect a strengthening upper
ridge to prevail over the Great Basin/Desert Southwest while
varying degrees of mean troughing align over the east-central U.S.
A leading shortwave crossing the northeast quadrant of the lower
48 will push along a wavy cold front during most of next week. A
trailing Pacific shortwave rounding the upper ridge should amplify
into the Midwest/western Great Lakes toward the end of the week,
supporting another area of low pressure and associated frontal
system. The primary features of interest at lower latitudes will
be Tropical Storm Elsa which should impact Florida and parts of
the Southeast through the middle of next week, and a slow-moving
upper trough/low that could produce heavy rainfall as it slowly
drifts over Texas and into northern Mexico.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Overall a 00Z/06Z model blend transitioning to a model/ensemble
mean blend provided a good starting point to reflect the most
common themes of guidance while downplaying details that have
lower confidence/predictability. For Elsa, the 06Z GFS provided
the best template relative to latest National Hurricane Center
advisories valid Tuesday-Thursday. ECMWF/UKMET runs are somewhat
slower while the CMC is holding onto its recent typical fast bias.
Over the past day or so the ECMWF has trended considerably toward
the GFS for track while the GFS has trended weaker. Meanwhile
there is good agreement in principle for the shortwave crossing
the northeastern quadrant of the lower 48 and a second shortwave
amplifying into the Midwest after rounding the western upper
ridge. In both cases but especially for the latter, there are
detail differences that have a meaningful effect on the surface
evolution--but low predictability 5-7 days out in time. The blend
approach reflects the most agreeable aspects of synoptic evolution
while awaiting better clustering for specifics.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough drifting southwest over southern Texas into
northern Mexico through next week will support a repeating heavy
rain threat over that region most days, with multi-inch totals
expected and localized five-day totals over a foot likely (though
the heaviest looks to be just south of the Rio Grande). Farther
northwest, late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are
likely to continue through Wednesday over the Central/Southern
Rockies. Any activity thereafter should be much lighter and more
scattered. Around midweek Elsa will bring the potential for heavy
rainfall, flooding, and high winds to parts of Florida and areas
northeastward over the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic. Though
somewhat less dramatic than in previous days, considerable spread
still exists for Elsa's strength/track/timing along with
associated effects. Monitor products from the National Hurricane
Center for the latest information regarding Elsa. The wavy front
pushing east from the Midwest/Great Lakes will produce periods of
rain that could be locally moderate/heavy. After midweek the
tropical moisture from Elsa could increase rain totals in the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast depending on Elsa's track/strength and any
frontal interaction. The system forecast to reach the
Midwest/Great Lakes toward the end of the week may be accompanied
by meaningful rainfall as well.

Expect the heat wave over a significant portion of the West to
continue through next week as the Great Basin/Southwest upper
ridge restrengthens. The Northwest and northern Great Basin should
see highs 10-15F above normal most days with locally higher
readings possible early and late in the period. For a brief time
around Wednesday-Thursday some locations may be a little less
above normal as a Pacific shortwave rounding the upper ridge
brings a weak cold front through. Some daily records for
highs/warm lows will be possible ahead of this weak front, while
such potential could also be worth monitoring as the upper ridge
rebounds late in the week. The southern High Plains/Texas will
likely see highs 5-12F below average for most of the week due to
cloudiness and rain from the persistent upper level disturbance
there.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat July 03 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 PM CDT Sat Jul 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

Made some minor adjustments to the isolated DryT line including
expanding it back into the Sierra. Otherwise, no changes.

..Bentley.. 07/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Sat Jul 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level anticyclone across will remain the primary weather
feature across the western half to two-thirds of the United States
on Sunday. Along the western periphery of this ridge, a series of
small short-wave troughs will lift north through the Western Great
Basin, bringing with them an increase in thunderstorm potential.

... Western Great Basin ...

Thunderstorms are expected across the Great Basin on Thursday as
another northward moisture surge coupled with strong diurnal heating
results in mid-level instability atop a very dry sub-cloud layer.
Several small mid-level short-wave troughs, potentially convectively
induced by Saturday's convection, will move northward across the
region. These perturbations will increase the likelihood of
thunderstorm initiation, leading to more storms than in previous
days, but also bring increased mid-level flow and a propensity for
faster storm motion. The net result of the increased number of
storms and faster storm motion than previous days will be a
combination of wet and dry thunderstorms, with lightning-induced
fire starts possible.

...Excessive heat to continue across the Northwest and Northern
Plains...

...Locally heavy rain likely along a frontal boundary draped
across the Gulf Coast with monsoon moisture likely across the
Southwest...

...Slight risk for severe thunderstorms from northeast Colorado
into western Nebraska on Saturday and the southern High Plains on
Sunday...

...Tropical Cyclone Elsa is expected to approach southern Florida
on Monday....

Well-above normal temperatures remain in place from the
northwestern to the north-central U.S.  With temperatures climbing
once again into the upper 90s to low 100s today, Heat Advisories
and Excessive Heat Warnings remain in effect for much of the
interior valleys of Washington, Oregon, and far northern
California, as well as for portions of Idaho, northern Nevada,
northern Utah, and eastern Montana.  While daytime highs are
expected to drop by a few degrees on Sunday, temperatures are
forecast to remain well-above normal across much of the region
through the remainder of the weekend.

Across the Southwest, monsoon moisture is expected to fuel rounds
of showers and thunderstorms, capable of producing heavy rainfall
amounts and localized flash flooding concerns across portions of
Arizona and New Mexico on Saturday and Sunday.

From Texas to southern Georgia and North Florida, a slow-moving
frontal boundary settling into the Southeast and Gulf Coast states
is expected to bring showers and thunderstorms each day through
Monday.  Some of these storms may produce locally heavy rainfall
amounts, resulting in localized flooding concerns.

Showers and thunderstorms are also expected farther to the north
from the central High Plains into the Dakotas today.  Some storms
may become severe -- producing damaging wind gusts and large hail
during the late afternoon and evening.  Additional storms are
expected over the central U.S. on Sunday, with severe storms
capable of damaging winds and large hail possible over the
southern High Plains.  A few storms are also possible from the
central Plains into the upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes.

Across much of the remainder of the Midwest into the Mid-South,
high pressure and dry conditions are expected to continue into
early next week.

Across the Northeast, an upper level low pressure system will
bring periods of rain and unseasonably cool temperature to the
region through the weekend, before temperatures begin to rebound
on Monday.

Lastly, tropical cyclone Elsa is forecast to track across eastern
and central Cuba over the weekend, moving north of the island on
Monday.  There is an increasing risk of tropical storm conditions,
storm surge, and rainfall impacts beginning Monday in the Florida
Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula.  Interests in Florida and
along the southeast U.S. coast should monitor Elsa's progress and
updates to the forecast.

...Elsa is forecast to impact Florida and the Southeast through
midweek with potential for heavy rainfall and high winds...

...Repeating heavy rain is may persist over southern Texas into
Friday as low pressure drifts over the region...


...Overview...

The western CONUS ridge/eastern trough persists through the work
week and becomes more amplified next weekend as the upper ridge
over the Great Basin/Desert Southwest strengthens. A leading
shortwave trough pushing east from the northern Great Lakes
Wednesday to eastern Canada Friday will push along a wavy cold
front over the northeastern CONUS through this time. A trailing
Pacific shortwave trough rounds the upper ridge, ejecting from the
WA/OR coast Wednesday morning and is expected to amplify into a
Midwest/Great Lakes by Saturday, supporting another area of low
pressure and associated frontal system for the northern half of
the country east of the Rockies. The primary features of interest
at lower latitudes will be Tropical Storm Elsa which should impact
Florida and parts of the Southeast through the middle of the week,
and an upper trough/low drifting southwest from Texas into
northern Mexico that may produce heavy rainfall over southern
Texas (and northern Mexico).

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Overall a deterministic 12Z/18Z global model blend (the 12Z CMC
was unavailable for the forecast) transitioning to a GFS/ECMWF
blend with some of their ensemble means produced a decent first
guess forecast. For Elsa, the 18Z and now 00Z GFS continue a trend
toward a weaker and less wet system crossing northeast over
northern Florida Wednesday and the coastal Southeast through
Thursday. The UKMET continues to be slower, but stronger with a
western track like the GFS while the CMC is the strongest with an
eastern Florida Peninsula track and the ECMWF is the slowest,
though it does have more of a system than in prior days with an
eastern track. Given this uncertainty of timing/strength/track the
heavy rain threat is somewhat diminished from previous days, but
there is still potential for this system to be impactful.
Meanwhile there is good agreement in principle for the shortwave
crossing the northeastern quadrant of the lower 48 and a second
shortwave amplifying into the Midwest next weekend after rounding
the western upper ridge. The 18Z and now the 00Z GFS jump ahead to
a faster timing with the latter wave which is a typical bias of
the FV3 GFS.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough drifting southwest over southern Texas into
northern Mexico through next week will support a repeating rain
threat over that region continuing for Wednesday into Friday, with
a somewhat diminished threat for as much repeating heavy rain as
indicated in recent days. However, ample Gulf moisture will be
available to this slow moving disturbance, so there is a flooding
threat. There is still some potential for heavy rain and high
winds for parts of Florida and the coastal Southeast from Elsa
Wednesday into Thursday. Please continue to monitor products from
the National Hurricane Center for the latest Elsa forecast track
information. The wavy front pushing east from the Midwest/Great
Lakes will produce periods of rain that could be locally
moderate/heavy. On Friday tropical moisture from Elsa may converge
on the frontal pattern over the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast and produce
heavy rainfall. The system forecast to reach the Midwest/Great
Lakes this upcoming weekend looks to interact with Gulf-sourced
moisture and result in meaningful rainfall as well.

The heat wave over a significant portion of the West will continue
at least through next weekend as the Great Basin/Southwest upper
ridge restrengthens. The Northwest and northern Great Basin should
see highs 10-15F above normal each day with locally higher
readings possible. Several daily high temperature records are
under threat across primarily the Great Basin each day. The
southern High Plains/Texas will likely see highs 5-12F below
average for most of the week due to cloudiness and rain from the
persistent upper level disturbance drifting over that region with
slightly below normal temperatures over the Midwest when rainfall
is forecast.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0142 AM CDT Sun Jul 04 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level anticyclone will remain the primary fire weather feature
across the western United States on Sunday. A weak, cyclonic
perturbation rotating around the large anticyclonic mid-level flow
will move north through California before turning east across
northern Nevada and southern Idaho. Farther east, broad mid-level
troughing remain across the eastern half of the country bringing
with it seasonably cool, moist, or both conditions.

... Great Basin into portions of the Northern Rockies...

Thunderstorms are expected to develop on Sunday in association with
strong diurnal heating of a relatively moist atmosphere.
Additionally, the aforementioned trough moving around the broader
ridge will also provide modest large-scale ascent to aid
thunderstorm development. Although precipitable water at or above
one inch in some locations would typically favor wet over dry
thunderstorms, increased flow in the cloud-bearing layer will allow
for sufficiently fast storm motions to limit some thunderstorm's
ability to produce wetting rains. The result should be another day
of a mix between wet and dry thunderstorms.

0143 AM CDT Sun Jul 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The western ridge will build northwestward into the Pacific
Northwest on Monday as the short-wave trough rotating around it
moves east into the northern Plains. As this ridge builds,
increasing mid-level heights and associated subsidence should result
in large-scale drying of the troposphere, in turn suppressing
convection across areas within and around the western Great Basin.
If the mid-level trough is slower to move east into the northern
Plains, isolated dry thunderstorms may be possible across portions
of eastern Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. This area will need to be
monitored in subsequent outlooks for possible dry thunderstorm
highlights.

Regardless of dry thunderstorm potential, increasing mixing heights
and steep lapse-rates associated with the building ridge will
support the potential for plume-dominated fire behavior.

...Excessive heat to continue across the Northwest and Northern
U.S....

...Locally heavy rain likely along a frontal boundary draped
across the Gulf Coast with monsoon moisture likely across the
Southwest...

...Slight risk for severe thunderstorms for parts of the Texas and
Oklahoma panhandles on Sunday...

...Tropical Storm Elsa is expected to approach southern Florida on
Monday...

Excessive heat is expected to continue from the northwestern to
the north-central U.S., with temperatures climbing once again into
the 90s to low 100s on Sunday and maybe a few degrees cooler on
Monday. Regardless, daytime highs remain well above normal and
heat advisories and excessive heat warnings remain in effect for
some locations. A couple of daily high records remain challenged
once again for Sunday, mainly across parts of Minnesota.

A frontal boundary settled along the Gulf Coast will keep showers
and storms in the forecast from northern Florida to Texas.
Moderate to locally heavy rain and localized flash flooding is
possible as is the threat for severe weather, particularly for
parts of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. Clouds and unsettled
weather will keep temperatures near or below normal across these
regions. Monsoonal moisture will help to fuel diurnally driven
showers and thunderstorms across parts of the Southwest with
locally heavy rainfall also a concern. Finally, a cold front
dropping into the northern Plains will support shower and
thunderstorm development by Monday with scattered rain also
possible in the Great Lakes and parts of the Northeast.

Tropical Storm Elsa is forecast to track near or over
eastern/central Cuba on Sunday, nearing the Florida Keys by
Monday. There is an increasing risk of tropical storm conditions,
storm surge, and heavy rainfall beginning Monday in the Florida
Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula. Tropical storm watches
have been hoisted for parts of the Keys and extreme southwest
Florida. This risk will also spread northward into Florida and
parts of the southeast by Tuesday and beyond the short range
period.

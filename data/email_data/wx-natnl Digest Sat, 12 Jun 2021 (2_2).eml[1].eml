Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
356 AM EDT Sat Jun 12 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Jun 12 2021 - 12Z Mon Jun 14 2021

...Scattered thunderstorms are expected across the eastern third
of the country as well as the High Plains through early next
week...

...Heat is expected to build across the interior West with some
elevated fire danger...

Unsettled weather is likely across the eastern part of the country
over the next few days, with a few upper-level impulses passing
through, along with surface fronts. These features will trigger
scattered thunderstorms from the Mississippi Valley eastward over
the next couple of days. Widespread severe storms are not
expected, but some strong to severe storms are possible in parts
of the Mid-South to Southeast today, and across parts of the
Midwest and Central/Northern Appalachians tomorrow, where the
Storm Prediction Center has delineated Marginal Risks of severe
weather. Locally heavy rain could cause isolated flash flooding in
some areas as well. The best chance for flash flooding will be
across eastern South Carolina, where there is a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall in place today into tonight. Additionally,
isolated thunderstorms are forecast for the Southern and Central
High Plains over the next couple of days, with high winds and hail
possible in a few storms.

Meanwhile in the West, the main story will be heat building
through next week as an upper-level ridge expands. Today
temperatures are forecast to be over 100 degrees in the Desert
Southwest and spreading into the Southern High Plains, and there
are Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories in effect. Above
normal temperatures should stretch northward into the
Intermountain West, Rockies, and Northern Plains today, but
temperatures are expected to become much hotter there over the
next several days, setting high temperature records. Given the
heat and dry conditions, Elevated Risks of fire weather are in
place for portions of Arizona and New Mexico today, and for parts
of Nevada/Utah/northwestern Arizona tomorrow. The exception to the
Western heat will be the Pacific Northwest, which should see
temperatures near or a bit cooler than normal along with rainy
weather as a couple of cold fronts come through the area.

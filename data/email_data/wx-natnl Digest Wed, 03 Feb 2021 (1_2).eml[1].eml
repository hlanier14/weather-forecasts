Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0925 AM CST Tue Feb 02 2021

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

An elevated risk area has been introduced for portions of the
eastern Florida coast. Mid-morning surface observations show dry air
advecting down the FL Peninsula with winds gusting between 25-30
mph. Despite cooler temperatures, RH reductions to near 35% appear
likely and may briefly fall to near 30% for some locations. Recent
rainfall over the past 24 hours has largely been below a tenth of an
inch, and ERC values remain above the 90th percentile. This
combination will support a fire weather concern for at least 2-3
hours this afternoon before winds begin to abate by early evening.

..Moore.. 02/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CST Tue Feb 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
A cool, relatively stable airmass will envelop much of the central
and eastern U.S. today in the wake of a strengthening coastal low
south/southeast of New England.  This synoptic pattern will result
in northwesterly flow across dry areas of Florida with minimum RH
values falling to around 35-40% amid relatively high ERCs.  A risk
of locally elevated fire-weather conditions will exist especially
across the eastern Peninsula this afternoon.

Elsewhere, a weak lee trough in the High Plains will allow for
locally dry and breezy conditions across west Texas and far eastern
New Mexico.  RH values should only fall into the 20-30% range,
however, with maximum surface winds in the 10-15 mph range.  These
conditions along with low ERCs should mitigate any widespread
fire-weather concerns.

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The most recent deterministic and ensemble guidance shows
remarkably good agreement and clustering for the upper level
pattern through the period. A deep, longwave trough is forecast to
center itself over central/eastern US through much of the period,
with an anomalous closed low north of the Great Lakes. This will
allow for a significant intrusion of Arctic air to overspread and
hold a firm grip on much of the central and eastern U.S.. Before
that though, low pressure forming off an old boundary off the
Southeast U.S. coast is forecast to lift northeast along the East
Coast this weekend. There remains some phasing differences in the
models - where the GFS/CMC offer a faster, split solution which
would keep any meaningful winter precipitation mostly offshore.
However, the ECMWF continues to suggest a slower, more phased
scenario with its low pressure riding up along the coast,
overspreading much more precipitation inland into the colder air.
This solution would bring a higher chance of meaningful amounts of
winter precipitation. Much uncertainty remains though and the WPC
blend/products favored a consensus approach at this time.

Toward the end of the period, the trough begins to flatten out as
more progressive/quasi-zonal flow takes shape. Individual
shortwaves will parade through the deep northwest flow initially
where there are some timing/strengths differences and by the end
of the period, interactions along the southern boundary will
result in an area of low pressure forming over the southern
Plains. This cycle of the WPC blend was composed mainly of the 00Z
ECMWF/CMC, 06Z GFS initially with increasing weight given to the
ECENS/GEFS means by day 6/7 to account for some of the model bias
and uncertainty. Overall though, forecast confidence was average
to above average through the period.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Deepening low pressure lifting out of the Great Lakes early in the
period will bring some enhanced snowfall near and to the north of
the main cyclone track along with blustery/windy conditions on the
backside. This will also enhance some lake effect snows. Meanwhile
upstream, expect a swath of heavy terrain snows from the Northwest
to the north-central Rockies as a potent shortwaves digs over the
region. This energy and subsequent systems will dive into an
amplified central U.S. upper trough position this weekend into
next week and produce periodic swaths of snows. Low pressure
developing off the Southeast coast on an old residual boundary
could lift northeast and produce precipitation across portions of
the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and New England...though there is
much uncertainty in the phasing of this low and mid/upper level
energy. Winter Weather Outlook probabilities are in the 30-50
percent range for meaningful amounts of snow. Finally, by day 7,
there is an emerging guidance signal that later period energy
progression dug into the base of the mean upper trough early next
week may offer potential for an inland precipitation signature out
from the south-central states that could offer a widespread threat
of overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity.

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The most recent deterministic and ensemble guidance shows
remarkably good agreement and clustering for the upper level
pattern through the period. A deep, longwave trough is forecast to
center itself over central/eastern US through much of the period,
with an anomalous closed low north of the Great Lakes. This will
allow for a significant intrusion of Arctic air to overspread and
hold a firm grip on much of the central and eastern U.S.. Before
that though, low pressure forming off an old boundary off the
Southeast U.S. coast is forecast to lift northeast along the East
Coast this weekend. There remains some phasing differences in the
models - where the GFS/CMC offer a faster, split solution which
would keep any meaningful winter precipitation mostly offshore.
However, the ECMWF continues to suggest a slower, more phased
scenario with its low pressure riding up along the coast,
overspreading much more precipitation inland into the colder air.
This solution would bring a higher chance of meaningful amounts of
winter precipitation. Much uncertainty remains though and the WPC
blend/products favored a consensus approach at this time.

Toward the end of the period, the trough begins to flatten out as
more progressive/quasi-zonal flow takes shape. Individual
shortwaves will parade through the deep northwest flow initially
where there are some timing/strengths differences and by the end
of the period, interactions along the southern boundary will
result in an area of low pressure forming over the southern
Plains. This cycle of the WPC blend was composed mainly of the 00Z
ECMWF/CMC, 06Z GFS initially with increasing weight given to the
ECENS/GEFS means by day 6/7 to account for some of the model bias
and uncertainty. Overall though, forecast confidence was average
to above average through the period.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Deepening low pressure lifting out of the Great Lakes early in the
period will bring some enhanced snowfall near and to the north of
the main cyclone track along with blustery/windy conditions on the
backside. This will also enhance some lake effect snows. Meanwhile
upstream, expect a swath of heavy terrain snows from the Northwest
to the north-central Rockies as a potent shortwaves digs over the
region. This energy and subsequent systems will dive into an
amplified central U.S. upper trough position this weekend into
next week and produce periodic swaths of snows. Low pressure
developing off the Southeast coast on an old residual boundary
could lift northeast and produce precipitation across portions of
the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and New England...though there is
much uncertainty in the phasing of this low and mid/upper level
energy. Winter Weather Outlook probabilities are in the 30-50
percent range for meaningful amounts of snow. Finally, by day 7,
there is an emerging guidance signal that later period energy
progression dug into the base of the mean upper trough early next
week may offer potential for an inland precipitation signature out
from the south-central states that could offer a widespread threat
of overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0115 PM CST Tue Feb 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

Only minor changes are needed for the ongoing elevated risk area
across southeast NM/southwest TX. Recent guidance continues to show
reasonable probability in elevated fire weather conditions (as
outlined in the previous discussion below), though the northeastward
extent of the threat remains somewhat uncertain.

Guidance continues to show relatively high probability for RH
reductions below 30% across southeast FL for Wednesday afternoon,
but the potential for wind speeds near/above 15 mph remains too low
to introduce a risk area.

..Moore.. 02/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CST Tue Feb 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure will slide southeastward across the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys behind a departing system over the western
Atlantic.  Meanwhile, a surface low will strengthen over eastern
Colorado and western Kansas through the evening beneath increasing
flow aloft.  Very late in the forecast period (D2/Wed evening), high
pressure over Oregon will contribute to offshore flow increasing
across terrain-favored areas of southern California, though recent
precipitation will hinder the ability for ignitions due to moist
fuels.

...West Texas and southeastern New Mexico...
Surface flow will increase west of a trough oriented roughly along
the I-27 corridor in the Texas South Plains due to vertical mixing
and steepening pressure gradient processes.  Widespread areas of
20-25 mph wind speeds are likely.  The lowest RH values (around
15-20%), however, are expected across the TransPecos and vicinity,
which happens to coincide with areas of minimal precipitation over
the past couple weeks.  Despite only modest ERCs, a risk of fire
spread will exist due to the aforementioned atmospheric conditions.
An elevated delineation has been added to address this threat.
Farther north toward the Texas Panhandle, locally elevated
fire-weather conditions are expected where fuels are dry, although
areas of precipitation have occurred and RH values are expected to
be slightly higher.

...Central/south Florida...
Despite weakening surface flow (in tandem with high pressure
building into the area), the 03Z RAP indicates potential for areas
of sub-25% RH values to develop across much of central and eastern
Florida where fuels are dry in spots.  This will contribute to a
localized, elevated fire-weather threat despite wind speeds of
around 5-10 mph in most areas.  The threat is expected to be too
spotty to introduce an area, but will be monitored in later
outlooks.

bV96qHW-UGf$

FOR WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 10 - TUESDAY FEBRUARY 16: An increased risk for
widespread much below normal temperatures across the U.S. during week-2
continues to be the main hazards concern. A series of mid-level troughs are
forecast to propagate across Alaska (excluding the Aleutians) and the CONUS
throughout week-2. This pattern supports strong surface high pressure sinki=
ng
southward from the Arctic, bringing anomalously cold temperatures into
mainland
Alaska and many parts of the CONUS (excluding the Southwest). The GEFS
ensemble
forecasts indicates the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index dropping to
significantly
negative values during week-2. The canonical temperature pattern typically
associated with this teleconnection signal also supports widespread anomalo=
us
cold temperatures for the CONUS. There continues to be relatively good
agreement between the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools indicating >20% chanc=
e
of
minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile across a widespr=
ead
portion of the northwestern, eastern and central CONUS throughout week-2.
Therefore, a broad area of slight risk (>20%) is highlighted for much below
normal temperatures across these regions throughout the period. Relative to
yesterday's outlook, the areas of moderate and high risk have been expanded
today due to the increased spatial coverage of the reforecast tools indicat=
ing
>40% and >60% chance, respectively, of minimum temperatures falling to the
lowest 15th percentile. A moderate risk (>40%) for much below normal
temperatures is posted across portions of the Northern and Central Plains,
Midwest, Tennessee Valley, Appalachians, Great Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic, Feb=
 10
to 13, and a high risk (>60%) is designated for parts of the Upper and Midd=
le
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and eastern portions of the Northern Plain=
s,
Feb 10 to 12. The reforecast tools indicate the possibility for many areas
experiencing minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 5th percentile, wit=
h
localized areas reaching the lowest 2nd percentile, which would translate t=
o
reaching near record breaking cold temperatures. The highlighted areas of r=
isk
across the Northern Plains, Midwest, and Northeast could have minimum
temperatures falling below zero (Deg F), while temperatures across the
southern
CONUS could fall to sub-freezing which would be some of the coldest
temperatures observed this season.



The deterministic 0Z ECMWF and 6Z GFS, along with the ECMWF ensemble mean
indicate a surface low intensifying over the Canadian Maritimes early next
week, which could bring high winds to parts of the Northeast at the beginni=
ng
of the period. A slight risk of high winds is designated for parts of the
Northeast for Feb 10, where the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates >20% chance=
 of
sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph. Sustained h=
igh
winds in combination with anticipated cold Arctic air would especially pose=
 an
increased risk for dangerous low wind chill values across the Northeast.



The advection of cold Arctic air into parts of Alaska is anticipated to bri=
ng
increased risk of widespread much below normal temperatures to the state.
There
continues to be good agreement amongst the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools
indicating an increased risk of much below normal temperatures across parts=
 of
mainland Alaska. The reforecast tools show a stronger signal today for this
anomalous cold feature compared to yesterday. Therefore, a moderate risk fo=
r
much below normal temperatures is added today for interior mainland Alaska,
Feb
10 to 11. The ECMWF reforecast tool shows the potential for some of these
moderate risk areas experiencing temperatures falling to the lowest 5th
percentile. A slight risk area is maintained for mainland Alaska north of t=
he
Alaska Range, Feb 10 to 12, where the reforecast tools indicate >20% chance=
 of
minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and -40 Deg F.

from northern New York to northern Maine.  Additionally,
rain/freezing rain will develop over parts of Coastal New England
today with snow ending overnight Wednesday across the Central
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic and begin to wane over the Northeast on
Thursday morning.

A cold front will advance through the West while another cold
front plunges south and east into the central U.S. Rain and higher
elevation snow is expected with this from the Pacific Northwest to
northern California today with the snow spreading east to the
Rockies late tonight/early Wednesday. Precipitation will taper off
over the West Coast on Wednesday. During Wednesday afternoon, the
snow will overspread the Central Rockies while rain enters
Southern Rockies. Additionally, a wintry mix will move across the
Northern Plains reaching the Central Plains and parts of the
Mississippi Valley by Wednesday evening. The front will slow its
eastward progression which will keep cold and wet conditions
across the center of the country.

PMDMRD
Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Tue February 02 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 08 - 12 2021

Today's models are in good agreement on an amplified 500-hPa pattern across
the
forecast domain. A large amplitude ridge is forecast over the North Pacific=
,
while a downstream trough is expected to persist over much of the CONUS. Mu=
ch
above normal heights are expected across Greenland and much of northern
Canada,
with mean positive height anomalies exceeding 350 meters over northern Baff=
in
Island..

Near to above normal temperatures are favored for the western Aleutians,
underneath anomalous ridging. Below normal temperatures are forecast for th=
e
remainder of Alaska due to near surface flow from western Canada and also
underneath below 500-hPa heights predicted over parts of the region.
Probabilities of below normal temperatures are enhanced for much of the CON=
US
underneath the forecast below normal heights and consistent with dynamical
forecast tools. The highest chances of below normal temperatures (exceeding
90%) exist over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley.

Below normal precipitation is favored for southern Alaska underneath foreca=
st
near to above normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal precipitation is likely =
for
parts of eastern Mainland Alaska consistent with the consolidation forecast
tool. Downstream of the large-amplitude ridge off the West Coast of the CON=
US,
relatively dry conditions favor below normal precipitation for most of the
western CONUS. One or more shortwaves are expected to intensify and travel
through the central CONUS, moving eastward and spreading precipitation acro=
ss
parts of the Northern High Plains and Southern Plains eastward to the
Southeast. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the
Upper
Mississippi Valley southward to the Middle Mississippi Valley and Ohio Vall=
ey
to the Northeast, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today=
's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
very good model agreement on a large-amplitude pattern over the domain and
relatively good agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 10 - 16 2021

During the week-2 period, a strong ridge is forecast to remain in the
northeastern Pacific, with the northern extension of the ridge moving west =
to
extend over the Bering Sea. Downstream, a persistent mean trough is forecas=
t
over much of the CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are favored for much of Alaska due to forecasted
low-level easterly flow from western Canada and also consistent with dynami=
cal
forecast tools. Predicted large scale troughing leads to enhanced
probabilities
of below normal temperatures for much of the CONUS, except parts of the
Southwest, where above normal temperatures are favored, consistent with the
Consolidation forecast tool.

As the forecast ridge builds west of Mainland Alaska, the storm track is
expected to lift further north than usual, favoring below normal precipitat=
ion
across much of the state. Below normal precipitation is favored for the
southwestern CONUS, consistent with dynamical forecast tools. Arctic surfac=
e
high pressure is forecast to progress south from Canada, increasing the
potential for upslope flow and associated above normal precipitation across
parts of the Northern Plains. Above normal precipitation is also likely for
parts of the Southern Plains due to moisture flow from the Gulf of Mexico.
Below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Southeast and much o=
f
the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=
0%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement on the large-scale patterns, offset by model disagreements
among
the temperature and precipitation forecasts.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1251 AM CST Wed Feb 03 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
The gradient between surface high pressure across the Ohio
Valley/Deep South and a low centered over southeastern Canada will
allow for a dry, north/northwesterly flow across a broad part of the
southeastern CONUS.  The gradient between this high and lee
troughing across the High Plains will also allow for breezy and dry
conditions across portions of New Mexico and west Texas.  Very late
in the forecast period, offshore flow will begin across coastal
ranges of Southern California in response to high pressure
developing over Oregon.  Fuels in this area are largely
unsusceptible to fires, however.

...Central/south Florida...
Recent model guidance has trended drier and a bit breezier compared
to prior runs.  Areas of 10-15 mph surface winds will develop by
midday and persist through sunset across much of the area.
Meanwhile, 60s F surface temperatures will allow for RH values to
fall into the 25-35% range during peak heating hours.  Fuels are dry
and ERCs relatively high.  Thus, an elevated fire-weather
delineation has been maintained for this outlook.

...Southeastern New Mexico and a small part of west Texas...
Surface troughing and terrain-related enhancement of surface winds
will allow for areas of 15-20 mph wind speeds to develop through
peak heating hours.  RH values should also fall into the 12-20%
range during the afternoon in tandem with surface temperatures
nearing 80F.  Although ERCs are not particularly high for this time
of year, an elevated risk for wildland fires will exist where fuels
(especially finer fuels) are dry.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1253 AM CST Wed Feb 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
Surface cyclogenesis will occur across the central Plains in the
first half of the forecast period (D2/Thu).  This low will migrate
northeastward toward the western Great Lakes while sending a cold
front southward across Texas.  Modest warm/moist advection will
occur across the Lower Mississippi Valley, though much of Florida
will remain dry under the influence of another high pressure area
centered over the Gulf Stream.  Lastly, offshore flow will occur in
coastal ranges of southern California, though recent rainfall should
mitigate any larger-scale fire-weather concerns.

...Southeastern New Mexico toward the Big Bend area of Texas...
A belt of breezy to windy conditions will exist ahead of the
southward-moving front across Texas and eastern New Mexico
throughout the day.  Although the speed/timing of the front is in
question, the expectation is that areas from Lubbock to San Angelo
should reside south of the front for much of the afternoon.  15-25
mph surface winds are expected along and south of the front, with
shifting winds expected within the frontal zone.  RH values will
fall into the 12-25% range as well.  Where fuels are dry, an
elevated fire-weather threat will exist.

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance still to show remarkably good agreement for the flow
pattern evolution through medium range time scales. This is
highlighted aloft by an amplified eastern Pacific/Alaskan ridge
and a deep longwave trough centering over the central/eastern
U.S., with an anomalous closed low north of the Great Lakes. This
allows significant intrusions of Arctic air overspread and hold a
firm grip on central and eastern U.S. much below normal
temperatures. The upper trough may begin to flatten by next
midweek as more progressive flow emerges from the Pacific.

Considering the better than average guidance clustering, the WPC
medium range product suite was derived from a composite blend of
the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS, 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian/ECMWF ensemble
mean and the 01 UTC National Blend of Models, albeit with
increasing emphasis on the ensembles by day 6/7 (next Tue/Wed)
consistent with gradually decreasing system predictability. This
maintains good WPC product continuity and latest 00 UTC model and
ensemble guidance overall seems well in line with this scenario.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Lead energetic low pressure exiting New England Saturday and
cyclonic flow/cold surge out from the Great Lakes offers some
lingering enhanced snows, including lake effect, along with
blustery/windy conditions on the backside. Meanwhile upstream,
expect upslope snows over the northern Rockies as shortwaves cross
over the region and as potent Arctic blasts surge southward. This
energy and subsequent systems will dive into an amplified central
U.S. upper trough position this weekend into next week and produce
periodic snow swaths in the reinforced Arctic air. A lingering
lead front over the Southeast/FL should focus Superbowl weekend
showers/thunderstorms. A Southeast coast low developing off the
front should lift northward Sunday/Monday and spread precipitation
across the cooling Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic and Northeast to
include an interior snow/ice threat. There is uncertainty with
phasing of this low and mid/upper level energy. Impulses running
on the base of the upper trough early-mid next week offer
potential for swaths of overrunning precipitation including a
snow/ice threat deeper into the cold post-frontal airmass over
much of the south-central states and Southeast where modest
amounts have an enhanced impact.

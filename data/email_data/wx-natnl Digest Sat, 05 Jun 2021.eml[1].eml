Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1154 AM CDT Fri Jun 04 2021

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTH EASTERN WASHINGTON AND FAR
NORTHERN OREGON...

...Lee of the Cascades...
Hi-res model guidance has come into better agreement that widespread
critical fire weather conditions are likely to develop this
afternoon and evening across portions of southeastern Washington and
far northern Oregon. Dry downslope flow along the Cascades will
support humidity values of 10-20% with sustained surface winds of
20-25 mph. The aforementioned meteorological conditions and the
presence of record early-season dry fuels gives enough confidence to
add a critical delineation to the forecast. Elsewhere, the forecast
remains valid with no major changes. The northwestern corner of the
elevated area across portions of North Dakota was adjusted to
account for higher precipitation totals with storms expected this
afternoon. See the previous discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 06/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0118 AM CDT Fri Jun 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will begin to dominate much of the CONUS today, but
with a well-defined mid-level impulse and associated surface
lee-trough cresting the ridge across the northern Rockies. Dry and
breezy downslope flow along the lee of the Cascades will promote
some wildfire-spread potential. Deep-layer lifting of a buoyant
airmass atop a dry boundary layer will support dry thunderstorm
potential from parts of the Great Basin to the northern Plains.
Farther southwest, dry and breezy conditions may be observed across
portions of the lower Colorado River Valley this afternoon, with
more localized favorable surface conditions across central
California to the lee of the Coast Ranges.

...Lee of the Cascades and Sierra...
During the afternoon, westerly downslope flow is expected to
contribute to widespread 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds
along the lee of the entire Cascades and northern Sierra,
overlapping with 15-20% RH. Fuels across this area are unseasonably
dry and are at least modestly receptive to fire spread, warranting
the continuation of Elevated highlights. Locally Critical conditions
are still expected across the Columbia and Harney Basins per latest
guidance consensus, but widespread coverage of Critical remains too
low for introducing highlights this outlook.

...Parts of the Great Basin into the Four Corners Region...
Deep-layer ascent ahead of the upper trough will promote isolated to
widely scattered high-based thunderstorms across much of the
Interior West during the afternoon into early evening hours. While
isolated thunderstorms across the Great Basin into the Four Corners
will be slow moving, 0.5-0.75 inch precipitable water values and a
very dry surface-500 mb sub-cloud layer suggest that dry strikes
will be common. Fuels are at least modestly receptive to fire spread
across western Nevada, to near critically receptive along the
Nevada/Utah/Arizona border and points southeast, warranting isolated
dry thunderstorm highlights for much of the Great Basin.

...Northern Rockies into North Dakota...
Farther north across parts of Montana into North Dakota, fuel
receptiveness becomes more nebulous, with 100-hr fuels supporting
some fire-spread potential despite relatively low ERCs. Precipitable
water values are also expected to exceed 1.0 inches across much of
eastern Montana and points east. Nonetheless, fast-moving storms
will develop atop a deep, dry sub-cloud layer, with the potential to
produce several dry strikes in addition to strong, erratic wind
gusts (please see the Day 1 Convective Outlook for more details on
severe potential). Dry and breezy ambient conditions verging on
Elevated thresholds (albeit more localized) are also expected across
parts of the northern Rockies into western North Dakota. Many of the
aforementioned conditions may compensate for high precipitable water
values/marginally receptive fuels to foster at least some
grassfire-ignition potential, with isolated dry-thunderstorm
highlights introduced where the best overlap of these favorable
conditions is expected.

Farther east into north-central North Dakota to northwest Minnesota,
more widespread Elevated conditions are expected ahead of a
southward-sagging cold front. Here, 15 mph sustained southwesterly
winds are expected to overlap with 20-25% RH for at least a few
hours, with Elevated highlights maintained given the very dry fuels
in place.

...Lower Colorado River Basin...
Latest guidance consensus has trended upward in surface wind speeds
across portions of central Arizona to the Nevada and New Mexico
border areas, given the presence of heat-low-induced gradient winds.
15 mph sustained westerly winds are expected to be common this
afternoon, and will overlap with 10-20% RH and very dry fuels, hence
the introduction of Elevated highlights.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTH EASTERN WASHINGTON AND FAR
NORTHERN OREGON...

...Lee of the Cascades...
Hi-res model guidance has come into better agreement that widespread
critical fire weather conditions are likely to develop this
afternoon and evening across portions of southeastern Washington and
far northern Oregon. Dry downslope flow along the Cascades will
support humidity values of 10-20% with sustained surface winds of
20-25 mph. The aforementioned meteorological conditions and the
presence of record early-season dry fuels gives enough confidence to
add a critical delineation to the forecast. Elsewhere, the forecast
remains valid with no major changes. The northwestern corner of the
elevated area across portions of North Dakota was adjusted to
account for higher precipitation totals with storms expected this
afternoon. See the previous discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 06/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0118 AM CDT Fri Jun 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will begin to dominate much of the CONUS today, but
with a well-defined mid-level impulse and associated surface
lee-trough cresting the ridge across the northern Rockies. Dry and
breezy downslope flow along the lee of the Cascades will promote
some wildfire-spread potential. Deep-layer lifting of a buoyant
airmass atop a dry boundary layer will support dry thunderstorm
potential from parts of the Great Basin to the northern Plains.
Farther southwest, dry and breezy conditions may be observed across
portions of the lower Colorado River Valley this afternoon, with
more localized favorable surface conditions across central
California to the lee of the Coast Ranges.

...Lee of the Cascades and Sierra...
During the afternoon, westerly downslope flow is expected to
contribute to widespread 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds
along the lee of the entire Cascades and northern Sierra,
overlapping with 15-20% RH. Fuels across this area are unseasonably
dry and are at least modestly receptive to fire spread, warranting
the continuation of Elevated highlights. Locally Critical conditions
are still expected across the Columbia and Harney Basins per latest
guidance consensus, but widespread coverage of Critical remains too
low for introducing highlights this outlook.

...Parts of the Great Basin into the Four Corners Region...
Deep-layer ascent ahead of the upper trough will promote isolated to
widely scattered high-based thunderstorms across much of the
Interior West during the afternoon into early evening hours. While
isolated thunderstorms across the Great Basin into the Four Corners
will be slow moving, 0.5-0.75 inch precipitable water values and a
very dry surface-500 mb sub-cloud layer suggest that dry strikes
will be common. Fuels are at least modestly receptive to fire spread
across western Nevada, to near critically receptive along the
Nevada/Utah/Arizona border and points southeast, warranting isolated
dry thunderstorm highlights for much of the Great Basin.

...Northern Rockies into North Dakota...
Farther north across parts of Montana into North Dakota, fuel
receptiveness becomes more nebulous, with 100-hr fuels supporting
some fire-spread potential despite relatively low ERCs. Precipitable
water values are also expected to exceed 1.0 inches across much of
eastern Montana and points east. Nonetheless, fast-moving storms
will develop atop a deep, dry sub-cloud layer, with the potential to
produce several dry strikes in addition to strong, erratic wind
gusts (please see the Day 1 Convective Outlook for more details on
severe potential). Dry and breezy ambient conditions verging on
Elevated thresholds (albeit more localized) are also expected across
parts of the northern Rockies into western North Dakota. Many of the
aforementioned conditions may compensate for high precipitable water
values/marginally receptive fuels to foster at least some
grassfire-ignition potential, with isolated dry-thunderstorm
highlights introduced where the best overlap of these favorable
conditions is expected.

Farther east into north-central North Dakota to northwest Minnesota,
more widespread Elevated conditions are expected ahead of a
southward-sagging cold front. Here, 15 mph sustained southwesterly
winds are expected to overlap with 20-25% RH for at least a few
hours, with Elevated highlights maintained given the very dry fuels
in place.

...Lower Colorado River Basin...
Latest guidance consensus has trended upward in surface wind speeds
across portions of central Arizona to the Nevada and New Mexico
border areas, given the presence of heat-low-induced gradient winds.
15 mph sustained westerly winds are expected to be common this
afternoon, and will overlap with 10-20% RH and very dry fuels, hence
the introduction of Elevated highlights.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 04 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure is favored to bring anomalously
warm
temperatures and possible excessive heat to the north-central contiguous U.S
throughout week-2. Potentially heavy rainfall forecast for parts of the
Southern Plains is likely to aggravate flooding conditions across portions of
Texas and Louisiana. There is also an increased chance of tropical cyclone
formation in the western Caribbean during mid-June which may bring heavy
rainfall to the Gulf Coast late in the period which could prolong flooding
across the aforementioned areas. Over Alaska, mid-level high pressure forecast
over the Bering Sea favors drier than normal conditions over parts of the
Mainland.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern and Central
Plains, Mon-Tue, Jun 14-15.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Rockies, Northern and
Central
Plains, and the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Sun-Thu, Jun 13-17.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for lower portions of the Gulf Coast
States,
Tue-Fri, Jun 15-18.

Flooding possible for parts of southern and eastern Texas and the Lower
Mississippi Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY JUNE 07 - FRIDAY JUNE 11:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!qg5vJdk7nbyK12zg7mJRwT-rx-z7hyhmEnq_foaHkGLWUEXTyycm7elMK6AhTGx84YMn2kJv$

FOR SATURDAY JUNE 12 - FRIDAY JUNE 18: At the start of week-2, there is good
agreement between the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF 500-hPa ensemble mean height
anomalies featuring anomalous troughing centered over the East Pacific, and
downstream anomalous ridging with positive height departures overspreading
much
of the CONUS. Both models favor this mid-level pattern to become more
amplified
by the beginning of the week-2 period, with the ECMWF being slightly more
aggressive with this progression than the GEFS by the middle of week-2.
Consequently, there is added confidence in today's outlook for the persistence
of anomalously warm temperatures for much of the CONUS, with elevated concerns
for excessive heat across the north-central CONUS.



As highlighted in previous hazard outlooks throughout the week, anomalous
mid-level ridging has been the culprit for promoting unseasonably hot late
spring temperatures over the northern tier of the CONUS, with some of the
hottest temperatures of the year (and near record breaking) still favored over
the Northern Plains, Great Lakes and Northeast during week-1. As this
anomalous
ridging is forecast to restrengthen over the north-central CONUS during
week-2,
reforecast tools indicate a broad region extending from the Northern
Intermountain region to the Great Lakes with increased chances for maximum
daily temperatures reaching the 85th climatological percentile. Tied to the
higher amplitude ridging favored by the ECMWF aloft, the ECMWF reforecast tool
is more robust with the anomalous heat signal than the GEFS, which depicts at
least a 40% (10%) chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th (98th)
percentile from the Central Rockies northeastward to the Upper Mississippi
Valley during the middle of the period. Within this area, the 0z ECMWF
ensemble
shows at least a 40% chance of maximum daytime temperatures exceeding 95
degrees F, mainly focused across the Northern High Plains, increasing the
potential for heat index values exceeding 100 degrees F. As a result, a
moderate risk of excessive heat is added to the outlook for Jun 14-15 during
the peak of the anomalous mid-level ridging forecast by the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles, while a slight risk is maintained for Jun 13-17 which covers a
broader area across the northwestern and north-central CONUS in accordance
with
the reforecast guidance. The anticipated anomalously warm conditions forecast
over the north-central CONUS, combined with below-normal precipitation
predominately favored over the region through mid-June is likely to adversely
impact developing agriculture and worsen moderate (D1) to exceptional (D4)
drought conditions being felt over the Northern Plains and portions of the
Upper Mississippi Valley.



Across the tropics, the large-scale environment continues to remain favorable
for tropical cyclogenesis in the western Atlantic with eastward propagating
wave features predicted to traverse the Americas during week-2. Dynamical
models continue to support tropical cyclone (TC) formation, however there are
more diverging solutions in today's ensemble guidance, compared to yesterday.
Consistent with previous runs, the 0z GEFS favors an area of mean surface low
pressure deepening over the Gulf of Honduras, with several ensemble member low
centers tracking northward across Cuba and towards western Florida by the
latter portion of the period. The 6z GEFS, however, features considerably more
spread among the members, with some favoring a more northeasterly solution
towards Florida, and others favoring the potential low to track westward
towards the western Gulf Coast states. In line with this scenario, the ECMWF
probabilistic TC tool depicts elevated chances for cyclone development over
the
Bay of Campeche, where there are also increased chances of 3-day precipitation
amounts exceeding 1 inch along the Gulf Coast, from Texas to the Lower
Mississippi Valley in both the raw 0z ECMWF ensemble and the ECMWF reforecast
tool. To address this uncertainty and trend in the guidance, the slight risk
area for heavy precipitation has been expanded westward along the Gulf Coast
in
today's outlook for Jun 15-18. Should a TC form and track towards the western
Gulf of Mexico, this would pose a greater risk to portions of southeastern
Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley given the persistent above-normal
rainfall observed, where many areas have experienced more than twice their
normal rainfall accumulation since early May. With enhanced precipitation also
forecast by the Weather Prediction Center over eastern Texas (another 2 to 4
inches of rainfall) during week-1, a flooding possible hazard remains issued
over southern and eastern Texas and into Louisiana as the observed minor to
moderate river flooding may persist into week-2.



Over Alaska, anomalous mid-level ridging favored by both the GEFS and ECMWF is
anticipated to bring above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation
to parts of the Mainland during week-2. A continuation of warm and drier than
normal conditions may help to dry out fuels and increase wildfire activity
into
mid-June.

...Record Heat Threat from the Northern Rockies/Plains to the
Northeast....
...Lingering Multi-Day Heavy Rainfall Event For the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Models and ensembles highlight the amplification and persistence
of a eastern Pacific to West Coast mean upper trough next week
while hot downstream ridging is forecast to build over much of the
East, albeit eroding southward from the Great Lakes/Northeast
mid-later next week with northern stream upper trough digging as
upper ridging builds upstream over the north-central states. An
upper weakness stuck over the east-central U.S. and associated
surface boundaries will be the focus/lift for widespread
precipitation, some of which could be locally heavy and result in
flash flooding over portions of Texas, Louisiana, and the ArkLaTex
region. With troughing established over the West Coast, storm
systems are expected to track along a quasi-stationary boundary
from the central/northern Rockies into the northern Plains, but
forecast spread is highest with this portion of the forecast.

While model guidance is reasonably clustered and agreeable for
much of the lower 48 for days 3-5 (Mon-Wed), there is considerable
uncertainty for the Western U.S. with the evolution of shortwave
energy coming out of the Gulf of Alaska and Eastern Pacific. This
then offers ample challenge with the timing and extent of height
falls working inland over the West mid-later next week. The WPC
medium range product suite is primarily derived from a composite
blend of the 06 UTC GFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and by days 6/7 the
less progressive and more amplified 06 UTC GEFS and 00 UTC ECMWF
ensemble means. Lo and behold the the latest 12 UTC models now
also show a strong trend toward amplification and slower
progression then that will be monitored for future forecast
cycles, but this trend seems reasonable considering the blocky
nature of the pattern.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The interaction of deep/moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico with
weakening surface boundaries up from the western/central Gulf
Coast and lingering upper troughing will continue to provide
episodes of heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding into
early-mid next week for portions of Texas, Louisiana, and
gradually northward across the ArkLaTex and Lower/Mid Mississippi
River Valley where the greatest risk area for several inches of
rainfall totals exists. Over time next week, the associated
surface trough is forecast to weaken and lift northward which will
bring numerous to widespread showers and thunderstorms to portions
of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions, although with lighter
rainfall amounts expected at this time. Meanwhile, diurnally
driven showers/storms will be possible eastward to the southern to
central Appalachians and parts of the Mid-Atlantic with the flow
around a strong Bermuda high. The West will remain dry aside from
some light precipitation for the Pacific Northwest and northern
Rockies.

The greatest temperature anomalies during the period are expected
to be across the northern tier of the CONUS where daytime highs
will range from 15F to 20+F above normal. Record highs will be
possible, especially across the Northeast Monday and Tuesday prior
to expected backdoor cold front passage. 12 UTC model trends for
more amplified upper flow downstream from the West Coast mid-later
next week may also act to prolong a threat of record conditions
over the north-central U.S. under a stronger upper ridge than
anticipated for this forecast package. This trend also blend wells
with the hot CPC week 2 forecast. The South will see normal to
even slightly below normal temperatures thanks to increased cloud
cover and precipitation chances while the West Coast will
experience slightly below normal readings in response to the
troughing in place over the region.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri June 04 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 10 - 14 2021

We continue to see good agreement among today's model solutions on the 500-hPa
pattern across North America. An amplified pattern is predicted, consisting of
strong anomalous ridges centered south of the Aleutians and over much of the
CONUS, and a deep trough over the Eastern Pacific, extending into the west
coast of the CONUS.

Ridging centered to the south of the Aleutians is forecast to favor relatively
warm and dry conditions for Alaska. Downstream, a deep trough forecast over
the
Eastern Pacific is expected to result in a relatively persistent flow of
moisture and developing storm systems along the west coast of the CONUS,
favoring above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California. Beneath the negative height anomalies associated with this trough,
odds of below normal temperatures are enhanced along most of the West Coast.
Anomalously strong ridging predicted over much of the CONUS is expected to
prevent storm systems and Pacific moisture from traversing the CONUS, strongly
favoring below normal precipitation for parts of the Rockies and Central and
Southern Plains. The likelihood of below normal precipitation is also
increased
eastward to the Great Lakes Region and Northeast beneath positive height
anomalies. Anomalous southerly low level flow and positive height anomalies
significantly increase chances of above normal temperatures across most of the
rest of the CONUS, especially over parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern
Plains, where positive height anomalies are highest and tools are in the best
agreement. The potential for some shortwave troughs to persist over parts of
the Southern Plains enhances the likelihood of near to below normal
temperatures over much of Texas and Louisiana, as well as above normal
precipitation over eastern Texas. A weakness in the forecast ridge is expected
from parts of Texas, east to the Mid-Atlantic region, favoring above normal
precipitation across this region.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's
operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to very good agreement among the model solutions, an amplified pattern
predicted across the domain, and good agreement among the temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 12 - 18 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is forecast to persist, but
deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. Because the pattern is expected to
be similar to the 6-10 day period, the temperature probability forecast is
quite similar. One significant difference is along the west coast of the
CONUS.
Positive height anomalies associated with the forecast ridge centered over the
CONUS are expected to spread westward by the week-2 period, favoring above
normal temperatures along the western coast of the CONUS. The week-2
precipitation probability forecast is also similar to the 6-10 day forecast,
with a few notable differences. 500-hPa troughing is forecast to build
northward over the Alaska Panhandle, favoring near normal precipitation there.
The latest models are predicting an increase in low-level moisture flow on the
western periphery of surface high pressure predicted over the eastern U.S.
This
favors increasing moisture and above normal precipitation over parts of the
Four Corners region. Due to the potential for increased tropical activity over
parts of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, above normal precipitation is
favored for states along the Gulf of Mexico, parts of the Southeast, southern
Mid-Atlantic, and Florida.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's
operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Fri Jun 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST ARIZONA SOUTHWEST NEW
MEXICO...

...Southeast Arizona Southwest New Mexico...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions are possible across
portions of southern Arizona and New Mexico Day2/Saturday. A
deepening area of low pressure across the great basin and increasing
mid-level flow will support westerly surface winds of 20-30 mph.
Very dry surface conditions with RH of 7-15% will overlap with
exceptionally dry fuels signaling an increase in fire weather
potential through the evening. The rest of the forecast remains
valid with no major changes.

..Lyons.. 06/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0220 AM CDT Fri Jun 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will gradually deepen while propagating across
the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies/northern Plains, as
an upper ridge breaks down across the CONUS tomorrow. Surface
lee-troughing will prevail across the Plains states, with gradient
winds and a mixing boundary layer contributing to widespread dry and
breezy conditions to portions of the Northern Rockies into the
Interior West. Deep-layer ascent and adequate moisture ahead of the
upper trough will also pose a low, conditional threat of isolated
dry thunderstorms across portions of the Great Basin into the Four
Corners region. However, details of Day 1 precipitation and greatest
coverage of dry strikes preclude isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights this outlook.

...Interior West...
By afternoon peak heating, downslope flow along the lee of the
southern Cascades/Sierra will contribute to widespread 15-25 mph
sustained westerly surface winds and 10-20% RH across southeast
Oregon into Idaho and western Nevada. Similar surface winds/RH are
expected from eastern Nevada into southwest Utah and much of central
Arizona, given boundary-layer drying and downward momentum transport
of modest mid-level flow. A broad area of Elevated highlights were
introduced, given widespread, unseasonably dry fuels. At least
locally Critical conditions are expected across much of the Elevated
area, with several of the latest guidance members depicting
potentially widespread Critical conditions. Lack of stronger upper
support with southward extent was the primary reason for withholding
Critical highlights this outlook, though Critical highlights may be
needed in future outlooks if models continue to trend drier and
windier across portions of the Interior West.

In addition, a lobe of relatively higher mid-level moisture may move
into the Great Basin tomorrow ahead of the upper trough, where the
latest guidance shows classic inverted-V soundings and strong enough
low/mid-level wind speeds to support fast storm motions. Questions
remain regarding the coverage of storms across the area. However, if
confidence increases in better storm coverage across the area,
isolated dry thunderstorm highlights may be introduced in future
outlooks given at least modestly receptive fuels across the area.

...Northern Rockies...
60+ kt mid-level flow will overspread the region tomorrow afternoon
as the upper trough passes overhead. Downward momentum transport
within a relatively dry boundary layer will foster widespread 15-25
mph sustained westerly surface winds and 15-25% RH. While the
marginal receptiveness of fuels to fire spread and potential impacts
of Day 1 precipitation may negatively influence wildfire-spread
potential to a degree, the widespread high-end Elevated to Critical
conditions warrant the introduction of Elevated highlights.

...Early season heatwave across the northern Plains will expand
into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend...

...Additional heavy rain expected to spread eastward into the
central Gulf Coast this weekend...

Impressive early season heat is expected to continue across much
of the northern tier of the U.S. into Saturday as a strong upper
level ridge dominates the weather pattern across the region.
Highs well into the 90s to near 100 degrees are likely to break
some old-standing records across portions of the Dakotas and
Minnesota Saturday afternoon.  Meanwhile, much cooler air
associated with an upper-level trough is moving into the Pacific
Northwest.  A cold front will move steadily eastward across the
northern Rockies tonight and could trigger some strong to severe
thunderstorms for the northern High Plains through tonight into
Saturday morning.  Cooler air behind the front will bring
temperatures down to normal levels for the northern High Plains on
Sunday.  However, the upper Midwest will remain hot on Sunday as
the heat expands eastward into the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic
on Sunday where high temperatures in the low to mid 90s could
challenge some daily records.  Over the Mid-Atlantic, some
thunderstorms this afternoon into this evening may become severe.
Expect the rain chances to decrease during the weekend as a
surface trough tends to move toward and off the Mid-Atlantic coast.

Meanwhile, additional heavy rainfall is forecast for the western
half of the Gulf Coast region as an upper-level trough/low forms
over the southern Plains and interacts with tropical moisture from
the Gulf of Mexico.  The highest chance of heavy rain is expected
to be across coastal Texas through tonight but the heavy rain is
expected to shift toward Louisiana on Saturday as the upper trough
is forecast to lift toward the northeast.  By Sunday, the threat
of heavy rain could spread further inland across the lower
Mississippi Valley.  Total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches of rain may
result in some instances of flooding especially across southern
Louisiana during the weekend.

Over the Pacific Northwest, damp and cool condition will return
for the weekend under cool and moist onshore flow associated with
the upper trough.  In contrast, it will remain quite warm across
the interior West with 100+ degree readings expected for the lower
elevations across the Desert Southwest.  Some scattered
thunderstorms is forecast across the Great Basin into this
evening, shifting into the central and southern Rockies during the
weekend, and possibly over the central to southern High Plains
Sunday afternoon.

...Record Heat Threat from the Northern Rockies/Plains to the
Northeast....
...Lingering Multi-Day Heavy Rainfall Event For the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Models and ensembles highlight the amplification and persistence
of a eastern Pacific to West Coast mean upper trough next week
while hot downstream ridging is forecast to build over much of the
East, albeit eroding southward from the Great Lakes/Northeast
mid-later next week with northern stream upper trough digging as
upper ridging builds upstream over the north-central states. An
upper weakness stuck over the east-central U.S. and associated
surface boundaries will be the focus/lift for widespread
precipitation, some of which could be locally heavy and result in
flash flooding over portions of Texas, Louisiana, and the ArkLaTex
region. With troughing established over the West Coast, storm
systems are expected to track along a quasi-stationary boundary
from the central/northern Rockies into the northern Plains, but
forecast spread is highest with this portion of the forecast.

While model guidance is reasonably clustered and agreeable for
much of the lower 48 for days 3-5 (Mon-Wed), there is considerable
uncertainty for the Western U.S. with the evolution of shortwave
energy coming out of the Gulf of Alaska and Eastern Pacific. This
then offers ample challenge with the timing and extent of height
falls working inland over the West mid-later next week. The WPC
medium range product suite is primarily derived from a composite
blend of the 06 UTC GFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and by days 6/7 the
less progressive and more amplified 06 UTC GEFS and 00 UTC ECMWF
ensemble means. Lo and behold the the latest 12 UTC models now
also show a strong trend toward amplification and slower
progression then that will be monitored for future forecast
cycles, but this trend seems reasonable considering the blocky
nature of the pattern.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The interaction of deep/moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico with
weakening surface boundaries up from the western/central Gulf
Coast and lingering upper troughing will continue to provide
episodes of heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding into
early-mid next week for portions of Texas, Louisiana, and
gradually northward across the ArkLaTex and Lower/Mid Mississippi
River Valley where the greatest risk area for several inches of
rainfall totals exists. Over time next week, the associated
surface trough is forecast to weaken and lift northward which will
bring numerous to widespread showers and thunderstorms to portions
of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions, although with lighter
rainfall amounts expected at this time. Meanwhile, diurnally
driven showers/storms will be possible eastward to the southern to
central Appalachians and parts of the Mid-Atlantic with the flow
around a strong Bermuda high. The West will remain dry aside from
some light precipitation for the Pacific Northwest and northern
Rockies.

The greatest temperature anomalies during the period are expected
to be across the northern tier of the CONUS where daytime highs
will range from 15F to 20+F above normal. Record highs will be
possible, especially across the Northeast Monday and Tuesday prior
to expected backdoor cold front passage. 12 UTC model trends for
more amplified upper flow downstream from the West Coast mid-later
next week may also act to prolong a threat of record conditions
over the north-central U.S. under a stronger upper ridge than
anticipated for this forecast package. This trend also blend wells
with the hot CPC week 2 forecast. The South will see normal to
even slightly below normal temperatures thanks to increased cloud
cover and precipitation chances while the West Coast will
experience slightly below normal readings in response to the
troughing in place over the region.

...Early season heatwave across the northern Plains will expand
into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend...

...Additional heavy rain expected to spread eastward into the
central Gulf Coast this weekend...

Impressive early season heat is expected to continue across much
of the northern tier of the U.S. into Saturday as a strong upper
level ridge dominates the weather pattern across the region.
Highs well into the 90s to near 100 degrees are likely to break
some old-standing records across portions of the Dakotas and
Minnesota Saturday afternoon.  Meanwhile, much cooler air
associated with an upper-level trough is moving into the Pacific
Northwest.  A cold front will move steadily eastward across the
northern Rockies tonight and could trigger some strong to severe
thunderstorms for the northern High Plains through tonight into
Saturday morning.  Cooler air behind the front will bring
temperatures down to normal levels for the northern High Plains on
Sunday.  However, the upper Midwest will remain hot on Sunday as
the heat expands eastward into the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic
this weekend where high temperatures in the low to mid 90s could
challenge some daily records.  Over the Mid-Atlantic, some
thunderstorms this afternoon into this evening may become severe.
Expect the rain chances to decrease during the weekend as a
surface trough tends to move toward and off the Mid-Atlantic coast.

Meanwhile, additional heavy rainfall is forecast for the western
half of the Gulf Coast region as an upper-level trough/low forms
over the southern Plains and interacts with tropical moisture from
the Gulf of Mexico.  The highest chance of heavy rain is expected
to be across coastal Texas through tonight but the heavy rain is
expected to shift toward Louisiana on Saturday as the upper trough
is forecast to lift toward the northeast.  By Sunday, the threat
of heavy rain could spread further inland across the lower
Mississippi Valley.  Total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches may result in
some instances of flooding especially across southern Louisiana
during the weekend.

Over the Pacific Northwest, damp and cool condition will return
for the weekend under cool and moist onshore flow associated with
the upper trough.  In contrast, it will remain quite warm across
the interior West with 100+ degree readings expected for the lower
elevations across the Desert Southwest.  Some scattered
thunderstorms are forecast across the Great Basin into this
evening, shifting into the central and southern Rockies during the
weekend, and possibly over the central to southern High Plains
Sunday afternoon.

...Much Above Normal Temperatures Continue Into Next Week Across
the Northern Plains to Northeast....
...Locally Heavy Rainfall Possible Next Week Across Lower/Mid
Mississippi...Tennessee...and Ohio Valleys...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The weather overview for the CONUS next week will be the
continuation of much above normal to near record warmth across the
northern tier of U.S., particularly across the northern Plains to
Northeast and New England. The other weather highlight will be the
threat of locally heavy rainfall throughout next week over
portions of the lower to middle Mississippi River Valley and
gradually spreading toward the Tennessee and lower Ohio River
Valleys.

The latest model guidance is in fairly good agreement with the
upper level pattern remaining amplified across the CONUS featuring
the western longwave trough while the strong Bermuda ridge holds.
Early on in the forecast period, a weakness in the trough over the
central U.S. will be the focus for some unsettled weather but that
is forecast to become absorbed or dissipate by the end of the
upcoming work week. The greatest model differences are after
Wednesday with the evolution of various shortwave troughs moving
through the longwave trough over the eastern Pacific into the
western U.S.. There are considerable timing issues between the
various deterministic models and the downstream effects reach the
Rockies and northern Plains as storm systems eject out. The WPC
blend incorporated the latest ECMWF/GFS/CMC early on then
transitioned over to mainly the latest GEFS/ECENS means to account
for some of the greater uncertainty out West.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The interaction of deep/moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico with
weakening surface boundaries up from the western/central Gulf
Coast and lingering upper troughing will continue to provide
episodes of heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding across the
ArkLaTex and Lower/Mid Mississippi River Valley where the greatest
risk area for several inches of rainfall totals exists. Over time
next week, the associated surface trough is forecast to weaken and
lift northward which will bring numerous to widespread showers and
thunderstorms to portions of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes
regions, which could produce some locally heavy rainfall.

The much above normal to near record warmth will continue across
the northern Plains to Northeast over the course of next week.
After Wednesday, some moderation is possible across the Northeast,
but the ridging over the Southeast U.S. and western trough should
provide additional periods of much above normal temperatures
across the Northern Plains through the week. The South will see
normal to even slightly below normal temperatures thanks to
increased cloud cover and precipitation chances while the West
Coast will experience slightly below normal readings in response
to the troughing in place over the region.

...Early season heatwave across the north-central states...

...Additional heavy rain for portions of the Gulf Coast...

Impressive early season heat is expected across much of the
northern tier of the U.S. on Saturday as a large upper level ridge
dominates the weather pattern across the Northern Plains and Upper
Midwest.  Highs well into the 90s and even low 100s are likely
from Montana to Minnesota, and this will likely challenge some
daily record highs.  Cooler weather arrives on Sunday as a cold
front brings readings down into the 70s and 80s for many of these
same areas, while 90s are likely again farther east across the
Upper Midwest.  It will also be quite warm across the Desert
Southwest with 100-110 degree readings expected for the lower
elevations.  It will not be as hot across Texas and the Deep South
owing to a weak upper low and abundant cloud cover and rainfall.

Another thing making weather headlines for the weekend will be
additional heavy rainfall across the central Gulf Coast region,
particularly across southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi.
Moisture rich flow from the Gulf of Mexico will intercept a weak
low level boundary over this region, and promote the development
of numerous showers and storms through Saturday, with the
potential for 2 to 5 inches of rain that may result in some
instances of flooding.  Heavy rain is also expected across the
ArkLaTex region in connection with the slow moving upper low, and
for the Cascades as a couple of Pacific disturbances pass through
the region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST ARIZONA AND SOUTHWEST
NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A broad upper ridge across the contiguous United States will weaken
slightly on Saturday, as a short-wave trough moves across the
interior Pacific Northwest and a cut-off low across the
south-central United States begins to open and lift northward. A
cold front associated with the Pacific Northwest trough will move
east-southeast through the forecast period, ending up stretched from
northern California east-northeast into central Wyoming by early
Sunday morning.

... Southeast Arizona Southwest New Mexico ...

Widespread critical fire weather conditions are possible across
portions of southern Arizona and New Mexico today. Guidance
continues to show a belt of increased lower-tropospheric flow moving
across the area from west to east in the presence of a deep,
well-mixed boundary layer. The result will be strong, gusty westerly
surface winds of up to 30 mph coincident with minimum afternoon
relative humidity falling into the 5-15% range.

... Great Basin to the Southwest and Surrounding Areas ...

As the aforementioned Pacific Northwest trough approaches the area,
mid-level flow will strengthen, particularly across the northern
Great Basin. The dry lower troposphere in place coupled with strong
diurnal heating will combine to support a deep, well-mixed boundary
layer this afternoon, resulting in surface relative humidity falling
into the 5-15% range. The resulting steep lower-tropospheric lapse
rates will support downward momentum transport. The result will be
several hours of winds around 20 mph. Across eastern portions of the
Great Basin, enough residual moisture may persist to allow for
afternoon thunderstorms, especially across portions of Utah.
However, overall coverage should be less than in recent days.

... Northern Rockies ...

Strong mid-level flow of at least 60 knots will overspread the
region tomorrow afternoon as the western upper trough moves through
the area. Downward momentum transport within a relatively dry
boundary layer will foster widespread 15-25 mph sustained westerly
surface winds and 15-25% RH.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN GREAT
BASIN...

...Synopsis...
The Pacific Northwest upper trough will begin to amplify on Sunday
in response to a stronger short-wave trough across the northeast
Pacific Ocean. As the broader trough responds, another in a series
of short-wave troughs will move through the Pacific Northwest upper
trough on Sunday, bringing enhanced mid-level flow. Another surface
cold front will push east-southeast on Sunday, ending up across
northern California, northern Nevada, and southeastern Idaho.

... Northern Great Basin ...

Strong diurnal heating within a dry lower troposphere will once
again result in a deep, well-mixed boundary layer on Sunday. This
will contribute to afternoon relative-humidity values falling into
the single digits to low teens. Additionally, downward momentum
transfer will support strong and gusty afternoon winds in the 20-30
mph range. The most likely area to experience sustained critical
fire-weather conditions on Sunday will be across far northern Nevada
where the overlap between strong diurnal heating and proximity to
enhanced mid-level flow associated with the short-wave trough is
maximized.

... Southeast Arizona and Southwest New Mexico ...

Widespread elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions will
be possible across portions of southern Arizona and New Mexico on
Sunday. Guidance continues to show a belt of increased
lower-tropospheric flow across the area -- albeit weaker than on
Saturday -- in the presence of a deep, well-mixed boundary layer.
The result will be strong, gusty westerly surface winds of up to 20
mph coincident with minimum afternoon relative humidity falling into
the 5-15% range.

... Northern Plains ...

Strong mid-level flow of at least 60 knots will overspread the
region tomorrow afternoon as the western upper trough continues to
move east along the United States-Canadian border. Downward momentum
transport within a relatively dry boundary layer will foster
widespread 15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds and 15-25% RH.

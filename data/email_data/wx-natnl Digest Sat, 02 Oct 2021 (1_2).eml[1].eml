NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1038 AM CDT Fri Oct 01 2021

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions
made. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 10/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1200 AM CDT Fri Oct 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level trough is forecast to move from the Four Corners
region this morning into the central/southern Plains through
tonight. Meanwhile, weak mid-level ridging across the western CONUS
is forecast to move eastward into the Great Basin and northern
Rockies in the wake of the Four Corners trough. As this occurs,
another weak trough will move quickly across the Northwest. At the
surface, a persistent area of weak surface high pressure over the
Great Basin will continue to promote dry offshore flow across
portions of southern California.

...Southern California...
Locally elevated fire weather conditions are possible (especially in
terrain favored areas) this morning into the early afternoon as the
aforementioned weak offshore downslope flow overlaps critical RH
values of 5-15% and at least modestly receptive fuels. Fire weather
conditions should improve during the afternoon with sustained/gusty
winds decreasing as the surface pressure gradient relaxes.

...Overview...

The latest guidance continues to highlight an amplification of the
medium range weather pattern next week. The flow should become
more blocky as an upper low closes off over the east-central U.S.
while an upper ridge/high builds over the northern tier states and
southern Canada. A leading wavy front and closed upper trough/low
support will spread rainfall of varying intensity and duration
across the eastern third of the country. Meanwhile an eastern
Pacific upper trough should steadily amplify and become more
elongated through the period, pushing a cold front into the
Northwest and California. An upper low initially offshore of
California will eject northeastward ahead of the upper trough and
may produce some areas of rainfall over the Four Corners
region/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The latest models and ensemble means generally agree on the
overall pattern evolution, but continue to show run to run
varability in the details. For the upper low dropping from the
Ohio Valley to the Southeast, exact placement continues to be an
issue, with the last two runs of the GFS showing a farther south
solution, and the ECMWF/UKMET/CMC favoring something farther
north. The ensemble means generally follow suit with their
deterministic counterpart, but do serve as an ok middle ground
solution. Meanwhile, the amplifying eastern Pacific upper trough
nearing the West Coast and leading closed low ejection from
offshore CA offer reasonable continuity, with some spread for how
the energy will be distributed and also overall timing of the
trough axis by late in the week.

This cycle of the WPC progs used a blend of the latest
deterministic guidance (which more weighting towards the ECMWF,
UKMET, and CMC over the GFS) for days 3-5, with increasing
ensemble mean contribution thereafter. This approach maintained
good continuity with the overnight WPC forecast.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany the wavy frontal
system that works across the eastern U.S. early next week and then
possibly stalls near the Southeast coast by midweek. Moderate to
locally heavy rainfall should linger over the Northeast on Monday,
with an increasing focus towards the Southwest, especially as the
upper low settles over the region. This should keep rainfall over
parts of the Southeast/East through much of next week with an
uncertain but gradual focus from the Southeast into the
Mid-Atlantic. The guidance continues to signal that some locations
could see significant totals, whether from an episode of heavy
rain and/or a multi-day accumulation due to persistence of the
pattern. Guidance variability and spread up to this point keep
confidence in specifics fairly low, but one area to monitor will
be the Southern Appalachians where terrain enhancement may be a
factor.

Expect the upper low ejecting northeastward into the West to
generate a period of rainfall over parts of the Southwest, Four
Corners, and parts of the Rockies mainly around Tuesday-Wednesday.
The front pushing into the Pacific Northwest and northern
California will spread areas of rain gradually southeastward with
time mid-later next week. Most activity should be in the
light-moderate range, but a few pockets of heavier rain could be
possible with snow in the higher elevations. The West Coast will
see moderately below normal daytime highs beginning around midweek
as the upper trough approaches and the cold front makes its way
through the region. Downstream upper ridging traversing the
north-central U.S. will support warmer than average temperatures
across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week with some plus
10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper 70s and 80s.
Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the emerging closed
upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the Southeast/East
should moderate daytime temperatures,  but should maintain decent
coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies for morning lows.

...Overview...

The latest guidance continues to highlight an amplification of the
medium range weather pattern next week. The flow should become
more blocky as an upper low closes off over the east-central U.S.
while an upper ridge/high builds over the northern tier states and
southern Canada. A leading wavy front and closed upper trough/low
support will spread rainfall of varying intensity and duration
across the eastern third of the country. Meanwhile an eastern
Pacific upper trough should steadily amplify and become more
elongated through the period, pushing a cold front into the
Northwest and California. An upper low initially offshore of
California will eject northeastward ahead of the upper trough and
may produce some areas of rainfall over the Four Corners
region/Rockies.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0124 PM CDT Fri Oct 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Latest guidance consensus suggests that a weak mid-level impulse
will traverse the Montana/Saskatchewan border tomorrow/Saturday,
promoting downslope flow along the lee of the Lewis/Flathead ranges
in northwest Montana. At the moment, it appears that coinciding 15+
mph sustained westerly winds and 15-25% RH will remain too localized
to support Elevated highlights at this time. However, an Elevated
area may need to be added in the upcoming Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
should RH trend lower in the latest guidance consensus.

Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track. Please see the
previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 10/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1201 AM CDT Fri Oct 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Weak troughing is forecast to move from the northern Great Basin
into the central/northern Rockies Day 2/Saturday as weak ridging
returns to the western CONUS. Large scale fire weather concerns are
forecast to remain low across much of the CONUS due to poor overlap
of low RH, stronger surface winds, and receptive fuels. The one
exception may be across southern California, where lingering weak
offshore flow is expected due to a persistent area of surface high
pressure over the Great Basin. However, weaker surface pressure
gradients are forecast than prior days, which suggests any fire
weather conditions should remain rather localized/brief.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 07 - 11 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement on =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. An enhanced Pacific jet is noted
across much of southern Alaska in between a trough forecast over eastern
Siberia and a ridge predicted south of the Alaska Peninsula. Farther to the
south, a trough near the West Coast of the CONUS is expected to push inland=
,
resulting in mean cyclonic flow across most of the western half of the CONU=
S
by
the end of the period. Strong ridging is forecast farther to the east acros=
s
much of northeastern North America. A trough is forecast to undercut this
ridge
over the Southeast throughout much of the period. The manual 500-hPa height
blend, based primarily on the ensemble means from the GEFS and ECMWF, depic=
ts
above normal heights across the northeastern quadrant of the CONUS, the
Southern Plains, and southwestern Alaska. Conversely, below normal heights =
are
favored for most of the western third of the CONUS,  parts of the Southeast=
,
and much of southeastern Alaska.

With strong ridging forecast over northeastern North America, above normal
temperatures are favored for the eastern CONUS, with probabilities exceedin=
g
70
percent across much of Great Lakes and Northeast. Enhanced above normal
temperature probabilities are relatively weak farther to the south across t=
he
Gulf Coast and Southeast region, due to a forecast weakness in the mean
subtropical ridge across the region. Above normal temperatures are likely f=
or
much of the Plains ahead of a trough predicted over the western CONUS. As t=
his
trough progresses inland, probabilities of below normal temperatures are
increased for most of the western third of the CONUS extending northward to
southeastern Alaska. Above normal temperatures are favored for southwestern
Alaska due to ridging predicted near the Alaska Peninsula, particularly ear=
ly
in the period.

An active pattern is likely for Alaska as an enhanced Pacific jet is foreca=
st
to set up across southern portions of the state. Therefore, probabilities o=
f
above normal precipitation are elevated across most of the state. Above nor=
mal
precipitation is also favored across much of the West Coast northeastward t=
o
the Northern Plains as a trough is forecast to push inland over the western
CONUS. As this trough progresses farther to the east, there is a potential =
for
moisture to be pulled northward across much of the east-central CONUS.
Therefore, above normal precipitation is slightly favored for the Middle an=
d
Upper Mississippi Valley. Conversely, below normal precipitation probabilit=
ies
are slightly elevated for northern New England due to predicted above norma=
l
500-hPa heights and mean surface high pressure. Above normal precipitation =
is
the most likely outcome farther to the south across most of the Eastern
Seaboard due to predicted mean onshore flow from the Atlantic. A drier than
normal pattern is likely for the southern High Plains and parts of the
Southwest, consistent with dynamical model guidance, and analogs from the
predicted 500-hPa height pattern.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 09 - 15 2021

During week-2, the 500-hPa flow pattern is generally forecast to become les=
s
amplified by the middle of the period, with potential re-amplification towa=
rd
the end of the period. An enhanced Pacific jet is forecast to persist acros=
s
southwestern Alaska into week-2. As time progresses, increased troughing is
noted across the state. The pattern is forecast to remain active across the
western CONUS as cyclonic flow is forecast to take hold from the West Coast=
 to
the Plains for much of the period. After an initial trough progresses eastw=
ard
toward the Plains by the middle of the period, most models predict a second
trough to reload and strengthen across the West Coast of North America duri=
ng
the latter half of week-2. As a result, strong downstream ridging predicted
over northeastern North America is initially forecast to weaken during the
middle of week-2 and then potentially re-amplify later in the period. An
undercutting trough across the Southeast is forecast to persist into early
week-2 and then lift northeastward offshore by the middle of the period. Th=
e
week-2 500-hPa manual height blend, based mostly on the GEFS and ECMWF
ensemble
means, features above normal heights from the northeastern CONUS to the
Southern Plains, as well as for the Aleutians. Below normal heights are mor=
e
likely over much of the western CONUS extending northward across the Alaska
Panhandle into much of Mainland Alaska.

With mean troughing expected to push eastward across the western CONUS, bel=
ow
normal temperatures are favored western third of the CONUS northward to
southeastern Alaska. Above normal temperatures are likely for most areas of
the
CONUS from the Plains eastward, ahead of the forecast trough.  Probabilitie=
s
of
above normal temperatures exceed 70 percent for parts of the eastern Great
Lakes and Northeast, associated with a strong ridge predicted over eastern
Canada. Milder than normal conditions are also slightly favored for parts o=
f
southwestern Mainland Alaska, associated with mean ridging forecast south o=
f
the Alaska Peninsula, particularly early in the period. A trend toward cold=
er
conditions is likely as time progresses, so probabilities of above normal
temperatures were reduced relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs=
 outlook.

An active pattern is likely to persist for much of Alaska as enhanced Pacif=
ic
flow is forecast to continue into week-2. Probabilities of above normal
precipitation are enhanced across most of the state. Farther to the south, =
as
mean cyclonic flow is forecast across the western CONUS, above normal
precipitation is favored from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern Plains.=
 As
a trough progresses eastward across the western CONUS toward the Plains,
increased moisture advection is possible for the east-central CONUS, leadin=
g
to
elevated chances for above normal precipitation across most of the Mississi=
ppi
Valley.  A drier than normal pattern is likely farther to the east across
parts
of  the northeastern CONUS, associated with predicted mean surface high
pressure. Mean onshore flow to the south of this surface high leads to
elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation across parts of the coastal
Southeast, particularly early in the period. Conversely, below normal
precipitation is slightly favored for parts of the southern High Plains and
Southwest supported by dynamical model guidance and the majority of analogs
constructed from the various model solutions.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 01 2021

SYNOPSIS: A 500-hPa trough is expected to develop in the western CONUS,
accompanied by an outbreak of anomalous cold that could last several days.
Nearly all models agree on these features.  That mid-level trough also rais=
es
the possibility of heavy snow in the higher elevations of the northern
Rockies,
Cascades, and Sierra Nevada, as well as strong winds farther east in the
Plains, but with less certainty due to model inconsistencies in strength,
position, and timing of the trough from day to day. Elsewhere, there is
significant model disagreement on three 500-hPa systems that could impact t=
he
United States: A mid-level low will likely cut off from the main circulatio=
n
and bring a period of unsettled weather to the middle Atlantic states or
southeastern CONUS, enhanced by subtropical storm interaction in some model
runs. This could bring heavy precipitation to at least part of the middle
Atlantic states and southeastern CONUS.  In Alaska, the progressive storm
systems will bring above-normal precipitation to much of Alaska, and
potentially strong winds to western parts of the state. But the models vary
significantly regarding details on the strength, timing, and position of al=
l
three systems, giving enough uncertainty to preclude posting week-2 hazards=
 at
this time.



HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the western U.S.=
,
Sat-Fri, Oct 9-15.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY OCTOBER 04 - FRIDAY OCTOBER 08:

hp__;!!DZ3fjg!u1bt59JQuscQ3OjNVTCc_MaKiPdr0RATNBTWbtE9M4S4wW-oYusJAFboZr2KX=
ZofBZgQ2S51$

FOR SATURDAY OCTOBER 09 - FRIDAY OCTOBER 15: Alaska could be affected by 2 =
or
3
storm systems tracking near or across the state. Like yesterday, models sho=
w
the strongest of these storms remaining above 970-hPa. Above-normal
precipitation and gusty winds will accompany these systems, with some areas=
 of
moderate to heavy snow likely. Given the expected strength of these systems
and
model disagreement on timing, hazardous weather does not seem likely across
the
state during the week-2 period. However, the evolution of the mid-level
systems
as they travel toward western Canada and CONUS could have a marked effect o=
n
weather in western sections of CONUS.



Ensemble means depict a slowly progressive 500-hPa pattern eastward through
North America during week-2. They show the strong anomalous ridge dominatin=
g
eastern North America drifting northeastward and slowly weakening while a
trough with negative 500-hPa height anomalies settles into the western CONU=
S.
This mean trough should keep a risk of anomalous cold in the interior
west-central and northwestern CONUS throughout the period, from the Cascade=
s
and Sierra Nevada eastward to the front range of the Rockies. A slight risk=
 of
much below normal temperatures is posted for areas of the West where the GE=
FS
and ECMWF reforecast tools depict minimum temperatures having at least a 20
percent chance of falling into the lowest 15th percentile and below freezin=
g.
Additionally, operational models and some individual ensemble members depic=
t a
more amplified weather pattern, bringing heavy higher-elevation snowfall to
some part of the interior West and strong winds to parts of the Plains. But
model inconsistencies regarding the timing, strength, and location of
individual mid-level systems dropping into the mean trough preclude the
placement of snow or wind hazards on the map at this time.



Models have come into better agreement that some sort of mid-level trough o=
r
cut-off low pressure system will affect the southeastern quarter of CONUS
during week-2. But as with the situation farther west, the models display a
wide array of solutions regarding timing, location, and strength in additio=
n
to
the resulting conditions in this region. The situation is additionally
complicated by the fact that a few models - mostly recent operational runs =
of
the GFS - bring a tropical or sub-tropical storm from the Caribbean northwa=
rd
toward the Southeast, which then interacts with the mid-level trough or clo=
sed
circulation. These drop excessive rainfall on parts of the Southeast or mid=
dle
Atlantic states, models that lack any tropical interaction and depict a wea=
ker
mid-level system - like the 00Z GEM - bring only moderate rainfall into
scattered areas at most. With so much model diversity, no week-2 hazards fo=
r
heavy rain or strong winds can be depicted at this time.



The storm systems potentially affecting Alaska, the western CONUS, and the
southeastern CONUS will continue to be scrutinized for increased model
consensus that would justify posting other week-2 hazards.

...Threat of heavy rain decreases by tonight across southeastern
Texas...

...Showers and thunderstorms across the Plains will progress
toward the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys through this weekend...

A slow-moving frontal boundary extending through the Great Plains
is forecast to move more quickly toward the east during the next
couple of days.   Moisture streaming north from the western Gulf
of Mexico will continue to support the threat of heavy rain across
southeastern Texas this afternoon into the evening.  By later
tonight, the upper-level trough over the southern High Plains is
forecast to lift further to the northeast and merge with another
upper trough drifting toward the Great Lakes.  This will end the
heavy rain threat over southeastern Texas later tonight as the
main energy associated with the entire system will shift into the
Ohio and Mississippi Valleys, where scattered showers and
thunderstorms are expected through much of this weekend.  Although
widespread excessive rainfall is not expected in these areas, some
localized heavy rainfall is possible with some of the stronger
thunderstorms.  By Sunday, showers and some thunderstorms are
expected to overspread the lower Great Lakes as well as
approaching the spine of the Appalachians.  New England should
also see a steady rain developing through the day on Sunday as a
back door cold front sneaks in ahead of a low pressure system
centered over the Great Lakes.

Temperatures will be above normal over the eastern half of the
country as return flow develops ahead of the low pressure and
frontal systems.  A nice stretch of fine weather along the East
Coast will extend into the weekend as the rain from the Ohio
Valley approaches.  Meanwhile, upper-level ridging ahead of the
next upper trough will allow the temperatures to be 10 to 20
degrees above average over parts of the northern Plains this
weekend.  In contrast, the temperatures over the southern Rockies
and southern High Plains will be slightly below average.
Elsewhere, Air Quality Alerts are in effect over parts of the San
Joaquin Valley through Sunday.

422 PM EDT Fri Oct 01 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Oct 04 2021 - 12Z Fri Oct 08 2021

...Overview...

The latest guidance continues to highlight an amplification of the
medium range weather pattern next week. The flow should become
more blocky as an upper low closes off over the east-central U.S.
while an upper ridge/high builds over the northern tier states and
southern Canada. A leading wavy front and closed upper trough/low
support will spread rainfall of varying intensity and duration
across the eastern third of the country. Meanwhile an eastern
Pacific upper trough should steadily amplify and become more
elongated through the period, pushing a cold front into the
Northwest and California. An upper low initially offshore of
California will eject northeastward ahead of the upper trough and
may produce some areas of rainfall over the Four Corners
region/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The latest models and ensemble means generally agree on the
overall pattern evolution, but continue to show run to run
varability in the details. For the upper low dropping from the
Ohio Valley to the Southeast, exact placement continues to be an
issue, with the last two runs of the GFS showing a farther south
solution, and the ECMWF/UKMET/CMC favoring something farther
north. The ensemble means generally follow suit with their
deterministic counterpart, but do serve as an ok middle ground
solution. Meanwhile, the amplifying eastern Pacific upper trough
nearing the West Coast and leading closed low ejection from
offshore CA offer reasonable continuity, with some spread for how
the energy will be distributed and also overall timing of the
trough axis by late in the week.

This cycle of the WPC progs used a blend of the latest
deterministic guidance (which more weighting towards the ECMWF,
UKMET, and CMC over the GFS) for days 3-5, with increasing
ensemble mean contribution thereafter. This approach maintained
good continuity with the overnight WPC forecast.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany the wavy frontal
system that works across the eastern U.S. early next week and then
possibly stalls near the Southeast coast by midweek. Moderate to
locally heavy rainfall should linger over the Northeast on Monday,
with an increasing focus towards the Southwest, especially as the
upper low settles over the region. This should keep rainfall over
parts of the Southeast/East through much of next week with an
uncertain but gradual focus from the Southeast into the
Mid-Atlantic. The guidance continues to signal that some locations
could see significant totals, whether from an episode of heavy
rain and/or a multi-day accumulation due to persistence of the
pattern. Guidance variability and spread up to this point keep
confidence in specifics fairly low, but one area to monitor will
be the Southern Appalachians where terrain enhancement may be a
factor.

Expect the upper low ejecting northeastward into the West to
generate a period of rainfall over parts of the Southwest, Four
Corners, and parts of the Rockies mainly around Tuesday-Wednesday.
The front pushing into the Pacific Northwest and northern
California will spread areas of rain gradually southeastward with
time mid-later next week. Most activity should be in the
light-moderate range, but a few pockets of heavier rain could be
possible with snow in the higher elevations. The West Coast will
see moderately below normal daytime highs beginning around midweek
as the upper trough approaches and the cold front makes its way
through the region. Downstream upper ridging traversing the
north-central U.S. will support warmer than average temperatures
across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week with some plus
10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper 70s and 80s.
Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the emerging closed
upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the Southeast/East
should moderate daytime temperatures,  but should maintain decent
coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies for morning lows.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1239 AM CDT Sat Oct 02 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A closed upper-level low will propagate through the Southern Plains
and merge with a mid-level trough positioned over the north-central
CONUS. Meanwhile, an upper-level ridge will take hold across the
West, with a zone of enhanced mid-level flow entering the northern
periphery of the Pacific Northwest. At the surface, localized
elevated fire-weather conditions may develop across portions of
north-central Montana and across western areas of the Dakotas, where
surface winds approaching 15 mph should develop by mid afternoon
amid RH values approaching the low 20s and perhaps upper teens in a
few locations. Otherwise, dry conditions and light surface winds
should prevail across much of the West, resulting in minimal
fire-weather concerns.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge positioned over the West is forecast to become
more amplified throughout the forecast period. This should result in
a predominately light/variable flow regime aloft, with any
appreciable mid-level flow being confined to the far northern areas
of the Pacific Northwest and into parts of southern Canada.
Consequently, dry conditions and light surface winds are expected at
the surface in most areas, with perhaps localized elevated
fire-weather conditions once again possible across portions of
north-central Montana during the afternoon as winds approach 15 mph
amid RH values falling into the low 20s.

...Southeast/Southern Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic Heavy Rain Threat
with a Blocky Closed Low...


...Overview...

Models and ensembles herald an amplification of the medium range
weather pattern next week. The flow should become more blocky as
an upper low closes off over the east-central U.S. while an upper
ridge/high builds over the northern tier states and southern
Canada. A leading wavy front and closed upper trough/low support
will spread rainfall of varying intensity and duration across the
eastern third of the country. Meanwhile an eastern Pacific upper
trough should steadily amplify and become more elongated through
the period, pushing a cold front into the Northwest and
California. A lead upper low initially offshore of California will
eject northeastward ahead of the upper trough and may produce some
areas of rainfall over the Southwest/Four Corners region/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance generally agrees on the overall pattern amplification,
but show varability with pesky embedded features. For the upper
low dropping from the Ohio Valley to the Southeast, placement
continues to vary some from run to run. Meanwhile, an amplifying
eastern Pacific upper trough nearing the West Coast and leading
closed low ejection from offshore CA offer reasonable larger scale
continuity, albeit with increasing forecast spread for how the
energy will be distributed and also overall timing of the trough
axis into late next week.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the reasonably compatible runs from the 18 UTC
GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National
Blend of Models for Days 3-5 (Tue-Thu) and WPC continuity. This
composite has good ensemble support. Growing model forecast spread
suggest a quick transition toward the ECMWF ensemble mean days
6/7, with only limited input from the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian models.
ECMWF ensembles are more amplified than the GEFS/NAEFS and that
seems to better fit the overall increasingly blocky nature of the
flow. The latest 00 UTC guidance offers similar variances and more
detail differences, but a blend would remain in line.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany a wavy frontal
system that slows across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic next week,
with enhanced focus as a closed upper low works over the region.
This should keep rainfall over parts of the Southeast/East through
much of next week, with an uncertain but gradual focus from the
Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic. The guidance continues to signal
that some locations could see some significant local totals,
whether from an episode of heavy rain and/or a multi-day
accumulation due to persistence of the pattern. Guidance
variability and spread up to this point keep confidence in
specifics fairly low, but one area to monitor will be the Southern
Appalachians where terrain enhancement will be a factor.

A lead upper low ejecting northeastward into the West is expected
to generate a period of rainfall over parts of the Southwest, Four
Corners, and parts of the Rockies mainly around Tuesday-Wednesday.
A subsequent and wavy cold front digging slowly but robustly into
the West will spread areas of rain gradually southeastward with
time into mid-later next week. Most activity should be in the
light-moderate range, but a few pockets of heavier rain could be
possible along with snow in the higher elevations. The West Coast
will see moderately below normal daytime highs beginning around
midweek as the upper trough approaches and the cold front makes
its way through the region. Downstream upper ridging traversing
the north-central U.S. will support warmer than average
temperatures across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week
with some plus 10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper
70s and 80s. Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the
emerging closed upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the
Southeast/East should moderate daytime temperatures, but should
maintain decent coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies for
morning lows.

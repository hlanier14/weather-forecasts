Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1019 AM CST Wed Jan 12 2022

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (please see below) remains on track, with no
additions or changes made.

..Squitieri.. 01/12/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CST Wed Jan 12 2022/

...Synopsis...
An amplified mid/upper-level ridge will persist over the western
CONUS, while a belt of strong northwesterly midlevel flow
overspreads the Missouri Valley. At the surface, high pressure will
remain centered over the Intermountain West, with broad/weak surface
troughing encompassing much of the central states.

...Southern High Plains...
Subsidence-induced drying along the southern periphery of the strong
northwesterly midlevel flow combined with diurnal heating/mixing
will foster critically low RH across portions of the southern High
Plains this afternoon. With that said, a weak surface pressure
gradient across the region should limit the overall fire-weather
threat. The one exception may be in the lee of the higher terrain
across east-central New Mexico, where breezy terrain-enhanced winds
may overlap the dry boundary-layer conditions for a few hours.
However, the threat appears too localized to introduce an Elevated
area at this time.

...Wintry weather is becoming increasingly likely from parts of
the Tennessee Valley into the East this weekend into early next
week, but with plenty of uncertainty...


...Overview...

The most notable weather feature during the medium range period,
and one of the most uncertain, is a developing surface low
pressure system that slides across the Southeast and then pivots
northward near the East Coast ahead of a potent mid-upper
shortwave trough. Uncertainty in specific impacts and weather type
remain high, but overall guidance continues to trend toward a low
pressure system possibly inland or at least near enough to the
East Coast to cause impactful wintry weather. Meanwhile in the
West, mainly dry conditions are expected underneath surface high
pressure, with the exception of light precipitation in the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies as weak fronts track through.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest 00z/06z (and incoming 12z guidance) continues to show
fairly good agreement on the large scale pattern across the CONUS,
with plenty of lingering uncertainty in some impactful details.
The main system to note is a strong shortwave tracking across the
central Plains and into the Southeast this weekend before it
pivots near the East Coast by Monday. This will induce
cyclogenesis at the surface with better agreement, compared to
previous days, in a surface low moving through the Southeast and
deepening as it lifts up near the East Coast. There remains some
placement differences in the surface low, especially in the East
around day 5, but overall, much of the guidance continues to trend
farther west, now bringing the low over or even inland from the
East Coast by early Monday. The GFS (including todays 12z run) has
consistently been the farthest west with the low amongst the
deterministic solutions, although its hard to call it an outlier
just yet given the latest trends with the new incoming 12z
guidance. On the other side, the UKMET is more suppressed to the
south and a look at the ensemble guidance from the GEFS and ECENS
shows plenty of uncertainty in exact low placement but members are
tending to cluster at this point somewhere in between the GFS and
UKMET. Both the 00z ECMWF and CMC (and the new 12z runs) are a
little closer to the ensembles and thus a preferred starting point
for the WPC forecast at this time. This led to a surface low over
southern New Jersey which is pretty close to previous WPC
continuity. It should, however, be stressed that the energy
leading to this potent shortwave is still out in the Pacific Ocean
at this time thus, data sampling is poor. As the energy reaches
the Northwest U.S. and encounters more observations, additional
shifts (potentially large) in the models are likely.

Elsewhere, ridging is likely to have hold of the West this
weekend, other than a meandering southern stream upper low
centered offshore of California. This feature is forecast to track
eastward early in the workweek and join with the main flow, and
possibly interact with northern stream energy entering the Pacific
Northwest around Monday. Model agreement for this overall pattern
was fairly good, but with increasing differences especially with
embedded shortwaves as the period progressed. Energy progresses
downstream early next week with some uncertainty in amplitude
across the Great Lakes next Tuesday into Wednesday, and potential
interaction with lingering energy from the East Coast low.

The blend for the updated WPC medium range forecast used a general
model consensus (leaning more towards the ECMWF) for days 3-4.
After that, began incorporating some modest amounts of the
ensemble means to help temper the late period uncertainties.
Overall, this led to a fairly consistent forecast with the
overnight WPC package.


...Weather Highlights...

The surface low lifting from the Lower Mississippi Valley, across
the Southeast, and up the East Coast will bring with it a full
array of weather hazards and threats. On the north side of the
initial system on Saturday, there could be some potential for
wintry weather across parts of the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee and Kentucky on Saturday, but confidence in amounts
is low given the surface low will not have consolidated by that
point. More concerning chances for heavy snow are likely in the
southern Appalachians beginning Saturday, spreading northward
along/on the backside of the deepening low and generally west of
the I-95 corridor in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. Chances
are also increasing for a potentially significant icing event,
especially from parts of far northern Georgia, through the western
Carolinas, and into south-central VA where warm and moist Gulf of
Mexico inflow will overrun initially cold air at the surface. WPC
has both the snow and ice threats highlighted in todays hazard
outlook. To the south, moderately to locally heavy rain could move
across the Southeast this weekend, and possibly up the immediate
East Coast Sunday into Monday. Gusty winds surrounding the surface
low may create high waves off the coast leading to possible
coastal flood concerns along the Northeast coastline. Of course,
all of this is highly dependent on the exact track of the surface
low and even small adjustments back to the east could bring heavy
snow potential into even coastal parts of the East.

Elsewhere, after the low exits northeast of the U.S. on Tuesday,
westerly flow and another shortwave should may bring favorable
conditions for lake effect/enhanced snow over the Great Lakes. The
West could see some light precipitation during the period,
particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern
Rockies early next week, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.
Rain could develop again across the Lower Mississippi Valley
beginning Tuesday with return flow from the Gulf of Mexico.

Temperature-wise, much below normal temperatures (-15 to -30F) is
forecast for the Northeast over the weekend, with slightly cooler
than average weather through early next week for the southeastern
quadrant of the country. Temperatures should generally be above
average in the Plains particularly from Sunday onward after a
cooler day Saturday. The West should see temperatures within about
5-10 degrees of normal, with a tendency toward slightly warmer
than average conditions especially for morning lows.

...Wintry weather is becoming increasingly likely from parts of
the Tennessee Valley into the East this weekend into early next
week, but with plenty of uncertainty...


...Overview...

The most notable weather feature during the medium range period,
and one of the most uncertain, is a developing surface low
pressure system that slides across the Southeast and then pivots
northward near the East Coast ahead of a potent mid-upper
shortwave trough. Uncertainty in specific impacts and weather type
remain high, but overall guidance continues to trend toward a low
pressure system possibly inland or at least near enough to the
East Coast to cause impactful wintry weather. Meanwhile in the
West, mainly dry conditions are expected underneath surface high
pressure, with the exception of light precipitation in the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies as weak fronts track through.

..Squitieri.. 01/12/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0203 AM CST Wed Jan 12 2022/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale mid/upper-level ridge will remain in place across the
Intermountain West during the first half of the Day 2 period, prior
to breaking down in response to an approaching midlevel trough. This
pattern will continue to support dry/subsident northwesterly flow
across the southern Plains, where a weak surface pressure gradient
will persist for the first half of the period.

...Southern High Plains...
Similar to Wednesday, the dry/subsident northwesterly midlevel flow,
combined with diurnal heating, will result in the development of
critically low RH across a large portion of the southern High Plains
during the afternoon hours. However, the surface pressure gradient
will be weak where the most substantial RH reductions occur,
generally limiting fire-weather concerns.

FOR THURSDAY JANUARY 20 - WEDNESDAY JANUARY 26: There is good agreement amo=
ng
the model guidance in predicting broad 500-hPa troughing over the central a=
nd
eastern CONUS, with ridging forecast upstream, centered over the Northeast
Pacific. This pattern favors anomalous northwesterly mid-level flow over th=
e
CONUS, which will act to bring waves of Arctic air southward out of Canada.
Initially, the coldest air is forecast across portions of the Upper Midwest
and
western Great Lakes as surface high pressure moves over the region. A high
risk
for much below normal temperatures is posted for Jan 20 over parts of the
Northern Pains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes, with a
second wave of cold air expected a few days later, which will reinforce the
cold air mass in the same areas Jan 23-25. The ECMWF reforecast tool depict=
s a
40-60 percent chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percent=
ile
across the high risk areas. Although the probabilities in the GEFS reforeca=
st
tool are lower (20-40 percent), uncalibrated guidance from both the 0z GEFS
and
ECMWF ensembles indicate negative minimum temperature anomalies of at least
-10
to -15 deg F. This translates to temperatures falling below 0 deg F over pa=
rts
of the highlighted region, and below -10 deg F across portions of North Dak=
ota
and northern Minnesota. Week-2 reforecast tools also indicate at least 40%
chance of minimum temperatures falling below -20 deg F across parts of
northern
Minnesota. Although the reforecast tool probabilities are slightly lower th=
an
usual for a high risk, it was justified due to the favorable synoptic set-u=
p,
and good agreement among the model guidance, combined with it being the
coldest
time of year climatologically.



During the early to middle part of week-2, the anomalous cold is favored to
spread southward to the Gulf Coast and eastward to the Eastern Seaboard. A
moderate risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for parts of the
Northern Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley,
Tennessee Valley, Northeast, and parts of the Southeast for all of week-2,
with
the southward expansion into the Tennessee Valley and Southeast taking plac=
e
near the middle of the period. Temperatures in the single digits and teens
(deg
F) are possible over parts of the Ohio Valley and Northeast, in addition to
subzero temperatures continuing across the Upper Midwest. An active storm
track
in the East prior to and during week-2 may also increase the snow pack over
parts of the Northeast, which favors larger negative temperature anomalies.=
 A
slight risk for much below normal temperatures is posted for much of the CO=
NUS
east of the Rockies for all of week-2 given the potential for the anomalous
cold to continue to expand as far south as the Gulf Coast. While positive
temperature anomalies across the Central and Southern Plains and Southeast =
are
favored early in the period, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depic=
t
elevated probabilities (at least 40 percent) of subfreezing temperatures
reaching parts of the Gulf Coast states and Southeast by the end of week-2.
Frost concerns are also elevated for many areas near and along the Gulf Coa=
st.



During the early part of week-2, models continue to depict enhanced
precipitation along a frontal boundary draped across the Deep South,
warranting
a slight risk for heavy precipitation on Jan 20. By day 9 (Jan 21), energy
from
a southern stream disturbance is predicted to be picked up by the broad tro=
ugh
forecast over the central and eastern CONUS. Surface low pressure is favore=
d
to
build across southern Texas before propagating eastward and dissipating nea=
r
the Louisiana coast Jan 21-22. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
indicate at least a 20 percent chance for 3-day precipitation totals exceed=
ing
the 85th climatological percentile and 1-inch over some areas supporting a
slight risk for heavy precipitation over the Lower Mississippi Valley,
Tennessee Valley, and Southeast on Jan 20. For the area extending from
Southern
Texas to southwestern Louisiana (Jan 21-22), there is a 20-30% chance 3-day
precipitation amounts will exceed the 85th percentile, with slight spatial
offsets in the highest probabilities in the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools=
.



During the first four days of week-2 (Jan 20-23), the synoptic pattern is
favorable for persistent northwesterly flow across the northeastern CONUS. =
The
persistent northwesterly flow coupled with above normal water temperatures =
in
the Great Lakes indicates an increased likelihood for heavy snow across the
region. This potential is further enhanced by a couple of low pressure syst=
ems
that are forecast to move across these areas during the first half of week-=
2.
As such, a slight risk for heavy snow is posted for the Upper Midwest, Grea=
t
Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Northeast Jan 20-23.



Toward the end of week-2, the strong southward push of the arctic air mass
into
the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS increases the potential for low pressur=
e
to
develop along the base and leading edge of the trough axis and intensify ov=
er
the Atlantic Ocean. This increases the risk of high winds along coastal are=
as
of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. However, there is increased uncertainty =
in
the timing of development and the track of a potential low pressure system,=
 so
no wind hazards are posted at this time for the CONUS.



Anomalous ridging and surface high pressure is forecast across the Northeas=
t
Pacific and Alaska during week-2, promoting increased southerly flow across
Alaska. Additionally, troughing and associated surface low pressure forecas=
t
over the north-central Pacific is forecast to move closer to Alaska, which
will
result in a tightening of the pressure gradients and an enhancement of the
southerly flow, both at the mid-levels and the surface. The GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools depict some areas along the southern coast of the Mainland
and
the northern Panhandle having at least a 20 percent chance of 3-day
precipitation exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 2-inches
throughout the period. Therefore a slight risk of heavy precipitation is
posted
along the southern coast of Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula, and the
northern Alaska Panhandle for the entirety of week-2. An accompanying sligh=
t
risk of high winds is also posted for the entire week-2 period for the same
areas, but extends farther west to include the eastern Aleutians, supported=
 by
the ECMWF reforecast tool, which depicts at least a 20% chance of wind spee=
ds
exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 25-mph over these areas.

...Wintry mix from the Great Lakes to the Northeast, with more
rain and mountain snow for the Northwest...

...Seasonably mild and tranquil conditions Thursday across central
and southern portions of the country...

...Winter storm to bring heavy snow to the Northern Plains and
Midwest Thursday night and Friday...

The short-range forecast period (Wednesday Evening through Friday
Evening) begins with two storm systems bringing wintry
precipitation to the Great Lakes and Northeast, with rain and
mountain snow for the Northwest.  A series of waves of low
pressure along a stationary frontal boundary draped along the
U.S.-Canadian border from Maine southwest to the Great Lakes and
into the Midwest will bring snow showers to the region Wednesday
night into Thursday morning. The front will begin to meander
further south on Thursday, with a light wintry mix expanding down
to the Ohio Valley and Appalachians. A stronger cold front over
Canada will sweep south behind this front on Friday, bringing
cooler temperatures and snow showers to New England. In the
Northwest, a Pacific storm system will approach the coast on
Thursday with lower elevation rain and mountain snow for the
Cascades expected through Thursday Morning. The snow will expand
into the Northern Rockies Thursday and Thursday night. Forecast
rain and snow totals both look to remain on the lighter side.

Meanwhile, most of the central and southern portions of the
country will seasonably mild and tranquil conditions south of the
storm systems to the north. Highs on Thursday will be above normal
for most, with the greatest anomalies centered over the Central
and Southern Plains where 60s and 70s will be common. Highs will
range from the 40s and 50s in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic to
the 60s in the Southeast, with 70s in the Southwest. A series of
cold fronts will bring temperatures down about 5-10 degrees and
closer to normal from the East Coast to the Central Plains Friday
while Texas and the Southwest continue to see highs in the 70s.

Higher impact winter weather returns Thursday night into Friday
for the Northern Plains and Midwest as a strong storm system
develops in the lee of the central Rockies and begins to track
eastward. The snow will begin first for the Northern Plains
Thursday evening and quickly spread southward to the
Mid-Mississippi Valley by Friday afternoon. The heaviest snow
totals look to be centered from northeastern South Dakota
southeastward through southwestern Minnesota and into central
Iowa, with Winter Storm Watches already in effect. Storm total
accumulations of 4-8 inches are likely, with locally higher
amounts looking increasingly possible. Gusty winds may also lead
to periods of blowing snow. Areas in the surrounding region from
the central Plains to the Ohio Valley will also see a wintry mix
of snow, sleet, and rain on Friday, transitioning to all snow from
south to north overnight Friday.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 18 - 22 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in very good agreemen=
t in predicting an
amplified
500-hPa circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions
during
the 6-10 day period. An amplified trough is forecast near the western
Aleutians
expanding northward into the Bering Sea, with associated below normal 500-h=
Pa
heights. Downstream, anomalous ridging is predicted by the ensemble means o=
ver
Mainland Alaska, the Gulf of Alaska, and near the West Coast of the CONUS,
with
positive 500-hPa height anomalies forecast across these regions. Anomalous
troughing and associated near to below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast
over
most of the central an eastern CONUS.

A ridge forecast near the West Coast favors elevated probabilities for near=
 to
above normal temperatures for the western CONUSand Southern Plains. Near to
below normal temperatures are favored over most of the eastern CONUS, North=

Plains, and Great Lakes due to forecast troughing and below normal 500-hPa
heights. Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over most of
southern Alaska, underneath above normal 500-hPa heights and also associate=

precipitation is also favored eastward across the Central Plains to parts o=
f
the Ohio Valley behind a forecast mean trough. Above normal precipitation i=

Lakes Region due to the frontal activity over the regions. Additionally,
probabilities of above normal precipitation are elevated for parts of the
Southern Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast, and most of the
East
Coast, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Forecast low-level
onshore flow leads to increased chances of above normal precipitation over
central and southern Alaska, while below normal precipitation is favored fo=

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 20 - 26 2022

A highly amplified mid-level 500-hPa pattern is forecast to continue into
week-2. Anomalous ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights remain favored f=
or
the period as a whole over most of Alaska and the West Coast of the CONUS.
Troughing and associated below normal mid-level heights are forecast across
most of the central and eastern CONUS.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored over most of the western CONU=
S
due to forecast ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights. Forecast troughin=
g
and below normal 500-hPa heights over the central and eastern CONUS favor
elevated probabilities of below normal temperatures for much of the central
and
eastern CONUS. Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over
Alaska,
underneath an anomalous ridge and also associated with predicted low-level
southerly flow.

Below normal precipitation is favored across most of the western quarter of
the
CONUS, under the predicted above normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are also enhanced eastward across parts of the
Plains and the Ohio Valley behind a forecast mean trough. Above normal
precipitation is favored for the Northern High Plains due to forecast front=

...Wintry mix from the Great Lakes to the Northeast, with more
rain and mountain snow for the Northwest...

...Seasonably mild and tranquil conditions Thursday across central
and southern portions of the country...

...Winter storm to bring heavy snow to the Northern Plains and
Midwest Thursday night and Friday...

The short-range forecast period (Wednesday Evening through Friday
Evening) begins with two storm systems bringing wintry
precipitation to the Great Lakes and Northeast, with rain and
mountain snow for the Northwest.  A series of waves of low
pressure along a stationary front draped along the U.S.-Canadian
border from Maine southwest to the Great Lakes and into the
Midwest will bring snow showers to the region Wednesday night into
Thursday morning. The front will begin to meander further south
during the day Thursday, with a light wintry mix expanding down to
the Ohio Valley and Appalachians. A stronger cold front over
Canada will sweep south behind this front on Friday, bringing
cooler temperatures and snow showers to New England. In the
Northwest, a Pacific storm system will approach the coast late
Wednesday evening with lower elevation rain and mountain snow for
the Cascades expected through Thursday Morning. The snow will
expand into the Northern Rockies Thursday and Thursday night.
Forecast rain and snow totals both look to remain on the lighter
side.

Meanwhile, most of the central and southern portions of the
country will seasonably mild and tranquil conditions south of the
storm systems to the north. Highs on Thursday will be above normal
for most, with the greatest anomalies centered over the Central
and Southern Plains where 60s and 70s will be common. Highs will
range from the 40s and 50s in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic to
the 60s in the Southeast, with 70s in the Southwest. A series of
cold fronts will bring temperatures down about 5-10 degrees and
closer to normal from the East Coast to the Central Plains Friday,
while Texas and the Southwest continue to see highs in the 70s.

Higher impact winter weather returns Thursday night into Friday
for the Northern Plains and Midwest as a strong storm system
develops in the lee of the Central Rockies and begins to track
eastward. The snow will begin first for the Northern Plains
Thursday evening and quickly spread southward to the
Mid-Mississippi Valley by Friday morning. The heaviest snow totals
look to be centered from northeastern South Dakota southeastward
through southwestern Minnesota and into central Iowa, where Winter
Storm Watches are in effect. Storm total accumulations of 4-8
inches are likely, with locally higher amounts looking
increasingly possible. Gusty winds may also lead to periods of
blowing snow. Areas in the surrounding region from the Central
Plains to the Ohio Valley will also see a wintry mix of snow,
sleet, and rain on Friday, transitioning to all snow from north to
south overnight Friday.

...Wintry weather is becoming increasingly likely from parts of
the Tennessee Valley into the East this weekend into early next
week, but with plenty of uncertainty...


...Overview...

The most notable weather feature during the medium range period,
and one of the most uncertain, is a developing surface low
pressure system that slides across the Southeast and then pivots
northward near the East Coast ahead of a potent mid-upper
shortwave trough. Uncertainty in specific impacts and weather type
remain high, but overall guidance continues to trend toward a low
pressure system possibly inland or at least near enough to the
East Coast to cause impactful wintry weather. Meanwhile in the
West, mainly dry conditions are expected underneath surface high
pressure, with the exception of light precipitation in the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies as weak fronts track through.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest 00z/06z (and incoming 12z guidance) continues to show
fairly good agreement on the large scale pattern across the CONUS,
with plenty of lingering uncertainty in some impactful details.
The main system to note is a strong shortwave tracking across the
central Plains and into the Southeast this weekend before it
pivots near the East Coast by Monday. This will induce
cyclogenesis at the surface with better agreement, compared to
previous days, in a surface low moving through the Southeast and
deepening as it lifts up near the East Coast. There remains some
placement differences in the surface low, especially in the East
around day 5, but overall, much of the guidance continues to trend
farther west, now bringing the low over or even inland from the
East Coast by early Monday. The GFS (including todays 12z run) has
consistently been the farthest west with the low amongst the
deterministic solutions, although its hard to call it an outlier
just yet given the latest trends with the new incoming 12z
guidance. On the other side, the UKMET is more suppressed to the
south and a look at the ensemble guidance from the GEFS and ECENS
shows plenty of uncertainty in exact low placement but members are
tending to cluster at this point somewhere in between the GFS and
UKMET. Both the 00z ECMWF and CMC (and the new 12z runs) are a
little closer to the ensembles and thus a preferred starting point
for the WPC forecast at this time. This led to a surface low over
southern New Jersey which is pretty close to previous WPC
continuity. It should, however, be stressed that the energy
leading to this potent shortwave is still out in the Pacific Ocean
at this time thus, data sampling is poor. As the energy reaches
the Northwest U.S. and encounters more observations, additional
shifts (potentially large) in the models are likely.

Elsewhere, ridging is likely to have hold of the West this
weekend, other than a meandering southern stream upper low
centered offshore of California. This feature is forecast to track
eastward early in the workweek and join with the main flow, and
possibly interact with northern stream energy entering the Pacific
Northwest around Monday. Model agreement for this overall pattern
was fairly good, but with increasing differences especially with
embedded shortwaves as the period progressed. Energy progresses
downstream early next week with some uncertainty in amplitude
across the Great Lakes next Tuesday into Wednesday, and potential
interaction with lingering energy from the East Coast low.

The blend for the updated WPC medium range forecast used a general
model consensus (leaning more towards the ECMWF) for days 3-4.
After that, began incorporating some modest amounts of the
ensemble means to help temper the late period uncertainties.
Overall, this led to a fairly consistent forecast with the
overnight WPC package.


...Weather Highlights...

The surface low lifting from the Lower Mississippi Valley, across
the Southeast, and up the East Coast will bring with it a full
array of weather hazards and threats. On the north side of the
initial system on Saturday, there could be some potential for
wintry weather across parts of the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee and Kentucky on Saturday, but confidence in amounts
is low given the surface low will not have consolidated by that
point. More concerning chances for heavy snow are likely in the
southern Appalachians beginning Saturday, spreading northward
along/on the backside of the deepening low and generally west of
the I-95 corridor in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. Chances
are also increasing for a potentially significant icing event,
especially from parts of far northern Georgia, through the western
Carolinas, and into south-central VA where warm and moist Gulf of
Mexico inflow will overrun initially cold air at the surface. WPC
has both the snow and ice threats highlighted in todays hazard
outlook. To the south, moderately to locally heavy rain could move
across the Southeast this weekend, and possibly up the immediate
East Coast Sunday into Monday. Gusty winds surrounding the surface
low may create high waves off the coast leading to possible
coastal flood concerns along the Northeast coastline. Of course,
all of this is highly dependent on the exact track of the surface
low and even small adjustments back to the east could bring heavy
snow potential into even coastal parts of the East.

Elsewhere, after the low exits northeast of the U.S. on Tuesday,
westerly flow and another shortwave should may bring favorable
conditions for lake effect/enhanced snow over the Great Lakes. The
West could see some light precipitation during the period,
particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern
Rockies early next week, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.
Rain could develop again across the Lower Mississippi Valley
beginning Tuesday with return flow from the Gulf of Mexico.

Temperature-wise, much below normal temperatures (-15 to -30F) is
forecast for the Northeast over the weekend, with slightly cooler
than average weather through early next week for the southeastern
quadrant of the country. Temperatures should generally be above
average in the Plains particularly from Sunday onward after a
cooler day Saturday. The West should see temperatures within about
5-10 degrees of normal, with a tendency toward slightly warmer
than average conditions especially for morning lows.

...Wintry weather is becoming increasingly likely from parts of
the Tennessee Valley into the East this weekend into early next
week, but with plenty of uncertainty...


...Overview...

The most notable weather feature during the medium range period,
and one of the most uncertain, is a developing surface low
pressure system that slides across the Southeast and then pivots
northward near the East Coast ahead of a potent mid-upper
shortwave trough. Uncertainty in specific impacts and weather type
remain high, but overall guidance continues to trend toward a low
pressure system possibly inland or at least near enough to the
East Coast to cause impactful wintry weather. Meanwhile in the
West, mainly dry conditions are expected underneath surface high
pressure, with the exception of light precipitation in the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies as weak fronts track through.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest 00z/06z (and incoming 12z guidance) continues to show
fairly good agreement on the large scale pattern across the CONUS,
with plenty of lingering uncertainty in some impactful details.
The main system to note is a strong shortwave tracking across the
central Plains and into the Southeast this weekend before it
pivots near the East Coast by Monday. This will induce
cyclogenesis at the surface with better agreement, compared to
previous days, in a surface low moving through the Southeast and
deepening as it lifts up near the East Coast. There remains some
placement differences in the surface low, especially in the East
around day 5, but overall, much of the guidance continues to trend
farther west, now bringing the low over or even inland from the
East Coast by early Monday. The GFS (including todays 12z run) has
consistently been the farthest west with the low amongst the
deterministic solutions, although its hard to call it an outlier
just yet given the latest trends with the new incoming 12z
guidance. On the other side, the UKMET is more suppressed to the
south and a look at the ensemble guidance from the GEFS and ECENS
shows plenty of uncertainty in exact low placement but members are
tending to cluster at this point somewhere in between the GFS and
UKMET. Both the 00z ECMWF and CMC (and the new 12z runs) are a
little closer to the ensembles and thus a preferred starting point
for the WPC forecast at this time. This led to a surface low over
southern New Jersey which is pretty close to previous WPC
continuity. It should, however, be stressed that the energy
leading to this potent shortwave is still out in the Pacific Ocean
at this time thus, data sampling is poor. As the energy reaches
the Northwest U.S. and encounters more observations, additional
shifts (potentially large) in the models are likely.

Elsewhere, ridging is likely to have hold of the West this
weekend, other than a meandering southern stream upper low
centered offshore of California. This feature is forecast to track
eastward early in the workweek and join with the main flow, and
possibly interact with northern stream energy entering the Pacific
Northwest around Monday. Model agreement for this overall pattern
was fairly good, but with increasing differences especially with
embedded shortwaves as the period progressed. Energy progresses
downstream early next week with some uncertainty in amplitude
across the Great Lakes next Tuesday into Wednesday, and potential
interaction with lingering energy from the East Coast low.

The blend for the updated WPC medium range forecast used a general
model consensus (leaning more towards the ECMWF) for days 3-4.
After that, began incorporating some modest amounts of the
ensemble means to help temper the late period uncertainties.
Overall, this led to a fairly consistent forecast with the
overnight WPC package.


...Weather Highlights...

The surface low lifting from the Lower Mississippi Valley, across
the Southeast, and up the East Coast will bring with it a full
array of weather hazards and threats. On the north side of the
initial system on Saturday, there could be some potential for
wintry weather across parts of the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee and Kentucky on Saturday, but confidence in amounts
is low given the surface low will not have consolidated by that
point. More concerning chances for heavy snow are likely in the
southern Appalachians beginning Saturday, spreading northward
along/on the backside of the deepening low and generally west of
the I-95 corridor in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. Chances
are also increasing for a potentially significant icing event,
especially from parts of far northern Georgia, through the western
Carolinas, and into south-central VA where warm and moist Gulf of
Mexico inflow will overrun initially cold air at the surface. WPC
has both the snow and ice threats highlighted in todays hazard
outlook. To the south, moderately to locally heavy rain could move
across the Southeast this weekend, and possibly up the immediate
East Coast Sunday into Monday. Gusty winds surrounding the surface
low may create high waves off the coast leading to possible
coastal flood concerns along the Northeast coastline. Of course,
all of this is highly dependent on the exact track of the surface
low and even small adjustments back to the east could bring heavy
snow potential into even coastal parts of the East.

Elsewhere, after the low exits northeast of the U.S. on Tuesday,
westerly flow and another shortwave should may bring favorable
conditions for lake effect/enhanced snow over the Great Lakes. The
West could see some light precipitation during the period,
particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern
Rockies early next week, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.
Rain could develop again across the Lower Mississippi Valley
beginning Tuesday with return flow from the Gulf of Mexico.

Temperature-wise, much below normal temperatures (-15 to -30F) is
forecast for the Northeast over the weekend, with slightly cooler
than average weather through early next week for the southeastern
quadrant of the country. Temperatures should generally be above
average in the Plains particularly from Sunday onward after a
cooler day Saturday. The West should see temperatures within about
5-10 degrees of normal, with a tendency toward slightly warmer
than average conditions especially for morning lows.

...Wintry weather is expected across the Appalachians and parts of
the Eastern Seaboard, but uncertainty remains with precipitation
type in some areas and with the location of the heaviest snow...


...Overview...

The most notable weather feature during the medium range period is
a developing surface low pressure system that slides across the
Southeast on Sunday and then pivots northward near/along the East
Coast ahead of a potent mid-upper shortwave trough. This will
cause impactful wintry weather to spread across much of the East
early next week. However, uncertainty remains with the exact low
track, which leads to low confidence in precipitation type (which
could change in some locations as the event progresses), the axis
of the heaviest snow, and the westward extent of the snow.
Meanwhile in the West, mainly dry conditions are expected
underneath surface high pressure, with the exception of light
precipitation in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies as
weak fronts track through.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance for the 12/18Z cycle (and the incoming 00Z cycle)
shows a similar idea to the previous couple of cycles of model
guidance with the impactful surface low in the East--that is, a
low track as described above staying onshore in the deterministic
guidance, but with the GEFS and EC ensemble means showing a track
offshore, while individual ensemble members demonstrate
considerable spread in low placement, with certainly some ensemble
members along the coast or inland. Again, while model guidance
exhibits good agreement for a strengthening low, the exact low
track will create significant differences in weather type at
certain locations, especially near the Atlantic coast to about the
I-95 corridor. The 12/18/00Z GFS along with the 12/00Z CMC all
show a track basically on the western side of the guidance
envelope (well inland over the northern Mid-Atlantic Monday
morning), with the 12Z ECMWF a bit farther east but still onshore.
Felt it prudent to continue with a low track in between the
western deterministic guidance and the eastern EC and GEFS
ensemble mean guidance, but somewhat favoring the fairly well
clustered deterministic models. The best proxy for this at the
time of forecast creation was close to the 12Z ECMWF and the 12Z
CMC ensemble mean; the 12Z CMC ensemble mean along with the
incoming 00Z CMC mean are the first ensemble means to show an
onshore track with the low. This led to a surface low basically
over Philadelphia on Monday morning, which was a very minor shift
farther inland/west compared to continuity. Hopefully models will
converge and confidence will increase within the next day for the
exact low track, as the shortwave energy leading to this system
will enter the Pacific Northwest/southwestern Canada and have
better data sampling for input into the model guidance.

Elsewhere, ridging is likely to have hold of the West early this
week, other than a meandering southern stream upper low centered
offshore of California. The southern stream low is forecast to
track eastward and join with the main flow by around Tuesday, with
some possible interaction with northern stream energy in the
eastern Pacific, but most guidance other than the 12Z CMC now has
more separation with these pieces of energy. Then there is good
model agreement for an amplified ridge over the West Coast by
Thursday drifting eastward from the Pacific, with some model
differences in possible embedded shortwaves particularly shown by
the GFS runs. Meanwhile, additional shortwaves reinforce troughing
centered over the Great Lakes Wednesday-Thursday, for which there
is reasonable model agreement.

The WPC medium range forecast was based on an initial blend of the
12/18Z deterministic guidance favoring the ECMWF somewhat, adding
the CMC ensemble mean by day 4 with its favorable low position in
the East and increasing the proportion of the EC ensemble mean for
the latter part of the period as well, to help temper minor
variations in model guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The surface low lifting from across the Southeast and up the East
Coast will bring with it a full array of weather hazards and
threats. Concerning chances for heavy snow are likely in the
southern Appalachians beginning Saturday, spreading northward
along/on the backside of the deepening low and generally west of
the I-95 corridor in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. Chances
are also increasing for a potentially significant icing event,
especially from parts of far northern Georgia, through the western
Carolinas, and into south-central Virginia where warm and moist
Gulf of Mexico inflow will overrun initially cold air at the
surface. WPC has both the snow and ice threats highlighted in the
most recent hazard outlook. To the south, moderately to locally
heavy rain could move across the Southeast this weekend, and
possibly up the immediate East Coast Sunday into Monday. Gusty
winds surrounding the surface low may create high waves off the
coast leading to possible coastal flood concerns along the
Northeast coastline. Of course, all of this is highly dependent on
the exact track of the surface low and even small adjustments back
to the east could bring heavy snow potential into even coastal
parts of the East.

Elsewhere, after the main low exits northeast of the U.S. on
Tuesday, another (weaker) low pressure system is forecast to track
over the north-central U.S. in response to a mid-upper shortwave
and bring some snow to the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes, with
possibly higher totals near typical lake enhancement areas. The
West could see some light precipitation during the period,
particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern
Rockies early next week, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.
Rain could develop again across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southeast beginning Tuesday and increasing Wednesday with return
flow from the Gulf of Mexico.

Cooler than normal temperatures are expected generally over the
eastern U.S. early next week, with particularly chilly lows below
0F in the interior Northeast Sunday morning, about 15-25 degrees
below average. The West to the Plains can expect generally above
average conditions through Tuesday. Then as a cold surface high
drops into the north-central U.S. Wednesday and Thursday,
temperatures will fall to 10-20F below normal in the Upper Midwest.

Northeast coastline. Of course, all of this is highly dependent on
the exact track of the surface low and even small adjustments back
to the east could bring heavy snow potential into even coastal
parts of the East.

Elsewhere, after the main low exits northeast of the U.S. on
Tuesday, another (weaker) low pressure system is forecast to track
over the north-central U.S. in response to a mid-upper shortwave
and bring some snow to the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes, with
possibly higher totals near typical lake enhancement areas. The
West could see some light precipitation during the period,
particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern
Rockies early next week, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.
Rain could develop again across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southeast beginning Tuesday and increasing Wednesday with return
flow from the Gulf of Mexico.

Cooler than normal temperatures are expected generally over the
eastern U.S. early next week, with particularly chilly lows below
0F in the interior Northeast Sunday morning, about 15-25 degrees
below average. The West to the Plains can expect generally above
average conditions through Tuesday. Then as a cold surface high
drops into the north-central U.S. Wednesday and Thursday,
temperatures will fall to 10-20F below normal in the Upper Midwest.

...Quick hitting winter storm to produce a swath of heavy snow
across parts of the Northern Plains and Midwest...

...Temperatures plunge behind an arctic cold front pushing through
the Northeast by the end of the week and could lead to dangerous
wind chills into Saturday morning...

For the most part, today will feature tranquil weather across much
of the Lower 48 with light precipitation confined to the Pacific
Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northern New England. However, by late
tonight a strong storm system diving southward out of
south-central Canada will create hazardous weather conditions into
the Northern Plains and eventually into the middle/lower Missouri
Valley. Conditions are expected to rapidly deteriorate across
parts of North Dakota tonight, before snow shifts into eastern
South Dakota and southwest Minnesota on Friday morning. Widespread
snowfall totals greater than 4 inches are likely, with over 8
inches possible from southeast North Dakota to central Iowa. The
associated area of low pressure will be fast-moving and enter the
Central Plains by Friday night, shifting the swath of heavy snow
into Iowa during the day on Friday and northern Missouri by
Saturday morning. Difficult driving conditions are likely
throughout this region as roads become snow covered. Visibility
will also be greatly reduced within heavy snowbands with rates up
to 1"/hr and during periods of gusty winds. Speaking of gusty
winds, high winds are likely throughout the High Plains as an
associated cold front races down the Plains on Friday. Gusts up to
60 mph are possible, which has prompted High Wind Watches to be
issued across western South Dakota.

Farther east, a very strong and rapidly strengthening storm system
in the eastern Atlantic Ocean will skim past New England on
Friday. Gusty winds and rough surf will be felt along coastal New
England, with light snow potentially reaching into Interior
Downeast Maine and Cape Cod. This system will help drag an arctic
cold front out of Canada and into the Northeast on Friday as well,
setting the stage for a bitter cold night and start to the
weekend. Temperatures are forecast to drop into the single digits
and below zero for much of New England on Saturday morning, with
wind chills making it feel even colder. For interior sections of
the Northeast, wind chills well below zero could cause frostbite
on exposed skin in a matter of minutes. Residents should plan
ahead and dress properly, including a hat and gloves. This frigid
airmass will also sink into the northern Mid-Atlantic, where
Saturday will start out in the teens and low 20s.

Otherwise, warm and dry weather is forecast through Friday across
the Southern Plains ahead of the approaching cold front. Quiet
conditions will also be experienced throughout the Southeast,
Tennessee Valley, and Gulf Coast States before the aforementioned
winter storm impacts the region this weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0219 AM CST Thu Jan 13 2022

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level ridge will remain centered over the Intermountain
West through this evening, prior to breaking down in response to an
approaching midlevel trough from the Pacific Northwest. At the
surface, high pressure will encompass most of the western and
central CONUS during the day, with lee troughing developing during
the overnight hours (into the Day 2/Friday period).

...Southern High Plains...
Dry/subsident northwesterly flow along the eastern periphery of the
upper ridge will foster critically low RH across the southern High
Plains this afternoon -- aided by deep boundary-layer mixing.
However, a weak surface pressure gradient and light winds will
generally limit the fire-weather threat for today.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1133 AM CDT Sat Jul 17 2021

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...Portions of the Great Basin into the northern Rockies...
Morning RAOBs across the Southwest indicate a mid-level moisture
plume is moving northward with precipitable water values increasing
by 0.12" at VEF - Las Vegas, NV over the last 12 hours. Meanwhile,
mid-level moisture is limited across much of the remainder of the
Great Basin and into the northern Rockies (e.g., 0.42" precipitable
water at LKN - Elko, NV RAOB). Thunderstorms are expected to develop
this afternoon across northeast Nevada, southeast Idaho, northwest
Utah, and northwest Colorado, as strong diurnal heating promotes
upslope flow along the higher terrain. While high-resolution
ensemble guidance suggests mid-level height rises may limit storm
longevity/coverage, isolated to widely scattered storms are possible
through mid-evening. Confidence in widely scattered coverage is
greatest over northeast Nevada (near/east of Elko, NV). New fire
ignitions are possible with any thunderstorm (especially away from
the storm core) as fuels across this region are extremely dry with
ERC percentiles at or above 92% (in many cases exceeding 98%).

...Southeast Oregon, far northeast California, northwest Nevada...
The forecast for Elevated fire weather conditions remains on track
across this area. A minor southward expansion was made into Alpine
County, California to near/south of the Tamarack fire, as the latest
high-resolution guidance suggests several hours of sustained surface
winds near 15 mph amidst 15% minimum RH values this afternoon.
Locally elevated conditions will likely extend farther south in the
vicinity of Mono and Inyo counties, California.

..Elliott.. 07/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Sat Jul 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-ridging will persist across the Inter-mountain West as
mid-level troughing continues over the Pacific Northwest. Beneath
modest mid-level flow, in proximity to the Cascades, boundary layer
mixing and downslope flow will support dry and breezy conditions.
Meanwhile, a mid-level moisture plume will continue to pivot around
the periphery of the upper-ridge, promoting thunderstorm
development, with dry strikes possible in the northern Rockies.

...Portions of the Northern Rockies...
While upper ridging will continue to slowly amplify through the
period, widespread strong diurnal heating/boundary-layer mixing and
associated upslope flow along the higher terrain will support
thunderstorm development by afternoon. Weak low and mid-level flow
suggests that storms will be relatively slow moving overall, and
isolated on the large-scale given the presence of the upper ridge.
Nonetheless, enough coverage warranting a broader isolated dry
thunderstorm delineation is expected across northern parts of the
Great Basin into the Northern Rockies. These high-based storms will
develop atop a deep sub-cloud layer, with around 0.75 inch
precipitable water values. In addition, critically to extremely
critically dry fuels will be in place, with record high ERCs and
100/1000 hr fuel dryness noted in spots.

...Southern parts of the Pacific Northwest/Northwest Great Basin...
Modest mid-level flow will overspread the Northwest given the
presence of an upper trough. Beneath the modest mid-level flow will
reside a deep, dry boundary layer, where downslope flow to the lee
of the southern Cascades/northern Sierra will promote widespread 15
mph sustained westerly surface winds with 15-20% RH. Elevated
highlights have been introduced for the dry and breezy conditions
within proximity/to the lee of the higher terrain.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0124 PM CDT Sat Jul 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

Primary change with this forecast update was to extend the isolated
dry thunderstorm area farther west to the California coast from
Santa Barbara County northward to Sonoma County. The latest
high-resolution guidance continues to suggest isolated to widely
scattered thunderstorms spreading/developing northward from late
morning into the afternoon/evening tomorrow along the northern
periphery of the mid-level moisture surge across southern/central
California, Nevada, and Idaho. While a mix of wet/dry thunderstorm
modes is expected, extremely dry fuels over the area suggest that
new lightning ignitions are likely -- with the greatest threats
along/near the foothills and across the higher terrain. Thunderstorm
activity is expected to be lower across Montana, though an isolated
thunderstorm over dry fuels remains possible.

An upper-level disturbance will bring a secondary surge of mid-level
moisture northward late Sunday night into Monday morning with
another round of isolated to widely scattered dry thunderstorms
possible across central California into western Nevada.

...Synopsis...
Similar to Day 1, upper ridging will continue to very gradually
amplify across the Interior West as upper troughing is maintained
across the Pacific Northwest. Modest southwesterly flow aloft will
overspread the Cascades and northern Sierra, promoting dry downslope
flow favorable for supporting some wildfire-spread threat. Mid-level
monsoonal moisture will also continue to pivot around the periphery
of the upper ridge, with isolated thunderstorm development likely
from the Sierra to the Montana/Canadian border.

...Far northeast California, southeast Oregon, extreme northwest
Nevada...
By afternoon peak heating, downslope flow across the northern Sierra
and southern Cascades will promote 15 mph sustained westerly surface
winds and 15-20% RH for several hours. These Elevated surface
conditions will begin in the higher terrain and develop eastward
into the Harney Basin and extreme northwest Nevada, as also
supported by the latest guidance consensus.

...Lee of the Sierra to northern Montana...
With afternoon heating and the development of adequate buoyancy in
the -20 to -30C layer, at least isolated thunderstorm development is
expected in the higher terrain areas of the Sierra into northern
Montana. While winds aloft are expected to be weak overall, the
storms are expected to be high-based, occurring atop critically to
record dry fuels. Some of the latest guidance shows a low-level
impulse emanating from southern California, and moving northwestward
through the day. This low-level feature may potentially foster
greater thunderstorm coverage. Given the very receptive fuels in
place, conditions will be monitored for isolated dry thunderstorm
highlight expansions and possibly the introduction of a scattered
dry thunderstorm area for parts of far east-northeast California
into central Nevada in future outlooks.

...Heat continues from the northern Great Basin to the northern
Rockies/northern Plains...

...Overview...

The strong upper high forecast to be centered near the central
Rockies will maintain well above normal temperatures over the
northern Rockies/Plains, with some of this heat extending into the
Upper Midwest and less extreme anomalies reaching back into the
Great Basin.  An upper low forecast to track from offshore British
Columbia toward central Canada should gradually flatten the ridge
to the north of the upper high, with a cold front beginning to
erode the western side of the heat by next Saturday.  Downstream
mean troughing will prevail over the East, with the northern
portion likely to trend a little deeper with time.  The trough
will support a series of fronts and accompanying episodes of
showers/thunderstorms along with near to moderately below normal
temperatures.  Meanwhile energy pulling away from the trough by
the start of the period early Tuesday should form a southern
Plains upper low that lingers and slowly weakens with time.  This
feature could support some areas of locally enhanced rainfall over
eastern to southern Texas as clouds/rain from this system together
with monsoon activity farther west keep high temperatures below
normal from the southern Plains into the Southwest.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Most guidance continues to offer similar ideas for the large scale
pattern along with embedded small scale uncertainties.  A blend of
the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GEFS, and 00Z CMC mean together with the
deterministic components yielded a solution that maintains good
continuity with previous forecast cycles.  The 00Z GFS appeared to
be an outlier late in the forecast period with too much frontal
wave development across the northern Plains toward the Great
Lakes, and thus was not included in the blend.  The 00Z ECMWF and
the CMC tended to keep an axis of heavy rainfall across eastern to
southern Texas from mid to late next week on the eastern flank of
the upper vortex.  This scenario was not supported by both the EC
mean and GEFS mean however.  Thus, the heavy rain axis over
northeastern Texas was downplayed for the current QPF blend.  For
the rest of the CONUS, models exhibited reasonable
variability/uncertainty for the medium range forecast period so
that a general model compromise trending toward their ensemble
means should offer a good starting point.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The greatest northern tier temperature anomalies (plus 10-20F)
associated with the central Rockies upper high should extend from
the eastern half or more of Montana into the Dakotas and parts of
the Upper Midwest.  Some locations in Montana and the Dakotas may
see one or more days with highs reaching at least 100F.  Best
potential for daily records will be in the short-range period but
a few isolated records could extend into at least Tuesday.  A cold
front expected to reach the northern Plains by Saturday should
bring some moderation to the heat for Montana at that time.
Southern Plains upper low/wavy front may produce some areas of
heavy rainfall Tuesday-Wednesday followed by a lighter trend as
these features weaken.  The remaining thunderstorms should tend to
drift east into the lower Mississippi Valley toward the Southeast
for the latter part of next week south of the dissipating front.

Meanwhile, rain and thunderstorms should continue within an area
of monsoon moisture over parts of the Four Corners states,
possibly extending into parts of California/Nevada after midweek.
Coverage and intensity of rainfall will likely increase somewhat
with time, and with a potential contribution from the southern
Plains moisture/upper level energy.  The unsettled pattern over
the southern Plains/Southwest will lead to highs up to 5-10F or so
below normal for one or more days.

Expect lingering rain/thunderstorms with a leading front that
settles over the Mid-Atlantic and South by Tuesday.  Two trailing
fronts dropping southeastward from Canada will bring rainfall of
varying intensity, mainly to the Great Lakes/Northeast but
possibly farther southward at times.  Temperatures over the East
will likely be near to moderately below normal through the period.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat July 17 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Northeast through Sunday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and the parts of the Northern/Central
High Plains through Sunday morning...

...Excessive heat throughout the Northern Plains and Intermountain
West; Potential for dry lightning over Central and Northern
California on Sunday could lead to conditions capable of producing
wildfires...

A slow-moving front will meander eastward between the Lower Great
Lakes and Southern Plains, then move off the Northeast Coast by
Monday while producing scattered showers and thunderstorms. The
front will intersect a very warm and humid airmass, sparking
numerous thunderstorms and making heavy rain.  The WPC has issued
a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms
over parts of the Northeast. The associated heavy rain will create
numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams may
flood, potentially affecting larger rivers through Sunday morning.
Moreover, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
over parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic through Sunday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.

In the meantime, the western end of the front will be
quasi-stationary through Monday over parts of the Northwest to the
Northern/Central High Plains. The boundary will aid in producing
showers and thunderstorms over the region through Sunday morning.
The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over the
parts of the Northern/Central High Plains through Sunday morning.
The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes.

Meanwhile, an upper-level building ridge over the western U.S.
will lead to hot temperatures that will be well above average
across the Northern Plains and Northern Great Basin for the next
several days. Highs into the triple digits can be expected
throughout the Intermountain West to the Northern High Plains.
Therefore, Excessive Heat Warnings/Watches and Heat Advisories
have been issued. Meanwhile, high temperatures into the low-to-mid
90s are forecast throughout the Northern Plains and parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley. This heatwave will exacerbate the severe
to the exceptional drought currently found across the region,
which in combination can make for an environment ripe for
wildfires to spread uncontrollably.

Additionally, dry lightning could be a concern for Northern and
Central California parts on Sunday as monsoonal moisture enters
from the south but produces very little rain. If thunderstorms do
form, extremely dry fuels struck by lightning could produce new
fires. Therefore, fire Weather Watches have been issued.

...Heat will continue over the northern Plains and extend into the
Upper Midwest...

...Overview...

Expect little change in the long-term mean pattern through the
period, with a persistent upper high anchored over or near the
central Rockies and mean troughs over the northeastern Pacific and
eastern U.S./Canada.  An upper low just off the British Columbia
coast as of early Wednesday will track into central Canada,
pushing a front into the northern Plains.  This front should bring
only slight moderation of the hot weather over the northern Plains
though.  On the other hand the combination of an upper
weakness/low over the southern Plains and monsoonal moisture over
and just west of the Four Corners states will promote episodes of
rain and thunderstorms along with below normal high temperatures
to the south of the upper high.  The eastern U.S. should see near
to below normal temperatures under mean troughing aloft while
multiple fronts may provide a focus for showers and thunderstorms.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The best consensus of 12Z/18Z operational models early in the
period followed by a trend to a model/ensemble mean blend late (60
percent total ensemble mean weight by day 7 Sunday) maintained
reasonable continuity in principle with only typical run-to-run
adjustments.  As has been the case lately, agreement is good for
the mean pattern while some spread exists for the embedded
details.  One area of uncertainty involves initial Hudson Bay
energy that drops into the mean trough, with various ideas between
sheared energy and a deeper compact upper low.  New 00Z guidance
tilts more toward the compact upper low scenario, though it
remains to be seen if it tracks as far south as latest ECMWF runs
(clipping Maine).  Later in the period, there was not great
support for the surface low offshore New England on Saturday in
the 18Z GFS while over the past 12 hours the GFS has been backing
off from low pressure the 12Z run had brought into the Northeast
by Sunday.  The upper low tracking into central Canada still has
some timing variability by late in the period.  On the positive
side the 00Z CMC has trended more progressive to compare better
with other models and the GEFS/ECMWF means.  The upper feature
evolving over the southern Plains as of midweek has generally
trended a little southward early in the period and appears
slightly weaker after Wednesday.  Finally, ahead of the reloaded
Northeast Pacific trough the 00Z CMC brings more height falls
versus consensus into the Northwest next weekend.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Portions of the northern Plains into Upper Midwest will likely see
highs up to 10-15F above normal on multiple days.  Highest
anomalies and best potential for parts of eastern Montana and the
Dakotas to reach at least 100F should be during Wednesday-Friday.
A front extending from Canadian low pressure will likely bring
temperatures down a little from west to east into the weekend but
perhaps by only a few degrees or so.  Plus 10F anomalies for highs
may also reach southward into the central Plains around late week.

Another period of enhanced monsoonal rainfall will be possible
over the Four Corners states after midweek, with some moisture
possibly reaching a little farther westward as well.  The
unsettled regime will keep highs up to 5-10F or so below normal
over the southwestern U.S.  Over Texas expect rainfall to continue
trending lighter and more scattered with time while below normal
highs trend somewhat closer to normal.

Lingering moisture along and south of a dissipating southern tier
front may provide localized enhancement to diurnal
showers/thunderstorms into the end of the week.  The northeastern
quadrant of the lower 48 should see areas of rain/thunderstorms
accompanying the fronts pushed along by flow within the mean
trough aloft.  Some rain may be locally moderate to heavy but
confidence in specifics is fairly low at this time.  Eastern U.S.
temperatures should be near to moderately below normal through the
period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 AM CDT Sun Jul 18 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-ridging will remain in place across the Inter-mountain West as
mid-level troughing persists across the Pacific Northwest. Modest
flow aloft accompanying the mid-level trough will overspread the
Cascades/northern Sierra, promoting dry and breezy conditions
favoring some fire-spread potential atop and to the lee of the
higher terrain. Mid-level moisture/buoyancy pivoting around the
upper ridge will also support at least isolated high-based
thunderstorm development, from the California Coast to the northern
Rockies, where dry strikes will be possible.

...California Coast to the northern Rockies...
Deeper mid-level moisture (i.e. 0.75-1.0 inch precipitable water
values) will gradually progress northwestward from the Lower
Colorado River Basin to support isolated thunderstorm development
across parts of the Great Basin into the Northern Rockies. Likewise,
a mid-level moisture surge is also expected along the windward side
of the Sierra, with isolated thunderstorm potential also expected
across much of California. Storms in Nevada/California may have a
higher ratio of wet strikes. However, record dry fuels may
compensate to support efficient lightning-ignition rates. Farther
north into the Northern Rockies, storms are expected to be
relatively drier. However, coverage is expected to be more sparse.
Nonetheless, fuels are also very receptive to fire spread in these
areas, with a dense enough storm coverage expected to warrant
isolated dry thunderstorm highlights.

...Northeast California, northwest Nevada, southeast Oregon...
With the onset of diurnal heating/boundary-layer mixing, westerly
downslope flow along the southern Cascades/northern Sierra will
promote Elevated conditions (i.e. widespread 15 mph sustained
westerly surface winds and 15-20% RH). These conditions will be most
likely in the higher terrain, leeward to the Harney Basin for at
least a few hours around afternoon peak heating.

...Heavy rain and scattered flash flooding possible throughout the
Southwest, Lower Mississippi Valley, and southern New England to
end the weekend...

...Excessive heat continues across the Northern Plains and
Northern Great Basin...

...Threat of dry lightning over central and northern California
today could spark new wildfires...

An area of low pressure centered over southern New England and
associated slow moving cold front is expected to remain the focus
for scattered thunderstorms and heavy rain through early this
week. A few downpours could lead to flooding concerns for parts of
southern New England today, where copious amounts of rain have
fallen so far this month. Farther south, repeating rounds of
thunderstorms are expected along the aforementioned cold front
between the Southeast and Southern Plains, with the boundary
becoming stationary at times. Due to ample moisture in place, a
few thunderstorms could produce intense rainfall rates and
scattered flash floods. A Slight Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive
Rainfall is in effect today for portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley, with a large Marginal Risk (level 1/4) covering much of
the southeastern and south-central U.S. between the Carolinas and
Oklahoma. The heavy rainfall threat is forecast to inch southward
on Monday, with the greatest flash flood chances found along
coastal sections of the Southeast, as well as northern Louisiana
and eastern Texas. Meanwhile, the summer monsoon is in full swing
across the Southwest, which means more chances for thunderstorms
and excessive rainfall today. Sections of central and southeast
Arizona, as well as much of New Mexico could see isolated rainfall
amounts up to an inch. Flash Flood Watches are in effect across
central New Mexico.

The dog days of summer are set to continue across the Northern
Plains and Northern Great Basin. High temperatures well into the
triple digits are forecast today and Monday for eastern Montana,
where a few daily high temperature records could be tied or
broken. Another concern with the ongoing heat wave is that low
temperatures are forecast to only drop into 70s at night, making
it harder to recover from the heat after sunset. Highs above the
century mark are also expected for the lower elevations of the
Intermountain West. Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories
have been issued. Residents are advised to drink plenty of fluids
and avoid extended time outdoors in order to avoid heat-related
illness.

Monsoonal moisture entering parts of California and the Sierra
Nevada today may fuel isolated showers and thunderstorms. While
rain is desperately needed across this portion of the country,
much of these thunderstorms are expected to remain dry. The main
threat will be associated with lighting and the potential for new
wildfires. Any lightning strikes reaching the ground could easily
ignite the dehydrated terrain throughout the region. Fire Weather
Watches and Red Flag Warnings have been issued in order to
highlight the threat.

0255 AM CDT Sun Jul 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN AND
SOUTHEASTERN MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
The upper ridge across the Interior West flattens across the
Northern Rockies as upper troughing propagates eastward from the
Pacific Northwest tomorrow/Monday. The eastward progression of the
upper trough will in turn encourage surface lee troughing across the
northern High Plains, with dry and breezy southerly flow likely
mainly across eastern Montana. Otherwise, deep-layer ascent
associated with the impinging upper trough will overspread much of
California into the northern Rockies, promoting at least isolated
dry thunderstorm development.

...Eastern Montana into northeast Wyoming...
A pressure gradient will become established across the northern High
Plains as surface lee troughing intensifies tomorrow afternoon. The
latest guidance consensus suggests 20 mph sustained southeasterly
surface flow will overlap with 15-20% RH for several hours during
the afternoon. While the expected surface winds are somewhat
marginal, Critical highlights were still introduced for portions of
eastern Montana to account for the highly receptive fuels to fire
spread.

...California Coast to the northern Rockies...
Mid-level moisture will continue to spread northwestward across the
Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest through the period tomorrow,
with several areas potentially witnessing at/above 1 inch
precipitable water values. While several storms will produce
predominantly wet strikes, at least a few dry strikes are possible,
especially along the periphery of storm cores. Given the anomalously
dry/receptive fuels in place, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights
have been introduced despite the potential for some wetting rains.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1031 AM CDT Tue Apr 06 2021

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed
based on recent observations and morning guidance. Relative humidity
has already fallen into the low teens for many locations across NM,
and winds will increase through the afternoon as a surface low
deepens over eastern CO/western KS. Morning soundings show 25-35 mph
winds within a deep residual layer that will support frequent wind
gusts into this range (and perhaps up to 40 mph for some locations)
by mid/late afternoon.

Elsewhere, dry conditions continue across the northern Plains as
well as much of the East Coast. While localized elevated fire
weather conditions are possible (especially across east PA into NJ
where wind gusts up to 15-20 mph are possible), winds will generally
remain too light to warrant additional highlights.

..Moore.. 04/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0109 AM CDT Tue Apr 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-low will move through the Great Basin and reach the
Four Corners toward by midday. Strong mid-level flow will develop on
the southern flank of the low across much of central Arizona
eastward into central/southern New Mexico. At the surface, a cyclone
will deepen along the Kansas/Colorado border before evolving into an
elongated surface trough from the southern High Plains northeastward
through eastern Nebraska by early evening. A cold front will
progress through the Southwest and into the Southern Plains.

...Southwest and Southern High Plains...
Widespread critical fire weather is likely to occur tomorrow
afternoon. The strong mid-level winds will be favorably timed with
peak boundary-layer mixing across New Mexico, especially.
Single-digit RH is probable over much of the region increasing to
around 15% around the fringes of the risk area. The deepening
surface low will help to enhance surface winds to 20-30 mph. Locally
extremely critical conditions may occur, particularly in southern
New Mexico border where the mid-level jet will be. However, ERCs are
only near the 50th percentile which should limit more extreme fire
behavior. Elevated conditions will extend both westward and eastward
where weaker winds and marginal fuels will limit critical fire
weather, respectively.

FOR WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 - TUESDAY APRIL 20: Compared to yesterday's guidance=
,
there is much better agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble mean 500=
-
hPa
height anomalies during week-2. As previously advertised by the ECMWF
regarding
the strengthening of mean anomalous troughing across the central and easter=
n
U.S., today's 0z and 6z GEFS runs have become better aligned with the ECMWF=
,
favoring the progression of a shortwave trough shifting over the eastern CO=
NUS
early in the period, and a larger coverage of negative height departures
focused predominantly east of Rockies and into the Atlantic through much of
the
week-2 period. With strong positive height departures predicted by both mod=
els
over the higher latitudes of eastern Canada, the overall mean mid-level hei=
ght
pattern resembles the negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase, whic=
h
typically favors below-normal temperatures and above-normal precipitation
across many portions of the central and eastern CONUS during April. Given
this,
and the high amplitude pattern favored by both models, temperature and
precipitation related hazard potential has also increased in today's outloo=
k.
Upstream, anomalous ridging continues to be favored by both the GEFS and EC=
MWF
across western North America, which is expected to promote unseasonably war=
m
temperatures for portions of the western CONUS, and also allow for a
moderation
of below normal temperatures across Alaska during week-2.



By the start of week-2, both the GEFS and ECMWF favor surface high pressure
overspreading much of the Plains behind the passage of a frontal system.
Negative 850-hPa temperature departures in the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles app=
ear
to be more robust relative to yesterday's guidance over the Plains, with a
larger coverage extending further eastward into the Mississippi, Tennessee =
and
Ohio Valleys. Better agreement exists in the reforecast tools, which indica=
te
at least a 20% chance that minimum temperatures fall below the 15th percent=
ile
and below freezing mainly throughout the Great Plains and parts of the Midw=
est
early in the period. Elevated probabilities of minimum temperatures falling
below the 15th percentile below 40 degrees F also exist across the
southeastern
U.S through the end of week-2. The persistence of these cold signals in the
reforecast guidance is likely tied to another surface low predicted to form
over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, resulting in prevailing northerly flow
over the Mississippi Valley which would help to reinforce much of the
anomalous
cold air across the southeastern CONUS. As a result, there is a heightened
concern for frost and near freezing temperature impacts to vulnerable emerg=
ing
spring vegetation, particularly across the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio
Valleys, and the Southeast, and a broad slight risk area for much below nor=
mal
temperatures is highlighted over much of the central and southeastern CONUS
for
Apr 14 to 20.  An increased likelihood for high winds is also possible, as
both
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict at least a 20% chance for sustai=
ned
winds exceeding the 85th percentile across the Southeast and into the
Mid-Atlantic during week-2. However, winds are not expected to surpass
hazardous wind thresholds at this time, and no related wind hazard is issue=
d.



Although there is better agreement between the multi-model ensembles with t=
he
mid-level pattern aloft, there are some differences regarding the potential
for
heavy precipitation between the models across the southern tier of the CONU=
S.
Several of the 0z ECMWF ensemble members favor 3-day precipitation amounts
exceeding an inch over the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys and the
Southeast early in the period, and the ECMWF reforecast tool reflects this
potential with at least a 20% chance of precipitation accumulations exceedi=
ng
the 85th percentile in the region. The 0z and 6z GEFS is particularly
lackluster with this potential, indicating little increase in the ensemble
mean
precipitation daily totals compared to yesterday, while also maintaining a
reduced probabilities in the reforecast tool. Despite this, the development=
 of
a stalled frontal boundary is possible early in the period, and both GEFS a=
nd
ECMWF ensembles depict mean low pressure and southerly flow across the Gulf=
 of
Mexico to support enhanced precipitation over the southern U.S. Thus, a sli=
ght
risk of heavy precipitation is posted for the Gulf States for Apr 14 to 16,=
 as
above-normal precipitation across the Southeast is also historically
consistent
with the negative phase of the NAO during April.



Across the Alaska region, much of the anomalous mid-level troughing forecas=
t
during week-1 is expected to lift out, with positive height departures
overspreading much of the Mainland during early week-2. Although this patte=
rn
change and the accompanying warmer temperatures are anticipated to help bri=
ng
an end to cold spell forecast for much of the state during early April, all
eyes are focused on any anomalous warm pattern that develops following the
predicted cold pattern over Alaska which may lead to accelerated snow and i=
ce
melt and increase the risk of localized flooding during river ice breakup
season. Based on the latest guidance, the greatest likelihood for above-nor=
mal
temperatures during week-2 now exists across the northern Mainland. However=
,
temperatures in northern Alaska are expected to remain well below freezing
during week-2, and climatologically, river ice breakup in this region
typically
begins later in May.

1830z update...

The same forecast reasoning from the overnight shift applies to
the medium range update for today. The latest guidance remains in
reasonable agreement through day 5 across the lower 48. For later
in the period, the 06z GFS has backed off some on strong troughing
across the Northwest, but a preference towards the ECMWF and the
means is preferred still. This cycle of the WPC progs used a
majority blend of deterministic guidance through day 5, decreasing
the GFS contributions thereafter in place of the ensemble means.
This approach also helps to mitigate differences farther
downstream with evolution of an upper low across the Upper Midwest
day 6-7. Only minor changes were needed to previous shift
fronts/pressures.

See previous discussion below for additional details regarding
guidance evaluation and sensible weather impacts.

Santorelli


...Previous discussion issued at 0656 UTC...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Most guidance continues to suggest that strong positive height
anomalies east of Hudson Bay and associated upper ridging will
support a mean trough aloft centered near the Upper Midwest.  As a
result low pressure systems associated with shortwaves entering
western North America will tend to gravitate toward that region
and the Great Lakes.  Models and ensembles are still showing some
spread for details within the blocky pattern, with predictability
for some specifics typically not very high given the likelihood of
various closed features between the northeastern quadrant of the
lower 48 and eastern Canada/North Atlantic.

Between Friday and Sunday the models are gradually refining the
details of how shortwave energy initially over the northern High
Plains will close off an upper low and displace a leading Midwest
system.  Consensus for the associated surface evolution is for the
leading low to lift northward while a developing southern
Plains/Mississippi Valley wave tracks into the Great Lakes.  A
leading wavy front extending through the Mid-Atlantic has trended
somewhat northward from recent continuity, with 18Z/00Z GFS runs
on the northern side of the spread.  GEFS means are a little less
extreme in that regard, recommending a more moderate continuity
adjustment.  Further adjustments can be made if these trends
continue.

Farther upstream the guidance is well clustered for another
vigorous shortwave reaching western North America by early
Saturday.  Most solutions say this feature will close off another
upper low which should track over or near the northern tier
states.  18Z/00Z GFS and GEFS mean runs have trended a bit
eastward of established consensus for this feature late in the
period.  For now would favor leaning somewhat more toward the 12Z
run for GFS/GEFS input.

By next Monday-Tuesday a number of recent GFS runs have wanted to
dig a fairly deep trough/upper low over the West.  Teleconnections
relative to the eastern Canada ridging favor some modest troughing
over the southwestern U.S./far northwestern Mexico but not so much
troughing over the Northwest, while some ridging should extend
into western Canada.  GEFS/ECMWF/CMC means all compare more
favorably to teleconnection-favored flow over the West.

Based on the above considerations, the forecast blend started with
a 12Z model composite early in the period followed by increasing
12Z GEFS/ECMWF/CMC mean input with the rest consisting of the only
the last two ECMWF runs by day 7 Tuesday.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

The forecast pattern will likely produce a fairly broad area of
precipitation over the eastern half of the lower 48 for portions
of the period.  The best signal for heaviest rainfall currently
exists from near the Gulf Coast into the southern-central
Appalachians, and possibly west into the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys,
late this week into the weekend.  During this time frame there
will be a decent flow of Gulf moisture ahead of southern Plains
into Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes surface development that will
be supported by High Plains into Midwest dynamics aloft.  Separate
southern stream energy will also likely play a role in southern
tier rain/thunderstorms.

The Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies will see a period
of rain and mountain snow from late this week into the weekend.
The forecast has been consistent in showing highest liquid totals
over the Olympics and Washington Cascades.  By late weekend into
early next week the associated development at the surface and
aloft may produce areas of enhanced precipitation over the
northern Plains and vicinity.  Some of this precipitation could
fall in the form of snow.  Other areas of rain may develop farther
south over the central U.S.  The majority of guidance indicates a
drying trend to the west of the Plains early next week but there
is still a modest potential for some precipitation to linger over
the north-central Rockies.

The most extreme temperature anomalies will be over southern Texas
on Friday with highs up to 10-20F above normal and over portions
of the East from late week into the weekend, especially for
morning lows that will be 10-20F above normal due to warm moist
flow ahead of an initial system and trailing development.
Portions of the Great Lakes could see morning lows near record
warm values on Friday.  Best potential for highs 10-15F above
normal will be over the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes area
Friday-Saturday.  From the weekend into early next week expect
highs of 5-15F below normal to progress across the Northwest and
northern Rockies behind a cold front pushing through the Northwest
and into the Plains.  Anomalies may moderate a bit by the time the
airmass reaches the Plains.  The southern half of the West will
tend to see above normal temperatures with most anomalies in the
plus 5-12F range.  Warmest days should be Friday-Saturday with a
slight rebound again over the West Coast states next Tuesday.

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...

The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed. Guidance continues to show the highest probability for
sustained 20+ mph winds across central NM where mid-level flow will
remain strong amid deep boundary-layer mixing. The eastern extent of
elevated conditions remains uncertain as some guidance depict
favorable overlap of breezy conditions with reduced RH across the
southeast TX Panhandle. However, fuels become less receptive with
eastward extent into TX, which should mitigate most fire weather
concerns.

...northern Montana...
Increasing west/southwesterly mid-level flow over the northern
Rockies, along with modest surface pressure falls across
Alberta/Saskatchewan, will help strengthen low-level downslope winds
tomorrow afternoon across northern MT. Humidity values may fall into
the 20-30% range, but confidence in the duration and coverage of
elevated fire weather conditions is low.

..Moore.. 04/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CDT Tue Apr 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough in the central Plains will slow and become
more negatively tilted on Wednesday. This will strengthen a belt of
northwesterly winds aloft across the Southwest. At the surface, the
cyclone within the lower-Missouri Valley will move northeastward and
weaken through the day. A cold front will progress to near the Gulf
coast.

...New Mexico...West Texas...
Elevated to critical fire weather is expected to develop during the
afternoon as mid-level winds mix to the surface. Very dry air will
remain across the region with RH dropping to 5-15%. With the surface
low displaced much further east and weakening with time, surface
winds will generally be lighter. Most locations will see 15-20 mph.
Central New Mexico is the most likely area for sustained critical
conditions to develop given the western extension of the mid-level
jet overhead.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue April 06 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 12 - 16 2021

There is much better consistency among the forecast guidance in the predict=
ed
500-hPa height and surface mean sea level pressure patterns across North
America, compared to yesterday's 6-10 day forecast. However, some uncertain=
ty
remains regarding the location and intensity of mean surface low pressure n=
ear
southwestern Mainland Alaska, with the 06Z GEFS depicting a weaker surface =
low
pressure centered over the eastern Bering Sea and the 00Z ECMWF ensemble
depicting the low centered near Kodiak Island. Models agree well with posit=
ive
mid-level height anomalies across much of the western third of the CONUS an=
d
over parts of the Northeast. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are favored
over
the remainder of the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS, associated with a bro=
ad
mean trough, with heights becoming near-normal along the Gulf Coast.

Despite differences in the strength and location of the mean surface low
pressure near Southwest Alaska, models agree with a southerly storm track a=
nd
below-normal temperatures over most of the state. In the western CONUS,
above-normal temperatures are favored underneath above-normal 500-hPa heigh=
ts
and sinking air aloft. Ongoing exceptional drought in parts of the region m=
ay
also support enhanced above-normal temperature odds, due to increased surfa=
ce
heating from lack of soil moisture. Colder air in Canada is also expected t=
o
drop southward into the central CONUS to as far south as Texas, increasing
probabilities of below-normal temperatures across the Great Plains and
Mississippi Valley. Over the northern Great Lakes and Northeast, above-norm=
al
temperatures are favored, associated with strong positive mid-level height
anomalies extending southward from Canada. Above-normal temperatures in the
Southeast are favored through the early half of the 6-10 day period, but
anomalies will begin to diminish later in the period.

With mean mid-level troughing and a southerly storm track across Alaska,
above-normal precipitation is favored across most of the southern two-third=
s
of
the Mainland and the Panhandle. Over the West Coast, Great Basin, and North=
ern
Rockies, positive mid-level height anomalies favor enhanced odds of
below-normal precipitation. Below-normal probabilities extend eastward acro=
ss
the Northern Plains to the Midwest, associated with surface high pressure t=
hat
is expected to dominate through much of the period. At the base and ahead o=
f
the mean trough over the eastern CONUS, above-normal precipitation is favor=
ed
for the Southern Plains, Gulf Coast, eastern seaboard, and extending into t=
he
northeastern Great Lakes.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among models and forecast tools, offset slightly by some
disagreement in the surface and mid-level height fields over Alaska.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 14 - 20 2021

The 500-hPa geopotential height pattern across North America during Week-2
indicates a progression of the pattern from the 6-10 day period. Today's mo=
del
solutions agree well with above-normal mid-level heights across all of Alas=
ka
and the western CONUS. Over most of the eastern CONUS, below-normal 500-hPa
heights are favored, associated with an amplified mean trough.

Similar to the 6-10 day period, a southern storm track across Alaska enhanc=
es
probabilities of below-normal temperatures across much of the Mainland.
However, with predominant southerly flow over the Alaska Panhandle, enhance=
d
below-normal temperature probabilities diminish to near-normal. Above-norma=
l
temperatures are favored in the western third of the CONUS, underneath
positive
mid-level height anomalies and sinking air aloft. An amplified mean trough
over
the eastern CONUS and surface high pressure on its western periphery, favor
enhanced odds of below-normal temperatures from the Great Plains to the Eas=
t
Coast. Southerly flow during the early half of the Week-2 period favor
increased odds of above-normal temperatures in northern New England and Mai=
ne.

Mean surface low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska favors below-normal
precipitation in its wake over southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutia=
ns.
Near-normal odds are favored ahead of the mean surface low, as the onshore
component to the flow has weakened a bit since yesterday's Week-2 forecast.
High pressure aloft and above-normal 500-hPa heights favor below-normal
precipitation across the western CONUS. Enhanced probabilities of below-nor=
mal
precipitation are favored over the Northern Plains and Midwest, associated
with
surface high pressure dominating through much of the period. At the base an=
d
ahead of the amplified mean mid-level trough over the eastern CONUS,
above-normal precipitation is favored for the Southern Plains, Gulf Coast, =
and
much of the eastern seaboard.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement in the modeled temperature and precipitation fields across
North
America, offset by some uncertainty in the mid-level height pattern over th=
e
North Pacific and southern Alaska.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

1830z update...

The same forecast reasoning from the overnight shift applies to
the medium range update for today. The latest guidance remains in
reasonable agreement through day 5 across the lower 48. For later
in the period, the 06z GFS has backed off some on strong troughing
across the Northwest, but a preference towards the ECMWF and the
means is preferred still. This cycle of the WPC progs used a
majority blend of deterministic guidance through day 5, decreasing
the GFS contributions thereafter in place of the ensemble means.
This approach also helps to mitigate differences farther
downstream with evolution of an upper low across the Upper Midwest
day 6-7. Only minor changes were needed to previous shift
fronts/pressures.

See previous discussion below for additional details regarding
guidance evaluation and sensible weather impacts.

Santorelli


...Previous discussion issued at 0656 UTC...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Most guidance continues to suggest that strong positive height
anomalies east of Hudson Bay and associated upper ridging will
support a mean trough aloft centered near the Upper Midwest.  As a
result low pressure systems associated with shortwaves entering
western North America will tend to gravitate toward that region
and the Great Lakes.  Models and ensembles are still showing some
spread for details within the blocky pattern, with predictability
for some specifics typically not very high given the likelihood of
various closed features between the northeastern quadrant of the
lower 48 and eastern Canada/North Atlantic.

Between Friday and Sunday the models are gradually refining the
details of how shortwave energy initially over the northern High
Plains will close off an upper low and displace a leading Midwest
system.  Consensus for the associated surface evolution is for the
leading low to lift northward while a developing southern
Plains/Mississippi Valley wave tracks into the Great Lakes.  A
leading wavy front extending through the Mid-Atlantic has trended
somewhat northward from recent continuity, with 18Z/00Z GFS runs
on the northern side of the spread.  GEFS means are a little less
extreme in that regard, recommending a more moderate continuity
adjustment.  Further adjustments can be made if these trends
continue.

Farther upstream the guidance is well clustered for another
vigorous shortwave reaching western North America by early
Saturday.  Most solutions say this feature will close off another
upper low which should track over or near the northern tier
states.  18Z/00Z GFS and GEFS mean runs have trended a bit
eastward of established consensus for this feature late in the
period.  For now would favor leaning somewhat more toward the 12Z
run for GFS/GEFS input.

By next Monday-Tuesday a number of recent GFS runs have wanted to
dig a fairly deep trough/upper low over the West.  Teleconnections
relative to the eastern Canada ridging favor some modest troughing
over the southwestern U.S./far northwestern Mexico but not so much
troughing over the Northwest, while some ridging should extend
into western Canada.  GEFS/ECMWF/CMC means all compare more
favorably to teleconnection-favored flow over the West.

Based on the above considerations, the forecast blend started with
a 12Z model composite early in the period followed by increasing
12Z GEFS/ECMWF/CMC mean input with the rest consisting of the only
the last two ECMWF runs by day 7 Tuesday.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

The forecast pattern will likely produce a fairly broad area of
precipitation over the eastern half of the lower 48 for portions
of the period.  The best signal for heaviest rainfall currently
exists from near the Gulf Coast into the southern-central
Appalachians, and possibly west into the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys,
late this week into the weekend.  During this time frame there
will be a decent flow of Gulf moisture ahead of southern Plains
into Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes surface development that will
be supported by High Plains into Midwest dynamics aloft.  Separate
southern stream energy will also likely play a role in southern
tier rain/thunderstorms.

The Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies will see a period
of rain and mountain snow from late this week into the weekend.
The forecast has been consistent in showing highest liquid totals
over the Olympics and Washington Cascades.  By late weekend into
early next week the associated development at the surface and
aloft may produce areas of enhanced precipitation over the
northern Plains and vicinity.  Some of this precipitation could
fall in the form of snow.  Other areas of rain may develop farther
south over the central U.S.  The majority of guidance indicates a
drying trend to the west of the Plains early next week but there
is still a modest potential for some precipitation to linger over
the north-central Rockies.

The most extreme temperature anomalies will be over southern Texas
on Friday with highs up to 10-20F above normal and over portions
of the East from late week into the weekend, especially for
morning lows that will be 10-20F above normal due to warm moist
flow ahead of an initial system and trailing development.
Portions of the Great Lakes could see morning lows near record
warm values on Friday.  Best potential for highs 10-15F above
normal will be over the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes area
Friday-Saturday.  From the weekend into early next week expect
highs of 5-15F below normal to progress across the Northwest and
northern Rockies behind a cold front pushing through the Northwest
and into the Plains.  Anomalies may moderate a bit by the time the
airmass reaches the Plains.  The southern half of the West will
tend to see above normal temperatures with most anomalies in the
plus 5-12F range.  Warmest days should be Friday-Saturday with a
slight rebound again over the West Coast states next Tuesday.

A surface low pressure system is forecast to move east across the
Plains into the Midwest by Thursday. A trailing cold front will
push to the southeast across the Central and Southern Plains,
while a quasi-stationary front extends east across the Midwest and
to the southeast across the Mid-Atlantic. Widespread heavy rain
along with severe thunderstorms are likely with this system as it
progresses east. Ahead of the cold front, the Storm Prediction
Center has delineated a Slight Risk of severe weather for hail and
wind threats over the Central Plains through tonight. The severe
weather shifts to the Lower Mississippi Valley Wednesday with a
Slight Risk of hail, wind, and tornadoes, and a Marginal Risk of
these hazards extending to the northwest across the lower Missouri
Valley. Training convection ahead of the cold front in the
vicinity of the surface low may lead to 1 to 2 inches of rain
through tomorrow morning across Kansas where there is a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall. Additionally, 1 to locally 3 inches of
rain will be possible for eastern South Dakota into the Upper
Mississippi Valley near the stationary front through Thursday.
Farther south, some areas in the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys could receive a couple of inches of rain through Wednesday
night. A Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall is in place for the
potential of localized flooding or flash flooding given the wet
ground conditions.

Behind the surface low pressure system, the associated upper-level
low will cause below normal temperatures and provide lift for snow
to develop in the Northern/Central Rockies and Central High Plains
through tonight. Higher elevations of the Black Hills could see 6+
inches of snow, while lower elevations of the Central Rockies and
Central High Plains could see some snow, but lighter amounts.
Winter Storm Warnings are in place for the Black Hills, with
Winter Weather Advisories in place for portions of southern
Montana, eastern Wyoming, northwestern Nebraska, and southwestern
South Dakota.

In the Southwest and Southern High Plains, warm temperatures are
forecast along with gusty winds and low relative humidity values,
and this combination will lead to the potential for dangerous fire
weather conditions. The Storm Prediction Center has outlined a
Critical Risk of fire weather for most of New Mexico as well as
portions of southeastern Colorado and western Texas through
tomorrow morning, and widespread Red Flag Warnings are in effect
as well. Elevated to Critical Risks are once again in place for
much of New Mexico and southwest Texas on Wednesday. Ahead of the
Central U.S. storm system, warmer than average temperatures are
expected for much of the contiguous U.S. Behind the system,
underneath the upper low, cooler than average temperatures are
forecast for parts of the north-central U.S. Cooler temperatures
will also overspread the Northwest behind a cold front by Thursday
as the next storm system moves eastward. The highest temperature
anomalies are forecast for the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley
regions, with highs around 15 to 25 degrees above normal through
Thursday.

Elsewhere, some light rain and occasional thunderstorms are
possible along the stationary front across the Mid-Atlantic. The
Northwest can also expect an increasing chance for precipitation
Wednesday into Thursday as the next frontal system moves eastward.
Over a foot of snow is forecast for the Cascades for Wednesday
into Wednesday night.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and means continue to show a blocky pattern covering
portions of North America into the Atlantic, with upper ridging
likely from eastern Canada through southern Greenland while a
couple of upper lows/surface systems head into the Great Lakes and
yet another upper low meanders near the Canadian Maritimes.
Farther west, as ridging builds into western Canada (consistent
with teleconnections relative to the eastern Canada/southern
Greenland ridge as well as the Pacific trough to the west)
solutions continue to diverge by early-mid week for possible
western U.S. troughing.

The forecast approach maintains good continuity from the past
couple cycles, incorporating a model blend early followed by a
trend toward the ensemble means and some ECMWF input.  However
there is the ongoing possibility for future change should guidance
start clustering toward any minority ideas.

During the weekend there is good agreement in principle that a
compact Midwest into Great Lakes shortwave/upper low will promote
fairly strong and concentrated surface low development from the
Mississippi Valley into Great Lakes.  There is still some spread
for track though.  The front anchored by this low should continue
across the East with embedded low pressure continuing over the
western Atlantic.  Then a majority of guidance including the
ensemble means would have a larger scale shortwave reaching into
western North America by early Saturday, leading to an upper low
that crosses the northern tier states and eventually reaches the
Great Lakes.  The corresponding surface low would bring another
frontal system across the lower 48 during the weekend and the
first half of next week.  Both upper lows exhibit some sensitivity
in terms of whether they stay in the Great Lakes region or
some/all of their energy may get carried farther eastward by more
progressive mean flow to the south.  Some recent GFS/CMC runs have
tended to be the solutions exhibiting the latter idea while their
ensemble means have been holding back closer to the ECMWF.  On the
other hand the means could be lagging the models in their
depiction of the Canadian Maritimes upper low.  Confidence is low
for precise movement of this low, with the GFS/CMC actually
bringing it back to or near New England by next Wednesday versus
remaining guidance that is farther east.

As for western troughing, teleconnections relative to the strong
positive height anomalies over or just east of eastern Canada
continue to support the more modest depictions of the
GEFS/ECMWF/CMC means versus the deeper trough and embedded closed
low scenario that the GFS has been showing over the past couple
days and now joined by the 00Z CMC.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

During the weekend expect the strengthening Mississippi Valley
into Great Lakes system and its associated fronts to focus areas
of moderate to heavy rainfall over portions of the eastern U.S.
Heaviest rain should be over and near the central and eastern Gulf
Coast.  Significant totals could also be possible closer to the
upper/surface low depending on training within any rain bands.
The next system emerging from the West will bring mostly light
rain/higher elevation snow to northern parts of that region and
then some rain/thunderstorms to the eastern half of the country
but in most cases with lighter amounts than expected for the
preceding system.  Some of the precipitation could be in the form
of snow over parts of the extreme northern tier from late weekend
into next week.  During the early to middle part of next week the
combination of cyclonic flow aloft and low level upslope flow
could produce some precipitation over the central/south-central
Rockies, though with considerable uncertainty over coverage and
amounts.

Warm flow ahead of the developing storm tracking into the Great
Lakes this weekend will bring widespread lows of 10-20F or so
above normal over the East Saturday-Sunday and plus 10-25F
anomalies for highs in a more focused area from the Great
Lakes/Upper Ohio Valley into New England on Saturday.
Temperatures will drop to within a few degrees on either side of
normal behind this system's cold front.  The next system initially
coming into western North America will spread below normal highs
(minus 5-15F anomalies) across the Northwest/northern Rockies
during the weekend and then into the central/east-central U.S.
Monday into Wednesday.  Southern parts of the West will remain
above normal through the period and an upper ridge approaching
from the Pacific may expand coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for
highs over northern California and the Northwest early-mid week.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will slow its progression today as it reaches
the Lower Missouri Valley. In the Northwest, an upper-level trough
will reach portions of the Northern Rockies. At the surface a cold
front will continue southward through Texas to near the Gulf coast
with the deepening of the Midwest cyclone. Another cyclone is
forecast to develop in the lee of the Canadian Rockies.

...New Mexico into western Texas...
With the surface low continuing to become further removed from the
region during the day, the potential for widespread critical fire
weather will be low. However, a very deep boundary layer will
develop by afternoon and mix strong winds to the surface across
portions of central New Mexico. Here, RH of 5-15% will overlap with
20 mph surface winds. In southern New Mexico, the RH could be even
lower, though winds will be lighter with the mid-level jet to the
north. Farther east into Texas, RH will be 10-25% with winds
generally in the 15-20 mph range. Locally elevated conditions could
occur as far east as portions of central Texas. Stronger winds will
be displaced to the north, however, and fuels are less receptive
that far east.

...North-central Montana...
15-25% RH is possible during the afternoon in the lee of the
Rockies. Winds could approach 20 mph in some locations as the
surface low deepens across the Canadian border. The spatial extent
of the dry/windy conditions will not be overly large, but recent
large fire activity suggests there is enough concern for elevated
highlights.

...Central North Dakota...
The deepening surface low in western/central Iowa will drive
enhanced northeasterly winds across portions of eastern and central
North Dakota. Mid and upper-level clouds will likely be present. A
narrow region of 20-25% RH is possible along the back edge of the
cloud shield. Given recent fire activity, fine fuels will carry
fire. Confidence in the duration of 15-20 mph winds is too low for
highlights, but locally elevated conditions do appear possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0219 AM CDT Wed Apr 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will continue to pivot northward into the
upper Great Lakes region on Thursday. A trough upstream in the
northern Rockies will slide southeastward into the central Rockies
by the end of the forecast period. Moderate mid-level westerly winds
will exist across a broad swath of the southwestern U.S. At the
surface, a large surface trough will extend from the Midwestern low
westward to the Continental Divide. A cold front will begin to move
into the Great Basin with high pressure increasing across the
Pacific Northwest.

...Southwest into the Trans-Pecos...
Deep boundary-layer mixing will bring enhanced winds to the surface.
Most areas will see 15-20 mph, though a few areas of 20+ may occur.
RH will fall to 5-15%. Elevated fire weather is expected during the
afternoon. The lack of stronger flow aloft and a relatively weak
surface pressure pattern should keep critical conditions localized.

...Southern into eastern Utah...
A shortwave trough will approach from the northwest, though the
stronger winds associated with it will likely be displaced farther
northward during peak heating. Similarly, the front and increasing
surface pressure gradient will also not occur until the
evening/overnight. However, locally elevated to near critical
conditions are at least possible in these areas where fuels have
sufficiently cured.

...Santa Barbara/Ventura County Mountains...
High pressure off the West Coast will drive northerly winds into the
Transverse Ranges. 20-25 mph winds are possible in the higher
terrain with RH falling as low as 10-20% into Thursday evening. Lack
of precipitation over the past two weeks has allowed fuels to cure
with ERCs reaching above normal and relatively high for this time of
year. The locally elevated risk should remain confined to the higher
terrain.

...Heavy rain and the potential for severe thunderstorms are
expected for the central U.S. for the next couple of days...

...Snow is likely in the Cascades and Northern Rockies as frontal
systems pass through...

...Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather remain in place in
and around New Mexico...

A surface low pressure system is forecast to move slowly through
the Middle/Upper Mississippi Valley over the next couple of days,
sweeping a cold front slowly eastward across the Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley and toward the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys.
Widespread moderate to heavy rain along with severe thunderstorms
are likely with this system ahead of the cold front. The Storm
Prediction Center has delineated a Slight to Enhanced Risk of
severe weather for tornado, wind, and hail threats centered over
the Lower Mississippi Valley for today into tonight. Some
locations in that region could also receive a couple inches of
rain, and given the wet ground conditions there, localized
flooding and flash flooding are possible through tonight. As the
cold front pushes slowly eastward, the Southeast and Tennessee
Valley could see increasing chances of rain and storms on
Thursday. Rain and thunderstorms are also likely farther north of
the low across the Upper Midwest where draping stationary fronts
reside through the next few days. Then on Friday, the
south-central to southeastern U.S. could once again see severe
thunderstorms and heavy rain causing flooding, as rain spreads
toward the Eastern Seaboard as well.

In the northwestern U.S., upper-level energy and frontal systems
are expected to move through today into Thursday, which will
produce cooler than normal temperatures there as well as
precipitation chances. Snow totals should be highest in the
Washington Cascades, which are forecast to see over a foot of snow
mainly through tonight, while the Northern Rockies can expect up
to 6 inches of snow in higher elevations.

In the Southwest and Southern High Plains, warm temperatures are
forecast along with gusty winds and low relative humidity values,
and this combination will lead to the potential for continued
dangerous fire weather conditions. The Storm Prediction Center has
outlined a Critical Risk of fire weather for portions of New
Mexico today, with an Elevated Risk for southeastern Arizona, much
of New Mexico, and western Texas, and Red Flag Warnings are in
place for New Mexico and southern Colorado. Additionally, an
Elevated Risk is in place for north-central Montana today. For
Thursday, conditions are still favorable for fire development in
and around New Mexico, and an Elevated Risk is again in place.

In general, most of the contiguous U.S. should see above normal
temperatures over the next few days, with the exceptions being the
Northwest (as mentioned) and central portions of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley underneath the upper low. The Great Lakes
region can expect high temperatures to be around 15 to 25 degrees
above normal today, and a few daily records could be set. The
Desert Southwest and southern Texas will experience temperatures
in the 90s and nearing 100 degrees over the next few days.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1038 AM CDT Sat Aug 28 2021

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Elevated conditions remain probable this afternoon for southern
Wyoming south of a stalled cold front. Winds near 15 mph may
occasionally gust up to 25-30 mph, but morning fuel guidance
continues to suggest that fuels are only modestly dry (ERC values
between the 50th-70th percentiles) that will keep fire weather
concerns limited to locally drier locations.  Brief and localized
elevated conditions remain possible for the northern Sacramento
Valley, but the probability for widespread and persistent elevated
conditions is low.

..Moore.. 08/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0101 AM CDT Sat Aug 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move through the northern Rockies towards
the upper Mississippi Valley today. Generally zonal flow will
develop across a sizable portion of the West. At the surface, high
pressure over the Northwest will weaken and shift into the Plains. A
weak boundary will move into the central Plains as the trough moves
east.

...Northern California...
Short-lived dry and windy conditions will exist early in the period
as high pressure will remain in the northern Rockies. Diminishing
flow aloft and at the surface will keep elevated conditions in parts
of the northern Sacramento Valley local and brief.

...Southern Wyoming...
Mid-level winds across Wyoming will be strong, especially in the
morning and early afternoon. These winds will weaken as the trough
moves east through the afternoon and evening. Given the sub-optimal
timing of the trough and uncertainty with the approach of the
boundary from the north, confidence is low on elevated conditions
being more than brief.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 PM CDT Sat Aug 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed
based on recent trends in ensemble guidance. Deterministic solutions
have delayed the arrival of stronger mid-level flow until Sunday
evening/overnight for the northern Sierra, limiting the potential
for more widespread elevated and/or critical conditions. See the
discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 08/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0102 AM CDT Sat Aug 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Sunday, zonal flow across the Northwest will gradually evolve
into broadly cyclonic flow as far south as the northern Great Basin.
The surface pressure pattern will remain rather diffuse. A modest
increase in mid-level winds across the northern Sierra will likely
promote low-end elevated fire weather conditions during the
afternoon and early evening. Winds of 15-20 mph with 10-15% will
exist. Confidence in the these conditions lasting a few hours is
greatest in the immediate lee of the Sierra. Locally elevated
conditions may extend into parts of northeastern Nevada, but
duration and spatial extent are too uncertain for highlights.

...Major Hurricane Ida to bring a Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat
from the central Gulf Coast to the Mid-Atlantic...

...Hurricane Nora likely will fuel a lead Southwest U.S. Heavy
Rain Threat mid-later next week...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The big story during the medium range period continues to be
impending hazardous impacts from both Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of
Mexico, as well as Hurricane Nora, forecast to track northward up
the Gulf of California. Please refer to products from the National
Hurricane Center and the local offices for the latest regarding
these systems.

For Ida, the guidance is in reasonably good agreement early next
week but larger uncertainties arise after day 5 on whatever is
left of Ida at that time (likely a remnant low). Most of the
guidance shows the remnants of Ida becoming absorbed into the
northern stream trough, but also suggest a southern component of
the leftover energy sliding south/southeastward along the East
coast with some models (like the 00z ECMWF) stronger than others
in a reflection of a surface low. Prefer a sort of middle ground
solution maintaining a wave along the frontal boundary as it exits
the Mid-Atlantic.

Elsewhere, guidance shows good agreement days 3-5 both with a
digging trough over the Western U.S. and a northern stream trough
sliding across the Northeast. After day 5, there's uncertainty
with evolution of a closed low into central Canada in terms of
timing, which translates to some smaller scale differences down
into the northern CONUS but a blend towards the ensemble means
should help mitigate those more difficult to resolve details at
this time.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived with a
blend of the ECMWF, GFS, and CMC for days 3-5, with increasing
ensemble mean support thereafter. For Ida and Nora impacts, the
WPC progs reflect the latest track guidance from the NHC. Overall,
this approach maintains good continuity with previous WPC
forecast.


...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Dangerous Hurricane Ida is expected to strengthen further over the
Gulf of Mexico as it moves steadily towards the northwest with an
expected landfall along the Louisiana coast late Sunday as a major
hurricane. Ida will bring powerful and gusty winds and very heavy
rainfall to the central Gulf Coast region. At the start of the
medium range period on Tuesday, a gradually weakening but still
very wet Ida is forecast to make a sharp turn to the
east-northeast spreading the heavy rainfall threat into the
Tennessee/Ohio Valleys Tuesday and into Wednesday. Considerable
flash, urban, small stream, and riverine flooding is likely with
Ida. Deep moisture feeding inland with time will also interact
with a slow moving front draped over the system, offering a lead
heavy rainfall focus into the central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic into Wednesday and Thursday.

The latest track guidance for Hurricane Nora brings it northward
into the Gulf of California and eventually into far northwest
Mexico, with the expectation that it will weaken rather quickly as
it interacts with the Mexican terrain. Leading deep tropical
moisture ahead of Nora will likely fuel a Southwest U.S. heavy
rain threat by the middle of next week. The guidance continues to
show some uncertainty in the track and certainly a track for
longer over the Gulf waters could bring a more substantial heavy
rainfall threat into the Southwest. By later next week, leading
moisture may also bring moderate to locally heavy, and terrain
enhanced, rains into the central Rockies as well.

Elsewhere, ample northern stream upper troughing will meanwhile
dig a wavy but only modestly unsettling/cooling front down from
the Northwest. Subsequent system progressions and genesis
mid-later next week out across the Rockies to the north-central
U.S. will increasingly focus an enhanced convection/rainfall
pattern that could focus locally heavy convection/rainfall as
enhanced by embedded impulses and frontal/wave reinforcements.
Moisture/instability pooling may support some locally strong to
severe convection and heavy downpours.

...Major Hurricane Ida to bring a Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat
from the central Gulf Coast to the Mid-Atlantic...

...Hurricane Nora likely will fuel a lead Southwest U.S. Heavy
Rain Threat mid-later next week...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The big story during the medium range period continues to be
impending hazardous impacts from both Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of
Mexico, as well as Hurricane Nora, forecast to track northward up
the Gulf of California. Please refer to products from the National
Hurricane Center and the local offices for the latest regarding
these systems.

For Ida, the guidance is in reasonably good agreement early next
week but larger uncertainties arise after day 5 on whatever is
left of Ida at that time (likely a remnant low). Most of the
guidance shows the remnants of Ida becoming absorbed into the
northern stream trough, but also suggest a southern component of
the leftover energy sliding south/southeastward along the East
coast with some models (like the 00z ECMWF) stronger than others
in a reflection of a surface low. Prefer a sort of middle ground
solution maintaining a wave along the frontal boundary as it exits
the Mid-Atlantic.

Elsewhere, guidance shows good agreement days 3-5 both with a
digging trough over the Western U.S. and a northern stream trough

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat August 28 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Hurricane Ida is forecast to intensify rapidly to major
hurricane strength before making landfall on the Louisiana coast
during the day on Sunday...

...Strong to severe thunderstorms possible across the northern
Plains to the upper Midwest tonight ahead of a developing low
pressure system...

...Heat persisting through the weekend over much of the Desert
Southwest, parts of the Midwest and the Carolinas...

Hurricane Ida is becoming a formidable force of nature forecast to
take aim at the Louisiana on Sunday.  The hurricane is currently
expanding in size while strengthening over the anomalously warm
waters of the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  Ida is forecast to
intensify rapidly to major hurricane strength before making
landfall on the Louisiana coast during the day on Sunday.  Squall
and heavy downpours associated with the outer rainbands of Ida are
expected to reach southern Louisiana tonight along with
increasingly strong and gusty winds.  Torrential rain driven by
destructive hurricane-force winds can be expected to lash the
Louisiana coast as the eye of the hurricane makes landfall on
Sunday.

The front extending from the northern Mid-Atlantic westward to the
Great Lakes then into the Great Basin has a wave of low pressure
over South-Central Canada will pull the front northward into
Canada on Sunday.  On Monday, the trailing front will extend from
the Lower Great Lakes westward to another wave of low pressure
over the Northern High Plains. The system will produce showers and
thunderstorms along and near the boundary from the Northern High
Plains to the Great Lakes, as some of the storms will be very
energetic. As a result, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over the Upper Mississippi Valley through
Sunday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes. There is a 10% or greater probability of 65 knots
or greater wind gusts over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley.
Additionally, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through Sunday
morning.

The severe thunderstorm threat decreases to a marginal threat on
Sunday into Monday.  The excessive rainfall threat also diminishes
over the Upper Midwest on Sunday into Monday morning. Over the
Gulf Coast, tropical moisture and upper-level impulses will
produce showers and thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast into the
Southeast on Saturday.

Elsewhere, upper-level impulses and diurnal heating will produce
showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Southwest into the
Southern High Plains from the late afternoon into the late evening
on Saturday and Sunday.  Additionally, heat will also produce
hazards. Heat Advisories are posted over parts of the Great Lakes
and the Middle Mississippi Valley, where high temperatures are
forecast in the upper 80s to low 90s. Moreover, many areas of the
Midwest will have the possibility of record high minimum
temperatures on Saturday and Sunday morning. In the Southwest,
highs in the 110s are expected on Saturday, and an Excessive Heat
Warning remains in effect for the area through Saturday evening.

Hurricane Ida is becoming a formidable force of nature forecast to
take aim at the Louisiana on Sunday.  The hurricane is currently
expanding in size while strengthening over the anomalously warm
waters of the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  Ida is forecast to
intensify rapidly to major hurricane strength before making
landfall on the Louisiana coast during the day on Sunday.  Squalls
and heavy downpours associated with the outer rainbands of Ida are
expected to reach southern Louisiana tonight along with
increasingly strong and gusty winds.  Torrential rain driven by
destructive hurricane-force winds will then lash the Louisiana
coast as the eye of the hurricane makes landfall on Sunday.  All
actions pertaining to protecting lives and properties should be
rushed to completion by tonight.  After landfall, Ida is expected
to turn more slowly to the north across central Louisiana Sunday
night.  The slower motion would prolong the impacts of high winds
and torrential rains along the path of Ida.  Ida is forecast to
weaken to tropical storm strength as it reaches southern
Mississippi Monday morning.  Much of Louisiana into southern
Mississippi will likely experience sustained  tropical storm force
winds early on Monday with hurricane-force wind gusts remain
possible.  In addition, wind-driven heavy rain will continue to
pound the area, leading to the possibility of life-threatening
flash flooding spreading up into the lower Mississippi Valley by
Monday evening.

Farther north across the northern Plains, a developing low
pressure system interacting with a couple of frontal systems will
keep an elevated risk of strong to severe thunderstorms across the
upper Midwest through tonight.  As the low pressure system
intensifies and heads into Ontario Canada on Sunday, the risk of
severe thunderstorms will decrease.  However, showers and
thunderstorms can be expected across the Great Lakes on Sunday
ahead of the trailing cold front.  By Monday, scattered showers
and thunderstorms are expected to extend from across the Ohio
Valley to New England.  Meanwhile, summer heat and humidity will
persist across the Midwest, Ohio Valley, and into the
Mid-Atlantic.  New England and the northern Mid-Atlantic will be
slightly cooler under the influence of the nearby cooler Atlantic
waters.

Meanwhile, much of the western U.S. will remain dry through
Monday.  The exception will be across the higher terrains of
Arizona and New Mexico where some late-day monsoonal showers and
thunderstorms can be expected through Monday.  The Desert
Southwest will remain quite hot into Monday with Heat Advisories
and Excessive Heat Warnings remain in effect.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1256 AM CDT Sun Aug 29 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow is expected to develop across the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Great Basin today. Enhancement of
mid-level winds across the northern Sierra will likely promote an
area of elevated fire weather in the immediate lee of the terrain.
With the surface pressure pattern expected to be rather benign,
these conditions are not expected to be widespread. It is possible,
however, that locally elevated conditions could occur in parts of
central Oregon into northeastern Nevada.

1257 AM CDT Sun Aug 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR LEE OF NORTHERN SIERRA...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level winds will increase across the Pacific Northwest into the
northern Great Basin on Monday. With the surface pressure gradient
also increasing, areas of critical fire weather are possible.

...Northern Nevada...
Sustained 20 mph winds are most likely to occur in the lee of the
northern Sierra. These strong downslope winds will aid low-level
drying. Afternoon RH may dip below 10% locally with most areas
reaching 10-15%. Elevated conditions are likely to extend into parts
of north-central and northeast Nevada as wind speeds will only reach
15-20 mph.

...Columbia Gorge...Cascade Gaps...
The strongest mid-level winds are expected to occur across Oregon
and Washington. With a surface trough in the Columbia Basin, strong
westerly winds are likely within the Columbia Gorge and the Cascade
gaps. There is spread in guidance as to how low RH will fall (some
models showing areas below 20%), though 20-25% seems most probable
immediately downstream of the terrain features. The RH uncertainty
and marginal fuels indicate and elevated fire risk despite 20-25 mph
winds.

...Ida Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat from the Central Gulf Coast
Today to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Midweek...

...Nora lead moisture to fuel a Southwest U.S. Heavy Rain Threat
mid-later week...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Impending hazardous high impacts are expected from Major Hurricane
Ida's looming landfall into Louisiana as well as Hurricane Nora
that is forecast to track northward up the Gulf of California and
into northwest Mexico. Please refer to products from the National
Hurricane Center and the local offices for the latest regarding
these dangerous systems.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered guidance from the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF
ensemble mean and 18 UTC GEFS mean. Of the models, the 12 UTC
ECMWF has the best ensemble support for both northern stream
system transitions and convection potential and also fits close to
the latest Ida and Nora forecasts from the National Hurricane
Center. The pattern offers better than average forecast
predictability, albeit with some lingering model system timing
variance that seems to have decreased marginally with advent of
latest 00 UTC model runs.

...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Dangerous Hurricane Ida is expected to strengthen further over the
Gulf of Mexico as it moves steadily towards the northwest with an
expected landfall along the Louisiana coast today as a major
hurricane. By the start of the medium range period Wednesday and
lingering into Thursday, a steadily weakening/exiting but still
very wet Ida is forecast to spread a heavy rainfall threat from
the upper Ohio Valley/Central Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic and
southern portions of the Northeast as leading deep moisture
interacts with a slow moving front draped over the system. Cell
training and terrain will significantly enhance the runoff threat
within a well defined precipitation axis.

The latest track guidance for Hurricane Nora brings it northward
into the Gulf of California and eventually into northwest Mexico,
with the expectation that it will weaken rather quickly as it
interacts with the Mexican terrain. Leading deep tropical moisture
ahead of Nora will likely fuel a Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat
by the middle of the week. The guidance continues to show some
uncertainty in the track and certainly a track for longer over the
Gulf waters could bring a more substantial heavy rainfall threat
into the Southwest. By later next week, leading moisture may also
bring moderate to locally heavy, and terrain enhanced rains into
the central Rockies as well.

Elsewhere, ample northern stream upper troughing will meanwhile
dig a wavy and modestly unsettling/cooling front down from the
Northwest. Subsequent system progressions and genesis mid-later
next week out across the Rockies to the north-central U.S. will
increasingly focus an enhanced convection/rainfall pattern that
should focus locally heavy convection/rainfall as enhanced by
embedded impulses and frontal/wave reinforcements.
Moisture/instability pooling and height falls will likely support
some locally strong to severe convection and heavy downpours.

Hurricane IDA is forecast to intensify rapidly to a major
hurricane before making landfall on the Louisiana Coast on Sunday.
 Squalls and heavy downpours associated with the outer rain bands
of Ida impact Louisiana, along with the increasingly strong and
gusty wind.  Torrential rain driven by destructive hurricane-force
wind will damage the Louisiana coast as the eye of the hurricane
makes landfall on Sunday.  All actions about protecting lives and
properties should be rushed to completion.  Amongst other hazards,
there will be a High Risk of excessive rainfall through Monday
morning.  Check with the NHC=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs latest bulletin for the mos=
t
up-to-date track and intensity of IDA. The heavy wind-driven rain
has led the WPC to issue a High Risk of excessive rainfall over
the Central Gulf Coast through Monday morning. Severe, widespread
flash flooding is expected with IDA. Areas that normally do not
experience flash flooding will flood. Lives and property are in
great danger.  Additionally, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe weather for tornado potential associated with IDA.

IDA will slowly start to weaken after landfall while moving
northward into the Tennessee Valley by Tuesday.  The excessive
rainfall threat will be Moderate over parts of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys through Tuesday evening into
Wednesday.  The severe weather threat will continue for tornado
potential associated with IDA through Tuesday morning.

Meanwhile, a front over the Upper Great Lakes into the Central
Rockies will move eastward, moving off the Northeast Coast and
extending across the Ohio/Middle Mississippi Valleys into the
Northern High Plains by Tuesday. Showers and thunderstorms will
develop along and ahead of the boundary from the Great Lakes into
the Northeast by Monday. As a result, the SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Upper Great Lakes
through Monday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  The severe thunderstorm threat
will weaken slightly over the Northeast on Monday into Tuesday
morning.  Showers and thunderstorms will continue along and near
the front from parts of the Northern/Central Plains into the
Ohio/Middle Mississippi Valley on Monday into Tuesday. As a
result, there will be a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Middle Missouri Valley on Monday into Tuesday.

Elsewhere, upper-level impulses and diurnal heating will produce
showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Southwest into the
Southern Plains from the late afternoon into the late evening on
Sunday and Monday. Additionally, heat will also produce hazards.
Therefore, Excessive Heat Warnings are in effect over Southern
California into parts of the Southwest through Monday.

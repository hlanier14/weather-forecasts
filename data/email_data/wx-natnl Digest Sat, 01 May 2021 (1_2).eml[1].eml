Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1149 AM CDT Fri Apr 30 2021

Valid 301700Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN MONTANA AND WESTERN NORTH
DAKOTA...

Elevated conditions appear probable in parts of central/eastern
North Dakota based on North Dakota mesonet data. The elevated area
has been expanded to include areas where relatively less cloud cover
will exist into the afternoon. There are signals that locally
dry/windy conditions will occur as far east as the Red River Valley,
but visible satellite suggest greater cloud cover for a longer
duration.

Current surface observations in Virginia and North Carolina show
slightly drier conditions than most guidance. The elevated area has
been expanded to include current elevated conditions along with
where the preferred RAP/HRRR solutions show elevated continuing
through the afternoon.

..Wendt.. 04/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CDT Fri Apr 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Amplified mid-level ridging centered over the Four Corners will
drive strong northwesterly flow with an embedded shortwave trough
across the northern Rockies/Plains while multi-episodic troughing
develops across the East Coast. At the surface, high pressure across
the central Plains will shift southeastward into the Ohio Valley,
while a clipper-like low and surface trough are forecast to move
into northern Minnesota by 06z Saturday.

...Northern Plains...
The mid-level shortwave trough across the western Canadian provinces
will augment low and mid-level pressure gradients across much of
Montana and into the western Dakotas through the day. Surface
pressure falls ahead of the clipper low and surface trough will
enhance northwesterly surface winds to 20-30 mph by early afternoon.
Dry continental trajectories and the downslope nature of the flow
will support widespread critical humidity values of 13-15% atop very
dry fuels. Thus, critical fire weather conditions are expected
across eastern Montana and western North Dakota through this
evening.

...Virginia and the Carolinas...
Post-frontal high pressure shifting into the Ohio Valley will drive
northwesterly flow across the Appalachians and offshore across the
eastern coast of the Carolinas. The dry continental trajectories and
diurnal heating under mostly clear skies will support minimum
surface humidity values in the 25-35% range atop near record dry
fuels. Vertical mixing in the lowest several km of the column will
support momentum transfer from a 60-70 kt northwesterly jet aloft.
Sustained surface winds of 10-20 mph and higher gusts will likely
support elevated fire weather conditions through the afternoon. A
second weaker cold front later in the evening should effectively end
the threat as cooler temperatures and higher humidity recoveries
develop overnight.

...Heavy Rainfall Threat across the South into Tuesday/Wednesday...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Guidance agrees that an active weather pattern will continue next
week as two significant troughs cross the southern tier states and
result in heavy rain and some severe thunderstorms. An warming
upper level ridge becomes established over the Intermountain West
mid-later next week ahead of the next Pacific storm system to
reach the West Coast by next Friday. An additional series of
impulses into the northern tier of the central and eastern U.S.
may amplify by later next week downstream of the western ridge.

Models and ensembles offer below normal forecast spread through
medium range time scales in an early May pattern with good run to
run continuity. The WPC medium range product suite was derived
from a composite blend of 00/06 UTC models and ensembles days 3-5
(Mon-Wed) along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. The 06
UTC GFS/GEFS and 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean solutions are
best clustered into days 6/7 in a pattern with continued above
normal predictability. Latest 12 UTC guidance remains in line.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Multiple rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall are likely to focus
next week across the South as multiple disturbances cross the
region. The region that appears most favored for excessive
rainfall from Texas and the lower MS/TN Valleys through the
Mid-South/Central Gulf Coast states into the southern
Appalachians. Most of this should fall during the
Tuesday-Wednesday time period with deepening moisture/instability
and favorable upper support. This may be enough to cause some
flooding, particularly where convective training develops or
across areas that will have already received noteworthy prior
rains. Periods of frontal focusing convection will meanwhile also
focus from the central Plains through the Midwest, OH Valley and
Northeast with impulse passages. Terrain enhanced snows are also
possible back over the central Rockies early next week.

In terms of temperatures, highs are expected to be about 5-15
degrees above average for much of the eastern U.S. ahead of the
front for early next week, with some 90 degree readings likely
across portions of the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont on
Tuesday. This will be followed by a return to more seasonal to
below normal temperatures to close out the week behind the cold
front. Across the western U.S., heat is expected to build in
response to the upper level ridge, with highs 10-20 degrees above
normal possible for the middle to end of the week for portions of
the Intermountain West and the Desert Southwest. This will equate
to some 100+ degree high temperatures for the lower elevations of
eastern California and southern Arizona.

Valid 12Z Mon May 03 2021 - 12Z Fri May 07 2021

...Heavy Rainfall Threat across the South into Tuesday/Wednesday...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Guidance agrees that an active weather pattern will continue next
week as two significant troughs cross the southern tier states and
result in heavy rain and some severe thunderstorms. An warming
upper level ridge becomes established over the Intermountain West
mid-later next week ahead of the next Pacific storm system to
reach the West Coast by next Friday. An additional series of
impulses into the northern tier of the central and eastern U.S.
may amplify by later next week downstream of the western ridge.

Models and ensembles offer below normal forecast spread through
medium range time scales in an early May pattern with good run to
run continuity. The WPC medium range product suite was derived
from a composite blend of 00/06 UTC models and ensembles days 3-5
(Mon-Wed) along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. The 06
UTC GFS/GEFS and 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean solutions are
best clustered into days 6/7 in a pattern with continued above
normal predictability. Latest 12 UTC guidance remains in line.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Multiple rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall are likely to focus
next week across the South as multiple disturbances cross the
region. The region that appears most favored for excessive
rainfall from Texas and the lower MS/TN Valleys through the
Mid-South/Central Gulf Coast states into the southern
Appalachians. Most of this should fall during the
Tuesday-Wednesday time period with deepening moisture/instability
and favorable upper support. This may be enough to cause some
flooding, particularly where convective training develops or
across areas that will have already received noteworthy prior
rains. Periods of frontal focusing convection will meanwhile also
focus from the central Plains through the Midwest, OH Valley and
Northeast with impulse passages. Terrain enhanced snows are also
possible back over the central Rockies early next week.

In terms of temperatures, highs are expected to be about 5-15
degrees above average for much of the eastern U.S. ahead of the
front for early next week, with some 90 degree readings likely
across portions of the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont on
Tuesday. This will be followed by a return to more seasonal to
below normal temperatures to close out the week behind the cold
front. Across the western U.S., heat is expected to build in
response to the upper level ridge, with highs 10-20 degrees above
normal possible for the middle to end of the week for portions of
the Intermountain West and the Desert Southwest. This will equate
to some 100+ degree high temperatures for the lower elevations of
eastern California and southern Arizona.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook

300 PM EDT Fri Apr 30 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR MAY 2021

During the latter half of April, negative SST anomalies in the tropical
Pacific
have continued to weaken. The Nino 3.4 index currently stands at -0.3C,
representing a 0.2C decrease in magnitude since mid-April as ENSO Neutral
conditions are becoming increasingly likely as we progress deeper into Spring.
This evolving ENSO pattern would tend to favor below normal 500-hPa heights
across much of the higher latitudes and anomalous ridging farther to the south
across the western CONUS. Additionally, the continued weakening of the oceanic
La Nina signal would tend to favor ridge development over the Bering Sea and
an
increasingly incoherent pattern across the eastern CONUS during the month of
May. Compounding this uncertainty is the strengthening of an already strong
ongoing MJO event, which recently transitioned from Phase 7 to Phase 8 in the
Wheeler-Hendon classification. This strong MJO event would act to counteract
the ENSO signal, increasing uncertainty and the likelihood of a variable
pattern across much of the forecast domain. WPC short term and CPC week-2
outlooks, dynamical model guidance, trends, and analysis of antecedent
boundary
layer conditions were used to resolve competing background ENSO and MJO
signals
where applicable.



Above normal temperatures are favored for most of the southern half of the
CONUS, consistent with CFSv2 dynamical model guidance and trends. However, the
ongoing MJO event is increasingly favoring cold across much of the CONUS which
is coinciding with diminishing ENSO influences, particularly across the
eastern
CONUS. Therefore, probabilities of above normal temperatures were reduced
across the eastern CONUS relative to the previous May outlook. A small region
of favored below normal temperatures was introduced for parts of the Great
Lakes Region and Upper Mississippi Valley, where short term WPC and week-2 CPC
outlooks indicate a fairly persistent cold signal. The highest probabilities
of
above normal temperatures are indicated from the Southern Plains to the
Southwest, where a coherent warm signal remains from ENSO composites. Also,
these elevated probabilities are consistent with low soil moisture (below the
10th percentile). The temperature outlook for Alaska is mostly similar to the
previous May outlook as below normal temperatures remain favored for
southwestern Mainland Alaska and parts of the Panhandle, consistent with ENSO
composites. Confidence in the cold signal is relatively higher for
southwestern
Mainland Alaska relative to the Panhandle as the former has dynamical model
support from the CFSv2. However, due in part to rapid snow melt, the area of
favored below normal temperatures has been reduced across Alaska relative to
the previous outlook. Above normal temperatures are likely for northern
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, consistent with dynamical model guidance
and
recent trends.



Wetter than normal conditions are likely for much of the east-central CONUS,
as
a storm system early in the month will likely result in increased rainfall for
much of this region. This area of enhanced above normal precipitation
probabilities is mostly consistent with the previous May outlook. Exceptions
are eastern portions of the Southern Plains and the western Gulf Coast Region,
as the storm system currently affecting much of Texas is expected to linger
into the weekend. Drier than normal conditions are likely farther to the west,
from the southern High Plains to parts of the West Coast, consistent with
dynamical model guidance and trends. A small area of enhanced probabilities of
above normal precipitation was introduced to parts of the northern High
Plains,
consistent with CFSv2 dynamical model guidance. The precipitation outlook for
Alaska is consistent with ENSO composites, which maintain a wet signal for the
Alaska Panhandle and a dry signal for the southwestern Mainland. However,
probabilities of below normal precipitation were reduced across southwestern
mainland Alaska relative to the previous May outlook due to lack of dynamical
model support.



******************************************************************************

********** Previous forecast discussion from mid-April is below ************

******************************************************************************



The May 2021 outlooks are issued against the backdrop of a weakening La Nina
and an ongoing strong MJO event. The Nino 3.4 index currently stands at -0.5C,
which represents a significant weakening relative to the value during much of
the past winter when the average index value was near -1.0C. The oceanic La
Nina signal is generally forecast to weaken further in May and ENSO Neutral
conditions are expected to become the most likely scenario as we progress
deeper into Spring. Weakening La Ninas of this magnitude and evolution tend to
result in below normal heights at high latitudes during the month of May,
including most of Alaska. Farther to the south, above normal heights typically
dominate most of the CONUS under such conditions. However, complicating
matters
is an ongoing strong MJO event in the Western Pacific which would tend to
counteract this ENSO signal across much of the forecast domain. Specifically,
composites from strong (defined in this case as a Wheeler-Hendon Index
amplitude greater than 1.0) Western Pacific MJO events occurring this time of
year indicate increased troughing across much of the western CONUS and less
troughing across Alaska during the month of May relative to the underlying
ENSO
signal. It should be noted, however, that the sample size of these MJO
composites is relatively small, thus, reducing the reliability of the signal.
Analysis of the most recent monthly and subseasonal dynamical model guidance,
recent trends, as well as contributions from current environmental conditions,
including soil moisture, snow cover and depth, SSTs, and sea ice extent, were
also utilized in the production of these outlooks. These additional inputs
were
collectively used to resolve the competing background ENSO and MJO signals.



Above normal temperatures are favored for the southern two-thirds of the CONUS
and for much of the Northeast consistent with ENSO composites, trends, and
dynamical model guidance. However, the ongoing MJO event would temper
probabilities, resulting in generally weaker above normal temperature
probabilities from the Rockies westward. Probabilities of warmer than normal
conditions are the greatest (exceeding 60 percent) across the Southern Plains
where warm signals from ENSO composites, dynamical model guidance, soil
moisture, and trends converge with the greatest confidence. Confidence in
above
normal temperatures diminish farther to the north as the current strong MJO
event supports a cold signal across much of the northern tier, which also
coincides with areas where recent trends toward warmer than normal conditions
are at its weakest or absent altogether. This cold MJO signal directly
conflicts with dynamical model guidance, which favors above normal
temperatures
across almost the entire CONUS. For these reasons, equal chances (or EC) of
above, near, or below normal temperatures are indicated across most of the
northern tier of the CONUS. Enhanced probabilities of above normal
temperatures
are also absent for much of Alaska. Deep snow cover, lingering sea ice, and
cold ENSO signals will likely combine to counteract recent trends toward above
normal temperatures across much of the state. Enhanced probabilities of below
normal temperatures are indicated for much of southern mainland Alaska and the
Alaska Panhandle where cold signals from increased snow depth, sea ice, ENSO,
and dynamical model guidance from the NMME, C3S, and ECMWF converge. Above
normal temperatures are favored for parts of northern Alaska where trends are
the strongest. Above normal temperatures are also favored for the Aleutians
where SSTs are near to above normal and trends tilt toward warmer than normal
conditions.



The potential for enhanced north to south temperature gradients is likely to
promote an active pattern across parts of the central and eastern CONUS.
Specifically, dynamical model guidance from the CFSv2, combined ENSO/MJO
composites, and trends support a wet signal stretching from parts of the Corn
Belt eastward across the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic. Therefore, above
normal precipitation is favored for these areas. Enhanced above normal
precipitation probabilities also extend southward to include much of the
Southeast due to support from ENSO/MJO composites and trends. Conversely,
below
normal precipitation is favored across the Southern Plains where dry signals
from the NMME, C3S, ECMWF, soil moisture, and trends converge. Farther to the
west, uncertainty is high as the dry pattern forecast by dynamical model
guidance directly conflicts with a strong wet signal produced by MJO
composites
from northern California to parts of the Central and Northern Rockies.
Additionally, trends are not particularly strong across this region. For these
reasons, equal chances of below, near, and above normal precipitation are
indicated across most the western CONUS. Confidence is somewhat higher across
Alaska as dynamical model guidance and ENSO composites generally agree on a
dry
signal across the southwestern Mainland and the Alaska Peninsula. Conversely,
above normal precipitation is favored across parts of the Alaska Panhandle and
eastern mainland Alaska due to a combination of wet signals from ENSO
composites, trends, and dynamical model guidance.

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1981 and 2010, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

The next monthly outlook...for Jun ... will be issued on Thu May 20 2021

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1981-2010 base period.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Limited adjustments were made on account of more recent guidance.
The central Plains remains a bit of a complex forecast. The
typically drier guidance tends to do a bit better with the initial
return to southerly flow where moisture may lag. Ahead of the
boundary, southerly/southwesterly winds will increase in the lowest
2 km. Sustained winds of 15-20 mph are probable with areas of higher
gusts. Meteorologically, fire weather concerns will be elevated to
near-critical; however, the presence of fuels that are greening will
likely limit the threat for spread/ignitions in most locations. Some
areas of drier, dead fuel beds will still support fire spread, but
the spatial extent is too small for highlights.

..Wendt.. 04/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Fri Apr 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level ridge across the center of the CONUS will flatten
significantly through the first half of the forecast period as
increasing southwesterly flow aloft develops over the West ahead of
a Pacific trough. A closed low over northern Mexico will open and
drift northeast across Texas as East Coast troughing continues. At
the surface, a low over the upper Midwest will gradually fill as a
lee low is forecast to develop across the central Plains and Gulf
moisture begins to return across the eastern half of the CONUS.
Gusty winds across the Great Basin and the northern Plains will
likely support elevated fire weather conditions through the period.

...Southern Great Basin...
Warm and dry surface conditions are expected through the afternoon
hours with temperatures in the 80s to 90s F and humidity of 10-15%.
Model soundings across the area show modest southwesterly flow aloft
of 20-30 kt developing through the day. Deep mixing from the warm
surface temperatures should result in momentum transport to the
surface bolstering winds to around 10-20 mph. The overlap of winds,
humidity, and dry fuels will be more than sufficient for widespread
elevated fire weather conditions to develop. Locally critical fire
weather conditions also appear possible given the favorable
parameter space. However, some uncertainty on the strength of the
mid-level flow and resulting surface winds casts doubt on how
widespread any critical fire weather conditions will be.

...Northern Plains...
Lingering gusty winds behind a weakening low across the upper
Midwest will be sufficient to support elevated fire weather
potential through the afternoon hours across eastern Montana and the
western Dakotas. Model soundings show a deeply mixed boundary layer
with temperatures in the 60s and 70s F. Humidity values will likely
be higher than Day1/Friday around 25-35%, but the combination of
very dry fuels and modest surface flow will support elevated fire
weather conditions through the afternoon hours.

...Central Plains...
Increasing southerly flow ahead of the developing lee low is
expected through the afternoon Day2/Saturday across portions of
western Kansas and eastern Colorado. South winds of 10-20 mph along
with warm temperatures and dry air ahead of the return of Gulf
moisture should support surface RH of 15-20% through peak heating. A
relative minimum in precipitation across the region over the last
several days suggests some potential for brief locally elevated fire
weather conditions through the afternoon hours, before a much more
humid airmass arrives after sunset.

300 PM EDT April 30 2021

SYNOPSIS: Surface low development along the Eastern Seaboard is favored to
bring high winds and potentially hazardous  below-normal temperatures over the
northeastern contiguous U.S. by the start of the period.  A series of surface
lows are anticipated to form over the central and western contiguous U.S.
These
surface lows and associated fronts could bring wet weather to parts of the
Midwest as these disturbances move eastward across the lower 48.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, Sat,

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Upper and
Middle
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley, and
Appalachians, Sat-Sun, May 8-9.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Lower and Middle
Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Tennessee Valley, Sat-Wed, May 8-12.

Slight risk of high winds across parts of the Four Corners region and Central
and Southern Plains,  Sat-Wed, May 8-12.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MAY 03 - FRIDAY MAY 07:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vqo4zTu9Tu7HzHiUzIhHgAzBEXSFvR-XtYiRCQr-exTBgI0rl-3y3BZzENgb68Rr8Zr4LFuX$

FOR SATURDAY MAY 08 - FRIDAY MAY 14: There is increased potential for a strong
storm system to form along the Eastern Seaboard at the beginning of week-2.
Model guidance and reforecast tools favor the greatest likelihood for
resultant
high winds over coastal parts of the Northeast and upper Mid-Atlantic on May
8,
although the GEFS show some ensemble members bringing the surface low further
inland. Due to the high model uncertainty regarding the details of the
evolution of this storm, a broad area is highlighted for a slight risk of high
winds across parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, May 8. Both the ECMWF
and
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance for localized coastal areas
experiencing sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph.
The 12Z deterministic GFS depicts a deeper surface low than the 6Z, with wind
speeds exceeding 40 mph.



As this surface low departs, surface high pressure is forecast to sink
southward from eastern Canada into the  northeastern CONUS, and bring
anomalous
cold air into parts of the region at the beginning of the period. Reforecast
tools support a slight risk of much below normal temperatures, and a
corresponding hazard region is highlighted for parts of the parts of the Upper
and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley, and
Appalachians, May 8 to 9. There is at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and less than 40 DegF,
where
emerging spring vegetation may be susceptible to freezing temperatures and
frost.



The majority of week-2 is anticipated to be dominated by low amplitude
mid-level ridging across the southeastern  CONUS, with mid-level troughing
across the western third. Above normal temperatures are favored across the
southern half of the CONUS, with near to below normal temperatures over the
northern half. A series of surface lows are anticipated to form over the
central and western half of the CONUS throughout week-2. A surface low
centered
over the Southern Plains at the beginning of the period combined with
potential
moist southerly flow into parts of the South-Central and southeastern CONUS
supports a slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Lower and
Middle Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Tennessee Valley, May 8 to 12. A
broad time range for this risk is identified as the ECMWF reforecast tool
favors the earlier portion of week-2, while the GEFS reforecast tool favors
the
middle of the period. Despite the timing differences amongst these tools, both
tools indicate at least a 20% chance of some of these areas receiving 3-day
totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch (one inch rainfall totals
could occur in a 24-hour period). Heavy rainfall could increase the potential
for localized flooding, especially in areas that are currently experiencing
much above normal streamflow and flooding conditions.



The 0Z ECMWF and 0Z GEFS indicate the formation of a series of surface lows
across the southwestern CONUS throughout week-2, which could support episodes
of localized high winds. The reforecast tools indicate the greatest likelihood
for high winds occurring from the beginning to middle of the period. A slight
risk for high winds is posted for an extended period, spanning May 8 to 12 to
account for uncertainty regarding the high wind potential at week-2 associated
with the timing and evolution of the surface lows. The high wind risk area
highlights where both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools indicate at least a
20% chance of sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph.
Localized enhanced wind speeds combined with above normal temperatures would
favor an increased potential for wildfires in the Southwest eastward into
parts
of Texas, where severe drought prevails. Interested parties are advised to
follow their local NWS forecasts carefully.



Mid-level height anomalies are predicted to be fairly weak across Alaska
during
week-2. A series of surface lows are anticipated to form over the Gulf of
Alaska and Bering Sea, but are not anticipated to support any widespread
hazards at this time.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri April 30 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 06 - 10 2021

Dynamical model solutions are in good agreement regarding a transient 500-hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain during the outlook period. Troughing
is
centered over the Aleutians in most model solutions. Model solutions agree on
further troughing along the west coast of North America, with some uncertainty
among ensemble members and between different model solutions on the extent to
which troughing extends to the western CONUS. Some model runs depict split
flow
around the Alaska Panhandle, while other model runs indicate an extension of
troughing from the southern coast of the Alaska Mainland to the CONUS. All
ensemble models depict ridging in the central Pacific, which favors troughing
downstream near the West Coast. Ridging is predicted over the Southwest by
most
model solutions, while the ECMWF ensemble mean predicts greater positive
500-hPa height anomalies over the region than the GEFS ensemble mean.
Troughing
is centered over the Northeast, and more amplified in todays ensemble means
compared to yesterdays runs. The ECMWF ensemble mean was given the greatest
weight in the 500-hPa manual blend, due to good agreement with the 0Z ECMWF
high resolution run, slightly greater recent skill, and to maintain
consistency
with yesterdays forecast.

Positive height anomalies forecast over much of the western CONUS favors
increased probabilities for near to above normal temperatures across most of
the western CONUS, outside of parts of the Pacific Northwest, where below
normal temperatures are slightly favored. This pattern is consistent with the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Probabilities for below normal temperatures
are increased across parts of southern Mainland Alaska, under the influence of
troughing. Below normal temperatures are favored for much of the eastern half
of the CONUS, related to the increasing amplitude of troughing over the
region.
Near to above normal temperatures are forecast along the Gulf Coast, due to
less influence from the troughing, and supported by the reforecast tools.

Probabilities of near to below normal precipitation are elevated for much of
the western CONUS and Southern Plains due to weak mid-level flow. Troughing
along the West Coast leads to a forecast of enhanced probabilities of above
normal precipitation for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, and
Intermountain West, and near normal precipitation for the Northern Plains.
Troughing over the Northeast leads to a more active pattern, favoring near to
above normal precipitation across much of the northeastern CONUS. Enhanced
probabilities of above normal precipitation are predicted from the eatern
Central Plains into the Northeast, supported by the ECMWF precipitation
forecasts. Near to below normal precipitation is more likely over the
Southeast
with less of an influence of the predicted trough. Enhanced westerly flow
resulting from troughing over the Aleutian Islands favors increased chances
for
above normal precipitation across the southern Alaska Mainland and the
Panhandle, as depicted in the consolidation forecast tool. Near normal
precipitation chances are favored for the remainder of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement in the model mid-level height forecast, offset by some
disagreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 08 - 14 2021

The circulation pattern forecast for the 6-10 day period de-amplifies
significantly in the week 2 period forecasts, as a transitioning mid-level
flow
pattern results in a more uncertain forecast. High resolution operational runs
of the GFS and most individual ensemble members of the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles
predict a somewhat amplified circulation pattern through week 2, although with
significant differences in the location and amplitude of anomalies. As a
result, weak mid-level flow is predicted across North America for the week 2
period by the manual blend, resulting in somewhat uncertain temperature and
precipitation forecasts. The ECMWF, GEFS and Canadian ensemble means depict
weakly positive height anomalies across much of the southeastern CONUS.
Ridging
in the Central Pacific leads to persistent troughing over the western CONUS.
The manual height blend for the 8-14 day period depicts near normal heights
for
much of the CONUS and Alaska, with a slight tilt towards positive height
anomalies over the southeastern CONUS, and some negative height anomalies over
the Upper Great Lakes and Northeast. Near to slightly below normal mid-level
heights are indicated over the Aleutians and southwestern Mainland Alaska,
with
a slight tilt towards above normal heights over remaining areas of the state.

Increased probabilities for above normal temperatures are predicted for most
of
the southern CONUS from California eastward across the Southern Plains to the
Southeast. Models favor troughing near the West Coast in the 6-10 day period
to
shift eastward into the interior of the West in week 2, resulting in a broader
area of enhanced probabilities for near to below normal temperatures for the
Pacific Northwest, extending into the Northern Plains. Continued troughing
over
the Northeast increases the chances of near to below normal temperatures for
the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes region, and the Northeast. Continued
enhanced troughing across southwestern Alaska favors increased probabilities
for near to below normal temperatures across most of the southern Mainland and
Panhandle. Above normal temperatures are likely over the Aleutians and across
the northeastern Mainland, consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools.

The 8-14 day precipitation forecast indicates slightly enhanced probabilities
for near to below normal precipitation to the west of the Rocky Mountains, as
the trough is expected to shift eastward. Troughing in the West favors the
development of one or more surface low pressure systems to track across the
northern CONUS, bringing enhanced above normal precipitation probabilities
across portions of the Intermountain West, Northern Plains, Central and Upper
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast. Probabilities for above normal
precipitation are elevated across much of southern Mainland Alaska and the
eastern Aleutians, consistent with continued westerly to southwesterly
mid-level flow, while probabilities of near normal precipitation are enhanced
over the Panhandle under rising near normal mid-level heights.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 11, 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
fair agreement among the model circulation and precipitation forecasts, offset
by large differences among model temperature forecasts, increasing
uncertainty,
and a low amplitude transient mid-level height pattern.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...Heavy rain and flash flooding across southern Texas will
continue into Saturday before shifting into the lower to
mid-Mississippi Valley with severe weather possible on Sunday...

...Strong to potentially damaging winds expected to continue
across the northern Mid-Atlantic into tonight...

...Heat across the northern Plains will be followed by late-season
wet snow over the northern Rockies this weekend...

The weather pattern remains quite active this weekend with a
variety of hazards over different parts of the nation.  First of
all, a stalled frontal boundary near the Gulf Coast will continue
to interact with a closed upper-level low exiting northern Mexico
to funnel Gulf moisture into the Lone Star State.  Bouts of
showers and thunderstorms, heavy at times, will continue to impact
parts of southern Texas through tonight and into the weekend,
where a few inches of rain can be expected.  The heavy rain will
likely lead to flash flooding where the most intense downpours
occur.  Therefore, WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of Excessive
Rainfall near the central portion of coastal Texas into tonight.
Rainfall on Saturday will gradually spread further north towards
central Texas as the low pressure system slowly lifts in that
direction.  By Sunday, the focus of moderate to heavy rain will
shift northeastward into the lower to mid-Mississippi Valley where
severe weather is possible later in the day.

Meanwhile, a deep low pressure system is quickly exiting New
England into the Canadian Maritimes.  Reinforcing shots of colder
air wrapping around the deep low will bring strong to potentially
damaging winds expected to continue across the northern
Mid-Atlantic into tonight. Winds could gust as high as 60 mph
between northern Virginia and New Jersey. This will likely lead to
downed trees and power lines this afternoon and evening. High Wind
Warnings and Wind Advisories have been issued to highlight the
hazard. Along with the howling northwesterly winds, below average
temperatures will bring the chance for late-April snow showers
throughout the Northeast and New England.

Elsewhere across the Lower 48, well above normal temperatures will
stretch from California to the northern/central Plains today,
extending into the Upper Great Lakes on Saturday. High
temperatures are forecast to break several daily record highs to
end the week from Southern California to Montana, with 80s found
as far north as the U.S.-Canada border. Fire weather is a concern
across the northern Plains as low relative humidity and gusty
winds could produce conditions ripe for fires to spread
uncontrollably. Red Flag Warnings have been issued across eastern
Montana, western North Dakota, and northwestern South Dakota.

 Winds will gradually subside on Saturday across the Northeast as
the deep low moves farther away.

Farther to the west, well above normal temperatures stretching
from California to the northern High Plains will shift into the
northern Plains on Saturday ahead of an upper-level trough
approaching from the Pacific Northwest.  This trough will
gradually slide across the northern Rockies during the weekend
bringing rain for the lower elevations as late-season wet snow is
forecast to accumulate over the higher elevations especially
during the night.  The rain/snow should dip into the central
Rockies on Sunday behind a cold front as the upper-level trough
exits into the northern Plains.

...Heavy Rainfall Threat across the South into Tuesday/Wednesday...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Guidance agrees that an active weather pattern will continue next
week as two significant troughs cross the southern tier states and
result in heavy rain and some severe thunderstorms. An warming
upper level ridge becomes established over the Intermountain West
mid-later next week ahead of the next Pacific storm system to
reach the West Coast by next Friday. An additional series of
impulses into the northern tier of the central and eastern U.S.
may amplify by later next week downstream of the western ridge.

Models and ensembles offer below normal forecast spread through
medium range time scales in an early May pattern with good run to
run continuity. The WPC medium range product suite was derived
from a composite blend of 00/06 UTC models and ensembles days 3-5
(Mon-Wed) along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. The 06
UTC GFS/GEFS and 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean solutions are
best clustered into days 6/7 in a pattern with continued above
normal predictability. Latest 12 UTC guidance remains in line.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Multiple rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall are likely to focus
next week across the South as multiple disturbances cross the
region. The region that appears most favored for excessive
rainfall from Texas and the lower MS/TN Valleys through the
Mid-South/Central Gulf Coast states into the southern
Appalachians. Most of this should fall during the
Tuesday-Wednesday time period with deepening moisture/instability
and favorable upper support. This may be enough to cause some
flooding, particularly where convective training develops or
across areas that will have already received noteworthy prior
rains. Periods of frontal focusing convection will meanwhile also
focus from the central Plains through the Midwest, OH Valley and
Northeast with impulse passages. Terrain enhanced snows are also
possible back over the central Rockies early next week.

In terms of temperatures, highs are expected to be about 5-15
degrees above average for much of the eastern U.S. ahead of the
front for early next week, with some 90 degree readings likely
across portions of the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont on
Tuesday. This will be followed by a return to more seasonal to
below normal temperatures to close out the week behind the cold
front. Across the western U.S., heat is expected to build in
response to the upper level ridge, with highs 10-20 degrees above
normal possible for the middle to end of the week for portions of
the Intermountain West and the Desert Southwest. This will equate
to some 100+ degree high temperatures for the lower elevations of
eastern California and southern Arizona.

...Heavy Rainfall Threat across the South into Tuesday/Wednesday...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Guidance agrees that an active weather pattern will continue next
week as two significant troughs cross the southern tier states and
result in heavy rain and some severe thunderstorms. An warming
upper level ridge becomes established over the Intermountain West
mid-later next week ahead of the next Pacific storm system to
reach the West Coast by next Friday. An additional series of
impulses into the northern tier of the central and eastern U.S.
may amplify by later next week downstream of the western ridge.

Models and ensembles offer below normal forecast spread through
medium range time scales in an early May pattern with good run to
run continuity. The WPC medium range product suite was derived
from a composite blend of 00/06 UTC models and ensembles days 3-5
(Mon-Wed) along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. The 06
UTC GFS/GEFS and 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean solutions are
best clustered into days 6/7 in a pattern with continued above
normal predictability. Latest 12 UTC guidance remains in line.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Multiple rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall are likely to focus
next week across the South as multiple disturbances cross the
region. The region that appears most favored for excessive
rainfall from Texas and the lower MS/TN Valleys through the
Mid-South/Central Gulf Coast states into the southern
Appalachians. Most of this should fall during the
Tuesday-Wednesday time period with deepening moisture/instability
and favorable upper support. This may be enough to cause some
flooding, particularly where convective training develops or
across areas that will have already received noteworthy prior
rains. Periods of frontal focusing convection will meanwhile also
focus from the central Plains through the Midwest, OH Valley and
Northeast with impulse passages. Terrain enhanced snows are also
possible back over the central Rockies early next week.

In terms of temperatures, highs are expected to be about 5-15
degrees above average for much of the eastern U.S. ahead of the
front for early next week, with some 90 degree readings likely
across portions of the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont on
Tuesday. This will be followed by a return to more seasonal to
below normal temperatures to close out the week behind the cold
front. Across the western U.S., heat is expected to build in
response to the upper level ridge, with highs 10-20 degrees above
normal possible for the middle to end of the week for portions of
the Intermountain West and the Desert Southwest. This will equate
to some 100+ degree high temperatures for the lower elevations of
eastern California and southern Arizona.

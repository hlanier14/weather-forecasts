Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 AM CDT Sat Apr 09 2022

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

Elevated to locally critical conditions are ongoing within central
Kansas/Nebraska. Uncertainty remains as to how long critical
conditions will be sustained, but 2-4 hours is possible in some
locations. Elevated highlights have been extended into these areas.

..Wendt.. 04/09/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0209 AM CDT Sat Apr 09 2022/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a large low/trough across the eastern CONUS will
continue to weaken as it shifts eastward toward the Atlantic Coast
today. In its wake, a second lower-amplitude trough and associated
jet across the Great Basin and western US will move eastward over
the Plains late today and tonight. Increasing ascent in the lee of
the Rockies will support robust surface cyclogenesis across the
central and southern High Plains. Southerly winds are forecast to
increase within the very dry airmass in place supporting increased
fire weather concerns.

...High Plains...
As the shortwave trough ejects east through the central Rockies and
onto the Plains later in the evening, lee troughing and cyclogenesis
will enhance southwesterly surface flow across the Southwest and
High Plains. Widespread downslope winds of 20-25 mph are expected
from central NM, eastward across OK/TX and into southeastern CO.
Warm temperatures and adiabatic drying will further desiccate an
already dry airmass supporting widespread single digit humidity
values. In addition to the favorable meteorological overlap,
prevalent dry fuels with substantial recent fire activity will be in
place. Widespread Critical fire weather conditions are expected
through the day and into this evening. Some threat for fire activity
may linger overnight across the northern TX/OK Panhandles given poor
humidity recoveries and the strengthening lee low across eastern CO.


With increased forcing aloft ahead of a cold front associated with
the approaching shortwave trough, isolated thunderstorms may develop
across parts of the central Rockies this afternoon and evening. Area
averaged model soundings show deep and well-mixed boundary layers
with PWATS generally less than 0.4 inches. The deep inverted-v
structure and dry lower atmosphere may support a few dry
thunderstorms across northern CO and central/eastern WY. Storm
coverage remains highly uncertain given the meager moisture and
buoyancy available. High elevation fuels also remain somewhat
unreceptive to starts given the early occurrence compared to
climatology. While no DryT area will be added, some risk for a few
dry strikes is possible within dry fuels at lower elevations.

...Florida...
Lingering northwesterly flow behind a cold front and the upper
low/trough will support a few hours of gusty surface winds (10-15
mph) across the southern Florida Peninsula. Despite recent rainfall,
local fuels remain dry, (ERCs 95th+ percentile) and diurnal RH
minimums are forecast to fall below 35%. The combination of dry and
breezy conditions within receptive fuels will support Elevated fire
weather Conditions.

...Northern California...
As the shortwave trough over the Great Basin shifts eastward,
mid-level flow will gradually become northwesterly ahead of an
upstream jet streak over the Pacific. The increasing northern
component in combination with a strong northerly pressure gradient
at the surface will support strong winds (15-25 mph) across the
Sacramento Valley. Downsloping within the post-frontal airmass will
support surface RH below 20% in combination with the strong surface
winds. While fuels are not overly dry, a few hours of elevated to
near Critical fire weather conditions appear likely.

...Active weather is likely next week, with heavy snow spreading
from higher elevations of the West into the northern Plains and
heavy rain and severe thunderstorm chances across the Mississippi
Valley...

...Overview...

The latest guidance continues to support an amplified and active
weather pattern across the lower 48 next week. A reinforced
western U.S. trough looks to emerge into the Plains by around
midweek as a vigorous closed low and associated surface low
develop over the Plains/Upper Midwest. Initially, this should
bring heavy mountain snows out west, with heavy snow and possible
blizzard conditions spreading north and west of the low track into
the northern Plains. In the warm sector of the system, severe
weather and heavy to excessive rain is expected, with the biggest
threat across the Mississippi Valley but potentially spreading
eastward ahead of the cold front. By late week, at least some
energy from the closed low should shear off to the northeast due
to a blocky ridge in the western Atlantic, while the flow upstream
is uncertain but chances are another weaker trough will move into
the West.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance continues to indicate a developing western
trough becoming a deep closed upper low as it tracks into the
central U.S., though timing and track differences between models
continue to be an issue. For a few days now, the GFS has been a
fast and north outlier, with the ECMWF and CMC the farthest
west/south with the surface low Wednesday into Thursday. While
this continues to be the case, the 00Z ECMWF and the newer 12Z run
is slightly faster than it was a day or so ago, and shows a more
west-east oblong than circular height pattern (so not indicating
troughing as far south through the Plains/Mississippi Valley) that
would push the cold front faster than in previous runs. Meanwhile,
the 06Z and 12Z GFS runs were still fast with the closed low to
develop and not as amplified farther south compared to other
guidance, but generally closer to consensus than the 00Z and
previous runs, as upstream energy spilling into the Pacific
Northwest around Wednesday shows a more favorable track in the
more recent GFS runs. So overall it seems the guidance is at least
converging a bit even though the differences remain. Individual
ensemble members and thus the ensemble means cluster with their
deterministic counterparts, which does not increase confidence in
one solution over the other. The WPC forecasts have been favoring
a slower track of the upper/surface lows compared to the GFS. For
this cycle, stuck with that with a deterministic model blend
favoring the ECMWF for the first part of the period, leading to a
forecast a bit faster than continuity with the surface low and
associated fronts, particularly given the ECMWF adjustment.

Beyond Wednesday/Thursday, flow upstream of that main upper low
feature is quite uncertain with significant model variability. As
noted the 06Z and 12Z GFS runs did look closer to consensus with
an initial bout of energy spinning near the Pacific Northwest
Wednesday/Thursday, but the track of that feature varies from
serving to enhance and elongate the upper low (00Z ECMWF) or
maintaining a troughing in the West into late week (06Z GFS and
newer 12Z GFS and ECMWF and the EC ensemble mean). The latter
seems more likely now that most 12Z guidance is in. For the WPC
forecast created with the 00Z/06Z cycle, heavily favored the ECMWF
ensemble mean amid rapidly increasing model discrepancies.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Beginning Tuesday, mountain snow will be ongoing across
particularly the Oregon Cascades as well as farther inland across
the Intermountain West. Meanwhile, the surface low pressure system
should be consolidating and so a favorable combination of upper
trough dynamics and low level upslope flow should increase
precipitation, yielding a springtime heavy snow threat into the
Rockies and the northern Plains. As the strong low pressure looks
to track from the Plains into the Upper Midwest Wednesday into
Thursday, high winds are expected along with the snow, possibly
creating blizzard conditions. Meanwhile in the warm sector, there
will be increasing coverage and intensity of rain and
thunderstorms ahead of the attendant cold front given persistent
Gulf moisture and instability. The Storm Prediction Center's
extended outlook indicates severe potential from eastern parts of
the southern/central Plains into the Mississippi Valley eastward.
Heavy to excessive rainfall concerns may focus on the southern
side across the Lower Mississippi Valley, but farther north,
dynamics wrapping around the low may support an additional area of
modest rainfall across the Upper Mississippi Valley. This may
cause localized flooding and flash flooding issues there as well
particularly if rain falls over frozen or snow covered ground.
While these wintry weather/heavy rain/severe weather threats are
generally coming into better focus, continue to monitor forecasts
for additional changes in timing and location of these impacts.

The western U.S. should see several days of below normal
temperatures, with daytime highs 20+ degrees below normal shifting
eastward with time into the north-central CONUS. Some moderation
is likely by later in the week across the West, though still below
normal with additional troughing moving in. By next
Thursday-Saturday, the core of the cold should be over the
northern Plains with low temperatures 10-20F below normal and
highs even approaching 30F below average. Meanwhile, ahead of the
big storm, expect temperatures from the south-central U.S. to the
East to be above normal, but trending back towards normal
following passage of the cold front.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat April 09 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19530403 - 20010328 - 20000328 - 19840415 - 19960407


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 7 day periods centered on the following dates:
20010328 - 19840416 - 20000327 - 19530402 - 19530326

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 PM CDT Sat Apr 09 2022

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS...

The primary adjustments to the ongoing forecast were to expand the
Elevated area in more of southwestern Nebraska and extend the
Critical area farther north along the Front Range. There remains
some spatial and duration uncertainties, but strong post-frontal
downslope winds will promote a few hours of fire weather concerns in
these areas. Elevated highlights were also expanded in New
Mexico/Arizona where dry/windy conditions will increase large fire
potential at lower elevations. Gusty, dry winds in the Sacramento
Valley will occur early in the period. Winds should decrease and
humidity should increase during the afternoon.

..Wendt.. 04/09/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0211 AM CDT Sat Apr 09 2022/

...Synopsis...
A low amplitude shortwave trough within broad southwesterly flow is
forecast to eject eastward across the central Plains through Sunday.
Behind the trough, strengthening mid-level winds will overspread
much of the Southwest and southern Plains. Enhanced by the flow
aloft and a strong surface low across eastern KS, low-level winds
will become quite strong within a very warm and dry airmass.
Volatile fuels and the dry/breezy conditions will support high-end
Critical fire weather conditions across parts of the southern Plains
Sunday.

...Southern Plains...
As the main shortwave trough shifts farther east into the Plains
Sunday, mid-level flow will gradually veer to westerly ahead of an
increasingly strong Pacific jet. As the strong flow aloft
overspreads the Southwest and southern Plains Sunday morning,
west-southwesterly surface winds should rapidly increase. Model
soundings show deep vertical mixing within an extremely dry air mass
near a pronounced low-level thermal ridge. Afternoon RH values of
5-10% are excepted to be widespread across portions of NM west TX
and far western OK. Within this corridor, surface winds of 20-30 mph
are expected. Gusts of 35-40 mph also appear possible given the deep
vertical mixing and increasing flow aloft. With fuels in the 90th+
percentile common across the Plains, widespread high-end critical
fire weather conditions are expected much of Sunday. A few hours of
locally extremely critical conditions may develop across eastern NM
where locally stronger winds appear more likely. Fire concerns may
linger after sunset as strong surface winds remain in place beneath
the low-level jet and humidity recoveries remain poor.

...Central Plains....
Downslope winds in the wake of the departing trough and
strengthening westerly flow are expected to spill out of the central
Rockies and onto the Plains. West to east surface pressure gradients
will support dry downslope flow and low RH despite falling
temperatures. Dry fuels suggest a few hours of Elevated fire weather
conditions are possible across the central High Plains Sunday.

...Northern California...
As flow aloft behind the shortwave trough farther east begins to
weaken, a second deeper trough will begin to emerge across the
eastern Pacific. Ahead of this feature, stronger northwesterly flow
aloft will nose inland across the Sacramento Valley supporting gusty
northwesterly winds for a few hours Sunday. Rain chances will begin
to increase late Sunday as the approaching trough deepens and
onshore flow strengthens. Prior to that, a few hours of locally
Elevated fire conditions may develop within dry fuels across
portions of northern California.

...A widespread area of the central and southern High Plains will
have elevated to critical fire weather concerns through the
weekend and into early next week...

...A major late-season winter storm will begin to impact the West
by early next week with strong winds, heavy rain, and heavy
mountain snow...

...Severe weather is expected to begin impacting areas of the
southern Plains and the lower to middle Mississippi Valley by
Monday...

A very active weather pattern is expected to ensue across the
Western U.S. by early next week as a strong area of low pressure
develops just offshore of the Pacific Northwest Sunday night and
moves inland on Monday across the Intermountain West. Strong
onshore flow will drive copious amounts of moisture inland and
this will initially yield heavy rain Sunday night for the coastal
ranges of especially western Oregon and northwest California with
heavy snowfall over the Cascades. On Monday, all of this moisture
along with colder temperatures will overspread the Great Basin and
the northern Rockies as a cold front pushes east with the
aforementioned low center. This will set the stage for a major
late-season winter storm with strong winds and widespread heavy
snowfall for the Intermountain West and especially for the
northern Rockies going through Monday night into early Tuesday.
Going through early Tuesday, as much as 1 to 2 feet of snow will
be possible for the higher terrain, with the heaviest amounts this
period expected to be over the Oregon Cascades.

Meanwhile, in the lee of the Rockies involving the central and
southern High Plains, there will be notable concerns for wildfire
activity through the remainder of the weekend and into early next
week as locally gusty winds, low relative humidity, and lack of
soil moisture given the ongoing drought all work in tandem to
promote elevated to critical fire weather concerns. This threat
will continue until the strong storm system in the West ejects out
into the Plains later next week.

Areas of the Central and Eastern U.S. will be relatively tranquil
compared to the Western U.S., but there will be a cold front
crossing the Midwest and the Great Lakes region late Sunday
through Monday, and this will bring a threat of rain and perhaps a
little wet snow to areas of the Upper Midwest. Farther south
across portions of the lower Missouri Valley and gradually the
southern Plains to the middle Mississippi Valley, there will be a
threat of showers and thunderstorms as the aforementioned front
drops down across this region. On Monday some severe weather will
be possible across these areas, and the Storm Prediction Center
has highlighted a Slight Risk of severe weather with as
thunderstorms will be capable of producing large hail, damaging
winds, and a couple of tornadoes.

...Potent storm system to bring heavy snow/blizzard conditions
across the Northern Plains with heavy rainfall and severe weather
from the Gulf Coast to the Mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Overview...

The latest guidance continues to support an active weather pattern
across the lower 48 into next weekend. The main system of interest
is an amplified trough/developing closed low over the northern
U.S./Upper Midwest which should spin up a rather impressive
looking spring storm system. This system brings a full array of
weather hazards mid to later next week... including heavy snow and
possible blizzard conditions to the north and west of the low
track across the Northern Plains and severe weather and heavy to
excessive rainfall in the warm sector. Upstream, uncertainty is
high regarding flow into the Western U.S. but changes are that
another trough may kick out into the West next weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models continue to show higher than avearge uncertainty
surrounding an amplified trough in the central U.S. which
eventually develops into a deep closed upper low tracking across
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. While all models now
suggest a rather significant storm system, there remains a lot of
questions on track and timing of the surface low and attendent
cold front across the South and Midwest. The 18z/Apr 9 GFS is the
fastest with closed low development, but is actually not too far
out of line with location of surface low pressure at day 3-4 in
the Upper Midwest. After this, likely a result of a much blockier
Western Atlantic ridge, the GFS gets much faster with steering
this low quickly northward, while the ECMWF and CMC suggest the
upper system is sheared/redevelops over the Great Lakes/eastern
Canada next weekend. Ensemble means do not really give a clear
answer here as they generally continue to follow their
deterministic counterparts. In the interest of continuity,
continued to favor the ECMWF over the GFS, with increasing
weighting towards the ECENS/GEFS means late period.

Beyond Wednesday/Thursday, flow upstream across the West becomes
very uncertain with some significant model variability especially
by the day 6-7 time frame. There is increased consensus on some
kind of open shortwave (or closed low) into the Pacific Northwest
on Friday. Models suggest another trough into the West next
weekend, but the details on embedded energy within that trough and
amplifcation become very murky next weekend with very poor model
run to run continuity. A blend heavily weighted towards the
ensemble means gets some weak troughing across the West with a
hint at low pressure once again moving into the Plains next Sunday.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Some lingering snowfall is likely as the period begins Wednesday
across the West, but by then a well developed storm should be
tracking across the northern Plains/Upper Midwest with a
significant snow storm likely to the north and west of the surface
low across the Dakotas and northwest Minnesota. Heavy snowfall,
possibly exceeding a foot in some locations, with gusty winds
could create blizzard conditions leading to hazardous travel and
power outages in many areas. Meanwhile in the warm sector, there
will be increasing coverage and intensity of rain and
thunderstorms ahead of the attendant cold front given persistent
Gulf moisture and instability. The Storm Prediction Center's
extended outlook indicates severe potential across the lower and
middle Mississippi Valley on Wednesday, with more uncertain
potential farther east into the Southeast on Thursday. Heavy to
excessive rainfall concerns may focus on the southern side across
the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valley, but farther north,
dynamics wrapping around the low may support an additional area of
modest rainfall across the Upper Mississippi Valley. This may
cause localized flooding and flash flooding issues there as well
particularly if rain falls over frozen or snow covered ground.
Rainfall may linger through Friday across the Southeast as the
western part of the boundary stalls across the region.

Out West, moderate to heavy rain/mountain snows are possible
across parts of California/Oregon with the next low pressure
system moving in late this week. Moisture looks to spread east
into the intermountain West, with more uncertainty by next Sunday
regarding precipitation into the Plains.

Much below normal temperatures (with anomalies 20+ degrees below
average) will shift eastward with time into the northern Plains
into next weekend. Some moderation is likely by later in the week
across the West, though still below normal with additional
troughing moving in. Meanwhile, ahead of the big storm, expect
temperatures from the south-central U.S. to the East to be above
normal, but trending back towards normal following passage of the
cold front.

...Potent storm system to bring heavy snow/blizzard conditions
across the Northern Plains with heavy rainfall and severe weather
from the Gulf Coast to the Mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Overview...

The latest guidance continues to support an active weather pattern
across the lower 48 into next weekend. The main system of interest
is an amplified trough/developing closed low over the northern
U.S./Upper Midwest which should spin up a rather impressive
looking spring storm system. This system brings a full array of
weather hazards mid to later next week... including heavy snow and
possible blizzard conditions to the north and west of the low
track across the Northern Plains and severe weather and heavy to
excessive rainfall in the warm sector. Upstream, uncertainty is
high regarding flow into the Western U.S. but changes are that
another trough may kick out into the West next weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models continue to show higher than avearge uncertainty
surrounding an amplified trough in the central U.S. which
eventually develops into a deep closed upper low tracking across
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. While all models now
suggest a rather significant storm system, there remains a lot of
questions on track and timing of the surface low and attendent
cold front across the South and Midwest. The 18z/Apr 9 GFS is the
fastest with closed low development, but is actually not too far
out of line with location of surface low pressure at day 3-4 in
the Upper Midwest. After this, likely a result of a much blockier
Western Atlantic ridge, the GFS gets much faster with steering
this low quickly northward, while the ECMWF and CMC suggest the
upper system is sheared/redevelops over the Great Lakes/eastern
Canada next weekend. Ensemble means do not really give a clear
answer here as they generally continue to follow their
deterministic counterparts. In the interest of continuity,
continued to favor the ECMWF over the GFS, with increasing
weighting towards the ECENS/GEFS means late period.

Beyond Wednesday/Thursday, flow upstream across the West becomes
very uncertain with some significant model variability especially
by the day 6-7 time frame. There is increased consensus on some
kind of open shortwave (or closed low) into the Pacific Northwest
on Friday. Models suggest another trough into the West next
weekend, but the details on embedded energy within that trough and
amplifcation become very murky next weekend with very poor model
run to run continuity. A blend heavily weighted towards the
ensemble means gets some weak troughing across the West with a
hint at low pressure once again moving into the Plains next Sunday.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Some lingering snowfall is likely as the period begins Wednesday
across the West, but by then a well developed storm should be
tracking across the northern Plains/Upper Midwest with a
significant snow storm likely to the north and west of the surface
low across the Dakotas and northwest Minnesota. Heavy snowfall,
possibly exceeding a foot in some locations, with gusty winds
could create blizzard conditions leading to hazardous travel and
power outages in many areas. Meanwhile in the warm sector, there
will be increasing coverage and intensity of rain and
thunderstorms ahead of the attendant cold front given persistent
Gulf moisture and instability. The Storm Prediction Center's
extended outlook indicates severe potential across the lower and
middle Mississippi Valley on Wednesday, with more uncertain
potential farther east into the Southeast on Thursday. Heavy to
excessive rainfall concerns may focus on the southern side across
the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valley, but farther north,
dynamics wrapping around the low may support an additional area of
modest rainfall across the Upper Mississippi Valley. This may
cause localized flooding and flash flooding issues there as well
particularly if rain falls over frozen or snow covered ground.
Rainfall may linger through Friday across the Southeast as the
western part of the boundary stalls across the region.

Out West, moderate to heavy rain/mountain snows are possible
across parts of California/Oregon with the next low pressure
system moving in late this week. Moisture looks to spread east
into the intermountain West, with more uncertainty by next Sunday
regarding precipitation into the Plains.

Much below normal temperatures (with anomalies 20+ degrees below
average) will shift eastward with time into the northern Plains
into next weekend. Some moderation is likely by later in the week
across the West, though still below normal with additional
troughing moving in. Meanwhile, ahead of the big storm, expect
temperatures from the south-central U.S. to the East to be above
normal, but trending back towards normal following passage of the
cold front.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS....

...Synopsis...
A low amplitude shortwave trough across the central Rockies is
forecast to move eastward across the Great Plains and reach the
Upper Midwest late this evening. Two areas of low pressure, with the
latter in the lee of the southern Rockies, will intensify,
supporting strong westerly winds across the Rockies and southern
High Plains. Dry surface conditions and the strong winds beneath the
trough will support Critical fire weather conditions across the
central and southern High Plains.

...Central and southern High Plains...
As the mid-level trough ejects eastward out of the central Rockies
this morning strong mid-level flow will overspread the central and
southern High Plains. A sub 1000 mb lee low will shift southeastward
across CO and into the OK/TX Panhandles. Strong west to east
pressure gradients bolstered by the mid-level flow at the base of
the trough will support robust downslope winds of 25-30 mph across
much of the Plains. Locally strong winds are expected beneath the
trough and behind a cold front moving south from the central Rockies
into the High Plains where a late season downslope winds storm is
expected to develop.

Warm temperatures and adiabatic downslope flow will support an
extremely dry airmass with widespread RH values below 10%. Hi-res
guidance suggests that locally stronger flow in the immediate lee of
the southern Rockies and beneath a pronounced thermal ridge may also
allow for local RH values to fall below 5% in spots. The combination
of strong surface winds and extremely dry conditions will support
widespread Critical fire weather conditions from eastern NM, along
the front range of CO, into western portions of TX and OK. Volatile
fuels remain in place with ERC values in the 90th+ percentile for
nearly all of the southern/central High Plains. With preceding days
showing above normal fire activity, widespread Critical fire weather
conditions are expected.

...South Florida...
A dry post frontal airmass is expected to remain in place this
afternoon across the southern Florida Peninsula where fuels remain
quite dry. Beneath surface high pressure winds are forecast to
remain relatively light but occasional gusts of 10+ mph may support
a few hours of near Elevated fire conditions given dry surface
conditions and available fuels.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST
AND THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS....

...Synopsis...
Initially zonal mid-level flow will gradually become more meridional
as a powerful Pacific jet deepens an approaching shortwave trough.
As the jet and trough dig across the Four Corners Monday, a deep
surface low will move eastward toward the southern High Plains. In
response to the strengthening flow aloft and strong surface cyclone,
surface southwesterly winds will increase substantially within an
already dry airmass. Volatile fuels and the strong winds/low
humidity will combine to support widespread high-end Critical fire
weather conditions across the southern High Plains.

...Southern Plains...
As the mid-level trough deepens in response to the advancing Pacific
jet, mid-level westerlies will gradually intensify over the
Southwest and southern High Plains. Deep mixing, enhanced by
orographic turbulence will aide in bolstering strong low-level
southwesterly winds from AZ eastward, across NM and into western
TX/OK. Ensemble and deterministic model soundings support high
confidence in widespread boundary-layer winds of 25-30 mph through
much of Monday afternoon. Stronger gusts may develop across western
portions of the Critical area as the main core of the upper jet
begins to overspread the High Plains later in the period. High
confidence also exists in very dry surface conditions given
downslope trajectories and a warm/well-mixed boundary layer. Minimum
RH values below 10% are expected to be widespread with local values
below 5% possible in the lee of the higher terrain where downsloping
will be maximized. With extremely dry fuels and ongoing drought
exacerbated by several preceding dry and windy days, high-end
Critical fire weather conditions appear likely across much of the
southern High Plains. Localized Extremely Critical conditions may
also materialize later in the period as strong wind gusts develop
beneath the stronger jet aloft. However, uncertainty remains
relatively high on the overlap of sustained 35+ mph winds and sub
10% RH within the areas of driest fuels.

...Central High Plains...
Similar to the southern High Plains, widespread strong winds and dry
surface conditions are expected beneath the deepening Great Basin
trough Monday. However, more southerly trajectories will likely
result in gradual moisture transport across the central High Plains
ahead of the deepening surface low. This may impact diurnal RH
somewhat casting some uncertainty on the coverage of sustained
Critical conditions. However, wind fields remain quite strong,
suggesting at least some fire weather threat is possible within dry
fuels. Elevated highlights will be maintained with the possibility
of an upgrade to Critical conditions in subsequent outlooks.

...A widespread area of the central and southern High Plains will
have elevated to critical fire weather concerns through the
weekend and into early next week...

...A major late-season winter storm will begin to impact the West
by Monday night with strong winds, heavy rain, and heavy mountain
snow...

...Severe weather is expected to begin impacting areas of the
southern Plains and the lower to middle Mississippi Valley by
Monday...

A very active weather pattern is expected to ensue across the
Western U.S. by early next week as a strong area of low pressure
develops just offshore of the Pacific Northwest Sunday night and
moves inland on Monday across the Intermountain West. Strong
onshore flow will drive copious amounts of moisture inland and
this will initially yield heavy rain Sunday night for the coastal
ranges of especially western Oregon and northwest California with
heavy snowfall over the Cascades. On Monday, all of this moisture
along with colder temperatures will overspread the Great Basin and
the northern Rockies as a cold front pushes east with the
aforementioned low center. This will set the stage for a major
late-season winter storm with strong winds and widespread heavy
snowfall for the Intermountain West and especially for the
northern Rockies going through Monday night into early Tuesday.
Going through early Tuesday, as much as 1 to 2 feet of snow will
be possible for the higher terrain, with the heaviest amounts this
period expected to be over the Oregon Cascades. Heavy snow and
strong winds spread into the Northern Plains on Tuesday. The
heaviest snow is likely to focus over eastern Montana and western
North Dakota, where over a foot of snow is possible.

Meanwhile, in the lee of the Rockies involving the central and
southern High Plains, there will be notable concerns for wildfire
activity through the remainder of the weekend and into early next
week as locally gusty winds, low relative humidity, and lack of
soil moisture given the ongoing drought all work in tandem to
promote elevated to critical fire weather concerns. This threat
will continue until the strong storm system in the West ejects out
into the Plains midweek.

Areas of the Central and Eastern U.S. will be relatively tranquil
compared to the Western U.S., but there will be a cold front
crossing the Midwest and the Great Lakes region late Sunday
through Monday, and this will bring a threat of rain and perhaps a
little wet snow to areas of the Upper Midwest. Farther south
across portions of the lower Missouri Valley and gradually the
southern Plains to the middle Mississippi Valley, there will be a
threat of showers and thunderstorms as the aforementioned front
drops down across this region. On Monday some severe weather will
be possible across these areas, and the Storm Prediction Center
has highlighted a Slight Risk of severe weather as thunderstorms
will be capable of producing large hail, damaging winds, and a
couple of tornadoes. The threat of severe weather returns to
portions of the Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley by midweek.

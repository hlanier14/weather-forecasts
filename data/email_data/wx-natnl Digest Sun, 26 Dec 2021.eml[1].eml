Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1036 AM CST Sat Dec 25 2021

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

The latest surface observations and Real-time Mesoscale Analysis
data indicate sustained surface winds in excess of 15-20 mph are
ongoing across western Nebraska and south/southwestward across
portions of the central/southern High Plains. Despite a chilly start
to the morning (with morning low temperatures below freezing), at
least relatively modest diurnal warming should allow for
seasonably-warm afternoon high temperatures of 50-60 F (warmest with
southward extent) and corresponding minimum RH values of 20-35%.
With critically receptive fuels over much of the area (e.g., ERC
values exceeding the 90th percentile), a rather broad area of at
least locally elevated fire weather conditions is probable this
afternoon across much of the central/southern High Plains. Elevated
to locally critical fire weather conditions are most likely across
portions of Nebraska and Colorado where the most favorable overlap
of wind/rh and receptive fuels is forecast.

...Nebraska...
The previous forecast of Elevated fire weather conditions across the
Nebraska Panhandle remains mostly on track, with only a slight
eastward extension into central Nebraska needed based on the latest
model/fuel guidance. Please see the previous discussion below for
more information on the fire weather threat in this area.

...Colorado...
An Elevated fire weather area was introduced across portions of the
high plains of Colorado as confidence has increased in at least a
few hours of sustained surface winds in excess of 15 mph occurring
in conjunction with afternoon RH values of 20-30% and exceptionally
dry fuels. Locally critical fire weather conditions are also likely
in terrain-favored areas along/near the I-25 corridor, where surface
wind gusts may exceed 35 mph.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
today's fire weather forecast -- including a section on locally
elevated fire weather conditions over the southern High Plains.

..Elliott.. 12/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1242 AM CST Sat Dec 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow will prevail across much of the CONUS Christmas day as a
weakening upper-level disturbance moves through the upper OH River
Valley and a stronger wave deepens along the West Coast. This flow
regime will favor a broad stretch of weak surface pressure falls
along the lee of the Rockies with an attendant downslope wind
response. Areas of fire weather concerns may emerge from the central
to southern High Plains, but will be most likely across the NE
Panhandle where strong winds are expected over critically dry fuels.

...Nebraska Panhandle...
A conditional, wind-driven fire weather concern appears probable for
portions of the NE Panhandle this afternoon. Stronger mid-level flow
between 850-700 mb will likely be in place over the region as a weak
upper-level wave propagates across the Dakotas. Mostly clear skies
should allow for sufficient boundary-layer mixing to realize these
winds at the surface. Sustained winds near 20 mph appear likely and
gusts up to 30-40 mph are possible. Although RH reductions will be
modest (down to 20-25% by late afternoon), ERC values across the
region are between the 90-97th percentile, which will support a
wind-driven fire weather concern.

...Central Colorado...
Latest ensemble guidance continues to show modest probabilities for
elevated fire weather conditions along the I-25 corridor in central
CO, primarily be driven by downslope winds in the immediate lee of
the terrain. However, weak flow aloft over central CO casts some
uncertainty into the wind forecast. Additionally, recent MRMS data
shows light rainfall over the region that may have mitigated fine
fuel receptiveness to a degree as well as boosted overnight RH
recoveries (as noted in recent surface obs). Localized fire weather
concerns may emerge, but confidence remains too low for highlights.

...West Texas...
Despite an influx of moisture over the past 24 hours, conditions
will remain generally dry across much of the southern High Plains.
While increasing westerly winds will support some downslope
warming/drying, increasing mid to high-level cloud cover through the
day may mitigate RH reductions to some degree. Sustained winds near
15 mph may gust as high as 25-30 mph during the afternoon hours,
especially along the I-20 corridor under an axis of stronger
low-level flow. Localized elevated conditions are likely, but
confidence in the duration/coverage of such conditions remains too
low for highlights.

Northern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic Sunday...

The seemingly endless upper level troughing pattern in the West is
forecast to stick around through the remainder of the holiday
weekend. Anomalously cold conditions and a barrage of Pacific
moisture results in prolonged periods of mountain snow and
coastal/valley rain, some of which may fall heavy at times. Enough
cold air is in place for even metropolitan areas of the Northwest
to receive measurable snowfall. Winter Storm Warnings have been
issued from Portland, Oregon and the Willamette Valley on south to
the Sierra Nevada and the Transverse Range in Southern California
through Sunday. Through the remainder of the weekend, the heaviest
snowfall totals are expected to occur in the northern and central
Sierras, where 2 to 4 feet of snow (locally higher amounts
possible) are expected. The Portland metro area may receive 2 to 5
inches of snow and the Seattle metro (under a Winter Weather
Advisory through Sunday afternoon) could receive a few inches of
snow. A little farther east, the next upper level disturbance
slams into the West Coast on Sunday, delivering another round of
moderate-to-heavy snowfall to the Intermountain West. Snow totals,
from the Sawtooths, the Tetons, Wasatch, and central Rockies can
anticipate roughly 1 to 2 feet of snow by the end of the weekend.
Travel will be treacherous, to at times impossible, from the
Sierras to the central Rockies this weekend due to whiteout
conditions and drifting snow.

The other weather story of the weekend will be the continued much
above normal warmth for most of the central and eastern U.S.
Record-tying and record-breaking high temperatures are likely from
the Southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic. A passing cold front
drops temperatures to more seasonally warm levels in the Ohio
Valley on Sunday, but much of the South remains remarkably warm as
highs soar into the 80s once again in Texas and Oklahoma. The
warmest average temperatures for Sunday will stretch from northern
Texas into southern Kansas where temperatures will be 25-35
degrees above average. Winds will also increase ahead of a cold
front across the High Plains on Sunday. The combination of windy,
dry, and continued warm conditions have resulted in a Critical
Risk of fire weather issued by the Storm Prediction Center for
southwest Kansas, southeast Colorado, and portions of both the
Oklahoma and northern Texas Panhandles. One exception to the
anomalous warmth (aside from the cooler, stormy setup along the
West Coast) is the Northern Plains where frigid Canadian air will
pool behind a strong cold front. Morning lows are forecast to be
sub-zero in the High Plains of Montana and North Dakota with
daytime highs struggling to get out of the single digits. This
cold airmass will expand back into the West coast on Sunday and
eastward by Monday.

Elsewhere, scattered light to moderate rain showers along a
frontal system will move across the Northeast tonight. A wintry
mix of freezing rain and snow is forecast in the cooler air on the
north side of the front across upstate New York and New England. A
glaze to moderate freezing rain is expected for Upstate New York
and western New England, with accumulations of around a tenth to a
quarter of an inch possible in the Hudson and Connecticut River
Valleys. Snow showers are likely for the higher terrain of western
New England and Maine. Winter Weather Advisories are in effect for
these areas. By Sunday afternoon, snow will begin to increase in
coverage across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest as an
emerging storm system strengthens and approaches from the West.
Latest forecast guidance indicated anywhere from 6 to 12 inches of
snow possible in eastern North Dakota Sunday night and into early
Monday morning. Parts of northern Minnesota may also pick up as
much as 6 inches Sunday night, while isolated parts of Minnesota's
Lake Superior coast may see over a foot of snow on Monday. A glaze
of ice accumulation is also possible in the Upper Mississippi
Valley and the central Great Lakes Sunday night into early Monday
morning.

...Bitterly cold temperatures are forecast across portions of the
Northwest to Northern Plains for much of next week...


...Overview...

As a highly amplified ridge/upper high persists over the northern
Pacific through much of next week, troughing is generally expected
downstream across the western U.S. during the period while upper
lows meander over Canada. Some encroachment of the troughing into
the north-central and northeastern tier of the U.S. is also likely
as shortwaves round the trough, which will also cause a series of
low pressure systems to track across the central U.S. to
Northeast. Meanwhile, another upper high over the Caribbean to the
Bahamas will allow for ridging and above normal temperatures
across the southeastern quadrant of the country to the south of
the storm track. By the latter half of the week, model guidance is
indicating the potential for a southern stream upper low dropping
through the eastern Pacific just off the California coast.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest models and ensembles continue to show good agreement
with the large scale pattern through much of the period, but with
some lingering uncertainties in the smaller scale details
especially by the latter part of the week. Relatively minor model
variations were seen with a series of shortwaves rotating out of
the Western U.S. trough towards the Great Lakes/Northeast and the
associated surface lows Tuesday-Wednesday, but some
strength/placement differences may take until the short range to
resolve, and could impact the frontal placement and exact axis of
heavy rainfall across the Ohio Valley midweek. Another notable
area of concern is regarding the next shortwave dropping down the
West Coast, with a closed low likely to develop off the California
coast by late Wednesday or Thursday. Deterministic models from
00/06Z and the incoming 12Z cycle still support the idea of this
development, but with differences particularly with the timing of
its formation, eastern turn toward the coast, and absorption back
into the mean flow by late week. The 00Z ECMWF was a bit of an
early outlier in closing off the low by early Wednesday, while the
06Z GFS was a quicker outlier with the turn eastward into the
California coast compared to other guidance/consensus and its
previous (and newer 12Z) runs.

The early part of the medium range forecast was based on a blend
of purely deterministic models--the 00Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and the
00Z/06Z GFS. As the period progressed, eliminated the 06Z GFS from
the blend and also introduced and gradually increased the EC and
GEFS ensemble means to help mitigate the smaller scale detail
differences. This provided good continuity with the previous WPC
forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Precipitation across the West should be waning by the start of the
period on Tuesday, although some modest snow accumulations may
continue in the higher terrain, especially for parts of Arizona
and the Colorado Rockies. Activity should quiet down in the West
on Wednesday, but another round of heavy mountain snows are
possible for portions of the Pacific Northwest/northern Rockies
particularly on Thursday ahead of the shortwave dropping down the
West Coast. The closed low development off the California coast
may help direct increased moisture into parts of southern
California and possibly the Southwest as well later next week.

Generally progressive low pressure systems will spread periodic
precipitation across parts of the central and eastern U.S. through
next week. The best snow chances should be confined to the Great
Lakes and interior Northeast, with rain to the south. The
associated trailing cold front slowly sinking southeastward could
provide a focus for enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley
around Tuesday-Wednesday and toward the Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachians/Southeast by Thursday-Friday of next week,
but with uncertainty remaining regarding the amounts and axis of
the heaviest rain.

Bitterly cold temperatures will be ongoing by Tuesday in parts of
the northwestern and north-central U.S., with daytime highs (and a
lesser extent overnight lows) 20 to nearly 40 degrees below
average. Some areas of North Dakota and Montana may stay below 0F
for more than 48 hours Tuesday-Wednesday, possibly even into the
latter half of the week, despite temperatures moderating slightly
as the week progresses. Cold temperatures combined with gusty
winds could result in dangerously cold wind chills, especially for
northern parts of the High Plains where wind chill values could
dip well below 0F for many. Temperatures are also expected to
trend colder in the rest of the western U.S., with expanding
coverage of highs 10-25F below normal early to mid next week.
Increasing numbers of locations along and just inland from the
West Coast could see daily records for low maximum and minimum
temperatures Tuesday and Wednesday. Meanwhile, mild to warm
weather is expected across the south-central U.S. and
northeastward through next week where many places from the
southern half of the Plains to the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic could
be 20 to 30 degrees above normal Tuesday into Wednesday. Daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures are likely. As the
pattern deamplifies just slightly over the country later next
week, temperatures across both the West and East should moderate,
but still maintain a general pattern of cool in the
West/north-central U.S. and warm in the south-central/eastern
U.S., just less extreme.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 PM CST Sat Dec 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN COLORADO...FAR SOUTHWEST
NEBRASKA...WESTERN KANSAS...FAR WESTERN OKLAHOMA...AND THE
OKLAHOMA/TEXAS PANHANDLES......

A complex fire weather forecast remains for tomorrow with very
strong/gusty surface winds (sustained winds in excess of 25-30 mph)
expected over a rather broad area of critically receptive fuels
across much of the southern/central High Plains. While uncertainties
regarding the coverage/duration of any critically-reduced minimum RH
values remain rather large (owing in large part to possible
mid/upper-level cloud cover), the strength of the surface winds
coupled with exceptionally dry fuels should yield at least a few
hours of critical conditions.

At the moment, the greatest potential for higher-end critical
conditions exists across portions of eastern Colorado and western
Kansas southward into the northern Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles, where
the strongest surface winds are expected underneath 100+ knot
mid-level winds. Fuels are also the most receptive in these areas
with ERC values in excess of the 98th percentile. A conditional
threat for moderate/higher-end critical conditions will also exist
near the low-level thermal ridge over southwest Oklahoma and north
Texas, though a greater potential for cloud cover in this area
decreases confidence in RH reductions and wind speeds.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 12/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CST Sat Dec 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early-morning water-vapor imagery reveals an upper-level disturbance
off the West Coast that is forecast to propagate eastward into the
Plains by Sunday afternoon. As this occurs, broad ascent ahead of
the wave combined with lee troughing will support a deepening
surface low over the High Plains. Southwesterly downslope winds are
expected to strengthen across much of the central to southern High
Plains in response, resulting in the potential for widespread fire
weather concerns. While some forecast details remain fluid, the
overall synoptic pattern continues to look favorable for at least
elevated to critical fire weather concerns.

...Central to southern High Plains...
Although some spread is noted among members, early-morning ensemble
guidance continues to show high probability for sustained winds
between 20-25 mph over a broad area from west TX to southwest NE.
These winds will primarily be driven by a pressure-gradient response
from the deepening low as well as 30-50 mph low to mid-level flow
over the region. While confidence in the general synoptic evolution
and wind forecast remains high, some forecast details remain
uncertain. Increasing cloud cover ahead of the wave is expected to
overspread much of the region and may limit the potential for
diurnal mixing and robust RH reductions. Furthermore, the low-level
thermal ridge (currently relegated to parts of southwest TX) may
become established from west TX into southwest OK, slightly
displaced from the stronger winds to the north. Drier deterministic
solutions hint at a pocket of 20-25% RH persisting into the
overnight hours across central and eastern KS. However, confidence
in this scenario is low given a large spread in guidance for the
overnight period and uncertainties regarding the western extent of
richer moisture return.

These uncertainties imply that elevated conditions are likely across
a broad swath of the region with the potential for critical
conditions from west TX/southwest OK into the CO/NE/KS region. For
this outlook, the Critical risk area delineates where a favorable
overlap of 15-20% RH and strong winds appears most likely, but this
area may be refined in subsequent updates as forecast details become
more clear.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat December 25 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Bitterly cold temperatures to continue through much of the
period across portions of the Northern Plains...


...Overview...

An amplified ridge/upper high should remain anchored over the
northern Pacific into next weekend, resulting in amplified and
renewed troughing downstream across the western U.S. including a
southern stream cutoff upper low which drops down the California
coast later this week. Northern stream shortwaves through the
Western trough and rounding the base of a large vortex across
central Canada, will allow for a series of low pressure systems to
track from the Central U.S. to the Northeast. Meanwhile, another
upper high over the Caribbean will allow for ridging across the
southeastern quadrant of the country to the south of the storm
track. The guidance indicates the anomalously strong high over the
northern Pacific may finally begin to weaken next weekend which
should allow for some ridging to move into the Northwest and shift
the general trough axis eastward.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest models and ensembles continue to show good agreement
with the large scale pattern through much of the period, but with
some lingering uncertainties in the smaller scale details.
Relatively minor model variations were seen with a series of
shortwaves rotating out of the Western U.S. trough towards the
Great Lakes/Northeast and the associated surface lows
Wednesday-Friday. Models are coming into a little bit better
agreement on a closed cutoff low of the California coast
Thursday-Friday. The 18z GFS is a bit farther west of the better
consensus while the UKMET is the quickest to bring it into the
Southwest next weekend. At this point, prefer a middle ground
solution closer to the CMC/ECMWF and ensemble means. As the
southern stream low/energy works into the Southwest, ridging
should once again build into the Northwest as the anomalous north
Pacific ridge finally weakens. The models show some uncertainties
regarding timing and strength of the ridge by days 6-7 related to
questions upstream with troughing dropping down from Alaska.

The early part of the medium range forecast was based on a blend
of purely deterministic models, minus the UKMET which was much too
quick with the southern stream energy into the Southwest. After
day 4, the ensemble means were introduced into the blend and
gradually increased to help mitigate the late period differences.
This provided good continuity through day 6 with yesterdays WPC
forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Precipitation across the West should be rather quiet compared to
the short range period, although some modest snow accumulations
may continue in the higher terrain, especially for parts of
Arizona and the Colorado Rockies on Wednesday. By Thursday though,
another round of heavy mountain snows are possible for portions of
the Pacific Northwest/northern Rockies particularly ahead of the
shortwave dropping down the West Coast. The closed low development
off the California coast may help direct increased moisture into
parts of southern California and the southwest as well
Wednesday-Friday, with snow likely in the higher terrain.

A couple of generally progressive cold fronts will move through
the central and eastern U.S., allowing for periods of widespread
and moderate precipitation across the Tennessee Valley and
Appalachians. The first round on Wednesday into Thursday may bring
a threat for locally heavy to excessive rainfall, particularly for
parts of the southern Appalachians, but with lingering uncertainty
regarding amounts and axis of heavies rain. Precipitation chances
increase again in roughly the same region by the weekend as the
next system makes its way eastward. Some light snow may fall
across northern areas from the Great Lakes into the Northeast with
the second front.

Bitterly cold temperatures should continue through at least
Saturday in parts of especially the northern Plains with daytime
highs (and a lesser extent overnight lows) 20 to 30 degrees below
average. Some areas of northern North Dakota and Montana may stay
below 0F even into next weekend, despite temperatures moderating
slightly as the week progresses. The addition of gusty winds could
result in dangerously cold wind chills, especially for northern
parts of the High Plains where wind chill values could dip well
below 0F for many. Temperatures are also expected to be below
normal across the rest of the western U.S., with the coldest
anomalies on Wednesday where daytime highs could still be 10-20F
below normal. Some records are still possible into Wednesday
across parts of the West. Meanwhile, mild to warm weather is
expected across the south-central U.S. and northeastward through
next week where many places from the southern half of the Plains
to the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic could be 15-25 degrees above
normal on Wednesday. Daily record high minimum and maximum
temperatures are likely. As the pattern deamplifies just slightly
over the country later next week, temperatures across both the
West and East should moderate, but still maintain a general
pattern of cool in the West/north-central U.S. and warm in the
south-central/eastern U.S., just less extreme. A potential pattern
shift may finally bring values back closer to normal by late next
weekend.

0116 AM CST Sun Dec 26 2021

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level disturbance is noted in early-morning water-vapor
imagery moving onto the southern CA coast. This feature will begin
to propagate east/northeast through the course of the morning within
the mean southwesterly flow regime, reaching the Plains by
mid-afternoon. Latest surface observations show weak pressure falls
along the lee of the northern to central Rockies, which will
intensify with the approach of the upper-level wave. A consolidated
lee cyclone will likely become established over the central Plains
by late afternoon, supporting a broad swath of strong winds along
the central and southern High Plains. Given this synoptic regime and
antecedent fuel conditions, the potential for elevated to critical
fire weather conditions remains high.

...Central High Plains to the Texas Panhandle...
Confidence in critical fire weather conditions is highest across the
eastern Plains of CO, western KS, and into the northern TX
Panhandle. Close proximity to the deepening surface low, combined
with a strong low/mid-level jet axis overhead, should support
sustained winds between 25-30 mph with frequent gusts up to 50 mph
across this region. The strong downslope flow will likely support RH
reductions into the 15-20% range, and latest ensemble guidance has
trended towards more scattered cloud cover, which will aid in
diurnal warming. Additionally, fuels across this region remain
critically dry (ERC values are well above seasonal record highs for
some locations), which will help support a robust fire-weather
threat.

...West Texas into Southwest Oklahoma...
The Critical risk area has been expanded southward into the Rolling
Plains of northwest TX. Recent ensemble guidance has trended towards
higher probabilities of RH values falling to near/below 20% across
parts of west TX into southwest OK. This is likely due to better
model consensus regarding the axis of the low-level thermal ridge,
which is already overspreading parts of west TX per recent RAP
mesoanalysis. Ensemble temperature forecasts also show the potential
for record high temperatures through this corridor despite the
potential for mid/high-level cloud cover. Confidence in the
temperature/RH forecast remains somewhat modest given observed cloud
trends in IR imagery. However, the warmer/drier trend in most
deterministic/ensemble guidance, coupled with critically dry fuels
and high probability for 20-25 mph winds, warrants the expansion.

...Significant snowfall for portions of West Coast mountain
ranges; freezing rain threat for parts of interior Northeast
tonight into Sunday morning...

...Anomalously warm temperatures continue for most of the central
and eastern U.S. while cold airmass expands across Northwest;
records possible...

...Dynamic system to bring rain, snow and a wintry mix from the
Northern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic Sunday...

The stagnant upper level jet stream pattern resulting in troughing
in the West and ridging in the South looks to stick around to
close out the holiday weekend and kickoff the final week of 2021.
The most impactful weather remains out West as a pair of storm
systems emerge from the Rockies and eventually become disruptive
winter storms in the Upper Midwest. A steady barrage of Pacific
moisture and anomalously cold temperatures within the atmospheric
column support heavy snowfall rats that will blanket the mountain
ranges of the West; from the Sierra Nevada to the central Rockies,
the former of which is forecast to receive the heaviest snowfall
totals through the next couple days. The Sierra Nevada have
already picked up copious amounts of snow in recent days, and yet
another astonishing 2 to 5 feet of snow is forecast through early
Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, other ranges such as the Shasta, the
Oregon Cascades, the Wasatch, Tetons, and Colorado Rockies can
expect anywhere from 1 to 3 feet of snow. Hazardous travel
conditions are expected across these ranges, prompting the
issuance of Winter Storm Warnings that extend as far south as the
Transverse Range of Southern California. Measurable and disruptive
snowfall accumulations are also on tap in the Pacific Northwest,
including in both the Portland and Seattle metro areas. This
stretch of wintry weather is able to occur thanks to frigid
temperatures, some of which may tie or break record cold highs and
lows both today and Monday.

On the flip side, remarkably warm temperatures remain anchored
over the southern U.S. today and will continue into the first half
of the upcoming week. The mixing of unusually warm temperatures,
low humidity levels, and windy conditions has prompted the Storm
Prediction Center to issue a Critical Risk of fire weather in the
central High Plains and both the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles.
Temperature departures today will be warmest in the Southern
Plains where highs in the 70s and 80s equate to departures of 25
to 40 degrees above normal. The much above normal minimum
temperatures are anticipated throughout the South and into the
Mid-Atlantic today. A passing cold front will cool down part of
the Mid-Atlantic on Monday, but core of the warmest temperature
departures (25 to 40 degrees above normal) moves into the
Mid-South and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Additional daily record warm
lows and highs are expected to be broken in these regions. The one
exception to the anomalous warmth (aside from the cooler, stormy
setup along the West Coast) is the Northern Plains where frigid
Canadian air becomes injected behind a strong cold front. Morning
lows are forecast to be sub-zero in the High Plains of Montana and
North Dakota with daytime highs struggling to get out of the
single digits Sunday. By Monday morning, lows in "Big Sky Country"
are forecast to be bitterly cold, potentially as cold as -15 to
-25 degrees.

Elsewhere, the first in a series of storm systems to exit the
Intermountain West is set to produce heavy snow in the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest Sunday afternoon and into Sunday night.
In advance of this impending winter storm, Winter Storm Watches
have been issues for eastern North Dakota, northern Minnesota, and
northwest Wisconsin. Periods of snow will stick around in the
northern Great Lakes on Monday before tapering off Monday evening.
Snow totals through Monday night are likely to range between 6 to
12 inches with locally higher totals possible, especially in the
Minnesota Arrowhead. This same storm will usher in light snow and

...Significant snowfall for portions of West Coast mountain ranges
and the Intermountain West; record cold for parts of the West
Coast...

...Anomalously warm temperatures continue for most of the southern
and eastern U.S. while cold airmass expands across the Northern
Plains...

...Heavy snow expected in the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest
Sunday night; Light snow and ice accumulations possible in the
northern Mid-Atlantic and interior Northeast Monday morning...

The stagnant upper level jet stream pattern resulting in troughing
in the West and ridging in the South looks to stick around to
close out the holiday weekend and kickoff the final week of 2021.
The most impactful weather remains out West as a pair of storm
systems emerge from the Rockies and eventually become disruptive
winter storms in the Upper Midwest. A steady barrage of Pacific
moisture and anomalously cold temperatures within the atmospheric
column support heavy snowfall rats that will blanket the mountain
ranges of the West; from the Sierra Nevada to the central Rockies,
the former of which is forecast to receive the heaviest snowfall
totals through the next couple days. The Sierra Nevada have
already picked up copious amounts of snow in recent days, and yet
another astonishing 2 to 5 feet of snow is forecast through early
Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, other ranges such as the Shasta, the
Oregon Cascades, the Wasatch, Tetons, and Colorado Rockies can
expect anywhere from 1 to 3 feet of snow. Hazardous travel
conditions are expected across these ranges, prompting the
issuance of Winter Storm Warnings that extend as far south as the
Transverse Range of Southern California. Measurable and disruptive
snowfall accumulations are also on tap in the Pacific Northwest,
including in both the Portland and Seattle metro areas. This
stretch of wintry weather is able to occur thanks to frigid
temperatures, some of which may tie or break record cold highs and
lows both today and Monday.

On the flip side, remarkably warm temperatures remain anchored
over the southern U.S. today and will continue into the first half
of the upcoming week. The mixing of unusually warm temperatures,
low humidity levels, and windy conditions has prompted the Storm
Prediction Center to issue a Critical Risk of fire weather in the
central High Plains and both the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles.
Temperature departures today will be warmest in the Southern
Plains where highs in the 70s and 80s equate to departures of 25
to 40 degrees above normal. The much above normal minimum
temperatures are anticipated throughout the South and into the
Mid-Atlantic today. A passing cold front will cool down part of
the Mid-Atlantic on Monday, but core of the warmest temperature
departures (25 to 40 degrees above normal) moves into the
Mid-South and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Additional daily record warm
lows and highs are expected to be broken in these regions. The one
exception to the anomalous warmth (aside from the cooler, stormy
setup along the West Coast) is the Northern Plains where frigid
Canadian air becomes injected behind a strong cold front. Morning
lows are forecast to be sub-zero in the High Plains of Montana and
North Dakota with daytime highs struggling to get out of the
single digits Sunday. By Monday morning, lows in "Big Sky Country"
are forecast to be bitterly cold, potentially as cold as -15 to
-25 degrees.

Elsewhere, the first in a series of storm systems to exit the
Intermountain West is set to produce heavy snow in the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest Sunday afternoon and into Sunday night.
In advance of this impending winter storm, Winter Storm Watches
have been issues for eastern North Dakota, northern Minnesota, and
northwest Wisconsin. Periods of snow will stick around in the
northern Great Lakes on Monday before tapering off Monday evening.
Snow totals through Monday night are likely to range between 6 to
12 inches with locally higher totals possible, especially in the
Minnesota Arrowhead. This same storm will usher in light snow and
freezing rain accumulations to the northern Mid-Atlantic and
interior Northeast Monday morning. While totals look to be light,
slick travel conditions and delays are possible in these areas on
Monday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0207 AM CST Sun Dec 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow over the central/southern Rockies will persist well into
Monday ahead of a second upper-level wave. While winds aloft will
weaken considerably compared to Sunday, sufficient flow will be in
place to support weak lee troughing near a surface high over KS/MO.
As a result, south to southwesterly surface winds will increase
through the afternoon over a region with antecedent dry fuels,
supporting another day of fire weather concerns.

...Central High Plains...
Dry and windy conditions on Sunday will prime the environment for
Monday's fire weather potential. Poor moisture return into the
region will help maintain a dry air mass, and critically dry fuels
will see little improvement due to somewhat poor overnight RH
recoveries Sunday night into Monday. Although cloud cover will
increase through the day, ensemble guidance shows reasonably high
probability for 15-25% RH along the I-25 corridor by Monday
afternoon. Combined with sustained winds between 15-25 mph, elevated
conditions are probable.

...Western Oklahoma...
Elevated fire weather conditions may evolve during the late
morning/early afternoon hours across western OK. A dry air mass in
place may see RH values fall to near 20% via diurnal warming prior
to the arrival of clouds in the afternoon. Northeast to easterly
winds around 15 mph may support areas of elevated conditions before
gradually weakening later in the afternoon. Although fuels across
western OK are receptive, uncertainties regarding cloud cover and
wind potential yield low confidence in the overall threat at this
time.

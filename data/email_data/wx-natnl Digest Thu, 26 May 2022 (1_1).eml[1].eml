Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

No changes to the previous forecast.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 AM CDT Wed May 25 2022/

...Synopsis...
Northwesterly flow will persist across the Four Corners region into
the southern High Plains for today, maintaining at least regional
fire weather concerns. Early morning surface observations show very
dry conditions (nocturnal RH values in the single digits and teens)
across western NM into eastern AZ, and 00 UTC RAOBs also show
limited boundary-layer moisture. No appreciable moisture recovery is
expected, fostering another day of 5-15% RH values region wide.
Furthermore, active wildfires were noted yesterday across the
region, confirming the presence of critically dry fuels. Winds today
will generally be more benign compared to Tuesday as the surface low
over southern TX weakens. However, 20-30 mph flow within the
boundary layer will likely mix down amid strong diurnal heating by
mid afternoon. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph are expected, and
occasional gusts to 30-35 mph are possible (especially for locations
that typically see terrain-enhanced winds). Consequently, areas of
elevated (to briefly critical) fire weather conditions are expected.

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, an amplified 500-hPa height pattern is forecast
across the contiguous U.S. (CONUS), with mid-level high (low) pressure
forecast
over the East (West). The axis of mid-level low pressure is forecast to
retrograde closer to the Pacific Coast, resulting in increased chances for
high
winds across the southwestern CONUS, along with the potential for below nor=
mal
temperatures continuing across parts of the Intermountain Region, extending
into the Northern and Central Plains. By the middle of the period, the patt=
ern
is forecast to become less amplified, although there are indications of
increased broad mid-level high pressure developing over the south-central
CONUS, with excessive heat concerns increasing across parts of Texas during
the
second half of the period. Flooding risks remain elevated across the Red Ri=
ver
of the North, northern Minnesota, and eastern parts of the Central and
Southern
Plains.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat across the San Joaquin Valley in California,
Thu,
Jun 2.

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of Texas, Sun-Wed, Jun 5-8.

Slight risk of much below-normal minimum temperatures across eastern parts =
of
the Intermountain West, extending into parts of the Central and Northern
Plains, Thu-Fri, Jun 2-3.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Southeast, Thu-Mon, =
Jun
2-6.

Slight risk of high winds across the parts of the southwestern CONUS, Thu-M=
on,
Jun 2-6.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North and northern
Minnesota.

Flooding possible across eastern parts of the Central and Southern Plains.

FOR THURSDAY JUNE 02 - WEDNESDAY JUNE 08: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles depict troughing across the interior West late in week-1,
retrograding toward the Pacific Coast at the outset of week-2. A slight ris=
k
of
excessive heat remains posted for the San Joaquin Valley in California on
day-8
(Jun 2) only as surface low pressure over the Desert Southwest promotes
downslope flow into the region, and the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools dep=
ict
at least a 20 percent chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile and 95 deg F. The signal diminishes thereafter, with the
aforementioned troughing favoring temperatures closer to or even slightly
below
normal across California for the remainder of the period.



The troughing in the West late in week-1 favors an associated surface low
pressure system to track across the Great Plains, with a cold front forecas=
t
to
move through the region prior to the start of week-2 and usher in a period =
of
below normal temperatures across parts of the west-central CONUS. Therefore=
, a
slight risk of much below-normal temperatures is posted Jun 2-3 across east=
ern
parts of the Intermountain West, extending into parts of the Central and
Northern Plains. The GEFS reforecast tool indicates at least a 20 percent
chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile of the
climatological distribution and 40 deg F, with the potential for some high
elevation areas to fall below freezing. The ECMWF is much more robust compa=
red
to the GEFS, indicating probabilities as high as 60 percent for temperature=
s
falling below the 15th percentile, and a more expansive area of subfreezing
temperatures in the higher elevations. While some consideration was given f=
or
a
moderate risk, the weaker signal in the GEFS combined with the fact that
temperatures in early June will not be as cold as during the winter, suppor=
ts
only a slight risk. The slight risk includes parts of the Northern and Cent=
ral
Plains, and parts of northern Minnesota, where the GEFS and  ECMWF reforeca=
st
tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance overnight lows fall below 40 de=
g
F,
which could result in some isolated frost.



The retrogression of the trough toward the Pacific Coast early in week-2
favors
a westward shift in the elevated risk area for high winds compared to
yesterday. The ECMWF reforecast tool now depicts at least a 20 percent chan=
ce
wind speeds exceed the 85th percentile and 20-mph across portions of
California, the Southwest, Four Corners Region, and the Central and Souther=
n
High Plains. A slight risk of high winds is posted across these areas from =
Jun
2-6. Increased wind speeds over regions with severe to, in some cases,
exceptional drought favors increased potential for wildfires.



Downstream of the troughing, broad ridging may develop across the south-
central
CONUS toward the middle of the period. The GEFS reforecast tool indicates a=
t
least a 20 percent chance maximum temperatures exceed the 85th percentile a=
nd
95 deg F starting on day-10 (Jun 4), with the ECMWF reforecast tool indicat=
ing
these elevated probabilities beginning a day later (Jun 5). Additionally, t=
he
composite ECMWF/GEFS heat probabilistic tool depicts areas of Texas having
increased potential (20-40 percent chance) for heat indices of 105-110 deg =
F
late in week-2, supporting the slight risk of excessive heat during the sec=
ond
half of week-2 (Jun 5-8). This could exacerbate and expand the ongoing
drought,
but will wait to see if this heat signal persists in the model guidance bef=
ore
considering a rapid onset drought hazard given the long lead time.



Across the East, anomalous ridging late in week-1 and early week-2 favors
anomalously warm temperatures with some locations along the Eastern Seaboar=
d
potentially topping 90 deg F on day-8 (Jun 2), with the ECMWF ensemble
depicting a warmer solution compared to the GEFS. However, heat indices are
not
forecast to reach the 100 (105) deg F threshold over the Northeast
(Mid-Atlantic), precluding a related excessive heat hazard. Temperatures ar=
e
forecast to moderate by the middle of the period as a frontal system traver=
ses
the eastern U.S., and more troughing develops over the region.



This troughing is forecast to subsequently increase tropical moisture flow
across the southeastern CONUS. The uncalibrated 0z ECMWF and GEFS ensembles
depict at least 2-3 inches of rain across parts of the Florida Peninsula
during
the week-2 period, with the 0z GEFS even indicating 4 inch totals across so=
uth
Florida. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20
percent chance 3-day precipitation totals exceed the 85th climatological
percentile and 1 inch through the middle of the period over the area, and
therefore, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is highlighted across parts=
 of
the Southeast, particularly the Florida Peninsula, from Jun 2-6.



River flooding is ongoing across areas along the Red River of the North,
Northern Minnesota, and eastern parts of the Central and Southern Plains.
Heavy
rain is forecast over these areas late in the week-1 period, which favors t=
he
flooding risks to persist into week-2. The flooding possible shape is remov=
ed
from Mainland Alaska due to the decline in available snow melt water.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CDT Wed May 25 2022

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

No changes to the previous forecast. Elevated to locally critical
conditions remain possible in parts of Nevada tomorrow. Isolated
thunderstorms also remain a possibility from central into
northeastern Nevada. Thermodynamic profiles still appear only weakly
supportive of isolated lightning flashes. Areas of virga showers
with gusty outflow winds are the more likely scenario.

..Wendt.. 05/25/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Wed May 25 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will increase for parts of the Great Basin
Thursday afternoon. An approaching upper-level wave off the West
Coast will support pressure falls across the northern Great Basin
and Pacific Northwest. The low-level mass response will induce
south/southwesterly downslope flow off the Sierra Nevada into
northwestern and southern NV. Little moisture recovery into the
region is expected over the next 48 hours, and the combination of
downslope effects and deep boundary-layer mixing will exacerbate
low-level dryness. Forecast RH values in the 10-15% range appear
likely based on ensemble consensus, through some locations may see
RH values fall into the single digits. The modest nature of the
pressure falls will likely support 15-20 mph winds and several hours
of elevated fire weather conditions, though frequent gusts between
25-30 mph appear probable for southern NV where the strongest wind
signal is noted in ensemble guidance. Fuels across southern NV
remain critically dry based on latest ERC analyses and will support
the fire weather threat. Portions of northwest NV have seen only
5-10% of their normal rainfall over the past 30 days per AHPS
analyses, and reports from the local WFO indication that
lower-elevation grasses have cured. This fuel information, combined
with reasonably high confidence in elevated wind/RH conditions,
warrant an expansion of the risk area into northwest NV.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
The approach of the upper-level wave will also provide sufficient
lift for scattered showers and thunderstorms across the greater
Pacific Northwest region. Forecast soundings from multiple models
hint that adequate mid-level moisture and steep mid-level lapse
rates may be in place across northern NV to support a few isolated
thunderstorms. PWAT values near 0.5 inches and a deep/dry sub-cloud
layer will support the potential for dry lightning. At this time the
greatest potential for thunderstorms only marginally overlaps
spatially with critically dry fuels, but this potential will be
monitored for northwest to central NV where fuels are receptive.

300 PM EDT Wed May 25 2022

Valid 12Z Sat May 28 2022 - 12Z Wed Jun 01 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

Behind a departing eastern U.S. upper trough and embedded low,
guidance is agreeable and consistent with developing a very
amplified western trough/eastern ridge pattern whose slow
evolution raises the potential for a period of significant
precipitation from the northern Rockies into the northern-central
Plains and Upper Midwest.  A system reaching the Pacific Northwest
coast on Saturday may also bring a brief period of locally
moderate to heavy precipitation to that part of the country.
Scattered rainfall may develop over parts of the South heading
toward the middle of next week, depending on uncertain details of
upper energy that could try to retrograde underneath the eastern
U.S. ridge.  This pattern evolution will gradually shift much
above normal temperatures from the Plains more into the northern
half or two-thirds of the East while it spreads much below normal
temperatures (especially for highs) through the West and into the
northern Plains.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

Within the agreeable and consistent large scale forecast,
individual models and ensembles differ with some important details
that will affect sensible weather specifics at some locations.
Near the East Coast, guidance continues to have difficulty with
handling the weekend upper trough/low.  Consensus from the 00Z/06Z
package appeared to have nudged somewhat slower than the majority
from the prior 12Z cycle.  The 06Z GFS was on the extreme slow
side but both the 00Z/06Z GFS runs hold it far enough back to
result in an ultimate path toward the Southeast coast as upper
ridging builds to the west/north.  Remaining guidance and the 12Z
GFS are more progressive with the main trough/low, with only
lingering southern periphery energy serving as any feature that
could slide beneath the upper ridge.  Meanwhile, the 12Z models
are showing a significant consolidation toward a more GFS-like
solution (though not as strong as the 06Z run) for the compact but
potentially vigorous system expected to reach the Pacific
Northwest coast on Saturday.  Models generally agree that this and
surrounding dynamics should yield a closed low that tracks
approximately through the Northwest/Great Basin into northern
Rockies during Sunday-Tuesday.  However from Monday onward there
is enough spread for the exact path/strength/timing of the upper
low and shortwave details ahead of it to lower confidence in
specifics of the wavy surface boundary setting up over the
Rockies/central U.S. along with accompanying significant
precipitation.  Developing differences upstream over the Pacific
may begin to have some influence toward midweek as well.

The updated forecast started with a blend of the 00Z/06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC for about the first half of the period,
leading to a conservative forecast for the initial East Coast
trough/low and intermediate/consensus forecast across the West,
with the amplifying upper trough likely reaching its greatest
depth around Monday.  Widening detail spread later in the period
favored maintaining a blended model/ensemble mean approach by
Tuesday-Wednesday.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

On Saturday a compact but potentially vigorous system should bring
a brief episode of locally moderate to heavy precipitation and
possibly brisk winds to parts of the Pacific Northwest on
Saturday.  This system and its moisture will contribute to a
larger scale upper low tracking into/through the West during the
weekend into next week and reinforce a leading wavy frontal
already in place over the central U.S. during the weekend.  Some
showers and thunderstorms will be possible over the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest during the weekend with this leading front,
while the combination of the western upper low and developing low
level upslope flow could produce a multi-day period of heavy
precipitation potential over and just east of the northern Rockies
from the weekend into next week.  This may include heavy snow at
high elevations within the northern Rockies.  By the middle of
next week rainfall may become heavier along the wavy front over
the central Plains.  The upper trough/low initially near the East
Coast could produce some scattered showers/thunderstorms on
Saturday followed by a drier trend over most of the East.
Depending on how energy aloft to the south of the building eastern
ridge evolves, some showers/storms could develop over parts of the
South toward midweek.  The Florida Peninsula should see episodes
of showers and thunderstorms through the period.

Temperatures will be quite warm across the central and southern
Plains during the weekend into the start of next week with highs
reaching well into the 90s from southern Nebraska to the Gulf
Coast, and on Saturday-Sunday some low-mid 100s across western
Texas which could challenge some daily records.  The heat will
then build eastward/northeastward as upper ridging strengthens
over the East, with plus 10-20F anomalies becoming increasingly
entrenched over the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley/Northeast.  Well below
normal temperatures will gradually progress from west to east
across the West and into the northern Plains as upper troughing
deepens and then persists over the western U.S.  Expect one or
more days with highs 10-20F below normal and possibly localized
colder readings over parts of the northern Rockies/High Plains.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed May 25 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 31 - JUN 04, 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement on =
the forecast mid-level
circulation pattern across the North American region. A ridge is forecast t=
o
amplify over the North Pacific to the west of Canada with positive 500-hPa
height anomalies extending over Mainland Alaska. A forecast trough over the
western CONUS is weaker in amplitude relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDs 6-10 day period
forecasts, while a greater amplitude ridge is forecast over the eastern CON=
US
in recent ensemble mean forecasts.

Above normal temperatures are favored over much of Alaska, except for the
Alaska Panhandle, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
temperatures are favored over most of the western CONUS, excluding Pacific
coastal states and parts of the Southwest along the Mexican border, under t=
he
forecast trough early in the period and consistent with dynamical model
temperature tools. Above normal temperatures are favored for parts of the
Southern Plains and the eastern CONUS, excluding the eastern Gulf Coast, un=
der
a predicted ridge.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for the eastern Aleutians an=
d
for most of Mainland Alaska, consistent with dynamical model precipitation
tools. Below normal precipitation is favored for parts of California and
Nevada, ahead of a forecast ridge. Above normal precipitation is favored fo=
r
interior areas of the Pacific Northwest, much of the Rockies, the Central
Plains, and the Northern Plains, under and ahead of the forecast trough.
Southerly moisture flow into eastern areas of the Southwest enhances
probabilities of above normal precipitation for this area.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by some differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools and increased model spread later in the period=
.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 02 - 08 2022

The predicted circulation pattern for the 6-10 day period persists into the
week-2, however 500-hPa height anomalies are very weak in the week-2 ensemb=
le
means and the manual blend due to a significant increase in uncertainty.
Slightly positive anomalies extend northeastward from the North Pacific ove=
r
much of Mainland Alaska in the manual blend. Slightly negative 500-hPa heig=
ht
anomalies are forecast over the Alaska Panhandle in the ensemble means of t=
he
GEFS and Canadian models. Weak troughing and negative 500-hPa height anomal=
ies
are forecast over the western CONUS early in the week-2 period. A weak ridg=
e
and positive 500-hPa height anomalies persist over much of the eastern CONU=
S
into the beginning of week-2. Near average mid-level heights are forecast o=
ver
the Gulf Coast.

Above normal temperatures are slightly favored over much of the Aleutians a=
nd
Mainland Alaska, excluding southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, under slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
temperatures are slightly favored for much of the northwestern and
north-central CONUS under the predicted trough early in the period. Above
normal temperatures are favored for eastern areas of the Southwest, the
Southern Plains, the Lower Mississippi Valley, and much of the eastern CONU=
S,
excluding parts of the Southeast, consistent with the temperature
consolidation
tool.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for interior Mainland Alaska=
,
consistent with the dynamical model forecasts, under southerly flow. Near t=
o
above normal precipitation is favored for most of the Pacific Northwest,
Northern Rockies, and Northern Intermountain West, under a predicted trough
early in the period. Below normal precipitation is slightly favored for par=
ts
of California and the Great Basin, supported by dynamical model precipitati=
on
tools. Above normal precipitation is favored for eastern areas of the
Southwest, as moisture is drawn northward into the region.  Below normal
precipitation is favored for parts of East Texas, consistent with the
precipitation consolidation tool. Above normal precipitation is favored for
much of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, consistent with the precipitation
consolidation tool and increased moisture flow from the Gulf of Mexico and =
the
Atlantic. Probabilities of below normal precipitation are increased for par=
ts
of the western Great Lakes region, under the predicted ridge.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well below average, 1 out of 5=
,
due to predicted very weak mean 500-hPa anomalies across most of the foreca=
st
domain and weak and conflicting signals in the temperature and precipitatio=
n
tools over most regions.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 16.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
318 PM EDT Wed May 25 2022

Valid 12Z Sat May 28 2022 - 12Z Wed Jun 01 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

Behind a departing eastern U.S. upper trough and embedded low,
guidance is agreeable and consistent with developing a very
amplified western trough/eastern ridge pattern whose slow
evolution raises the potential for a period of significant
precipitation from the northern Rockies into the northern-central
Plains and Upper Midwest.  A system reaching the Pacific Northwest
coast on Saturday may also bring a brief period of locally
moderate to heavy precipitation to that part of the country.
Scattered rainfall may develop over parts of the South heading
toward the middle of next week, depending on uncertain details of
upper energy that could try to retrograde underneath the eastern
U.S. ridge.  This pattern evolution will gradually shift much
above normal temperatures from the Plains more into the northern
half or two-thirds of the East while it spreads much below normal
temperatures (especially for highs) through the West and into the
northern Plains.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

Within the agreeable and consistent large scale forecast,
individual models and ensembles differ with some important details
that will affect sensible weather specifics at some locations.
Near the East Coast, guidance continues to have difficulty with
handling the weekend upper trough/low.  Consensus from the 00Z/06Z
package appeared to have nudged somewhat slower than the majority
from the prior 12Z cycle.  The 06Z GFS was on the extreme slow
side but both the 00Z/06Z GFS runs hold it far enough back to
result in an ultimate path toward the Southeast coast as upper
ridging builds to the west/north.  Remaining guidance and the 12Z
GFS are more progressive with the main trough/low, with only
lingering southern periphery energy serving as any feature that
could slide beneath the upper ridge.  Meanwhile, the 12Z models
are showing a significant consolidation toward a more GFS-like
solution (though not as strong as the 06Z run) for the compact but
potentially vigorous system expected to reach the Pacific
Northwest coast on Saturday.  Models generally agree that this and
surrounding dynamics should yield a closed low that tracks
approximately through the Northwest/Great Basin into northern
Rockies during Sunday-Tuesday.  However from Monday onward there
is enough spread for the exact path/strength/timing of the upper
low and shortwave details ahead of it to lower confidence in
specifics of the wavy surface boundary setting up over the
Rockies/central U.S. along with accompanying significant
precipitation.  Developing differences upstream over the Pacific
may begin to have some influence toward midweek as well.

The updated forecast started with a blend of the 00Z/06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC for about the first half of the period,
leading to a conservative forecast for the initial East Coast
trough/low and intermediate/consensus forecast across the West,
with the amplifying upper trough likely reaching its greatest
depth around Monday.  Widening detail spread later in the period
favored maintaining a blended model/ensemble mean approach by
Tuesday-Wednesday.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

On Saturday a compact but potentially vigorous system should bring
a brief episode of locally moderate to heavy precipitation and
possibly brisk winds to parts of the Pacific Northwest on
Saturday.  This system and its moisture will contribute to a
larger scale upper low tracking into/through the West during the
weekend into next week and reinforce a leading wavy frontal
already in place over the central U.S. during the weekend.  Some
showers and thunderstorms will be possible over the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest during the weekend with this leading front,
while the combination of the western upper low and developing low
level upslope flow could produce a multi-day period of heavy
precipitation potential over and just east of the northern Rockies
from the weekend into next week.  This may include heavy snow at
high elevations within the northern Rockies.  By the middle of
next week rainfall may become heavier along the wavy front over
the central Plains.  The Storm Prediction Center is monitoring the
potential for severe weather with the activity over the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest during the weekend, as well as for what
reaches the Plains next week but with too much uncertainty in
details for the latter to resolve the specifics at this time.
Check the latest SPC outlooks for additional information on severe
threats.  The upper trough/low initially near the East Coast could
produce some scattered showers/thunderstorms on Saturday followed
by a drier trend over most of the East.  Depending on how energy
aloft to the south of the building eastern ridge evolves, some
showers/storms could develop over parts of the South toward
midweek.  The Florida Peninsula should see episodes of showers and
thunderstorms through the period.

Temperatures will be quite warm across the central and southern
Plains during the weekend into the start of next week with highs
reaching well into the 90s from southern Nebraska to the Gulf
Coast, and on Saturday-Sunday some low-mid 100s across western
Texas which could challenge some daily records.  The heat will
then build eastward/northeastward as upper ridging strengthens
over the East, with plus 10-20F anomalies becoming increasingly
entrenched over the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley/Northeast.  Well below
normal temperatures will gradually progress from west to east
across the West and into the northern Plains as upper troughing
deepens and then persists over the western U.S.  Expect one or
more days with highs 10-20F below normal and possibly localized
colder readings over parts of the northern Rockies/High Plains.

above normal temperatures from the Plains more into the northern
half or two-thirds of the East while it spreads much below normal
temperatures (especially for highs) through the West and into the
northern Plains.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

Within the agreeable and consistent large scale forecast,
individual models and ensembles differ with some important details
that will affect sensible weather specifics at some locations.
Near the East Coast, guidance continues to have difficulty with
handling the weekend upper trough/low.  Consensus from the 00Z/06Z
package appeared to have nudged somewhat slower than the majority
from the prior 12Z cycle.  The 06Z GFS was on the extreme slow
side but both the 00Z/06Z GFS runs hold it far enough back to
result in an ultimate path toward the Southeast coast as upper
ridging builds to the west/north.  Remaining guidance and the 12Z
GFS are more progressive with the main trough/low, with only
lingering southern periphery energy serving as any feature that
could slide beneath the upper ridge.  Meanwhile, the 12Z models
are showing a significant consolidation toward a more GFS-like
solution (though not as strong as the 06Z run) for the compact but
potentially vigorous system expected to reach the Pacific
Northwest coast on Saturday.  Models generally agree that this and
surrounding dynamics should yield a closed low that tracks
approximately through the Northwest/Great Basin into northern
Rockies during Sunday-Tuesday.  However from Monday onward there
is enough spread for the exact path/strength/timing of the upper
low and shortwave details ahead of it to lower confidence in
specifics of the wavy surface boundary setting up over the
Rockies/central U.S. along with accompanying significant
precipitation.  Developing differences upstream over the Pacific
may begin to have some influence toward midweek as well.

The updated forecast started with a blend of the 00Z/06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC for about the first half of the period,
leading to a conservative forecast for the initial East Coast
trough/low and intermediate/consensus forecast across the West,
with the amplifying upper trough likely reaching its greatest
depth around Monday.  Widening detail spread later in the period
favored maintaining a blended model/ensemble mean approach by
Tuesday-Wednesday.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

On Saturday a compact but potentially vigorous system should bring
a brief episode of locally moderate to heavy precipitation and
possibly brisk winds to parts of the Pacific Northwest on
Saturday.  This system and its moisture will contribute to a
larger scale upper low tracking into/through the West during the
weekend into next week and reinforce a leading wavy frontal
already in place over the central U.S. during the weekend.  Some
showers and thunderstorms will be possible over the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest during the weekend with this leading front,
while the combination of the western upper low and developing low
level upslope flow could produce a multi-day period of heavy
precipitation potential over and just east of the northern Rockies
from the weekend into next week.  This may include heavy snow at
high elevations within the northern Rockies.  By the middle of
next week rainfall may become heavier along the wavy front over
the central Plains.  The Storm Prediction Center is monitoring the
potential for severe weather with the activity over the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest during the weekend, as well as for what
reaches the Plains next week but with too much uncertainty in
details for the latter to resolve the specifics at this time.
Check the latest SPC outlooks for additional information on severe
threats.  The upper trough/low initially near the East Coast could
produce some scattered showers/thunderstorms on Saturday followed
by a drier trend over most of the East.  Depending on how energy
aloft to the south of the building eastern ridge evolves, some
showers/storms could develop over parts of the South toward
midweek.  The Florida Peninsula should see episodes of showers and
thunderstorms through the period.

Temperatures will be quite warm across the central and southern
Plains during the weekend into the start of next week with highs
reaching well into the 90s from southern Nebraska to the Gulf
Coast, and on Saturday-Sunday some low-mid 100s across western
Texas which could challenge some daily records.  The heat will
then build eastward/northeastward as upper ridging strengthens
over the East, with plus 10-20F anomalies becoming increasingly
entrenched over the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley/Northeast.  Well below
normal temperatures will gradually progress from west to east
across the West and into the northern Plains as upper troughing
deepens and then persists over the western U.S.  Expect one or
more days with highs 10-20F below normal and possibly localized
colder readings over parts of the northern Rockies/High Plains.

...Flash flooding and severe weather threat continues for the
eastern half of the country...

...Above normal temperatures and some fire weather risk expected
in the West...

...Pacific storm system will bring showers and thunderstorms from
the Northwest to the Northern Great Plains late Thursday into
Friday...

The risk for flash flooding and severe weather will accompany a
complex storm system moving through the eastern half of the
country through the short-term forecast period (Friday evening). A
warm, moist airmass will continue to expand northward as a warm
front lifts north through the Great Lakes region late Wednesday
and a cold front moves slowly eastward, helping to maintain the
development of widespread showers and thunderstorms. There is a
Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of Excessive Rainfall Thursday for the
Central Gulf Coast where thunderstorms will tend to develop and
move over the same areas promoting widespread rainfall totals
between 2-3 inches, with the risk of significantly higher totals
between 3-6 inches possible. Rainfall over the region Wednesday
will also leave saturadated soils contirbuting to the risk for
flooding. A broader Slight Risk is in place northward through
portions of the Southeast into the Southern Appalachians with
rainfall totals between 1-2 inches forecast, locally as high as
3-4 inches into the Southern Applachians. Further northward, there
is a severe weather risk across portions of the Upper Ohio Valley
where the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level
2/5). Storms will carry the threat for gusty winds along with
isolated instances of hail and perhaps a tornado. The heavy
rainfall and severe weather risk continues Friday as the cold
front moves slowly eastward. There is a Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall from the Piedmont of North Carolina north through the
Mid-Atlantic. Rainfall totals between 1-2 inches are forecast,
with isolated totals above 3 inches possible. There is also a
Slight Risk of severe weather across the same region as gusty
winds accompany lines of thunderstorms moving across the region,
with some hail also possible. Outside of the highlighted areas,
rainfall locally of up to an inch is possible for locations from
the Central Mississippi Valley to the East Coast.

Meanwhile, in the West, well above normal tempeartures across
California Wednesday will expand eastward to the Great Basin as
well as the Rockies and High Plains Thursday and Friday as an
upper-level ridge moves across the region. High tempeartures
Thursday in the Great Basin will reach the low 90s, around 15
degrees above normal for this time of year. The high temperatures
as well as dry conditions and gusty downslope winds have prompted
an Elevated Risk of Fire Weather from the Storm Prediction Center
for most of Nevada. Hot temperatures will also continue across the
San Joaquin Valley of California and the Desert Southwest with
highs at or above 100 forecast. The High Plains will see similary
abnormal high temperatures Friday with tempartures into the 90s as
far north as South Dakota.

Later in the period, a Pacific storm system will move into the
Northwest late Thursday afternoon and evening. Scattered showers
and thunderstorms, along will cooler tempeatures, will expand from
the coast to the Northern Rockies. Storms are expected to continue
Friday as a cold front pushes eastward across the region with
showers and thunderstorms spreading into the Northern Plains by
Friday evening.

0107 AM CDT Thu May 26 2022

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather concerns remain likely this afternoon across
northwestern to southern Nevada. Early-morning water vapor imagery
reveals an upper-level wave approaching the Pacific Northwest.
Surface pressure falls across the northern Great Basin will induce
south to southwesterly winds off the Sierra Nevada and lower CO
River Valley. Sustained winds between 15 to 20 mph are expected by
early afternoon based on ensemble guidance. However, deep
boundary-layer mixing will support frequent wind gusts between 25-35
mph, especially across central to southern NV where nearly all
solutions show the strongest low-level mass response. Downslope
effects, combined with antecedent dry conditions and diurnal
warming, will support RH reductions into the 10-15% range across
much of the region. Consequently, elevated (to briefly critical)
fire weather conditions appear likely, including across far western
NV where several lightning strikes were noted Wednesday afternoon.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
The approaching upper low will also support the potential for
isolated to scattered thunderstorms by late afternoon across the
Pacific Northwest and parts of the northern Great Basin. Observed 00
UTC soundings show an increase in column precipitable water over the
region, but values remain near 0.3 to 0.5 inches. Continued
moistening is expected, but PWATs will likely remain near 0.5 to
0.75 across NV and will support a dry-lightning threat. While the
probability for thunderstorms is highest across portions of OR, WA,
and ID, a few dry thunderstorms are possible across central to
northern NV. An isolated dry-thunderstorm risk area is introduced
where confidence in thunderstorms overlapping with critically dry
fuels is highest.

...Above normal temperatures and some fire weather risk in the
West...

A wrapped-up storm system in the Mississippi Valley will continue
its trek to the northeast today, bringing a variety of weather
hazards to the Midwest, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast. Southerly
flow out of the Gulf of Mexico has transported warm and saturated
air northward to the Great Lakes region, and scattered showers
with some storms will continue through the morning hours. This
afternoon, daytime heating will promote more expansive showers and
thunderstorms, some of which may be severe along the I-75 corridor
from Ohio southward to Georgia. In addition, heavy rain falling
over areas that have received appreciable rainfall recently may
lead to areas of flash flooding. Areas under the highest threat
will be around the Mobile, AL area into the Florida panhandle. By
Friday, the storm will continue to move through the Midwest into
the Northeast, carrying its cold front across the central/southern
Appalachians. Showers and thunderstorms will again expand in
coverage during the afternoon hours with a focus over the
Mid-Atlantic region for both severe weather and flash flooding.

In the West, a cold front will move into coastal Washington and
Oregon late tonight. Ahead of the system, mild temperatures and
overspreading moisture will contribute to showers and
thunderstorms over eastern Oregon into central Idaho, some of
which may be severe. The Storm Prediction Center has indicated a
Slight Risk of storms with the main threat of damaging wind and
hail. Temperatures over much of the West will be well above normal
today, except for along the immediate coast. By Friday, the front
in the Northwest will being in cooler air to Washington and Oregon
eastward to northern Idaho, as the core of the heat moves into the
central Rockies and the western portion of the High Plains. Some
areas may approach record highs. South of this frontal system,
warm temperatures, low relative humidity values, and breezy winds
will support a fire weather risk over much of Nevada where some
dry thunderstorms may also be possible.

...Synopsis...
Increasing west to southwest winds across parts of the southern
Great Basin, Southwest, and Four Corners will lead to a broad swath
of fire weather concerns Friday afternoon. The upper-level wave
currently approaching the Pacific Northwest is forecast to translate
into the northern Rockies by late Friday. Falling heights aloft will
support modest surface pressure falls over the inter-mountain West,
resulting in a broad low-level mass response from the southern Great
Basin into the Four Corners and Southwest. Ensemble guidance and
deterministic solutions generally suggest that 15-20 mph winds will
be common across this region. Drier/windier solutions indicate that
areas of 20-25 mph winds are possible, but considerable spread in
deterministic solutions introduces uncertainty regarding the exact
placement and coverage of the strongest winds. Strong mid and
upper-level winds will largely be displaced to the north of the
region, which further limits confidence on where the windiest
corridors will be established within the risk area.

Nonetheless, dry conditions will prevail with 10-15% RH values
expected by late afternoon. Widespread elevated conditions are
likely, and a few corridors of critical conditions are possible.
Similar wind/RH conditions are possible across much of the southern
High Plains as well, but widespread rainfall over the past few days
has mitigated fuel status for the time being. Fuel trends will be
monitored for a possible expansion, but Friday's warm/dry conditions
will likely begin the drying process for most locations as
temperatures rebound into the 90s.

256 AM EDT Thu May 26 2022

Valid 12Z Sun May 29 2022 - 12Z Thu Jun 2 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A more amplified upper level pattern is expected to become
established over the continental U.S. going into the Memorial Day
weekend and extending into the middle of next week.  Multiple
shortwave impulses will reinforce a rather deep synoptic scale
trough over the western U.S. whilst a large upper ridge and closed
high builds downstream across the Mississippi River Valley and
eventually the Eastern U.S. by early next week.  This overall
pattern will likely become more quasi-zonal by next Thursday with
the western trough lifting out and the ridge breaking down some.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in good overall agreement on most
aspects of the forecast going through Memorial Day, and model
spread has decreased over the past 24 hours with improved forecast
confidence.  However, mesoscale differences regarding smaller
scale features remain, and this has an effect on the placement of
MCS activity and heavier areas of rainfall.  There is also
increasing model spread regarding the weakening of the upper
trough by late in the forecast period.  However, there is very
good model agreement on the building upper ridge over the Ohio
Valley going through the middle of next week.  The WPC forecast
incorporated some of the GEFS/ECENS means for the Tuesday through
Thursday time period to account for the mesoscale uncertainty,
whilst still maintaining some of the deterministic CMC/ECMWF/GFS,
and generally shows good continuity with the previous WPC forecast
as well.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

The main focus for precipitation will extend from the northwestern
U.S. through the northern-central Plains to the western Great
Lakes.  Showers and storms will initially develop across the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest in response to a developing low
pressure and frontal boundary over the north-central U.S. on
Sunday, while some precipitation extends back into the northern
Rockies and vicinity.  Another stronger shortwave is forecast to
slowly cross the Rockies and interact with the wavy and slow
moving frontal system setting up over the Plains.  The result will
be late season snow for the higher terrain of the Northern
Rockies, with potentially over a foot of accumulation above 8000
feet elevation.  There is also an increasing potential for heavy
rainfall across much of Montana, northern Wyoming, and the western
Dakotas by early next week behind the front with moist upslope
flow, with perhaps 2 to 4 inches for the foothills of the Montana
Rockies.  The focus for heavy rainfall and strong storms is then
expected to be across the central Plains by the middle of the week.

Temperatures will be quite warm across the central and southern
Plains for the weekend with highs reaching well into the 90s from
southern Nebraska to the Gulf Coast, and some low-mid 100s across
western Texas which could challenge some daily records.  The heat
then builds eastward to include the Ohio Valley and eventually the
East Coast going into early next week, compliments of the building
upper ridge and southerly flow ahead of the storm system over the
Plains.  This will equate to widespread upper 80s to middle 90s
for highs going into the beginning of June.  Well below normal
temperatures will likely encompass areas from the Pacific
Northwest to the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains as the upper
trough moves in behind the cold front, with highs 15 to 25 degrees
below late May averages.

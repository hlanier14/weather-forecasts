Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1034 AM CST Sat Jan 22 2022

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Morning observations and latest guidance continue to suggest low
fire weather potential for today. Recent observations from the
coastal southern CA mountains show wind gusts between 50-65 mph,
which will likely continue through the afternoon before gradually
abating tonight. While RH in the teens and 20s is supporting
elevated to critical wind/RH combinations, latest fuel information
continues to show ERC values below seasonal average.

..Moore.. 01/22/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1221 AM CST Sat Jan 22 2022/

...Synopsis...
For today, a broad upper-level trough will exist across the upper
Midwest into the Mid-South. Farther west, a closed upper low will
slowly progress eastward within the lower Colorado River Valley
region. At the surface, high pressure will be situated across much
of the west into the Plains. Colder surface temperatures and light
winds will keep fire weather concerns minimal for most areas.
Offshore winds will continue across southern California into the
afternoon. Fuels are not receptive to fire spread due to recent
precipitation, however.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 PM EST Sat Jan 22 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Jan 25 2022 - 12Z Sat Jan 29 2022


1900 UTC Update...

The latest guidance for today continues to show relatively good
agreement on the large scale pattern during the medium range, but
continued significant uncertainties in the details, especially
concerning western Atlantic low pressure next weekend. The past
several runs of both the GFS and ECMWF have shown very
inconsistent surface low positions. The 00z/12z ECMWF both show a
more offshore surface low, but yesterdays 12z ECMWF was much
farther to the southwest hugging the Southeast U.S. coast.
Meanwhile, the GFS run had been fairly consistent showing a
slower/deeper solution near the Southeast coast, except for
today's 06z run which slingshot the low well into New England (12z
solution back near the Southeast). The CMC is also farther north
like the 06z GFS run. Needless to say, it appears an ensemble mean
solution seems to be the best way to mitigate these uncertainties
and conveniently, the means do show a very middle ground solution.

Otherwise, no major changes to the overnight forecast was needed
and so the previous discussion still stands. Todays WPC progs used
a deterministic model blend for the first half of the period (sans
the UKMET which was much quicker off the bat with the first
southern stream shortwave), and trended towards a 50/50 blend of
the ECMWF/GFS and the ensemble means (with a little more weighting
towards the ECMWF/ECENS).

See previous discussion below for more details in the pattern and
weather threats.

Previous Discussion issued at 0700 UTC...

...Overview...

Guidance continues to show a strong eastern Pacific ridge helping
to keep a broad mean trough across a majority of the lower 48
through Wednesday.  The Pacific ridge will likely drift into the
West by Thursday-Friday, followed by some weakening depending on
very uncertain details of upstream shortwave energy.  Meanwhile
within the lower 48 mean trough, one shortwave will rotate through
the eastern half of the country during the first half of the
period and then another shortwave dropping into the central U.S.
late in the week may reach near the East Coast by early Saturday.
There is a decent signal that this latter shortwave will support a
developing East Coast/western Atlantic storm by next weekend but
with low confidence in details.  The pattern through the period
will generally favor below to well below normal temperatures over
the eastern half of the country and mild temperatures from the
West into the northern/central Plains.  Precipitation coverage and
intensity across the lower 48 will tend to be low aside from an
area of moisture crossing the East on Tuesday and then possibly
over parts of the South and East by the end of the week/next
weekend depending on details of upper flow and surface development.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

At the start of the period, guidance still varies somewhat on the
fine-scale details of initial northern Gulf of Mexico low pressure
quickly tracking into the Atlantic as supporting dynamics shear
out within accelerating flow aloft.  A blend approach maintains
the prevailing theme of the evolution.  Then continuity and
agreement are decent with a Canadian system dropping into the
Great Lakes by late in the week and then weakening.

The rest of the late-period forecast becomes more uncertain as
models and ensembles diverge considerably for eastern
Pacific/western U.S. details.  With some possible influence from
these issues, the evolution over and near the East by late
Friday-Saturday also displays a fair degree of uncertainty.  In
contrast to previous trend, over the past day guidance has trended
stronger with the upper ridge reaching the West late in the week
and increasingly varied with how energy within the shortwave
approaching from the west may separate (as illustrated most simply
by the 12Z and new 00Z ECMWF runs).  By day 7 Saturday the end
result over the West is a chaotic ensemble spaghetti plot with
anything between a shortwave or lingering ridge a possibility.
The 12Z ECMWF mean's shortwave did not have much agreement among
other 12Z/18Z models and means but the new 00Z CMC has come in
with a similar feature and the new ECMWF has a fairly strong
shortwave.  There is a somewhat better suggestion that energy
rounding the ridge may support a wave/front dropping into the
northern tier on Saturday.  The most common theme farther east is
for low pressure to be organizing over the western Atlantic by
early Saturday.  The 18Z/00Z GFS runs are closest to the
relatively higher density of ensemble surface lows at that time
while recent CMC runs have been somewhat in the neighborhood.  The
12Z GFS/ECMWF were on the southwestern edge of the spread.  The
new 00Z ECMWF is closer to the majority cluster in principle.

Based on latest guidance comparisons, the updated forecast
reflected a blend of 12Z/18Z operational models early in the
period and then transitioned toward greater weight of the
GEFS/ECens/CMCens due to the uncertainty of upper details over the
West toward the end of the period and to yield the highest
probability track for western Atlantic low pressure by Saturday.
Manual depiction of this low will likely trend deeper as
confidence in strength and track improves.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The combination of a northern Gulf of Mexico wave quickly moving
into the Atlantic and a cold front crossing the East will spread
an area of precipitation across the East on Tuesday.  Most amounts
will be in the light to moderate range, with some proportion of
the precipitation possibly being in the form of snow from the Ohio
Valley/central Appalachians into the Northeast.  A period of lake
effect snow will be possible behind the front.  A trailing
wave/front may spread areas of light snow from the northern Plains
into the Great Lakes and Northeast from about midweek into the
weekend.  Supporting dynamics could be amplified enough to support
some precipitation farther south as well but with low confidence
over coverage and amounts.  By next Saturday the
coverage/intensity/type of precipitation along the East Coast are
likewise uncertain at this time and will require close monitoring.
 Parts of the High Plains may see light snow on Tuesday.  Much of
the West should be dry during the period.  Some moisture could
eventually reach the Pacific Northwest by next Saturday.

A surge of cold air will initially be over the Upper Mississippi
Valley and Midwest on Tuesday, with some areas seeing temperatures
20-25F below normal from Tuesday into early Wednesday.  This cold
will then spread toward/into the South and East with time,
bringing a day or so of readings that are 10-20F above normal.  By
Friday-Saturday the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast may moderate some
while parts of the Southeast may see highs at least 10F below
normal.  After less extreme cold passes through the
central/southern Plains early in the period, most of the Plains
will see a warming trend with some areas seeing temperatures at
least 10F above normal.  The West will see moderately above normal
temperatures next week with some localized plus 10-15F anomalies
for highs.

Extended Forecast Discussion

159 PM EST Sat Jan 22 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Jan 25 2022 - 12Z Sat Jan 29 2022


1900 UTC Update...

The latest guidance for today continues to show relatively good
agreement on the large scale pattern during the medium range, but
continued significant uncertainties in the details, especially
concerning western Atlantic low pressure next weekend. The past
several runs of both the GFS and ECMWF have shown very
inconsistent surface low positions. The 00z/12z ECMWF both show a
more offshore surface low, but yesterdays 12z ECMWF was much
farther to the southwest hugging the Southeast U.S. coast.
Meanwhile, the GFS run had been fairly consistent showing a
slower/deeper solution near the Southeast coast, except for
today's 06z run which slingshot the low well into New England (12z
solution back near the Southeast). The CMC is also farther north
like the 06z GFS run. Needless to say, it appears an ensemble mean
solution seems to be the best way to mitigate these uncertainties
and conveniently, the means do show a very middle ground solution.

Otherwise, no major changes to the overnight forecast was needed
and so the previous discussion still stands. Todays WPC progs used
a deterministic model blend for the first half of the period (sans
the UKMET which was much quicker off the bat with the first
southern stream shortwave), and trended towards a 50/50 blend of
the ECMWF/GFS and the ensemble means (with a little more weighting
towards the ECMWF/ECENS).

See previous discussion below for more details in the pattern and
weather threats.

Previous Discussion issued at 0700 UTC...

...Overview...

Guidance continues to show a strong eastern Pacific ridge helping
to keep a broad mean trough across a majority of the lower 48
through Wednesday.  The Pacific ridge will likely drift into the
West by Thursday-Friday, followed by some weakening depending on
very uncertain details of upstream shortwave energy.  Meanwhile
within the lower 48 mean trough, one shortwave will rotate through
the eastern half of the country during the first half of the
period and then another shortwave dropping into the central U.S.
late in the week may reach near the East Coast by early Saturday.
There is a decent signal that this latter shortwave will support a
developing East Coast/western Atlantic storm by next weekend but
with low confidence in details.  The pattern through the period
will generally favor below to well below normal temperatures over
the eastern half of the country and mild temperatures from the
West into the northern/central Plains.  Precipitation coverage and
intensity across the lower 48 will tend to be low aside from an
area of moisture crossing the East on Tuesday and then possibly
over parts of the South and East by the end of the week/next
weekend depending on details of upper flow and surface development.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

At the start of the period, guidance still varies somewhat on the
fine-scale details of initial northern Gulf of Mexico low pressure
quickly tracking into the Atlantic as supporting dynamics shear
out within accelerating flow aloft.  A blend approach maintains
the prevailing theme of the evolution.  Then continuity and
agreement are decent with a Canadian system dropping into the
Great Lakes by late in the week and then weakening.

The rest of the late-period forecast becomes more uncertain as
models and ensembles diverge considerably for eastern
Pacific/western U.S. details.  With some possible influence from
these issues, the evolution over and near the East by late
Friday-Saturday also displays a fair degree of uncertainty.  In
contrast to previous trend, over the past day guidance has trended
stronger with the upper ridge reaching the West late in the week
and increasingly varied with how energy within the shortwave
approaching from the west may separate (as illustrated most simply
by the 12Z and new 00Z ECMWF runs).  By day 7 Saturday the end
result over the West is a chaotic ensemble spaghetti plot with
anything between a shortwave or lingering ridge a possibility.
The 12Z ECMWF mean's shortwave did not have much agreement among
other 12Z/18Z models and means but the new 00Z CMC has come in
with a similar feature and the new ECMWF has a fairly strong
shortwave.  There is a somewhat better suggestion that energy
rounding the ridge may support a wave/front dropping into the
northern tier on Saturday.  The most common theme farther east is
for low pressure to be organizing over the western Atlantic by
early Saturday.  The 18Z/00Z GFS runs are closest to the
relatively higher density of ensemble surface lows at that time

...Periods of light to moderate snow from the Northern Plains to
the Great Lakes...

...Low pressure system to bring rain showers and thunderstorms to
the Gulf Coast beginning Monday...

...Arctic chill continues across much of the southern and eastern
U.S., but mild weather returns to the Northern/Central Plains and
Mississippi Valley; West Coast remains warmer than normal....

The pattern across the CONUS will be fairly straightforward; a
series of shortwaves will round a trough stationed over Ontario
while ridging continues in the west and a closed low weakens as it
swings from the Southwest through Texas. The first shortwave will
spawn an area of low pressure along a stationary front draped
across the Northern Plains today. This new system will track
across the Midwest through Sunday, dumping a swath of 3-6 inches
of snow from southeastern Minnesota to southwestern Pennsylvania
along the way. Isolated amounts exceeding 6 inches are possible,
particularly in and around southern Lake Michigan. As the first
clipper moves off into the Atlantic another shortwave will drop
into the Upper Midwest, but this one will take a slightly more
northerly track than its predecessor. Light snow showers will
blanket the Great Lakes with 2-4 inches as a result. Lake effect
enhancement from both systems could see areas downwind of the
lakes receive increased amounts by Monday evening.

A closed upper-level low will degrade into an open trough as it
swings into the Southern Plains over the next couple of days. This
upper feature will develop a surface low over southern Texas on
Monday and tap a bit of subtropical moisture by Monday. This newly
developed southern stream system will go on to produce modest
amounts of rainfall along the Gulf coast on Monday and Tuesday.
Fortunately, the heaviest rainfall will occur over the Gulf so
risk of flash flooding remains low as of right now.

Cold air from the late week arctic front that passed through the
eastern half of the country are forecast to remain across the Gulf
and East Coasts through Monday. Temperatures are likely to be
between 10-15 degrees below normal for the aforementioned areas
over the next couple of days. Temperatures will drop across the
Upper Midwest and Great Lakes on Sunday behind the clipper system.
The Northern/Central Plains will also warm up considerably
tomorrow with high temperatures peaking at around 15-20 degrees
above normal over parts of South Dakota. The warmth spreads into
the Mississippi Valley on Monday. The West remains seasonably warm
for the next several days due to the staunch Pacific ridge.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are necessary. Latest guidance continues to show
high confidence in strong winds gusting to 30-45 mph tomorrow
afternoon across central MT in the lee of the Rocky Mountain Front.
Cool temperatures will generally limit RH reductions and fuels in
most locations are not receptive per collaboration with local NWS
offices. However, given ongoing drought conditions and a lack of an
appreciable snow pack, the low-end, wind-driven fire weather concern
is worth mentioning.

..Moore.. 01/22/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1223 AM CST Sat Jan 22 2022/

...Synopsis...
For Sunday, the closed upper low over the Southwest will evolve into
an open wave before reaching the southern High Plains. A shortwave
trough will quickly move southeastward out of Canada and into the
northern Plains. At the surface, high pressure will remain in the
West with a surface low developing in the upper Midwest. Overall,
fire weather concerns will be minimal due to cool/cold conditions
and unreceptive fuels. Offshore winds will continue in southern
California, though fuels will continue to be unsupportive of fire
spread.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat January 22 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1139 PM CST Sat Jan 22 2022

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
For today, a closed upper low will continue eastward in the
Southwest, becoming more of an open wave with time. Elsewhere, a
broad upper trough will be situated across the eastern third of the
country. A fast-moving shortwave trough will dive southeastward out
of Canada and into the northern Plains. A surface cyclone will
follow a similar path out of the Canadian Prairie. A surface high
pressure system will remain in the Great Basin, but is expected to
weaken through the period.

Two areas of strong winds and lowered RH are possible. Offshore
winds will continue for part of the day in southern California. Some
of the more aggressively dry guidance shows near-critical RH
occurring in parts of central Montana along with fairly strong
winds. Even with the potential for elevated/near-critical
meteorological conditions, fuels have received enough recent
precipitation that fire weather concerns should remain low in both
areas.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 AM CST Sun Jan 23 2022

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad upper-level troughing will continue across eastern portions of
the CONUS on Monday. The shortwave trough in the southern High
Plains will continued shifting eastward and eventually phase with
the broader, large-scale trough in the East. In the Pacific
Northwest, another shortwave trough will move southeastward out of
western Canada, reaching the Great Basin by Tuesday morning. At the
surface, another strong cold front will move through the Plains and
upper-Midwest.

Temperatures ahead of the cold front in the southern High Plains
will likely reach the 50s F to near 60 F in some places. Dry
conditions (generally 20-25% RH) are possible just ahead of and
behind the front as cold air will lag behind a shift to northerly
winds. Fuels remain quite dry despite some improvement due to recent
cold conditions. Winds may struggle to reach 15 mph, however. Any
fire weather concerns that develop will be local and brief.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 AM EST Sun Jan 23 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 26 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 30 2022

...Overview...

Models and ensemble means generally agree upon the idea of broad
mean troughing aloft over much of the lower 48 as of Wednesday
transitioning more to the eastern half of the country as a mean
ridge over the eastern Pacific moves into the western U.S.  Best
consensus of guidance has a Pacific shortwave briefly suppressing
the western ridge around Saturday followed by a rebound of the
ridge, ahead of troughing over the far northeastern Pacific.  The
strongest system of the period will likely be low pressure
expected to develop over the western Atlantic around the end of
the week through the weekend, in response to a strong shortwave
trough approaching and crossing the East Coast.  Details remain
too uncertain to resolve exactly what the system's effects will be
over the East.  Farther west, a couple clipper systems with fairly
light precipitation will track over the northern tier while the
late week/weekend pattern should bring at least a modest increase
of moisture to the Northwest.  For temperatures the East will be
below normal most of the period while much of the West through
portions of the Plains will be above normal.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Within the fairly agreeable mean pattern, the most prominent
forecast uncertainties have been with the eastern Pacific/western
U.S. evolution as shortwave energy approaches the upper ridge that
reaches the West along with expected western Atlantic development
as an amplified trough reaches the East late in the week.  Model
and ensemble spread remains considerable for the Pacific/West
area, with recent GFS runs and 12Z CMC holding onto a stronger
ridge versus the past couple ECMWF runs.  However the 18Z and new
00Z GFS runs have adjusted much closer to the 12Z ECMWF and the
ensemble means.  The 00Z CMC has also trended toward this
improving cluster.  This leaves the 00Z UKMET that diverges from
most other guidance for various aspects of the eastern
Pacific/northwestern North American pattern.  Perhaps with the aid
of this better western agreement, the 00Z models have trended
somewhat closer for the late week/weekend Atlantic development.
In particular the 00Z GFS has gone away from the 12Z/18Z runs
whose slower/sharper/elongated upper trough had produced a farther
southwest storm than a great majority of GEFS/ECMWF/CMC ensemble
members.  The 00Z GFS/CMC and latest ensemble means are now
similar in showing low pressure somewhat east of the Mid-Atlantic
coast early Saturday and then tracking into or south of the
Canadian Maritimes by early Sunday.  The supporting shortwave
energy is currently over the North Pacific and is not scheduled to
round the East Pacific ridge until around Tuesday, plus guidance
is still varying with the western ridge/Pacific energy heading
into it, so it will likely take a while to gain much more
confidence in a particular scenario.

The forecast has been fairly consistent in concept for two
fronts/waves expected to drop into the northern tier during the
period, the first around Thursday and another during the weekend.
There are still some typical detail differences and run-to-run
adjustments that are best resolved by a blend approach.
Models/means show better than average agreement for the upper
troughing and surface system over the northeastern Pacific by the
end of the period.

An early period 12Z/18Z model blend trended toward 50-60 percent
total weight of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means by days 6-7
Saturday-Sunday to reflect the consistent and intermediate
solution for Atlantic development in the means (minimizing 12Z/18Z
GFS influence) and to account for ongoing uncertainty with details
over the West late week into the weekend.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A mid-late week wave/frontal system should spread an area of
mostly light snow across parts of the northern Plains and Great
Lakes/Northeast, followed by another system also accompanied by
mostly light snow next weekend.  The southern High Plains may see
a little light precipitation Wednesday.  Confidence is still not
great for exactly how late week/weekend Atlantic storm development
will affect areas near the East Coast.  The most likely evolution
would lead to some potential for snow and brisk to strong winds
over New England with lesser probability for significant effects
farther south.  Typical guidance errors at this time frame still
allow for significant changes to the current forecast.
Approaching Pacific shortwave energy and then flow ahead of a
developing northeastern Pacific upper trough may bring light to
locally moderate rain and mountain snow into the Pacific Northwest
during Friday-Sunday, with a little snow possibly extending into
the northern Rockies.

Within the chilly pattern over the eastern half of the country,
coldest anomalies should extend from the Midwest/Upper Mississippi
Valley through the Great Lakes Wednesday into early Thursday with
readings 15-25F below normal and locally colder in parts of the
Midwest early Wednesday.  Somewhat less extreme cold anomalies
will spread through the southern Plains/South and the East during
that time.  Reinforcing cold air should lead to decent coverage of
5-15F below normal temperatures over the East next weekend.
Mostly above normal readings will prevail from the West through
the northern half of the Plains.  Some scattered plus 10-15F
anomalies will be possible over and near the Great Basin and the
northern Plains should have one or more days 10-20F above normal.
Some of the positive anomalies should reach into the southern
Plains by the weekend.

An arctic air mass that has settled across the southern and
eastern U.S. will bring another day of colder than normal
temperatures before a moderating trend sets in on Monday.
Meanwhile, a series of shortwaves diving across western Canada
will round a broad trough stationed over eastern Canada.  This
pattern will result in a couple of fast-moving low pressure waves
to track across the northern tier states during the next couple of
days, bringing period of snow through the region followed by
intrusion of arctic air from Canada.  The first clipper will bring
a swath of 3-6 inches of snow today just south of Lake Erie with
light amounts farther east.  The second clipper will deliver a
quick round of main light snow across the northern Plains to the
upper Midwest and into the Great Lakes on Monday, before reaching
New England by Tuesday morning.  Lake effect enhancement should
result in somewhat higher amounts downwind of the lake waters from
both systems.

Meanwhile, a closed upper-level low is currently bringing areas of
light precipitation over Arizona into New Mexico.  This system is
forecast to track eastward toward southern Texas the next couple
of days and trigger the formation of a surface low system just off
the Texas coast Monday night.  This system will tap into Gulf
moisture and trigger a round of showers and some thunderstorms
along western to central Gulf coast late Monday into Tuesday
morning.  The heaviest rainfall is forecast to stay just off the
coast.

Elsewhere, the northern/central Plains will also warm up
considerably today as second clipper system tracks into the
northern Plains by tonight.  The arctic front in the wake of the
clipper will then plunge into the Plains with much colder
temperatures surging south Monday night together with a round of
snow spreading from northern to central Rockies.

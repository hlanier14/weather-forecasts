...Additional rounds of severe weather and flash flooding possible
across the central and southern Plains through the weekend...

...Below average temperatures found throughout much of the central
and eastern United States, while heat builds in the West...

Unsettled weather will be found across parts of the central and
southern Plains, as well as the East Coast this holiday weekend.
The most hazardous conditions are expected in the Great Plains as
additional rounds of thunderstorms stretch from eastern Colorado
to West Texas through Memorial Day. The threat of damaging wind
gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes exists today throughout
the central High Plains and shifts southward into southeast New
Mexico and southwestern Texas on Sunday. Scattered instances of
flash flooding are also possible with the thunderstorm activity as
high rainfall rates lead to multiple inches of rain falling in a
relatively short period of time. WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall for today across the central High Plains, with
a Slight Risk also issued for Sunday over parts of the Southern
Plains and far south-central Kansas. Meanwhile, damp and dreary
weather will be found across much of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast through early Monday as a frontal boundary stalls along
the East Coast. Showers and locally heavy rain will make it
difficult to stay dry if spending time outdoors, with a stiff
northeast wind making conditions feel even more uncomfortable.
These gusty winds may also lead to coastal flooding from  Long
Island to the Delmarva Peninsula. Coastal Flood Watches and
Advisories are in effect. A low pressure system is forecast to
eventually develop along the aforementioned frontal boundary and
swing into New England on Monday, subsequently leading to much of
the Mid-Atlantic enjoying a drier and pleasant Memorial Day.

May is forecast to end quite chilly throughout the central and
eastern United States, with high temperatures only reaching the
50s and 60s from the central Plains, Midwest, and Ohio Valley to
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. On the northern side of the cold
airmass, early morning temperatures will dip low enough for freeze
and frost concerns in the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes this
morning. The opposite is expected in the western U.S. as heat
begins to slowly build into the region. Excessive Heat Warnings
and Heat Advisories have already been issued across the Sacramento
Valley and northern San Joaquin Valley for Sunday and Monday.
Highs are forecast to reach the upper-90s and triple digits on
Sunday throughout much of the Desert Southwest and California's
Central Valley.

Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Tue Mar 02 2021 - 12Z Thu Mar 04 2021

...Showers and thunderstorms are likely across the Southeast
through tonight, with isolated flooding possible...

...Gusty winds and cold wind chills are expected in the Northeast
today, along with snow in the interior through Wednesday...

A surface low pressure system is expected to move eastward along
the Gulf Coast today and tonight, and as Gulf moisture streams
into the region, rain and thunderstorms are forecast across the
Gulf Coast states to the north of the low. Rain amounts of 1 to
locally 3 inches are expected over southern Alabama, Georgia, and
South Carolina as well as northern Florida through early
Wednesday. A Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall is in place for
these areas, indicating isolated flash floods are possible. Rain
should clear out by Wednesday afternoon as the low makes its way
into the Atlantic. The southeastern U.S. can also expect cooler
than normal temperatures with highs in the 40s and 50s today,
moderating closer to normal (but still 5 to 10 degrees below) on
Wednesday.

In the Northeast, strong winds are forecast today due to a tight
pressure gradient from a deep surface low in southeastern Canada.
Thus High Wind Warnings are scattered across the region, along
with widespread Wind Advisories from the northern Mid-Atlantic
into New England. The gusty winds combined with cold temperatures
have led to the issuance of Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories
this morning for portions of the Northeast. Additionally, rounds
of snow showers are possible for the Great Lakes region into the
interior Northeast over the next couple of days. Snow amounts
should be relatively light, except for in the Adirondacks where 6+
inches are possible in higher elevations. Meanwhile, dry and
relatively warm conditions are forecast in the north-central U.S.,
where high temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above normal
through the next several days.

Elsewhere, as an upper-level low and frontal system approach the
southwestern states on Wednesday, rain showers are possible for
Southern California into the Desert Southwest. As precipitation
spreads farther inland into the Four Corners states Wednesday
night, snow is expected for higher elevations in particular, with
a few inches possible in the peaks of the Mogollon Rim, Wasatch,
and San Juan Mountains through Thursday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Sun Sep 05 2021

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...Southwestern Montana...
Morning observations showed an area of relatively poor surface
humidity recoveries (30-40%) overnight across areas of southwestern
Montana and northern Idaho. As solar heating continues this morning,
surface humidity values are expected to fall rapidly to less than
15% across much of the region. As surface flow increases through out
the day, the combination of very dry air and dry fuels will likely
support elevated fire weather conditions despite marginal winds. The
elevated area was expanded southwestward to better align with the
corridor of expected fire weather risk this afternoon. Elsewhere,
the previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments to
match latest observations/hi-res guidance.

..Lyons.. 09/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0133 AM CDT Sun Sep 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will persist across the western U.S. as a mid-level
impulse, characterized by a 50+ kt 500 mb jet streak, crests the
upper ridge over the northern Rockies today. The strongest flow
aloft will overspread portions of central/northern Montana,
supporting widespread 15+ mph sustained westerly flow amid 15-20%
RH, warranting the maintenance of Elevated highlights. Otherwise,
locally dry and breezy conditions are likely across terrain-favoring
areas of the Interior West (as shown by the latest high-resolution
guidance consensus). At the moment, the higher terrain/lee of the
southern Cascades in Oregon, the Snake River Plain in southern
Idaho, and the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming are the most likely
regions to experience brief bouts of 15-20 mph sustained winds
overlapping 15-20% RH.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1244 PM EDT Sun Sep 5 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Sep 8 2021 - 12Z Sun Sep 12 2021

17Z Update:  The transition from an amplified to a more
quasi-zonal flow pattern over the northern tier states and
southern Canada is leading to an increase in model spread and thus
forecast uncertainty compared to recent days.  Overall agreement
is still decent on Wednesday before greater differences become
apparent by the end of the week.  There are timing and amplitude
differences with Pacific shortwave energy tracking eastward, with
the past couple runs of the GFS indicating a more amplified
solution over the Northern Plains and then the Great Lakes.  The
CMC is considerably weaker compared to the GFS and ECMWF across
this same general area, although it is more amplified with the
trough over the eastern U.S. by the weekend.  Taking these factors
into account, the WPC forecast was primarily derived from a
CMC/ECMWF/ensemble mean blend through Friday, and then
ECMWF/ECENS/GEFS for next weekend.  Some previous WPC continuity
was also maintained through the forecast period.  The previous
forecast discussion is appended below. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Strong upper ridging will weaken as it drifts out of the Four
Corners region midweek into the southern Plains as troughing
gradually moves into the Pacific Northwest. Troughing in the Great
Lakes will move into/through the Northeast later in the week,
helping to keep Hurricane Larry out over the open Atlantic. The
pattern is a rather dry one, with generally near to above normal
temperatures over much of the lower 48.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The guidance continues to struggle with the flow out of the
Pacific, with no clear consensus among the deterministic models.
With heights lowering Wednesday, the disparate solutions grew
farther apart thereafter, translating across the CONUS and
southern Canada into next weekend. Questions remain as to how much
troughing is left to slowly move east just off northern CA vs how
much northern troughing may shear eastward through southern
Canada, ultimately slipping into the backside of the eastern
troughing if quick enough. Ensemble means generally followed their
deterministic parent models but were a bit closer to each other
(GEFS and ECMWF EPS) so that a trend toward that blend was
preferred by the end of the period. To start, a deterministic
blend sufficed for the first two days of the period, with a messy
re-weighting in between. Confidence was lower than normal over the
northern tier due to the inconsistent model signal (yet fairly
consistent broader ensemble agreement). This is no surprise given
the trend toward quasi-zonal flow vs amplified flow.

Over the Southwest, the movement of the upper high southeastward
may allow for an increase in moisture into the lower CO River
basin later in the week. NHC is monitoring the potential for
development off the Mexican coast that may try to lift northward,
perhaps spreading moisture into the Southwest next weekend. Some
GFS runs have been more aggressive in bringing significant
rainfall to parts of AZ/SoCal, but continued to favor a drier
solution rather than wetter until confidence increases. The daily
17Z NHC-WPC tropical coordination call will refine the surface
progs and consequentially the QPF.

In the Gulf, tropical development remains uncertain but moisture
transport northward/northeastward continues to look more likely
into the northern/northeastern Gulf. Maintained a modest QPF
signal into the FL Panhandle and southeastern GA. Please see the
NHC outlooks for more information.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus along and ahead of a cold front from the
Northeast to the Southeast before it exits/dissipates. Amounts
will generally be light except over the northeastern Gulf where
tropical moisture may support modest to perhaps heavier amounts.
Daily showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to
the south of the boundary. Some moisture will work back through
the Southwest around the upper high as it drifts southeastward,
focused over inland CA into the Great Basin and parts of the
Desert Southwest. This may lift northward into the northern
Rockies by later in the week into the weekend, ahead of another
Pacific front.

Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially in the interior West to the Northern Rockies ahead of
the incoming Pacific trough Wed-Thu. Temperatures 5-15 degrees
above normal are possible as the area of warmth moves into the
southern/central Plains later in the week/weekend. Temperatures in
the Great Lakes/Northeast will be near to a bit below normal via
northwest flow behind the cold front this week, perhaps moderating
a bit next weekend as the surface high approaches.

Rainfall will focus along and ahead of a cold front from the
Northeast to the Southeast before it exits/dissipates. Amounts
will generally be light except over the northeastern Gulf where
tropical moisture may support modest to perhaps heavier amounts.
Daily showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to
the south of the boundary. Some moisture will work back through
the Southwest around the upper high as it drifts southeastward,
focused over inland CA into the Great Basin and parts of the
Desert Southwest. This may lift northward into the northern
Rockies by later in the week into the weekend, ahead of another
Pacific front.

Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially in the interior West to the Northern Rockies ahead of
the incoming Pacific trough Wed-Thu. Temperatures 5-15 degrees
above normal are possible as the area of warmth moves into the
southern/central Plains later in the week/weekend. Temperatures in
the Great Lakes/Northeast will be near to a bit below normal via
northwest flow behind the cold front this week, perhaps moderating
a bit next weekend as the surface high approaches.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun September 05 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 PM CDT Sun Sep 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Southern Wyoming and western South Dakota...
Recent model guidance has trended drier with the expected airmass
ahead of the cold front moving through the northern Rockies/High
Plains. Widespread surface RH below 20% is expected by early
afternoon. Stronger mid-level flow displaced to the north across
Montana may limit stronger surface winds to near 15 mph though
elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are still
likely. The elevated area was trimmed to the south and west where
weaker winds and limited fuels overlap suggesting a lower threat.

Farther east across western south Dakota weaker surface flow and
recent light precipitation/wetter fuels may also limit the temporal
coverage of elevated/locally critical conditions despite a very dry
airmass.

Elsewhere, minor adjustments have been made to the previous
forecast. Locally critical conditions may develop for a short time
across portions of northern Wyoming and southern Montana where the
best overlap of strong winds, low humidity and dry fuels exists.
However, confidence on the coverage of widespread critical
conditions is low. See the previous discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 09/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Sun Sep 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will remain in place across the western U.S.
tomorrow/Monday, with a mid-level trough amplifying while cresting
the ridge and ejecting into the northern Plains states. 60+ kts of
mid-level flow will overspread much of the northern Rockies, with
intensifying surface lee troughing likely over the northern High
Plains behind a southward-moving cold front. The net result will be
widespread 15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds overlapping
with 15-25% RH across much of the northern and central Rockies into
the northern High Plains, addressed by a fairly large Elevated
delineation given forecast fuel ERCs at or above 80%. At least
locally Critical conditions will be possible across much of the
Elevated area. However, the lack of a more favorable, longer-lasting
wind/RH overlap precludes Critical highlights this outlook.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
349 PM EDT Sun Sep 05 2021

Valid 00Z Mon Sep 06 2021 - 00Z Wed Sep 08 2021

...Expansive heat dome building across much of the West,
excessively hot temperatures in the Desert Southwest...

...Unsettled weather for the Deep South and parts of the East; new
wave of low pressure to spark showers and storms in the Upper
Great Lakes on Tuesday...

...Keeping a watchful eye on the Gulf of Mexico for tropical
activity this week...

The upper level pattern to start the first full week of September
features an intensifying ridge in the West with a pair of upper
troughs tracking across the northeastern quarter of the Lower 48.
The hottest temperatures will be centered over the western third
of the country with high temp departures ranging between 10-20
degrees above normal. Some locations in the Desert Southwest are
under Excessive Heat Warnings due to daytime highs forecast to
range anywhere from 105-115F with some spots even surpassing 115F.
Heat Advisories are also in effect for much of California's Great
Valley and a large chunk of Southern California. By Tuesday the
heat continues to build even more in the Great Basin and
Intermountain West where a handful of daily record high temps
could be tied and/or broken. The large area of high pressure aloft
will keep the West dry as well, meaning little relief is expected
to come for ongoing wildfires. In fact, there are Elevated Risks
for favorable fire weather conditions in the northern Rockies and
High Plains. Expect large swaths of wildfire smoke to blanket much
of the West and parts of the Plains with some Air Quality Alerts
posted from the West Coast to the Rockies.

The most active weather is set to occur in the Deep South where a
quasi-stationary frontal boundary triggers daily rounds of showers
and thunderstorms. Locally heavy downpours could lead to areas of
flash flooding with a few severe storms possible. In addition,
West Texas and both southern Arizona and New Mexico may witness
hit-or-miss showers and thunderstorms through Labor Day, with
chances of seeing precipitation decreasing on Tuesday as the ridge
out west strengthens. Farther north, a cold front producing spotty
showers and thunderstorms tracks through the Tennessee Valley, the
Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast tonight. High pressure building in
behind the front will make for a dry Labor Day for most of these
areas. The lone exception is northern New England as another cold
front passing through Ontario approaches Labor Day afternoon. Last
but not least, a deepening upper trough spawns a new storm system
over the Upper Midwest Monday night into Tuesday. This area of low
pressure will be responsible for showers and thunderstorms
bringing locally heavy rainfall and some severe weather to the
Upper Great Lakes on Tuesday.

The NHC is monitoring a tropical wave near the tip of the Yucatan
Peninsula that is forecast to track into the northern Gulf of
Mexico later this week. There is currently a 30% chance of
development and it could usher in heavy rainfall to parts of the
northern Gulf Coast. Interests from Louisiana to the west coast of
Florida should continue to check in on the latest forecast
regarding this tropical disturbance over the next few days.

...Overview...

An upper high initially over the Four Corners region will weaken
and slip eastward across the southern Plains. This will allow
quasi-zonal flow to take hold across much of the CONUS, suggesting
lower confidence in system timing/details. The patter remains
rather dry with generally near to above normal temperatures.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The guidance continues to struggle with the flow out of the
Pacific, with no clear consensus among the deterministic models
and poor run-to-run consistency. Questions remain as to how strong
northern troughing through southern Canada may be, which may
influence the shape/departure of the Northeast troughing Thu-Fri.
Ensemble means generally followed their deterministic parent
models but were a bit closer to each other (GEFS and ECMWF EPS) so
that a trend toward that blend was preferred by the end of the
period. To start, a deterministic blend sufficed for the first two
days of the period before incorporating a majority ensemble
weighting. Confidence was lower than normal over the northern tier
due to the inconsistent model signal (yet fairly consistent
broader ensemble agreement).

Possible tropical development in the East Pacific has trended
offshore and was reflected in the NHC-WPC coordination yesterday.
In the Gulf, tropical development remains uncertain but moisture
transport northward/northeastward continues to look likely into
the northern/northeastern Gulf. Maintained a modest QPF signal
into the FL Panhandle and southeastern GA but ultimately need to
wait and see if any organization will occur. Please see the NHC
outlooks for more information.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus along and ahead of a cold front along I-95
Thursday morning, with its tail-end lingering over the Southeast
for a few days before dissipating. Amounts will generally be light
except over the northeastern Gulf where tropical moisture may
support modest to perhaps locally heavier amounts. Daily
showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to the
south of the boundary. Some moisture will work back through the
Southwest around the upper high as it drifts southeastward,
focused over inland CA (Sierra) into the Great Basin and parts of
the Desert Southwest. This may lift northward into the northern
Rockies by later in the week into the weekend, ahead of another
Pacific front. Amounts have trended less which was reflected in
the updated QPF.

Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially over the Rockies ahead of the incoming Pacific
front/trough Thu-Fri. Temperatures 5-15 degrees above normal are
possible as the area of warmth moves into the southern/central
Plains later in the week into the weekend and toward the Midwest
next week. Temperatures in the Great Lakes/Northeast will be near
to a bit below normal via northwest flow behind the cold front
later this week, moderating a bit over the weekend as the surface
high settles over the region.

0145 AM CDT Mon Sep 06 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST WYOMING...

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge/anticyclone will persist across the western U.S.,
with a mid-level trough amplifying while cresting the upper ridge
and ejecting into the northern Plains today. Widespread 30-60 kt 500
mb flow will overspread a relatively dry boundary layer behind a
southward-advancing surface cold front. As such, widespread 15-25
mph sustained west-northwesterly surface winds coinciding with
10-20% RH are expected across the central/northern Rockies.
Widespread Elevated highlights have been maintained to address the
overall favorable surface meteorological conditions given forecast
fuel ERCs at/above the 80th percentile.

While locally Critical conditions are expected across the entire
Elevated area, a regional corridor of more focused Critical
conditions appears likely across portions of central into southeast
Wyoming by afternoon peak heating, as shown by several model
guidance members. Critical highlights were introduced where 20 mph
sustained westerly surface winds are expected to overlap 10-15% RH
for at least a few hours. With at least 25 mph sustained westerly
winds expected across portions of southern and eastern Montana, more
widespread Critical meteorological conditions may manifest. However,
cooling temperatures and recovering RH in the 20-30% range render
confidence too low to add Critical highlights into Montana at this
time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CDT Mon Sep 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level anticyclone will persist across the Interior West
tomorrow/Tuesday. As the mid-level trough responsible for fire
weather concerns today moves further out into the central U.S., a
second mid-level trough will impinge on the West Coast late
tomorrow, supporting dry and breezy conditions along and to the lee
of the Coast Ranges in central California. Otherwise, dry and breezy
conditions will remain more localized and confined to
terrain-favoring areas across the Intermountain West by afternoon
peak heating.

...Portions of central California...
By late afternoon into early evening, modest mid-level flow from the
aforementioned trough will overspread central California, where a
dry and well-mixed boundary layer will be in place. Downslope flow
along the lee of the central Coast Ranges into the Bay Area and
parts of the Sacramento/San Joaquin Valleys will promote 15+ mph
sustained west-northwesterly surface winds amid 10-15% RH for at
least a few hours tomorrow. Elevated highlights were introduced
given favorable winds/RH over critically dry fuels, enforced by an
exceptional drought over central California.

...Late-summer heat forecast to dominate much of the West...

...Fine weather across the mid-section of the country but showers
and thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast and across the northern
tier states ...

The Labor Day weekend will end with a relatively tranquil note as
no widespread areas of heavy rain or stormy conditions are
anticipated today.  Only isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
forecast across the Deep South and the Mid-Atlantic region as a
relatively dry cold front passes through.  Nevertheless, some
brief periods of heavy rain are possible with the strongest
storms.  Meanwhile, widely scattered showers are exiting New
England as the northern portion of the cold front moves east into
the Canadian Maritimes by tonight.  A reinforcing cold front will
also bring some widely scattered showers and thunderstorms from
the lower Great Lakes this morning followed by northern New
England by tonight.  By Tuesday, another upper trough dipping
across central Canada will trigger the development a new low
pressure system near the U.S.-Canadian border.  Some showers and
thunderstorms are expected to move across the upper Midwest into
the Great Lakes near/ahead of this system.  The thunderstorms
could become quite strong across the lower Great Lakes Tuesday
evening as the low pressure system intensifies.  By Wednesday
morning, these thunderstorms will be moving towards New England.

Mainly fine and dry weather is expected to continue across the
mid-section of the country for the next few days.  This dry
pattern will be reinforced and extended into the western U.S. as
an upper level ridge is forecast to expand and remain anchored
over the region.  High temperature departures will range between
10-20 degrees above normal under this expanding ridge.  Some
locations in the Desert Southwest are under Excessive Heat
Warnings due to daytime highs 105-115F with some spots even
surpassing 115F.  Heat Advisories are also in effect for much of
California's Great Valley and a large chunk of Southern
California.  By Tuesday, the heat will continue to build even more
in the Great Basin and Intermountain West where a handful of daily
record high temps could be tied and/or broken. The large area of
high pressure aloft will keep the West dry as well, meaning little
relief is expected to come for ongoing wildfires.  In fact, there
are Elevated Risks for favorable fire weather conditions in the
northern Rockies and High Plains.  Expect large swaths of wildfire
smoke to blanket much of the West and parts of the Plains with
some Air Quality Alerts posted from the West Coast to the Rockies.

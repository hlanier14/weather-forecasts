Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1104 AM CDT Fri Apr 29 2022

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST NEW
MEXICO...SOUTHEAST COLORADO...SOUTHWEST KANSAS...AND THE FAR WESTERN
OK PANHANDLE...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Southern High Plains...
The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed
based on recent observations and morning guidance. 12 UTC soundings
across the central Rockies into the High Plains show a deep, dry
boundary-layer atop a shallow moist layer. This low-level moisture
is mixing out rapidly based on recent surface observations with
several stations already reporting critical conditions from eastern
NM into the TX/OK Panhandles - likely aided by synoptic subsidence
that is overspreading the region (per latest low-level water vapor
imagery).

Such conditions will become more expansive from west to east through
the afternoon as this subsidence spreads into the Plains. Confidence
in extremely critical conditions remains highest across southeast CO
where favorable overlap of downslope winds and a mid-level jet will
support 50-60 mph wind gusts and single-digit RH. Periods of
extremely critical conditions are possible across the OK/TX
Panhandles and western OK this afternoon as winds gust between 30-40
mph. Winds will shift to the northwest across the High Plains during
the late afternoon/evening hours as a cold front moves southeast
from the I-70 corridor into the TX Panhandle and western OK. Gusty
winds behind the front may impact any ongoing fires.

...Mid-Atlantic...
The Elevated risk area is expanded into portions of NY, MA, CT, and
VT where the potential for several hours of elevated wind/RH
conditions this afternoon has increased. Late-morning surface
observations across this region already show 15-20 mph winds with
15-25% RH. Given dry upstream conditions, elevated wind/RH should
persist through the afternoon hours.

..Moore.. 04/29/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Fri Apr 29 2022/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will move across the central Rockies
today. The mid-level jet will move over portions of northern New
Mexico and southern Colorado during peak heating hours. At the
surface, a deep surface low will develop in western Kansas and drive
strong surface winds across the southern High Plains.

...Northeast New Mexico...southeast Colorado...southwest Kansas...
Strong downslope winds in excess of 30 mph are expected to occur in
the lee of the Sangre de Cristos. Widespread single-digit RH is
expected to develop by late-morning/early-afternoon. Widespread ERCs
above the 90th percentile will support extreme fire behavior under
these meteorological conditions. Towards the end of the afternoon, a
cold front will move through southeast Colorado and southwest
Kansas. Winds will shift from westerly to northwesterly. Despite
some RH recovery behind the front, confidence remains high that
several hours of Extremely Critical conditions will occur.

Elsewhere across the southern High Plains, Elevated to Critical
conditions are expected during the afternoon in the post-dryline
environment. RH will be similarly low across the broader region, but
winds will only reach 15-25 mph.

...Mid-Atlantic...
This evening's observed soundings from the Northeast into
southeastern Canada show a very dry low-level airmass. A strong
upper-low off of the northeast coast will couple with a high
pressure system in Canada to promote gusty offshore northwesterly
winds. Fine fuels are quite dry in this region. With RH falling
below 20% in some locations, 15-20 mph winds will bring Elevated
fire weather concerns.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 29 2022

SYNOPSIS: At the beginning of the period, there is higher uncertainty among
model ensemble means in regards to the mid-level pattern, with the 0Z GEFS
ensemble mean favoring amplified mid-level low pressure across the
northeastern
Lower 48, while the 0Z ECMWF and Canadian favors a weaker solution. Despite
this uncertainty, a slight risk for much below normal temperatures is
maintained for portions of the northeastern Contiguous U.S. (CONUS) at the
beginning of the period, although for a smaller region compared to yesterday.
Amplified mid-level high pressure supports a slight risk of much above normal
temperatures across parts of the South-Central CONUS during the middle of the
period. Meanwhile, a series of surface lows are predicted to form over the
Great Plains from the beginning to middle of week-2, enhancing the potential
for episodes of high winds across the Great Plains and heavy precipitation
across parts of the Central and Southern Plains, Lower and Middle Mississippi,
Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, Appalachians, and Southeast from May 7 to 11.
Even
with more seasonable temperatures favored over Alaska, above freezing daytime
temperatures are still anticipated during week-2, which may lead to localized
flooding during the ice river breakup and snowmelt season across the state.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Great Lakes,
Ohio Valley, Appalachians, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic, Sat-Mon, May 7-9.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across portions of the western
third of the CONUS, Mon-Wed, May 9-11.

Slight risk of episodes of heavy precipitation for portions of the Central and
Southern Plains, Lower and Middle Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys,
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast, Sat-Wed, May 7-11.

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures across parts of Texas and
southwestern New Mexico, Sun-Tue, May 8-10.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across parts of the Great Plains and
Rockies, Sat-Wed, May 7-11.

Possible flooding along the Red River of the North.

Possible flooding for the eastern and southern Alaska Interior Mainland.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MAY 02 - FRIDAY MAY 06:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!5B71kNRNgSKnIIrpOII00pNoEl6KvslvTfdPe7Wok6ybd_RuamX5tR3-ts0dfLYcxOiA_9dVjD1lqCBb-3ASFK823p8$

FOR SATURDAY MAY 07 - FRIDAY MAY 13: There is less agreement among the 0Z GEFS
and 0Z ECMWF ensemble forecasts of the mid-level height pattern over the CONUS
at the beginning of the period compared to yesterday's guidance. The GEFS has
greater negative 500-hPa departures over the northeastern CONUS compared to
the
ECMWF, which is reflected in both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. The
GEFS
reforecast tool maintains the anomalous cold signal over the region for a more
prolonged period, whereas the ECMWF has a very limited region of minimum
temperatures reaching hazardous thresholds over New England on day 8 (May 7).
Despite these differences, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is
posted across a smaller region compared to yesterday for parts of the Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley, Appalachians, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic, May 7 to 9. The
GEFS reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures
falling to the lowest 15th percentile and 40 Deg F across the highlighted risk
area, shifting eastward during the risk period. Amplified mid-level riding
across the central CONUS is anticipated to shift eastward to this region by
the
middle of the period, diminishing chances for much below normal temperature
risk in the highlighted area.



There continues to be good model agreement indicating mid-level troughing
shifting from the northeastern Pacific and Pacific Northwest eastward to the
western half of the CONUS by day 10 (May 9). Therefore, a slight risk of much
below normal temperatures continues to be posted for parts of the western
third
of the CONUS, May 9 to 11. The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance
of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and 40 Deg F
across the designated risk area. This risk diminishes toward the end of the
period as the trough aloft is favored to weaken.



A series of surface lows are anticipated to form across the Great Plains from
the beginning to middle of week-2. These lows, in addition to accompanying
frontal systems, could bring episodes of heavy precipitation to portions of
the
eastern half of the CONUS. Additionally, the recent deterministic GFS
solutions
are indicating the potential for surface low pressure to form near the
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast coast during this period. Therefore, a broad area
(the Central and Southern Plains, Lower and Middle Mississippi, Ohio, and
Tennessee Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast) and extended
period is designated with a slight risk of heavy precipitation, May 7 to 11.
The highlighted risk area is based on reforecast tools which indicate at least
a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding one inch, uncalibrated model
ensembles, and recent deterministic guidance.



In addition to heavy precipitation, the aforementioned surface lows could
support increased chances for high winds. The ECMWF reforecast tool no longer
includes the Northern Plains in the high wind signal (at least a 20% chance of
wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph) and the GEFS now shows a
high wind signal in the Four Corners region during the 8 to 12 day period.
Recent deterministic GFS and ECMWF model guidance, however, indicates the
potential for wind speeds exceeding 30 mph in parts of the Great Plains. Based
on recent deterministic model guidance and reforecast tools, a broadened area
and period is highlighted with a slight risk of episodes of high winds for the
Great Plains, May 7 to 11.



Across the southern tier of the CONUS, the reforecast tools maintain good run
to run continuity showing at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 degrees F, across Texas and southeastern
New Mexico associated with mid-level ridging across the South-Central CONUS.
Therefore, a slight risk of much above normal temperature is maintained for
these regions, May 8 to 10, when the anomalous warm signals are greatest.
Although these expected temperatures may not be as impactful to human health,
the unseasonably hot conditions combined with anticipated below-normal
precipitation favored during week-2 over the Central and Southern Plains is
likely to worsen drought conditions. Additionally, the potential for elevated
wind speeds could enhance wildfire risk throughout the region.



A flooding possible hazard is also posted for many areas surrounding the Red
River of the North where there is ongoing snow melt and flooding. With
above-average precipitation favored during week-1 and week-2, any additional
precipitation during the period may worsen already saturated ground conditions
over the region.



Over Alaska, models continue to generally indicate mid-level troughing over
the
Gulf of Alaska. Today's mean week-2 outlook favors below normal temperatures
across much of the state. Despite the increased potential for anomalous cold,
above-freezing daytime temperatures are still anticipated to result in
snowmelt. The possible flood risk area is maintained over the eastern and
southern Interior of Alaska, where many locations have registered near record
snowpack prompting concerns for flooding.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0120 PM CDT Fri Apr 29 2022

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

Elevated risk areas are introduced for portions of New Mexico and
the High Plains. Pressure-gradient winds are forecast to gradually
diminish through the day across the Plains, but latest guidance
hints that 15-20 mph winds should linger into the early/mid
afternoon hours across eastern CO into the OK/TX Panhandles. Mostly
clear skies in the wake of the upper-level trough should support
enough diurnal warming for a few hours of elevated wind/RH over a
region with receptive fuels. Across central to northeast NM, winds
are forecast to increase to 15 mph by late afternoon. While such
winds will likely be confined to terrain features, forecast RH
values in the low teens along with critically dry fuels across the
region will support at least a low-end fire weather concern.

..Moore.. 04/29/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0129 AM CDT Fri Apr 29 2022/

...Synopsis...
On Saturday, the upper-level trough will move northeast out of the
Plains and into the upper Midwest along with the surface cyclone.
Across the West and High Plains, upper-level ridging will develop.
This pattern will not favor strong surface winds across the
Southwest and adjacent High Plains, where dry fuels will remain.
Some areas may see briefly Elevated conditions behind the cold
front. This appears most likely to occur in parts of northwest Texas
into the South Plains. As meteorological conditions will be marginal
an brief, no highlights will be added.

300 PM EDT Fri Apr 29 2022

Valid 12Z Mon May 02 2022 - 12Z Fri May 06 2022

...Overview...

Continuing from the short range time frame, a series of Pacific
systems (each supported by an upper trough that may contain a
closed low for a period of time) progressing across the lower 48
will produce active weather during the period. These systems will
spread rain and high elevation snow across the Pacific Northwest
and north-central Rockies/High Plains, and then mostly rain over a
large part of the central/eastern U.S. There will be two primary
systems of interest, one tracking from the south-central High
Plains through the Great Lakes early in the week and the second
entering the West by Monday and reaching near the Midwest by
Friday. Some thunderstorms could be strong with SPC indicating a
threat of severe weather over the southern Plains and vicinity
Monday into Tuesday with the first system and then again a couple
days later ahead of the next one. Heavy rain will also be a threat
with each system. WPC has issued an experimental medium range
Slight Risk for excessive rainfall early in the week over/near the
eastern southern Plains. Late in the period the guidance suggests
an evolution toward larger scale features with mean troughing
aloft reaching the eastern Pacific/West Coast while ridging builds
over central Canada and a trough reaches eastern Canada/Northeast
U.S. The pattern during the period will likely leave the southern
half or third of the West, the northern Plains near the Canadian
border, and the Gulf Coast as the relatively drier areas during
next week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The most contentious aspect of the forecast in recent days has
generally been the system reaching the West on Monday and then
continuing through the western-central U.S. for the rest of the
week. After a slower adjustment in the ECMWF a couple days ago,
there was a consistent guidance spread between faster GFS runs and
slower ECMWF while the CMC/UKMET tended to be in the middle to
slower part of the envelope. Over the past day the GFS and GEFS
mean have made a fairly dramatic slower adjustment, leading to
improved clustering within what had been the slower part of the
spectrum. New 12Z models maintain continuity with this developing
majority scenario through early day 6 Thursday so confidence is
improving at least through that time. Some divergence still arises
thereafter, with varying ideas for upstream flow entering the West
and flow in the southwest part of the eastern Canada mean
trough--with potential effects on the system reaching the central
U.S. For both of those areas the 06Z/12Z GFS offer somewhat less
confident solutions, bringing more amplified troughing into the
West and showing more southwestward trough elongation into the
Great Lakes versus prevailing consensus. Note that model/ensemble
spread for the trough near the West Coast increases significantly
after early Thursday, and the ECMWF/ECMWF mean have trended toward
a less amplified trough over the past day. For the early week
system tracking from the south-central High Plains through the
Great Lakes, there are still some detail/strength differences with
trends generally favoring an intermediate solution. Some
differences are related to still-unresolved details of interaction
with northern stream flow. CMC runs have been persistent with
slower timing than other guidance to the east of the Plains.

A 06Z/00Z operational model blend early followed by a
model/ensemble mean mix represented the improving slower consensus
for the western through central U.S. system while yielding the
desired intermediate (and closer to continuity) forecast of the
leading system early in the week. Upper troughing/leading surface
front pushing into the West late in the week are fairly stable
relative to previous forecast.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Over the West, another system will spread moisture from the
Pacific Northwest through the Rockies into early and middle part
of next week. Depending on exact system details, this could
produce some enhanced totals, including accumulating snows into
the north-central Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Subsequently,
an amplified upper trough and surface frontal system forecast to
reach the West Coast next Thursday-Friday should bring a renewed
precipitation focus into the Pacific Northwest and then farther
inland. The southern extent of precipitation will depend on the
upper trough's precise amplitude which becomes increasingly
uncertain by next Friday.

Over the central/eastern U.S., the Northeast may see lingering
light precipitation on Monday with a weakening front. The trailing
cold front will likely stall over the southern Plains while the
next system emerges from the West, with this system currently
expected to track through the Plains/Midwest early next week.
There is decent potential for areas of moderate to heavy rainfall
from portions of the central/southern Plains northeastward,
including a Slight Risk area of excessive rainfall during Monday
into early Tuesday over the south-central U.S. Some severe weather
is also possible, with the Storm Prediction Center currently
indicating the best potential for severe thunderstorms across the
southern Plains in that same time frame. A localized area of snow
may be possible over the north-central High Plains. The guidance
signal is also growing that the next system in the series tracking
out of the West may produce yet another area of significant
rainfall over and east from the central U.S. mid-late next week.
Confidence is slowly improving for this system's details at least
through Thursday, with progression in the slower portion of prior
spread adding somewhat to the heavy rainfall potential over some
locations. Prior rainfall could make some areas sensitive to
additional rainfall from this latter system. Fortunately the
guidance continues to produce most if not all precipitation to the
south of the far northern Plains where soil conditions are the
wettest.

The northern half of the Plains and Midwest will be on the chilly
side next week. The most extreme anomalies should be over the
north-central Plains on Monday (north of the first central U.S.
system) with highs 15-25F below normal. Expect a trend closer to
normal toward the end of the week. The West will see temperatures
vary from west to east with system progression, with some highs
5-15F below normal crossing the region during the first half of
the week to be followed by above normal highs of similar magnitude
Wednesday-Thursday. The West Coast will trend back to
near/slightly below normal late in the week. Most of the East will
tend to see above normal temperatures next week with
Tuesday-Wednesday likely producing the greatest coverage of plus
10F or greater anomalies.

The northern half of the Plains and Midwest will be on the chilly
side next week. The most extreme anomalies should be over the
north-central Plains on Monday (north of the first central U.S.
system) with highs 15-25F below normal. Expect a trend closer to
normal toward the end of the week. The West will see temperatures
vary from west to east with system progression, with some highs
5-15F below normal crossing the region during the first half of
the week to be followed by above normal highs of similar magnitude
Wednesday-Thursday. The West Coast will trend back to
near/slightly below normal late in the week. Most of the East will
tend to see above normal temperatures next week with
Tuesday-Wednesday likely producing the greatest coverage of plus
10F or greater anomalies.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri April 29 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 05 - 09 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. An amplified longwave trough and associated below normal
500-hPa heights are predicted over Alaska extending southward to the
northeastern Pacific and the western coast of the CONUS. A ridge associated
with above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast at the higher latitudes of
central North America. A trough is forecast to be situated over the eastern
CONUS.

Troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased odds of below
normal temperatures over the Northwest, Great Lakes, and Corn Belt.
Probabilities for below normal temperatures are elevated for the West Coast as
a shortwave trough is expected to cross this area. Conversely, near to above
normal temperatures are more likely for the remainder of the CONUS, consistent
with the consolidation temperatures forecast tool. The highest forecast
confidence in the 6-10 day temperature outlook exists across the Southeast and
along the Gulf Coast due to anomalous warmth in response to the strengthening
ridge aloft. Below normal 500-hPa heights along with periods of precipitation
also favors near to below normal temperatures Alaska.

Enhanced onshore flow increases probabilities for above normal precipitation
across the Pacific Northwest, northern California, and parts of the Central
and
Northern Rockies. A predicted trough over the eastern CONUS favors above
normal
precipitation for parts of the Southern Plains and most of the southeastern
CONUS. Below normal precipitation is favored over parts of the Four Corners
region, Southern and Northern Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, and
Upper Great Lakes, supported by most of the dynamical tools. Anomalous
troughing and enhanced onshore flow elevate probabilities for above normal
precipitation throughout the eastern half of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, while below normal precipitation is favored over southwestern
Mainland Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and in
the
forecast temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 07 - 13 2022

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement on the
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
The GFS and ECMWF ensemble means remain in good agreement, depicting a 500-hPa
trough and below normal 500-hPa heights extending from Alaska southward to the
western CONUS.  A ridge with above normal 500-hPa height is forecast at the
higher latitudes of central North America, while a trough is predicted along
the East Coast.

Below normal temperatures are favored for the Middle to Upper Mississippi
Valley, Corn Belt, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, associated with predicted
troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights over the eastern CONUS. Enhanced
onshore flow coupled with below normal 500-hPa heights increase probabilities
for below normal temperatures across the western CONUS. Above normal 500-hPa
heights increase the likelihood of near to above normal temperatures for the
remainder of the CONUS, consistent with the operational autoblend temperature
tool. Below normal 500-hPa heights along with periods of precipitation also
favors below normal temperatures for Alaska in week-2.

As a trough enters the western CONUS later in week-2, above normal
precipitation is favored from the Pacific Northwest eastward to the northern
Rockies and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley. Below normal precipitation is
more likely over the northeastern CONUS, due to a southward shift of a cold
front. Near to below normal precipitation is favored across parts of Arizonal
and New Mexico, supported by most of the dynamical forecast tools. Given the
likely continuation of a trough and onshore flow, above normal precipitation
remains slightly favored for eastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle,
while below normal precipitation is likely over parts of southwestern Mainland
Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the precipitation tools offset by differences in the
temperature tools for parts of the CONUS.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

...A Moderate Risk for severe thunderstorms exists across the
central Plains this evening into tonight while Extremely Critical
fire weather will impact the southern to central High Plains...

...Heavy rain and the potential for flash flooding will exist
across the north-central U.S. into Saturday while locally heavy
rain is expected for portions of Florida...

...Temperatures will generally be warmer than average across
southern portions of the nation while cooler than average
temperatures will be in place across many northern locations...

A storm system moving into the central U.S. as of Friday afternoon
will likely support the development of severe thunderstorms across
portions of the central to southern Plains late this afternoon
into tonight. A combination of favorable wind shear and the
northward transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will lead
to the development of strong and severe thunderstorms beginning
late Friday afternoon over the Great Plains. There will be the
potential for significant tornadoes, destructive wind gusts and
very large hail with a focus over southeastern Nebraska into
eastern Kansas as highlighted by the Moderate Risk in place by the
Storm Prediction Center. Farther north, several rounds of moderate
to heavy rain will lead to an increased threat for flash flooding
from northern Nebraska into south-central North Dakota through
Saturday morning. Farther south, high winds and extremely dry
relative humidities will drive an Extremely Critical Risk for the
spreading of wildfires across northeastern New Mexico into
southeastern Colorado and southwestern Kansas, behind a dryline
and with the passage of a cold front from the north which will
increase wind speeds late this evening.

On Saturday, a relatively strong surface low will move into the
upper Mississippi Valley as an associated occluded/cold front
sweeps eastward across the Midwest into the lower Ohio Valley.
Severe thunderstorms and localized flash flooding will be possible
with thunderstorms that develop ahead of the cold front, with
better chances for severe storms from the middle Mississippi
Valley toward southern portions of Lake Michigan. The cold front
will stall and eventually retreat across the southern Plains on
Sunday where the potential for strong to severe thunderstorms will
exist across portions of western Texas.

In addition to the strong storm system forecast to impact portions
of the central to eastern U.S. into this weekend, another upper
level disturbance will track into the northwestern U.S. by early
Saturday morning bringing a mixture of rain and mountain snow to
the drought stricken Interior Northwest. Across Florida, a
lingering and weakening frontal boundary will help trigger
diurnally driven thunderstorms with potential for very heavy
rainfall, mainly across central and southern portions of the
Florida Peninsula.

Regarding temperatures, positive daily maximum temperature
anomalies of 10 to 20 degrees above late April/early May averages
will exist from the southwestern U.S. into the southeastern U.S.
over the weekend. Conversely, high temperatures will generally be
10-20 degrees below average from the Pacific Northwest into the
northern Plains and portions of New England, with warmer weather
expected for New England on Sunday.

402 PM EDT Fri Apr 29 2022

Valid 12Z Mon May 02 2022 - 12Z Fri May 06 2022

...Overview...

Continuing from the short range time frame, a series of Pacific
systems (each supported by an upper trough that may contain a
closed low for a period of time) progressing across the lower 48
will produce active weather during the period. These systems will
spread rain and high elevation snow across the Pacific Northwest
and north-central Rockies/High Plains, and then mostly rain over a
large part of the central/eastern U.S. There will be two primary
systems of interest, one tracking from the south-central High
Plains through the Great Lakes early in the week and the second
entering the West by Monday and reaching near the Midwest by
Friday. Some thunderstorms could be strong with SPC indicating a
threat of severe weather over the southern Plains and vicinity
Monday into Tuesday with the first system and then again a couple
days later ahead of the next one. Heavy rain will also be a threat
with each system. WPC has issued an experimental medium range
Slight Risk for excessive rainfall early in the week over/near the
eastern southern Plains. Late in the period the guidance suggests
an evolution toward larger scale features with mean troughing
aloft reaching the eastern Pacific/West Coast while ridging builds
over central Canada and a trough reaches eastern Canada/Northeast
U.S. The pattern during the period will likely leave the southern
half or third of the West, the northern Plains near the Canadian
border, and the Gulf Coast as the relatively drier areas during
next week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The most contentious aspect of the forecast in recent days has
generally been the system reaching the West on Monday and then
continuing through the western-central U.S. for the rest of the
week. After a slower adjustment in the ECMWF a couple days ago,
there was a consistent guidance spread between faster GFS runs and
slower ECMWF while the CMC/UKMET tended to be in the middle to
slower part of the envelope. Over the past day the GFS and GEFS
mean have made a fairly dramatic slower adjustment, leading to
improved clustering within what had been the slower part of the
spectrum. New 12Z models maintain continuity with this developing
majority scenario through early day 6 Thursday so confidence is
improving at least through that time. Some divergence still arises
thereafter, with varying ideas for upstream flow entering the West
and flow in the southwest part of the eastern Canada mean
trough--with potential effects on the system reaching the central
U.S. For both of those areas the 06Z/12Z GFS offer somewhat less
confident solutions, bringing more amplified troughing into the
West and showing more southwestward trough elongation into the
Great Lakes versus prevailing consensus. Note that model/ensemble
spread for the trough near the West Coast increases significantly
after early Thursday, and the ECMWF/ECMWF mean have trended toward
a less amplified trough over the past day. For the early week
system tracking from the south-central High Plains through the
Great Lakes, there are still some detail/strength differences with
trends generally favoring an intermediate solution. Some
differences are related to still-unresolved details of interaction
with northern stream flow. CMC runs have been persistent with
slower timing than other guidance to the east of the Plains.

A 06Z/00Z operational model blend early followed by a
model/ensemble mean mix represented the improving slower consensus
for the western through central U.S. system while yielding the
desired intermediate (and closer to continuity) forecast of the
leading system early in the week. Upper troughing/leading surface
front pushing into the West late in the week are fairly stable
relative to previous forecast.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Over the West, another system will spread moisture from the
Pacific Northwest through the Rockies into early and middle part
of next week. Depending on exact system details, this could
produce some enhanced totals, including accumulating snows into
the north-central Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Subsequently,
an amplified upper trough and surface frontal system forecast to
reach the West Coast next Thursday-Friday should bring a renewed
precipitation focus into the Pacific Northwest and then farther
inland. The southern extent of precipitation will depend on the
upper trough's precise amplitude which becomes increasingly
uncertain by next Friday.

Over the central/eastern U.S., the Northeast may see lingering
light precipitation on Monday with a weakening front. The trailing
cold front will likely stall over the southern Plains while the
next system emerges from the West, with this system currently
expected to track through the Plains/Midwest early next week.
There is decent potential for areas of moderate to heavy rainfall
from portions of the central/southern Plains northeastward,
including a Slight Risk area of excessive rainfall during Monday
into early Tuesday over the south-central U.S. Some severe weather
is also possible, with the Storm Prediction Center currently
indicating the best potential for severe thunderstorms across the
southern Plains in that same time frame. A localized area of snow
may be possible over the north-central High Plains. The guidance
signal is also growing that the next system in the series tracking
out of the West may produce yet another area of significant
rainfall over and east from the central U.S. mid-late next week.
Confidence is slowly improving for this system's details at least
through Thursday, with progression in the slower portion of prior
spread adding somewhat to the heavy rainfall potential over some
locations. Prior rainfall could make some areas sensitive to
additional rainfall from this latter system. Fortunately the
guidance continues to produce most if not all precipitation to the
south of the far northern Plains where soil conditions are the
wettest.

The northern half of the Plains and Midwest will be on the chilly
side next week. The most extreme anomalies should be over the
north-central Plains on Monday (north of the first central U.S.
system) with highs 15-25F below normal. Expect a trend closer to

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
402 PM EDT Fri Apr 29 2022

Valid 12Z Mon May 02 2022 - 12Z Fri May 06 2022

...Overview...

Continuing from the short range time frame, a series of Pacific
systems (each supported by an upper trough that may contain a
closed low for a period of time) progressing across the lower 48
will produce active weather during the period. These systems will
spread rain and high elevation snow across the Pacific Northwest
and north-central Rockies/High Plains, and then mostly rain over a
large part of the central/eastern U.S. There will be two primary
systems of interest, one tracking from the south-central High
Plains through the Great Lakes early in the week and the second
entering the West by Monday and reaching near the Midwest by
Friday. Some thunderstorms could be strong with SPC indicating a
threat of severe weather over the southern Plains and vicinity
Monday into Tuesday with the first system and then again a couple
days later ahead of the next one. Heavy rain will also be a threat
with each system. WPC has issued an experimental medium range
Slight Risk for excessive rainfall early in the week over/near the
eastern southern Plains. Late in the period the guidance suggests
an evolution toward larger scale features with mean troughing
aloft reaching the eastern Pacific/West Coast while ridging builds
over central Canada and a trough reaches eastern Canada/Northeast
U.S. The pattern during the period will likely leave the southern
half or third of the West, the northern Plains near the Canadian
border, and the Gulf Coast as the relatively drier areas during
next week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The most contentious aspect of the forecast in recent days has
generally been the system reaching the West on Monday and then
continuing through the western-central U.S. for the rest of the
week. After a slower adjustment in the ECMWF a couple days ago,
there was a consistent guidance spread between faster GFS runs and
slower ECMWF while the CMC/UKMET tended to be in the middle to
slower part of the envelope. Over the past day the GFS and GEFS
mean have made a fairly dramatic slower adjustment, leading to
improved clustering within what had been the slower part of the
spectrum. New 12Z models maintain continuity with this developing
majority scenario through early day 6 Thursday so confidence is
improving at least through that time. Some divergence still arises
thereafter, with varying ideas for upstream flow entering the West
and flow in the southwest part of the eastern Canada mean
trough--with potential effects on the system reaching the central
U.S. For both of those areas the 06Z/12Z GFS offer somewhat less
confident solutions, bringing more amplified troughing into the
West and showing more southwestward trough elongation into the
Great Lakes versus prevailing consensus. Note that model/ensemble
spread for the trough near the West Coast increases significantly
after early Thursday, and the ECMWF/ECMWF mean have trended toward
a less amplified trough over the past day. For the early week
system tracking from the south-central High Plains through the
Great Lakes, there are still some detail/strength differences with
trends generally favoring an intermediate solution. Some
differences are related to still-unresolved details of interaction
with northern stream flow. CMC runs have been persistent with
slower timing than other guidance to the east of the Plains.

A 06Z/00Z operational model blend early followed by a
model/ensemble mean mix represented the improving slower consensus
for the western through central U.S. system while yielding the
desired intermediate (and closer to continuity) forecast of the
leading system early in the week. Upper troughing/leading surface
front pushing into the West late in the week are fairly stable
relative to previous forecast.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Over the West, another system will spread moisture from the
Pacific Northwest through the Rockies into early and middle part
of next week. Depending on exact system details, this could
produce some enhanced totals, including accumulating snows into
the north-central Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Subsequently,
an amplified upper trough and surface frontal system forecast to
reach the West Coast next Thursday-Friday should bring a renewed
precipitation focus into the Pacific Northwest and then farther
inland. The southern extent of precipitation will depend on the
upper trough's precise amplitude which becomes increasingly
uncertain by next Friday.

Over the central/eastern U.S., the Northeast may see lingering
light precipitation on Monday with a weakening front. The trailing
cold front will likely stall over the southern Plains while the
next system emerges from the West, with this system currently
expected to track through the Plains/Midwest early next week.
There is decent potential for areas of moderate to heavy rainfall
from portions of the central/southern Plains northeastward,
including a Slight Risk area of excessive rainfall during Monday
into early Tuesday over the south-central U.S. Some severe weather
is also possible, with the Storm Prediction Center currently
indicating the best potential for severe thunderstorms across the
southern Plains in that same time frame. A localized area of snow
may be possible over the north-central High Plains. The guidance
signal is also growing that the next system in the series tracking
out of the West may produce yet another area of significant
rainfall over and east from the central U.S. mid-late next week.
Confidence is slowly improving for this system's details at least
through Thursday, with progression in the slower portion of prior
spread adding somewhat to the heavy rainfall potential over some
locations. Prior rainfall could make some areas sensitive to
additional rainfall from this latter system. Fortunately the
guidance continues to produce most if not all precipitation to the
south of the far northern Plains where soil conditions are the
wettest.

The northern half of the Plains and Midwest will be on the chilly
side next week. The most extreme anomalies should be over the
north-central Plains on Monday (north of the first central U.S.
system) with highs 15-25F below normal. Expect a trend closer to
normal toward the end of the week. The West will see temperatures
vary from west to east with system progression, with some highs
5-15F below normal crossing the region during the first half of
the week to be followed by above normal highs of similar magnitude
Wednesday-Thursday. The West Coast will trend back to
near/slightly below normal late in the week. Most of the East will
tend to see above normal temperatures next week with
Tuesday-Wednesday likely producing the greatest coverage of plus
10F or greater anomalies.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 AM CDT Sat Apr 30 2022

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
Shortwave ridging aloft will build into central and southern Rockies
today. To the west, the next shortwave trough will move into the
northern Great Basin by early Sunday morning. At the surface, the
overall pressure pattern will be relatively weak in the High Plains
region. With the trough approaching, a surface low will likely
develop in the southern Great Basin.

...Southern High Plains...
Marginally elevated conditions may develop within the broader
region. At present, the most likely areas for this to occur are
southeast Colorado into parts of the Panhandles and parts of
central/eastern New Mexico. Dry flow around the surface ridge will
support RH into the 5-20% range. Winds will mostly remain light, but
15-20 mph for a couple of hours is possible in the highlighted
regions.

...Southern Nevada...
As fuels are now starting to become critically dry, locally elevated
conditions are possible as winds increase toward the late afternoon.
While 5-20% RH is possible, winds of 15-20 mph are not expected to
be more than brief given the weak surface pattern and mid-level
winds displaced to the west.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1256 AM CDT Sat Apr 30 2022

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST...

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move through the southern Great Basin and
into the Southwest and Sunday. A surface low will deepen within the
Colorado Plateau and eventually in the lee of the southern Rockies.
Strong winds and dry surface conditions are expected between a
Pacific cold front in the Great Basin and a dryline in eastern New
Mexico.

...Southern Great Basin and Southwest...
With the mid-level jet moving across northern Arizona and northern
New Mexico, surface winds of 25-35 mph are possible within these
areas. Outside of this more favorable region, surface winds of 15-25
mph are expected. Minimum RH values of 5-15% will be common. Broadly
Critical fire weather is likely across much of New Mexico into
northern Arizona. Locally extremely critical conditions are possible
in north of the Mogollon Rim into northwest New Mexico. However,
these conditions will either be brief or occur where fuel loading is
typically quite low.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Sat Apr 30 2022

Valid 12Z Tue May 03 2022 - 12Z Sat May 07 2022

...Overview...

A series of Pacific systems (each supported by an upper trough
that may contain a closed low for a period of time) progressing
across the lower 48 will produce active weather during the period.
These systems will spread rain and high elevation snow across the
Pacific Northwest and north-central Rockies/High Plains, and then
mostly rain over a large part of the central/eastern U.S. There
will be two primary systems of interest, one tracking from the
south-central High Plains through the Great Lakes early in the
week and the second entering the West by Monday and reaching near
the Midwest by Friday. Some thunderstorms could be strong with SPC
indicating a threat of severe weather over the southern Plains and
vicinity into Tuesday with the first system and then again a
couple days later ahead of the next one. Heavy rain will also be a
threat with each system. WPC has now issued an experimental medium
range "Slight Risk" for excessive rainfall next midweek  over/near
the eastern southern Plains, with runoff issues affected by
additional short range rainfall. The midweek threat signal is
stronger than normal as a closed upper system/lead upper
diffluence combine with increasing inflow into a wavy front. Late
in the period the guidance suggests an evolution toward larger
scale features with mean troughing aloft reaching the eastern
Pacific/West Coast while ridging builds over central Canada and a
trough reaches eastern Canada/Northeast U.S. The pattern during
the period will likely leave the southern half or third of the
West, the northern Plains near the Canadian border, and the Gulf
Coast as the relatively drier areas during next week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Latest 18/00 UTC GFS and 12/00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET mass field and QPF
solutions seem best clustered days 3-5 (Tue-Thu) and have good
ensemble and continuity support in a period with seemingly above
normal predictability. WPC product continuity is well maintained,
bolstering forecast confidence.

Forecast spread increases dramatically into days 6/7 as guidance
struggles both with Pacific system track issues inland into the
West and with closed system progression out from the Plains.
Recent GFS runs curiously show much more robust height
falls/system digging across the West Coast to the Southwest while
in contrast the Canadian and especially the ECMWF instead focus
into the Northwest. A favored GEFS mean and double weighted ECMWF
ensemble mean blend shows only moderate system digging into the
West along with downstream system progressions out from the
central U.S. on the slower side of the full envelope of guidance
solutions. This best takes into account the nature of patterns
with closed lows/troughs in a split southern stream.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Over the West, another system will spread moisture from the
Pacific Northwest through the Rockies into early and middle part
of next week. Depending on exact system details, this could
produce some enhanced totals, including accumulating snows into
the north-central Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Subsequently,
an amplified upper trough and surface frontal system forecast to
reach the West Coast next Thursday-Saturday should bring a renewed
precipitation focus into the Pacific Northwest and then farther
inland. However, the southern extent of precipitation will depend
on the upper trough's precise amplitude becomes increasingly and
wildly uncertain by next Friday.

Over the central/eastern U.S., the Northeast may see lingering
light precipitation on Monday with a weakening front. The trailing
cold front will likely stall over the southern Plains while the
next system emerges from the West, with this system currently
expected to track through the Plains/Midwest early next week.
There is decent potential for areas of moderate to heavy rainfall
from portions of the central/southern Plains northeastward,
including a Slight Risk area of excessive rainfall during Monday
into early Tuesday over the south-central U.S. Some severe weather
is also possible, with the Storm Prediction Center currently
indicating the best potential for severe thunderstorms across the
southern Plains in that same time frame. A localized area of snow
may be possible over the north-central High Plains. The guidance
signal is also growing that the next system in the series tracking
out of the West may produce yet another area of significant
rainfall over and east from the central U.S. mid-late next week.
Confidence is slowly improving for this system's details at least
through Thursday, with progression in the slower portion of prior
spread adding somewhat to the heavy rainfall potential over some
locations. Prior rainfall could make some areas sensitive to
additional rainfall from this latter system. Fortunately the
guidance continues to produce most if not all precipitation to the
south of the far northern Plains where soil conditions are the
wettest.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Sat Apr 30 2022

Valid 12Z Tue May 03 2022 - 12Z Sat May 07 2022

...Overview...

A series of Pacific systems (each supported by an upper trough
that may contain a closed low for a period of time) progressing
across the lower 48 will produce active weather during the period.
These systems will spread rain and high elevation snow across the
Pacific Northwest and north-central Rockies/High Plains, and then
mostly rain over a large part of the central/eastern U.S. There
will be two primary systems of interest, one tracking from the
south-central High Plains through the Great Lakes early in the
week and the second entering the West by Monday and reaching near
the Midwest by Friday. Some thunderstorms could be strong with SPC
indicating a threat of severe weather over the southern Plains and
vicinity into Tuesday with the first system and then again a
couple days later ahead of the next one. Heavy rain will also be a
threat with each system. WPC has now issued an experimental medium
range "Slight Risk" for excessive rainfall next midweek  over/near
the eastern southern Plains, with runoff issues affected by
additional short range rainfall. The midweek threat signal is
stronger than normal as a closed upper system/lead upper
diffluence combine with increasing inflow into a wavy front. Late
in the period the guidance suggests an evolution toward larger
scale features with mean troughing aloft reaching the eastern
Pacific/West Coast while ridging builds over central Canada and a
trough reaches eastern Canada/Northeast U.S. The pattern during
the period will likely leave the southern half or third of the
West, the northern Plains near the Canadian border, and the Gulf
Coast as the relatively drier areas during next week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Latest 18/00 UTC GFS and 12/00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET mass field and QPF
solutions seem best clustered days 3-5 (Tue-Thu) and have good
ensemble and continuity support in a period with seemingly above
normal predictability. WPC product continuity is well maintained,
bolstering forecast confidence.

Forecast spread increases dramatically into days 6/7 as guidance
struggles both with Pacific system track issues inland into the
West and with closed system progression out from the Plains.
Recent GFS runs curiously show much more robust height
falls/system digging across the West Coast to the Southwest while
in contrast the Canadian and especially the ECMWF instead focus
into the Northwest. A favored GEFS mean and double weighted ECMWF
ensemble mean blend shows only moderate system digging into the
West along with downstream system progressions out from the
central U.S. on the slower side of the full envelope of guidance
solutions. This best takes into account the nature of patterns
with closed lows/troughs in a split southern stream.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Over the West, another system will spread moisture from the
Pacific Northwest through the Rockies into early and middle part
of next week. Depending on exact system details, this could
produce some enhanced totals, including accumulating snows into
the north-central Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Subsequently,
an amplified upper trough and surface frontal system forecast to
reach the West Coast next Thursday-Saturday should bring a renewed
precipitation focus into the Pacific Northwest and then farther
inland. However, the southern extent of precipitation will depend
on the upper trough's precise amplitude becomes increasingly and
wildly uncertain by next Friday.

Over the central/eastern U.S., the Northeast may see lingering
light precipitation on Monday with a weakening front. The trailing
cold front will likely stall over the southern Plains while the
next system emerges from the West, with this system currently
expected to track through the Plains/Midwest early next week.
There is decent potential for areas of moderate to heavy rainfall
from portions of the central/southern Plains northeastward,
including a Slight Risk area of excessive rainfall during Monday
into early Tuesday over the south-central U.S. Some severe weather
is also possible, with the Storm Prediction Center currently
indicating the best potential for severe thunderstorms across the
southern Plains in that same time frame. A localized area of snow
may be possible over the north-central High Plains. The guidance
signal is also growing that the next system in the series tracking
out of the West may produce yet another area of significant

Saturday, a strong storm over the Central Missouri Valley will
slowly move northeastward to the northern coast of Lake Superior
by Monday. The system will pull moisture northward over the
Mississippi Valley. The associated front will destabilize the
atmosphere producing showers and thunderstorms over the Upper
Mississippi, Western Ohio Valleys, and Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley on Saturday. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over the Upper Mississippi, Western Ohio
Valleys, and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley through Sunday
morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.

In addition, heavy rain will develop north of the surface low over
the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley with a strong
moisture inflow. A second region of heavy rain will develop over
parts of the Ohio Valley to the Lower Mississippi Valley.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall over those two regions through Sunday morning. The
associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain through Sunday morning.

On Sunday, the threat of severe thunderstorms moves eastward to
the Eastern Ohio Valley/Central Appalachians. Therefore, the SPC
has issued a Marginal Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the area on Sunday into Monday morning. The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a minimal threat for tornadoes.
The associated front moves to the Mid-Atlantic by Monday,
producing light rain over parts of the Northeast and showers and
thunderstorms along the Mid-Atlantic Coast.

Meanwhile, a front will move onshore over the Pacific Northwest
Saturday, moving south and eastward to the Southern High Plains
into the Southern Rockies by Monday. The system will begin to
produce coastal rain and highest elevation snow over parts of the
Pacific Northwest/Northern California on Saturday, ending by
Sunday. By Sunday morning, the rain and highest elevation snow
will move to the Northern Rockies and Great Basin.

Moreover, as the system moves out of the Southwest, moisture will
move northward over the Southern High Plains, aiding in
destabilizing the atmosphere producing showers and thunderstorms
overnight Sunday into Monday morning over the area. Therefore, the
SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Texas Panhandle on Sunday into Monday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Additionally,
the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Southern Plains. The associated heavy rain will
create localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that
experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.

Furthermore, the SPC has issued an Elevated Risk of fire weather
over parts of the Central/Southern High Plains and Southern
Rockies on Saturday. On Sunday, the fire weather risk increases to
a Critical Risk over the Southwest and Southern Rockies. The Fire
weather threat is due to gusty winds, dry fuels, and low relative
humidity.

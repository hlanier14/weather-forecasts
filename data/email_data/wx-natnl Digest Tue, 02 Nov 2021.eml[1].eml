.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CDT Mon Nov 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Cool and or moist conditions will be in place across much of the
CONUS today. The only dry conditions will be in portions of the
Southwest and the southern Great Basin. However, despite a dry
airmass, fuels in this region are not critically dry. Also, winds
are forecast to remain light across this region. Therefore, no fire
weather concerns are expected.

Valid 12Z Thu Nov 4 2021 - 12Z Mon Nov 8 2021

17Z Update:  The latest models and ensembles are in above average
agreement on the synoptic scale through Thursday across the
continental U.S., before more timing differences become apparent
starting on Friday with eastern Pacific shortwave impulses.  The
12Z GFS becomes more progressive and stronger with the shortwave
approaching the Pacific Northwest by the end of the week, and also
faster with the one approaching over the weekend.  Additionally,
there has been more run-to-run variability with the past several
GFS runs regarding the magnitude of the eastern U.S. trough for
later in the forecast period, and there slightly more weighting
was applied to the ECMWF and its ensemble mean for the Saturday to
Monday portion of the forecast period.  The UKMET was slightly out
of phase off the West Coast by Friday and Saturday with a flatter
trough axis compared to the ECMWF/GFS, and a stronger upper ridge.
 Otherwise, the existing forecast is mainly on track with no major
changes necessary for this forecast update.  The previous
discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period will begin Thursday with a ridge axis
across the Southwest to northern High Plains separating troughing
over the eastern Pacific and in eastern North America. Model
guidance agrees on this much, before diverging by the end of the
week with a couple of key features. First, shortwave energy moving
through the trough in the East creates differences in the trough's
evolution Friday into the weekend, namely the depth that the
trough digs, whether or not a separate/possibly closed low
develops in the southern stream with this energy, and the speed
the trough tracks eastward. These differences also impact the
possibility of a surface low forming and its track likely in the
western Atlantic, along with precipitation chances for the East
Coast. There have been ample run-to-run and model-to-model
variations with these features over the past couple of days, with
generally the GFS suite taking the weaker/faster side compared to
other guidance. For the 12/18Z cycle, somewhat better model
agreement was finally seen as the 12Z ECMWF (and now the new 00Z
ECMWF) no longer spin up a deep closed low with the energy on
Friday and lasting into the weekend, but take a more middle ground
approach with weaker but still potent energy producing a southern
stream open trough. Additionally, the 18Z GFS, while overall still
fast compared to consensus, keeps troughing persistent across the
East into Saturday, though is now on the aggressive side with a
small closed upper low off the East Coast by Sunday. The 12Z CMC
shows a brief closed low forming Saturday but certainly within
reason. Thus for these features in the East, a blend mainly based
on the 18Z GFS, the 12Z ECMWF, and the 12Z CMC was utilized
through the weekend, weighting the GEFS and EC ensemble means
(which were better clustered tonight) more heavily as the period
progressed. With this blend, surface cyclogenesis occurs off the
East Coast, and most guidance tonight shows a trend toward most
precipitation remaining offshore with the low, but with the
possibility for lighter amounts over the East Coast Friday and
Saturday.

Farther west, there is uncertainty with track and timing of
shortwave energies entering the West Coast late this week. Most
guidance (though the 00Z CMC is on the weaker side) takes a
shortwave across the Northwest and southwestern Canada Thursday
into Friday, which pushes upper ridging somewhat eastward into the
central U.S. Just behind this shortwave there is potential for
additional shortwave energy to come into the West Friday into
Saturday. This is where model guidance begins to diverge more
notably. The 12Z UKMET is quite strong with a closed mid-upper low
forming in the central U.S. on Saturday, the 12Z ECMWF splits
energy to take some into central Canada while some tracks quickly
southward over the Mississippi Valley and reinforces the East
Coast troughing by Sunday but keeps ridging over the central U.S.,
and the 12Z CMC takes most energy eastward along the U.S./Canadian
border and creates zonal flow over the western and central CONUS.
The 12Z and 18Z GFS differ notably, as the 12Z GFS aggressively
combines strong energy to create a central U.S. closed low Sunday,
somewhat like the UKMET but a day later, while the 18Z shears the
shortwave energy north of the west-central U.S. ridging. The new
00Z GFS is more like the 18Z GFS, though does close off a 500mb
low in the Upper Midwest more quickly than the 18Z run. For this
feature leaned toward the 18Z GFS and GEFS mean for the forecast,
which seemed to be a good middle ground solution among guidance,
as it maintains some ridging in the central U.S. but accounts for
the shortwave energy as well. Overall, variability in model and
ensemble guidance leads to below average confidence in the
forecast evolution, though may be improving somewhat compared to
previous cycles.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Light to moderate rain is expected across the Gulf Coast and the
southeastern quadrant of the country on Thursday as a weak
shortwave moves through the base of the trough and sufficient
moisture streams north of a Gulf Coast front. The heaviest
precipitation will likely be in the Southern Appalachians, and the
highest peaks there could see snow. Then some rain may spread into
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday into Saturday, but how far
west precipitation reaches will depend on the surface low track in
the western Atlantic. If moisture does reach the higher elevations
of the Central Appalachians and interior Northeast, snow is
possible there as well.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation during the latter half of the week into the
weekend near the West Coast. Through the period, the Pacific
Northwest/far northern California can expect the heaviest
precipitation, with normal terrain enhancements and higher
elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with highest amounts
Thursday into early Friday.

Behind the aforementioned front across the Gulf Coast, a cold high
pressure system will maintain well below normal temperatures
across the central and eastern CONUS. This will especially be the
case for highs, which should be 10-20F below average from southern
parts of the Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley
toward the eastern U.S. Chilly lows are also forecast, with
temperatures about 5-10F below normal across the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley and stretching toward the south-central U.S. by Friday, and
into the Southeast over the weekend. Expect above normal
temperatures under the western/central U.S. ridge aloft, with
highs about 10-15F above average for the north-central U.S.
southward into the central High Plains, with the Desert Southwest
a few degrees above normal as well. Meanwhile, periods of
unsettled weather will keep highs near to somewhat below normal
over the West Coast on most days.

possibility of a surface low forming and its track likely in the
western Atlantic, along with precipitation chances for the East
Coast. There have been ample run-to-run and model-to-model
variations with these features over the past couple of days, with
generally the GFS suite taking the weaker/faster side compared to
other guidance. For the 12/18Z cycle, somewhat better model
agreement was finally seen as the 12Z ECMWF (and now the new 00Z
ECMWF) no longer spin up a deep closed low with the energy on
Friday and lasting into the weekend, but take a more middle ground
approach with weaker but still potent energy producing a southern
stream open trough. Additionally, the 18Z GFS, while overall still
fast compared to consensus, keeps troughing persistent across the
East into Saturday, though is now on the aggressive side with a
small closed upper low off the East Coast by Sunday. The 12Z CMC
shows a brief closed low forming Saturday but certainly within
reason. Thus for these features in the East, a blend mainly based
on the 18Z GFS, the 12Z ECMWF, and the 12Z CMC was utilized
through the weekend, weighting the GEFS and EC ensemble means
(which were better clustered tonight) more heavily as the period
progressed. With this blend, surface cyclogenesis occurs off the
East Coast, and most guidance tonight shows a trend toward most
precipitation remaining offshore with the low, but with the
possibility for lighter amounts over the East Coast Friday and
Saturday.

Farther west, there is uncertainty with track and timing of
shortwave energies entering the West Coast late this week. Most
guidance (though the 00Z CMC is on the weaker side) takes a
shortwave across the Northwest and southwestern Canada Thursday
into Friday, which pushes upper ridging somewhat eastward into the
central U.S. Just behind this shortwave there is potential for
additional shortwave energy to come into the West Friday into
Saturday. This is where model guidance begins to diverge more
notably. The 12Z UKMET is quite strong with a closed mid-upper low
forming in the central U.S. on Saturday, the 12Z ECMWF splits
energy to take some into central Canada while some tracks quickly
southward over the Mississippi Valley and reinforces the East
Coast troughing by Sunday but keeps ridging over the central U.S.,
and the 12Z CMC takes most energy eastward along the U.S./Canadian
border and creates zonal flow over the western and central CONUS.
The 12Z and 18Z GFS differ notably, as the 12Z GFS aggressively
combines strong energy to create a central U.S. closed low Sunday,
somewhat like the UKMET but a day later, while the 18Z shears the
shortwave energy north of the west-central U.S. ridging. The new
00Z GFS is more like the 18Z GFS, though does close off a 500mb
low in the Upper Midwest more quickly than the 18Z run. For this
feature leaned toward the 18Z GFS and GEFS mean for the forecast,
which seemed to be a good middle ground solution among guidance,
as it maintains some ridging in the central U.S. but accounts for
the shortwave energy as well. Overall, variability in model and
ensemble guidance leads to below average confidence in the
forecast evolution, though may be improving somewhat compared to
previous cycles.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Light to moderate rain is expected across the Gulf Coast and the
southeastern quadrant of the country on Thursday as a weak
shortwave moves through the base of the trough and sufficient
moisture streams north of a Gulf Coast front. The heaviest
precipitation will likely be in the Southern Appalachians, and the
highest peaks there could see snow. Then some rain may spread into
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday into Saturday, but how far
west precipitation reaches will depend on the surface low track in
the western Atlantic. If moisture does reach the higher elevations
of the Central Appalachians and interior Northeast, snow is
possible there as well.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation during the latter half of the week into the
weekend near the West Coast. Through the period, the Pacific
Northwest/far northern California can expect the heaviest
precipitation, with normal terrain enhancements and higher
elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with highest amounts
Thursday into early Friday.

Behind the aforementioned front across the Gulf Coast, a cold high
pressure system will maintain well below normal temperatures
across the central and eastern CONUS. This will especially be the
case for highs, which should be 10-20F below average from southern
parts of the Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley
toward the eastern U.S. Chilly lows are also forecast, with
temperatures about 5-10F below normal across the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley and stretching toward the south-central U.S. by Friday, and
into the Southeast over the weekend. Expect above normal
temperatures under the western/central U.S. ridge aloft, with
highs about 10-15F above average for the north-central U.S.
southward into the central High Plains, with the Desert Southwest
a few degrees above normal as well. Meanwhile, periods of
unsettled weather will keep highs near to somewhat below normal
over the West Coast on most days.

...Accumulating Lake Effect Snows possible across portions of the
Great Lakes...

...Below Average Temperatures on tap for much of the Central to
Eastern U.S., above average Temperatures across the West and Gulf
Coast...

...Heavy Rains developing across portions of the Southern Plains
on Wednesday...

A highly amplified mid to upper level flow pattern across much of
North America will deliver a cooler than average start to the
month of November across much of the central to eastern U.S.  High
temperatures are expected to be in the 40s and 50s, 10 to 20
degrees colder than average, across much of the Plains, Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley and Northeast.  Cold west northwesterly flow
across the Great Lakes will support widespread lake effect snow
and rain showers over the next few days downwind of the Great
Lakes.  The season's first accumulating lake effect snows expected
across portion of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the northern
portion of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and in the higher
terrain downwind of the eastern portions of Lakes Erie and
Ontario.  Locally heavy snows are possible with the best chance
across portions of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where totals of
4 to 6"+ are possible.

While the Central to Eastern U.S. are colder than average over the
next few days, the opposite will be true across areas from the
Rockies to the West coast and along the Gulf Coast.  High
temperatures across these regions expected to be 5 to 10 degrees
above average.

Aside from areas downwind of the Great Lakes, precipitation
amounts are expected to be light Monday night, through Tuesday
across much of the Lower 48.  However, during Wednesday,  there
will be an increasing chance of heavy rains along an north of a
slow moving frontal boundary sinking southward through Texas.
This will bring moderate to heavy rain potential during Wednesday
across central to north Texas, eastern Oklahoma, western Arkansas
and northwest Louisiana.  These regions have had below average
precipitation over the past few weeks, resulting in stream flows
below average.  This should keep the risk of any flooding at a low
level across areas that do receive heavy rains.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon November 01 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 07 - 11 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a ridge with
above-normal mid-level heights over the Bering Sea and western Alaska, while a
trough is forecast over the Gulf of Alaska, near the Pacific West Coast of
North America, with below-normal mid-level heights extending to the
northwestern CONUS. A ridge is predicted over the central CONUS, with
above-normal 500-hPa heights over the southwestern and central CONUS. A trough
is forecast over the southeastern CONUS with slightly below normal mid-level
heights.

Mean surface low pressure over the Gulf of Alaska favors predominantly
easterly
and northerly winds increasing probabilities of near- to below-normal
temperatures across Alaska. Below-normal temperature probabilities are
elevated
across the Northwest and Northern California, associated with above-normal
cloudiness. Above-normal temperatures are favored for much of the southwestern
and central CONUS, extending to parts of the Northeast due to predicted
above-normal mid-level heights. A predicted eastward progression of a trough
over the southeastern CONUS results in enhanced probabilities of near to
below-normal temperatures over the southeastern CONUS.

Near- to below-normal precipitation probabilities are favored over Alaska
associated with above-normal mid-level heights. Beneath the predicted mean
trough, above-normal precipitation chances are increased over the northwestern
CONUS extending into parts of the Northern Plains. Below-normal precipitation
probabilities are enhanced over the remainder of the CONUS due to forecast
ridging with above-normal mid-level heights.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, offset
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 09 - 15 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is similar to the
6-10 day period, but generally forecast to deamplify. The Northern Pacific
troughing is forecast to weaken over the Northwest and a flattening ridge is
forecast over the central CONUS as well as eastward progression. A trough with
slightly below normal mid-level heights is forecast over the southeastern
CONUS.


Surface easterly and northerly winds with more cloudiness lead to increasing
probabilities of below-normal temperatures across much of Alaska extending
into
parts of the northwestern CONUS. Above-normal 500-hPa heights are forecast
over
much of the western, central and northeastern CONUS, as well as the middle
Atlantic States, favoring near to above-normal temperatures. Below-normal
temperatures are favored across Florida during week-2  in association with
below normal mid-level heights.

With the mean mid-level trough over the Northeast Pacific, increased easterly
and northeasterly flow favors near- to below-normal precipitation across most
of Alaska. The mean trough over the Northern Pacific favors enhanced
probabilities of above-normal precipitation across much of the western CONUS
due to increased onshore flow, extending to the Northern Plains and western
Great Lakes. Enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitation are also
favored over the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States due to storm system
development over the regions consistent with the operational auto-blend tool.
Below-normal precipitation is favored over the southern-central CONUS related
to forecast above-normal mid-level heights beneath a mean ridge.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, offset
by increasing uncertainty and differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools.


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

US Hazards Outlook

300 PM EDT November 01 2021

SYNOPSIS: An end to the growing season still seems likely in much of the East
early in week-2. Temperatures should dip below freezing to near the Gulf
Coast,
and below 40 degrees F into the northern Florida Peninsula. But following the
first couple days of the period, high pressure sliding eastward into the
Atlantic should pull warmer air into the East thereafter. Farther west,
above-normal 500-hPa heights are expected in the Southwest while significantly
lower than normal 500-hPa heights remain over the Northwest and northern
Pacific Ocean. Between these anomalies, a strong jet stream and active storm
track should bring stormy, wet conditions into the West. The timing and
intensity of individual systems are uncertain, but enhanced chances for
surplus
precipitation centered over northern California and the Sierra Nevada early in
the period should shift northward with time. The strong Pacific storms also
bring an elevated risk of strong winds to the Oregon and adjacent Washington
coast. Some models indicated a possibility for marginally colder-than-normal
conditions in parts of Alaska, but a lack of model consensus precludes
introducing any week-2 hazards there.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for southern portions of the
central Gulf Coast States and northern Louisiana, Tue-Wed, Nov 9-10.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Mid-Atlantic
States, Ohio Valley, and Southeast, Tue-Wed Nov 9-10.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of central and northern
California,
Tue-Thu, Nov 9-11.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for western sections of Washington and
Oregon, Thu-Sat, Nov 11-13.

Slight risk of high winds for the Oregon and adjacent Washington coast,
Tue-Thu, Nov 9-11.

FOR TUESDAY NOVEMBER 09 - MONDAY NOVEMBER 15: Models are in decent agreement
for week-2 in Alaska, the northern Pacific Ocean, and western North America.
All show mid-level troughing centered in the northern Pacific Ocean and
extending into southern Alaska and the northwestern CONUS. Farther south, a
weak ridge with positive 500-hPa height anomalies is centered over the
southwestern CONUS. This pattern creates an anomalously strong Pacific jet
stream and active storm track from the northern Pacific Ocean into the western
CONUS. The mean week-2 surface low pressure is centered by all models to the
south of Alaska, and west of Canada and the CONUS, but models are not in
agreement on the timing and strength of individual storms. Still, both the
latest GEFS and European Ensemble forecast the most anomalously heavy
precipitation to fall on northern California and surrounds early in the
period,
shifting northward into the Pacific Northwest later, as shown in the week-2
probabilistic precipitation hazards map. Heavy rainfall could trigger debris
flows and mudslides in burn scar areas. In addition, this set-up can bring
strong winds into parts of the West, especially near the coast, with the GEFS
highlighting the first few days of the period as having the greatest risk for
strong winds along the Oregon and adjacent Washington coast. Strong winds may
affect other parts of the West Coast at other times, but there was not enough
model consensus to identify any other location or time period as having an
elevated risk of strong winds.



Farther east, the models are less consistent with each other. All keep near or
below normal 500-hPa heights over at least part of the Southeast. The 00z
Canadian Ensembles show this feature weakest in the mean, with subnormal
heights restricted to part of Florida, while the 12z operational GFS keeps a
much deeper anomaly over a larger part of the East, extending westward into
the
Mississippi Valley. Most models are in better agreement with the Canadian
Ensembles, but with a somewhat stronger and broader mid-level trough in the
Southeast. This keeps a surface high pressure system over the Southeast early
in the period, moving eastward into the Atlantic Ocean later in week-2. As a
result, there is general agreement on a scenario featuring well below normal
temperatures for parts of the mid-Atlantic States and Southeast early in the
period, before the surface high pressure system shifts eastward into the
Atlantic. Temperatures are expected to drop below 40 degrees F across the
interior northern Florida Peninsula Nov 9-10, with subfreezing temperatures
expected southward to near the central Gulf Coast. European Ensembles and GEFS
show the greatest chances for anomalously low temperatures along the central
Gulf Coast, where a moderate risk for well below normal temperatures exists.
Model agreement is less robust farther north and to the south in the northern
Florida Peninsula, where only a slight risk of unusually cold weather is
noted.
After this cold snap early in the period, models are in strong agreement that
the surface high pressure responsible for the below normal temperatures will
move from the eastern CONUS into the western Atlantic Ocean. This results in a
return southerly flow of air into the region, dislodging the cold air and
bringing above-normal temperatures into the region near the end of week-2.

Extended Forecast Discussion

419 PM EDT Mon Nov 01 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Nov 04 2021 - 12Z Mon Nov 08 2021

17Z Update:  The latest models and ensembles are in above average
agreement on the synoptic scale through Thursday across the
continental U.S., before more timing differences become apparent
starting on Friday with eastern Pacific shortwave impulses.  The
12Z GFS becomes more progressive and stronger with the shortwave
approaching the Pacific Northwest by the end of the week, and also
faster with the one approaching over the weekend.  Additionally,
there has been more run-to-run variability with the past several
GFS runs regarding the magnitude of the eastern U.S. trough for
later in the forecast period, and there slightly more weighting
was applied to the ECMWF and its ensemble mean for the Saturday to
Monday portion of the forecast period.  The UKMET was slightly out
of phase off the West Coast by Friday and Saturday with a flatter
trough axis compared to the ECMWF/GFS, and a stronger upper ridge.
 Otherwise, the existing forecast is mainly on track with no major
changes necessary for this forecast update.  The previous
discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period will begin Thursday with a ridge axis
across the Southwest to northern High Plains separating troughing
over the eastern Pacific and in eastern North America. Model
guidance agrees on this much, before diverging by the end of the
week with a couple of key features. First, shortwave energy moving
through the trough in the East creates differences in the trough's
evolution Friday into the weekend, namely the depth that the
trough digs, whether or not a separate/possibly closed low
develops in the southern stream with this energy, and the speed
the trough tracks eastward. These differences also impact the
possibility of a surface low forming and its track likely in the
western Atlantic, along with precipitation chances for the East
Coast. There have been ample run-to-run and model-to-model
variations with these features over the past couple of days, with
generally the GFS suite taking the weaker/faster side compared to
other guidance. For the 12/18Z cycle, somewhat better model
agreement was finally seen as the 12Z ECMWF (and now the new 00Z
ECMWF) no longer spin up a deep closed low with the energy on
Friday and lasting into the weekend, but take a more middle ground
approach with weaker but still potent energy producing a southern
stream open trough. Additionally, the 18Z GFS, while overall still
fast compared to consensus, keeps troughing persistent across the
East into Saturday, though is now on the aggressive side with a
small closed upper low off the East Coast by Sunday. The 12Z CMC
shows a brief closed low forming Saturday but certainly within
reason. Thus for these features in the East, a blend mainly based
on the 18Z GFS, the 12Z ECMWF, and the 12Z CMC was utilized
through the weekend, weighting the GEFS and EC ensemble means
(which were better clustered tonight) more heavily as the period
progressed. With this blend, surface cyclogenesis occurs off the
East Coast, and most guidance tonight shows a trend toward most
precipitation remaining offshore with the low, but with the
possibility for lighter amounts over the East Coast Friday and
Saturday.

Farther west, there is uncertainty with track and timing of
shortwave energies entering the West Coast late this week. Most
guidance (though the 00Z CMC is on the weaker side) takes a
shortwave across the Northwest and southwestern Canada Thursday
into Friday, which pushes upper ridging somewhat eastward into the
central U.S. Just behind this shortwave there is potential for
additional shortwave energy to come into the West Friday into
Saturday. This is where model guidance begins to diverge more
notably. The 12Z UKMET is quite strong with a closed mid-upper low
forming in the central U.S. on Saturday, the 12Z ECMWF splits
energy to take some into central Canada while some tracks quickly
southward over the Mississippi Valley and reinforces the East
Coast troughing by Sunday but keeps ridging over the central U.S.,
and the 12Z CMC takes most energy eastward along the U.S./Canadian
border and creates zonal flow over the western and central CONUS.
The 12Z and 18Z GFS differ notably, as the 12Z GFS aggressively
combines strong energy to create a central U.S. closed low Sunday,
somewhat like the UKMET but a day later, while the 18Z shears the
shortwave energy north of the west-central U.S. ridging. The new
00Z GFS is more like the 18Z GFS, though does close off a 500mb
low in the Upper Midwest more quickly than the 18Z run. For this
feature leaned toward the 18Z GFS and GEFS mean for the forecast,
which seemed to be a good middle ground solution among guidance,
as it maintains some ridging in the central U.S. but accounts for
the shortwave energy as well. Overall, variability in model and
ensemble guidance leads to below average confidence in the
forecast evolution, though may be improving somewhat compared to
previous cycles.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Light to moderate rain is expected across the Gulf Coast and the
southeastern quadrant of the country on Thursday as a weak
shortwave moves through the base of the trough and sufficient
moisture streams north of a Gulf Coast front. The heaviest
precipitation will likely be in the Southern Appalachians, and the
highest peaks there could see snow. Then some rain may spread into
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday into Saturday, but how far
west precipitation reaches will depend on the surface low track in
the western Atlantic. If moisture does reach the higher elevations
of the Central Appalachians and interior Northeast, snow is
possible there as well.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation during the latter half of the week into the
weekend near the West Coast. Through the period, the Pacific
Northwest/far northern California can expect the heaviest
precipitation, with normal terrain enhancements and higher
elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with highest amounts
Thursday into early Friday.

Behind the aforementioned front across the Gulf Coast, a cold high
pressure system will maintain well below normal temperatures
across the central and eastern CONUS. This will especially be the
case for highs, which should be 10-20F below average from southern
parts of the Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley
toward the eastern U.S. Chilly lows are also forecast, with
temperatures about 5-10F below normal across the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley and stretching toward the south-central U.S. by Friday, and
into the Southeast over the weekend. Expect above normal
temperatures under the western/central U.S. ridge aloft, with
highs about 10-15F above average for the north-central U.S.
southward into the central High Plains, with the Desert Southwest
a few degrees above normal as well. Meanwhile, periods of
unsettled weather will keep highs near to somewhat below normal
over the West Coast on most days.

precipitation will likely be in the Southern Appalachians, and the
highest peaks there could see snow. Then some rain may spread into
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday into Saturday, but how far
west precipitation reaches will depend on the surface low track in
the western Atlantic. If moisture does reach the higher elevations
of the Central Appalachians and interior Northeast, snow is
possible there as well.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation during the latter half of the week into the
weekend near the West Coast. Through the period, the Pacific
Northwest/far northern California can expect the heaviest
precipitation, with normal terrain enhancements and higher
elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with highest amounts
Thursday into early Friday.

Behind the aforementioned front across the Gulf Coast, a cold high
pressure system will maintain well below normal temperatures
across the central and eastern CONUS. This will especially be the
case for highs, which should be 10-20F below average from southern
parts of the Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley
toward the eastern U.S. Chilly lows are also forecast, with
temperatures about 5-10F below normal across the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley and stretching toward the south-central U.S. by Friday, and
into the Southeast over the weekend. Expect above normal
temperatures under the western/central U.S. ridge aloft, with
highs about 10-15F above average for the north-central U.S.
southward into the central High Plains, with the Desert Southwest
a few degrees above normal as well. Meanwhile, periods of
unsettled weather will keep highs near to somewhat below normal
over the West Coast on most days.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
314 AM EDT Tue Nov 02 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Nov 05 2021 - 12Z Tue Nov 09 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will be characterized by an upper ridge
with its axis gradually shifting from the Four Corners late this
week into the Plains early next week, separating mean troughing in
the East and the eastern Pacific into the West. Periods of
shortwave energy and fronts coming into the Northwest will keep
precipitation chances high there, while a front and developing low
pressure system off the East Coast will spread some rain to
Florida and the Southeast coast.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance has now been in better agreement for a few cycles
now that a shortwave will move quickly through the Great Lakes and
Northeast on Friday through the base of a northeastern North
America trough. More differences arise with the evolution of
shortwave energy that begins over the northern High Plains on
Friday and tracks eastward/southeastward, as well as southern
stream troughing across the Southeast. GFS runs take the
combination of the energy/troughing more quickly offshore this
weekend, with other deterministic guidance holding energy back
over the Southeast. These differences also impact the track of a
surface low developing off the Southeast coast in the western
Atlantic. Considering the typical biases of these models as well
as WPC continuity, favored an upper-level and surface pattern
similar to the 12Z EC ensemble mean. The 12Z ECMWF and CMC may end
up a bit slow and strong at 500mb with this feature by Monday,
especially considering that the newer 00Z ECMWF especially is a
bit faster/weaker than its previous run.

A persistent train of shortwaves coming into the Pacific Northwest
shows considerable variability in the shortwaves' track across the
northern U.S. and southern Canada this weekend into early next
week. This is to be expected for these small-scale features at
this time range; however, it does affect the broader
trough-ridge-trough pattern in some instances if the shortwaves
are successful in breaking down the central U.S. ridge. This
particularly occurred with the 12Z GFS run around next Monday,
which seems to be an anomaly considering other recent
deterministic and ensemble mean guidance. Maintaining ridging
seems like the best bet at this time, though some suppression
along the edges of the ridging is possible depending on the
eventual strength of the shortwaves.

Given the reasons described above, the WPC forecast began with a
multi-model deterministic blend of 12Z/18Z guidance, transitioning
to favor the ECMWF more than the GFS runs, and adding larger
proportions of the EC ensemble mean and some GEFS mean as the
medium range period progressed.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A front over the western Atlantic, Florida peninsula, and the Gulf
of Mexico and a developing surface low along it will cause
rainfall over much of Florida on Friday as ample moisture streams
in. As the low tracks northeastward into the western Atlantic,
some rain is expected on the backside for the coastal Carolinas
and possibly into parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday
into Saturday, but how far west precipitation reaches will depend
on the surface low track in the western Atlantic. Current
forecasts do not show rainfall reaching very far inland, given a
more offshore track of the low.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation during the latter half of the week into
early next week near the West Coast. Through the period, the
Pacific Northwest/far northern California can expect the heaviest
precipitation, with normal terrain enhancements and higher
elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with amounts there
increasing by next Monday into Tuesday.

Behind the aforementioned front in the Gulf, a cold surface high
pressure system will maintain below normal temperatures across the
southeastern CONUS through the weekend, with highs 10-15F below
average and highs/lows 5-10F below normal in southern portions of
the Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley. Meanwhile, a more
persistent upper-level ridge indicated with this forecast cycle
over the west-central U.S. should lead to temperatures that are
above average by 10-20 degrees over the Plains and stretching into
the Midwest. Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat
below normal over the West Coast on most days.

...Lake Effect snow accumulations possible across portions of
Michigan and New York through the early afternoon...

...Quasi-stationary boundary to bring heavy rain to portions of
the Southern Plains on Wednesday...

...Unseasonably cool temperatures to persist across the Central
and Eastern US as above average temperatures emerge out West...

Cyclonic flow around a deep low pressure system over eastern
Canada is serving to force cool Canadian air southward over the
Great Lakes. When combined with shortwave instability at the
surface and forcing via a passing cold front, this cold air
advection is expected to produce a favorable environment for a
rain shower/Lake Effect snow mix over portions of Michigan and
Upstate New York over the next couple days. While only light
accumulations are expected over higher terrain in New York, parts
of Northern Michigan could see widespread totals of 2+" today with
isolated higher amounts of 5-8+", particularly in the Upper
Peninsula where Winter Weather Advisories are currently in effect.
Out West a stationary boundary curving through the Rockies will
also serve as the focal point for the development of both rain and
snow. Unlike its eastern counterpart, moderate to heavy snow
accumulations in this part of the country will be primarily
isolated to higher elevations above 8000 ft.

In the neighboring Southern Plains, the southern edge of the
aforementioned stationary boundary is forecast to bring showers
and thunderstorms to much of the region through Thursday morning.
On Wednesday the front and an associated low pressure wave are
expected to remain virtually motionless over Texas, delivering
moderate to heavy rainfall to the eastern portion of the state.
With rainfall totals of 2-3+" in 24 hours possible in some areas,
the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk of
Excessive Rainfall for portions of eastern Texas effective
Wednesday morning through Thursday morning. Meanwhile, a series of
low pressure systems approaching the Pacific Northwest will bring
light rain and high elevation snow to the region throughout the
period.

Temperature-wise unseasonably cool weather is expected to persist
throughout the Central and Eastern US as surface high pressure
dominates and pulls cold air south. The greatest hit to daily
maximum temperatures will be felt in the Central and Southern
Plains where highs are forecast to sit 20 to 25 degrees below
normal as they struggle to escape the 40s and 50s. Less extreme
temperature departures of 10 to 15 degrees below average are also
expected throughout the Northern Plains, Midwest, Ohio Valley, and
Northeast. In stark contrast to the cold spell to the east,
temperatures from the Rockies to the West Coast are forecast to
remain around average on Tuesday before warming up on Wednesday.
Thanks to a building upper-level ridge, high temperatures across
these regions are expected to rise to 5 to 10 degrees above
average.

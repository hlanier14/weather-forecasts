Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1114 AM CDT Wed Jun 09 2021

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF EASTERN NEVADA...FAR
NORTHWEST ARIZONA...AND WESTERN UTAH...

The previous forecast remains on track for the Interior West. Please
see the previous forecast below for more details on fire weather
highlights across the Great Basin, Four Corners, Central and
Northern Rockies regions.

In addition, locally Elevated conditions are possible along the lee
of the Cascades this afternoon. By evening, isolated thunderstorms
may develop across portions of the Pacific Northwest, though most of
the area is also expected to see wetting rains, precluding the
introduction of isolated dry thunderstorm areas. Portions of Maine
may also experience dry and breezy northwesterly surface conditions
verging on Elevated criteria by afternoon peak heating. However, the
lack of stronger surface winds precludes the addition of Elevated
highlights here as well.

..Squitieri.. 06/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CDT Wed Jun 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough will shift slowly east through the day, leading
to moderate mid-level flow and lee cyclogenesis in the Great Basin.
Very dry surface conditions are forecast this afternoon across much
of the Southwest, Great Basin, and central Rockies. Surface winds
will increase through the day as a result of deep thermal mixing
transporting stronger flow to the surface, and also as a result of
the tightening pressure gradient accompanying lee cyclogenesis.

By mid to late afternoon, expect relative humidity of 6 to 12
percent and a broad region of 20 to 30 mph winds. Within this larger
region, some sustained surface winds in excess of 30 mph are
expected, especially across portions of Nevada. While meteorological
conditions will likely support an extremely critical delineation,
fuels across Nevada are mostly characterized by ERCs in the 85 to
90th percentile, which could be a limiting factor to extreme fire
behavior.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
213 PM EDT Wed Jun 09 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Jun 12 2021 - 12Z Wed Jun 16 2021

...Much above normal temperatures and record/dangerous heat this
weekend into early next week across much of the interior
West/Northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...


...Overview...
Upper pattern is forecast to amplify along 105W this weekend into
early next week, promoting warm/hot temperatures over much of the
West and northern High Plains that may near or break daily
records. Troughing exiting New England will dig back into the East
next week supporting a couple cold frontal passages and a chance
of showers/storms. A Pacific front will push into the Pacific
Northwest early next week and head into Canada.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the models/ensembles were in reasonable
agreement and offered average to above average predictability and
consistency in the longwave pattern evolution. This includes the
upper flow amplification driven by near +3 sigma 500mb height
anomalies via a closed 594+ dm upper high into the Four Corners
region. The largest model spread existed with downstream troughing
for the Great Lakes into Northeast next week. With such strong
upstream ridging, the deeper troughing has become a clearer signal
and preferred pattern but the depth and progressiveness remain
uncertain. Upstream energy amplitude/track and interactions with
shortwave energy coming out of Hudson Bay lower confidence by the
middle of next week. Over the Gulf, a weakness between the
Southwest and NW Caribbean ridges/highs will take a feature
southwestward into Mexico, perhaps enhancing some rainfall over
the open waters. Utilized a blend of the deterministic guidance
(GFS/ECMWF/CMC/UKMET) to start, followed by increased weighting of
the GEFS mean and ECMWF ensemble mean by days 6-7 (next Tue/Wed).
13Z National Blend of Models was a good staring point for
temperatures and other surface grids but a multi-model/ensemble
blend was used for QPF. This maintained good continuity from the
overnight progs.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The amplification of the upper ridge over the central U.S. is
expected to bring another round of much above normal to record
warm/hot temperatures to the northern Rockies and northern Plains
late this weekend and early next week. Temperatures over the
Southwest may approach and exceed records as well next week with
dangerously high temperatures into the 110s. Temperatures may be
10-25F above normal with some triple-digit readings possible as
far north as central/eastern Montana Monday and Tuesday. Nighttime
lows will also remain warm for the region and likely stay 10F to
15F above normal for the middle of June. Elsewhere across the
CONUS, temperatures are expected to be near to slightly above
normal, perhaps a bit below normal over the Great Lakes into the
Northeast next week behind a cold front. The strong/dominant upper
ridge over the central CONUS will keep much of the area void of
significant or heavy rainfall -- the exceptions being over the
Northwest as a front moves in this weekend and possibly along the
Gulf Coast to Southeast U.S. late this weekend into early next
week where a frontal boundary stalls and lingers.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
213 PM EDT Wed Jun 09 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Jun 12 2021 - 12Z Wed Jun 16 2021

...Much above normal temperatures and record/dangerous heat this
weekend into early next week across much of the interior
West/Northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...


...Overview...
Upper pattern is forecast to amplify along 105W this weekend into
early next week, promoting warm/hot temperatures over much of the
West and northern High Plains that may near or break daily
records. Troughing exiting New England will dig back into the East
next week supporting a couple cold frontal passages and a chance
of showers/storms. A Pacific front will push into the Pacific
Northwest early next week and head into Canada.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the models/ensembles were in reasonable
agreement and offered average to above average predictability and
consistency in the longwave pattern evolution. This includes the
upper flow amplification driven by near +3 sigma 500mb height
anomalies via a closed 594+ dm upper high into the Four Corners
region. The largest model spread existed with downstream troughing
for the Great Lakes into Northeast next week. With such strong
upstream ridging, the deeper troughing has become a clearer signal
and preferred pattern but the depth and progressiveness remain
uncertain. Upstream energy amplitude/track and interactions with
shortwave energy coming out of Hudson Bay lower confidence by the
middle of next week. Over the Gulf, a weakness between the
Southwest and NW Caribbean ridges/highs will take a feature
southwestward into Mexico, perhaps enhancing some rainfall over
the open waters. Utilized a blend of the deterministic guidance
(GFS/ECMWF/CMC/UKMET) to start, followed by increased weighting of
the GEFS mean and ECMWF ensemble mean by days 6-7 (next Tue/Wed).
13Z National Blend of Models was a good staring point for
temperatures and other surface grids but a multi-model/ensemble
blend was used for QPF. This maintained good continuity from the
overnight progs.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The amplification of the upper ridge over the central U.S. is
expected to bring another round of much above normal to record
warm/hot temperatures to the northern Rockies and northern Plains
late this weekend and early next week. Temperatures over the
Southwest may approach and exceed records as well next week with
dangerously high temperatures into the 110s. Temperatures may be
10-25F above normal with some triple-digit readings possible as
far north as central/eastern Montana Monday and Tuesday. Nighttime
lows will also remain warm for the region and likely stay 10F to
15F above normal for the middle of June. Elsewhere across the
CONUS, temperatures are expected to be near to slightly above
normal, perhaps a bit below normal over the Great Lakes into the
Northeast next week behind a cold front. The strong/dominant upper
ridge over the central CONUS will keep much of the area void of
significant or heavy rainfall -- the exceptions being over the
Northwest as a front moves in this weekend and possibly along the
Gulf Coast to Southeast U.S. late this weekend into early next
week where a frontal boundary stalls and lingers.

FXUS21 KWNC 091901
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 09 2021

SYNOPSIS: Amplified mid-level high pressure is predicted to dominate the
western two-thirds of the lower 48 at the beginning of week-2, expanding
eastward to cover the majority of the contiguous U.S. by the end of the
period.
This pattern is anticipated to support increased chances for excessive heat
across parts of the western half of the lower 48. There continues to be
relatively good model agreement indicating increased chances for tropical
cyclone formation over the Gulf of Mexico during week-2 which may bring heavy
rainfall and high winds to parts of the Gulf Coast states including further
inland. Mid-level low pressure is forecast to form across the North-Central
and
North-Eastern Pacific, favoring above normal precipitation for parts of
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Alaskan precipitation amounts are not
anticipated to exceed pre-defined hazards thresholds.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat across parts of the Central Great Basin, Central
and Southern Rockies, Southwest and eastern California,  Thu-Fri, Jun 17-18.

Moderate risk of excessive heat across parts of the Rockies, Great Basin,
Southwest, Northern and Central Plains, and California, Thu-Sat, Jun 17-19.

Slight risk of excessive heat across many parts of the western half of the
CONUS, Thu-Wed, Jun 17-23.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
Tennessee Valley, Southern Appalachians, Southeast, and Texas, Thu-Mon, Jun
17-21.

Slight risk of high winds across portions of the Gulf Coast states, Thu-Mon,
Jun 17-21.

Slight risk of high winds across coastal portions of California, Thu-Mon, Jun
17-21.

Flooding possible for parts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY JUNE 12 - WEDNESDAY JUNE 16:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!s1SpVnzsmt9RnPKRJ9oDAkhR1JbaPZCWHRt3gMwqxAC-Uu4v92nItaAczWYj3DvhjYQxJ8_e$

FOR THURSDAY JUNE 17 - WEDNESDAY JUNE 23: Model ensemble means (0Z GEFS,
ECMWF,
and Canadian) continue to have good model agreement depicting anomalous
amplified mid-level ridging initially across the western two-thirds of the
CONUS, expanding eastward to cover the majority of the lower 48 by the end of
the period. The ECMWF reforecast tool continues to show higher probabilities
and extends further East (into parts of the Midwest) throughout the period,
compared to the GEFS, which maintains elevated heat potential to west of the
Mississippi Valley. A slight risk of excessive heat is posted for many parts
of
the western half of the CONUS, June 17 to 23, where both reforecast tools show
at least a 20% chance of exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 deg F (100 deg
F)
across parts of the Northwest (central and Southern California and Southwest.
A
moderate risk of excessive heat is designated for parts of the Rockies, Great
Basin, Southwest, Northern and Central Plains, and California, June 17 to 19,
where both reforecast tools indicate at least a 40% (20%) chance of exceeding
the 85th (95th) percentile. A high risk of excessive heat is included in
today's outlook across parts of the Central Great Basin, Central and Southern
Rockies, Southwest and eastern California, for June 17 to 18, since the GEFS
reforecast tool is now showing probabilities greater than 60% for maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile. The ECMWF reforecast tool has been
consistently indicating >60% probabilities in the last few days and continues
today. Many parts of the West, especially southwestern CONUS continue to
experience severe drought. Anticipated dry conditions and anomalous heat
across
the West may support increased chances for localized wildfire risk during the
period. The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) fire potential outlook
shows moderate risk for significant potential across much of the southwestern
quadrant of the country, with high risk triggers (lightning and low humidity)
for June 15, where anomalous hot, dry conditions are anticipated for week-2.
The ensemble means indicate a transition to mid-level troughing developing
along the West Coast toward the end of the period, which would lower chances
for widespread excessive heat across the region.



Across the tropics, the large-scale environment continues to remain favorable
for tropical cyclogenesis in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico during
week-2. Dynamical models continue to support tropical cyclone (TC) formation,
although there is significant model uncertainty regarding the details of the
timing and evolution of possible TCs. The ECMWF probabilistic TC tool depicts
elevated chances for cyclone development over the Bay of Campeche at the
beginning of the period, with increased potential extending into the Gulf of
Mexico throughout the period. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) currently
indicates a disturbance over the western Caribbean having a 10% chance of TC
formation in the next 5 days as of 2pm EDT today. In general, recent GEFS and
ECMWF ensembles continue to favor the central and western Gulf Coast states
with the greatest likelihood of TC activity. Both the GEFS and the ECMWF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals
exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and one inch from the days 8 to
12
day period over the central and western Gulf Coast states. Uncalibrated
ensemble model tools continue to indicate elevated potential for heavy
precipitation across parts of Florida. Therefore, a broad area is highlighted
with a slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Lower
Mississippi
Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southern Appalachians, Southeast, and Texas, June 17
to 21, associated with favorable TC activity and large-scale flow for enhanced
moisture. Increased likelihood for TCs may also support high winds across
parts
of Texas and southeastern CONUS. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools show at
least a 20% chance of sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and
20 mph approaching the Gulf Coast during the 8 to 12 day period. Therefore, a
slight risk of high winds is highlighted for parts of the Gulf Coast states
for
June 17 to 21. Expected elevated potential for heavy rainfall combined with
saturated soils may also lead to localized flooding in areas already
experiencing flood conditions. A possible flood risk area is posted for parts
of Texas Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama where current stream flows exceed
the 90th percentile and the NWS River Flood Outlook indicates areas with
significant flooding already occurring or forecast to occur in the next 5
days.



Surface high pressure is predicted to form over the northeastern Pacific, with
thermal low pressure over California and the Southwest. The orientation of
these features may support a tight pressure gradient over parts of California
from the beginning to middle of the period, resulting in increased chances for
high winds across coastal California. Therefore, a slight risk of high winds
is
highlighted for coastal parts of California, June 17 to 21, where both the
GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of sustained wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph.



Mid-level ridging is anticipated to dominate Mainland Alaska during the
period,
supporting increased chances for above normal temperatures across the majority
of the state during week-2. Despite many week-2 model tools favoring above
normal precipitation being for much of Alaska, this precipitation may be
convective in nature, rather than related to large scale features and
widespread precipitation. Anomalously warm temperatures and increased
potential
for thunderstorms may support general increased likelihood for wildfire risk
across the northeastern quadrant of the mainland of Alaska during week-2.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed June 09 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 15 - 19 2021

Today's model solutions are in a good agreement on the 500-hPa circulation
pattern across the forecast domain. An amplified pattern is predicted,
consisting of an anomalous trough over the eastern Aleutians southeastward to
the West Coast, an amplified ridge centered over much of the western and
central CONUS, and an amplified trough over the eastern CONUS.

Troughing centered across the Aleutians and associated southerly flow are
forecast to favor relatively warm conditions for Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians. Downstream, anomalously strong ridging predicted over much of the
west-central CONUS is expected to significantly increase chances of above
normal temperatures across most of the western and central CONUS, especially
over parts of the North-Central Rockies and Great Basin as well as the
Northern
Plains, where positive height anomalies are forecast to be the highest. The
potential for some shortwave troughs and frontal activities persist over parts
of the Southern Plains and much of the eastern CONUS, enhancing the likelihood
of near to below normal temperatures over those regions. Above normal
temperatures are favored over the central and southern Florida Peninsula,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered across the Aleutians favors near to above normal
precipitation over Alaska. Anomalously strong ridging and positive height
anomalies predicted over much of the western and central CONUS are expected to
significantly increase chances of below normal precipitation across much of
the
northern and central CONUS, especially over parts of the Northern Rockies
eastward to the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valleys. The potential for some
shortwave troughs predicted across parts of the Southern Plains and Southeast
and moisture flow from south enhance chances of near to above normal
precipitation over the southern Four Corners areas and the coastal region of
the Gulf of Mexico, except for southern Florida, where below normal
precipitation is indicated.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 4 out of 5,
due to good agreement among the model solutions, an amplified pattern
predicted
across the domain, offset by some uncertainties and differences among the
precipitation and temperature forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 17 - 23 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is forecast to
persist, but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. Because the week-2
mid-level pattern is expected to be similar to the 6-10 day period, the
temperature and precipitation probability forecasts are quite similar between
the two outlook periods.

Above normal temperatures are expected for much of Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Positive height
anomalies associated with the forecast ridge centered over the west-central
CONUS favor above normal temperatures across the western and central CONUS.
Near to below temperatures are expected over parts of the Southern Plains and
most of the eastern CONUS underneath forecast near to below normal 500-hPa
heights. Above normal temperatures are more likely for the central and
southern
Florida Peninsula consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered over the northern Aleutians favors above normal
precipitation over much of Alaska. Below normal precipitation is likely across
much of the northern and central CONUS and parts of the Southern Plains
underneath forecast ridging over the western CONUS and predicted surface high
pressure over the eastern CONUS. Due in part to the potential for increased
moisture flow from south and tropical activity over parts of the Caribbean and
Gulf of Mexico, near to above normal precipitation is favored for states along
the Gulf of Mexico and parts of the Southeast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Flooding remains likely for portions of the Mid-South as heavy
rain continues to fall across areas where very heavy amounts have
already occurred...

...Scattered severe storms are likely Thursday afternoon and
evening across the northern Plains...

...Elevated to Critical Fire Weather conditions are in place
across much of the Interior West...

A slow-moving area of low pressure will continue to produce
periods of very heavy rainfall across portions of the Mid South
Wednesday night into Thursday.  These heavy rains, in addition to
the near-historic rains that have already occurred across portions
of the region, will likely worsen the already dangerous flooding
conditions occurring across portions of southern Arkansas and
northern Mississippi.  Heavy rain is also a concern farther to the
east across much of the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys, into the
Appalachians and Mid Atlantic region, as plenty of moisture
spreads across the region.

As noted, this system will be slow to move move east.  As the
threat for locally heavy rains continues across portions of the
Tennessee and Ohio valleys on Thursday, the threat is expected to
increase across the Mid Atlantic beginning Thursday and continuing
into Friday.  A cold front, sinking south into the region, is
forecast to increase the potential for organized heavy rains,
raising the threat for localized flash-flooding concerns across
the region.

Meanwhile, the ongoing heatwave across the Northeast will begin to
subside.  Following one more day of well-above normal temperatures
on Wednesday, temperatures are forecast to drop off by several
degrees on Thursday, followed by an additional decrease on Friday
as the previously noted front drops south through the Northeast
into the Mid Atlantic.

In the West, widely scattered thunderstorms are forecast to
develop late this afternoon and evening from the northern Rockies
into central Montana.  Some of these storms are expected to become
severe -- producing damaging winds and large hail.

Then on Thursday, scattered severe storms are likely during the
afternoon and evening across portion of the northern Plains.  A
strong area of low pressure is expected to intensify east of the
northern Rockies.  This system is forecast to help support the
development of severe storms capable of producing very large hail,
damaging winds, and tornadoes from central Montana and eastern
Wyoming to the Dakotas and Nebraska.

Gusty winds will accompany this system's trailing cold front as it
moves across the West over the next couple days.  With no
precipitation expected, Red Flag Warnings for critical fire
weather conditions are in effect today from the central and
southern Sierra Nevada to western Colorado.  On Thursday, critical
fire weather conditions are expected from northern Arizona
northeastward through central Wyoming.

...Much above normal temperatures and record/dangerous heat this
weekend into early next week across much of the interior
West/Northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...


...Overview...
Upper pattern is forecast to amplify along 105W this weekend into
early next week, promoting warm/hot temperatures over much of the
West and northern High Plains that may near or break daily
records. Troughing exiting New England will dig back into the East
next week supporting a couple cold frontal passages and a chance
of showers/storms. A Pacific front will push into the Pacific
Northwest early next week and head into Canada.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the models/ensembles were in reasonable
agreement and offered average to above average predictability and
consistency in the longwave pattern evolution. This includes the
upper flow amplification driven by near +3 sigma 500mb height
anomalies via a closed 594+ dm upper high into the Four Corners
region. The largest model spread existed with downstream troughing
for the Great Lakes into Northeast next week. With such strong
upstream ridging, the deeper troughing has become a clearer signal
and preferred pattern but the depth and progressiveness remain
uncertain. Upstream energy amplitude/track and interactions with
shortwave energy coming out of Hudson Bay lower confidence by the
middle of next week. Over the Gulf, a weakness between the
Southwest and NW Caribbean ridges/highs will take a feature
southwestward into Mexico, perhaps enhancing some rainfall over
the open waters. Utilized a blend of the deterministic guidance
(GFS/ECMWF/CMC/UKMET) to start, followed by increased weighting of
the GEFS mean and ECMWF ensemble mean by days 6-7 (next Tue/Wed).
13Z National Blend of Models was a good staring point for
temperatures and other surface grids but a multi-model/ensemble
blend was used for QPF. This maintained good continuity from the
overnight progs.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The amplification of the upper ridge over the central U.S. is
expected to bring another round of much above normal to record
warm/hot temperatures to the northern Rockies and northern Plains
late this weekend and early next week. Temperatures over the
Southwest may approach and exceed records as well next week with
dangerously high temperatures into the 110s. Temperatures may be
10-25F above normal with some triple-digit readings possible as
far north as central/eastern Montana Monday and Tuesday. Nighttime
lows will also remain warm for the region and likely stay 10F to
15F above normal for the middle of June. Elsewhere across the
CONUS, temperatures are expected to be near to slightly above
normal, perhaps a bit below normal over the Great Lakes into the
Northeast next week behind a cold front. The strong/dominant upper
ridge over the central CONUS will keep much of the area void of
significant or heavy rainfall -- the exceptions being over the
Northwest as a front moves in this weekend and possibly along the
Gulf Coast to Southeast U.S. late this weekend into early next
week where a frontal boundary stalls and lingers.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST
UTAH INTO FAR NORTHWEST COLORADO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN ARIZONA INTO
EASTERN UTAH...WESTERN COLORADO...AND CENTRAL WYOMING...

An Extremely Critical delineation has been added to portions of
northeast Utah into far northwestern Colorado for tomorrow afternoon
and early evening. Latest guidance consensus, including
high-resolution model output, shows more widespread, longer lasting
30+ mph sustained southwesterly surface winds overlapping RH under
10% across portions of the Upper Colorado River Valley. Fuels across
this area are critically (verging on extremely critically) dry with
ERCs and BIs near record values for early June. Evidence of
anomalously high fuel receptiveness to fire spread is further
supported by a lack of recent appreciable rainfall accumulations and
subsequent exceptional drought. A few ongoing fires have also
exhibited extreme behavior per coordination with WFOs/fire weather
partners, further warranting the need for Extremely Critical
highlights given the aforementioned anticipated surface winds/RH.

Elevated/Critical expansions have also been made across parts of the
Northern/Central Rockies into the Great Basin and Lower Colorado
River Valley to account for the latest guidance. Many of these areas
are still expected to see 15-30 mph sustained southwesterly winds
and 10-20% RH through much of tomorrow afternoon, where fuels are
modestly to highly receptive to significant wildfire spread.

An Elevated area was added to portions of the Columbia River Basin
in southeast Washington. Here, downslope flow during the late
afternoon/early evening hours will promote 15-25 mph sustained
westerly surface winds and 20-25% RH atop fuels receptive to fire
spread.

..Squitieri.. 06/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Wed Jun 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Thursday, a mid-level shortwave trough is forecast to shift from
southern Nevada into western Wyoming during the day. On the southern
periphery of this trough, 40 to 50 knots of mid-level flow is
forecast. In addition, very strong lee cyclogenesis is forecast in
eastern Montana during the afternoon, which will tighten the
pressure gradient across much of the northern and central Rockies.

These combined effects of deep mixing amid strong mid-level flow and
a strong surface pressure gradient will lead to strong surface winds
ahead of the surface cold front, from southeast Utah into northwest
Colorado and central Wyoming. Sustained winds of 30 to 35 mph are
likely in this region with relative humidity around 7 to 10 percent.

In addition, fuels in this region are quite dry with ERCs well above
the 90th percentile in most areas; some ERCs approach the 97th
percentile. Extreme fire behavior on multiple fires the last few
days with lighter winds builds more support for the idea that fuels
are very dry. In addition, there are at least half a dozen ongoing
fires in the region where the worst conditions are forecast on
Thursday. An extremely critical delineation was strongly considered
this outlook, but would like to see 12Z high-resolution guidance
confirm the extremely critical conditions before adding it.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
205 AM EDT Thu Jun 10 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Jun 13 2021 - 12Z Thu Jun 17 2021

...Record to dangerous heat this weekend into early next week
across much of the interior West/Northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...

...Overview...
Anomalously strong upper ridge building and amplifying through the
central U.S. into next week will continue the much above normal
temperatures across much of the West into the Northern Plains.
Record heat will be possible early next week from the Southwest to
Northern Plains where the repeated days of heat will become
excessive and dangerous. Troughing exiting New England will dig
back into the East next week supporting a couple cold frontal
passages and a chance of showers/storms. A Pacific front will push
into the Pacific Northwest early next week and head into Canada.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
The amplified flow pattern holding over the CONUS during the
medium range period (Sunday-Thursday) has above average model
predictability and forecast confidence. A 594+ dm upper high
expands over the Four Corners and central Rockies next week
contributing to a +3 sigma 500 mb height anomaly which is well
clustered with the available deterministic guidance. Shortwave
energy downstream will help carve out more troughing over the
Great Lakes to Northeast, especially by Tuesday onward. A
shortwave trough rounding the base of the western trough will
eject into the Northern Rockies days 6-7. Finally, over the Gulf,
a weakness between the Southwest and NW Caribbean ridges/highs
will take a feature southwestward into Mexico, perhaps enhancing
some rainfall over the open waters. With the above average model
agreement, the WPC blend this cycle utilized a mostly
deterministic blend compromised of the 18Z GFS and 12Z
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET with some inclusion of the ECENS/GEFS for day 7 to
account for some slightly higher model spread.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The upper ridge over the central U.S. will keep temperatures much
above normal from portions of the Southwest to the Northern
Rockies/Plains late this weekend through much of next week.
Departures from normal of 15F to 25F will be common with daily
records likely to be set Monday-Wednesday. High temperatures well
into the 110s will be possible across the Southwest while upper
90s to low 100s will be possible from Utah into portions of the
Northern Plains and Northern Rockies. Little relief at night is
expected with nighttime lows 10F to as much as 20F above normal.
The repeating days of this type of heat, especially for areas in
the northern tier unaccustomed to prolonged heat waves, will
become dangerous for sensitive groups.

Elsewhere across the CONUS, temperatures are expected to be near
to slightly above normal, perhaps a bit below normal over the
Great Lakes into the Northeast next week behind a cold front. The
strong/dominant upper ridge over the central CONUS will keep much
of the area void of significant or heavy rainfall -- the
exceptions being over the Northwest as a front moves in this
weekend and possibly along the Gulf Coast to Southeast U.S. late
this weekend into early next week where a frontal boundary stalls
and lingers.

...Record to dangerous heat this weekend into early next week
across much of the interior West/Northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...

...Overview...
Anomalously strong upper ridge building and amplifying through the
central U.S. into next week will continue the much above normal
temperatures across much of the West into the Northern Plains.
Record heat will be possible early next week from the Southwest to
Northern Plains where the repeated days of heat will become
excessive and dangerous. Troughing exiting New England will dig
back into the East next week supporting a couple cold frontal
passages and a chance of showers/storms. A Pacific front will push
into the Pacific Northwest early next week and head into Canada.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
The amplified flow pattern holding over the CONUS during the
medium range period (Sunday-Thursday) has above average model
predictability and forecast confidence. A 594+ dm upper high
expands over the Four Corners and central Rockies next week
contributing to a +3 sigma 500 mb height anomaly which is well
clustered with the available deterministic guidance. Shortwave
energy downstream will help carve out more troughing over the
Great Lakes to Northeast, especially by Tuesday onward. A
shortwave trough rounding the base of the western trough will
eject into the Northern Rockies days 6-7. Finally, over the Gulf,
a weakness between the Southwest and NW Caribbean ridges/highs
will take a feature southwestward into Mexico, perhaps enhancing
some rainfall over the open waters. With the above average model
agreement, the WPC blend this cycle utilized a mostly
deterministic blend compromised of the 18Z GFS and 12Z
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET with some inclusion of the ECENS/GEFS for day 7 to
account for some slightly higher model spread.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The upper ridge over the central U.S. will keep temperatures much
above normal from portions of the Southwest to the Northern
Rockies/Plains late this weekend through much of next week.
Departures from normal of 15F to 25F will be common with daily
records likely to be set Monday-Wednesday. High temperatures well
into the 110s will be possible across the Southwest while upper
90s to low 100s will be possible from Utah into portions of the
Northern Plains and Northern Rockies. Little relief at night is
expected with nighttime lows 10F to as much as 20F above normal.
The repeating days of this type of heat, especially for areas in
the northern tier unaccustomed to prolonged heat waves, will
become dangerous for sensitive groups.

Elsewhere across the CONUS, temperatures are expected to be near
to slightly above normal, perhaps a bit below normal over the
Great Lakes into the Northeast next week behind a cold front. The
strong/dominant upper ridge over the central CONUS will keep much
of the area void of significant or heavy rainfall -- the
exceptions being over the Northwest as a front moves in this
weekend and possibly along the Gulf Coast to Southeast U.S. late
this weekend into early next week where a frontal boundary stalls
and lingers.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0144 AM CDT Thu Jun 10 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST UTAH AND
NORTHWEST COLORADO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN ARIZONA INTO CENTRAL
WYOMING...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough, located in northwest Nevada at 06Z this morning,
will shift northeastward toward the northern Rockies by this
afternoon/evening. Lee troughing as a result of this approaching
upper-level wave will likely result in a surface low around 995mb by
mid evening across eastern Montana. In addition, a piece of the
eastern Pacific high-pressure area is forecast to break eastward in
the wake of the mid-level shortwave trough. This should result in a
tight pressure gradient and widespread strong winds across much of
the eastern Great Basin and portions of the northern and central
Rockies. An even more favorable area for strong sustained surface
winds will be in a belt from central Utah into north-central
Wyoming. In this area, surface winds will be aided by downward
momentum transfer of moderate to strong mid-level flow.

Widespread winds of 20 to 30 mph are anticipated. Sustained winds in
excess of 30 mph are forecast from south-central Utah into
north-central Wyoming. Relative humidity of 6 to 12 percent is
forecast across the region.

These winds and relative humidities suggest that meteorological
conditions will likely exceed extremely critical criteria. In
addition, fuels in the area are extremely dry. Dry and breezy
conditions the last 2 days have further increased the ERCs in this
region. Most area averaged ERCs are now well above the 90th
percentile with several approaching the 97th percentile. This alone
suggests very dry fuels in the region. However, there are numerous
large fires already burning across northeast Utah and northwest
Colorado which have been reported to have extreme fire behavior.
This further confirms the receptiveness of the fuels.

The extremely critical delineation primarily covers the region where
meteorological conditions and fuels support the potential for large
fires. The strongest winds may be in southern Wyoming, but this
region is mostly desert with only minimal burnable vegetation.

Additionally, some dry and breezy conditions are anticipated in the
lee of the Cascades and across portions of the Columbia Basin
tomorrow. Winds are not forecast to be overly strong and relative
humidity may not be as dry as the Great Basin. However, some
elevated conditions will be possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0148 AM CDT Thu Jun 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The mid-level shortwave trough and associated jet streak and lee
cyclogenesis which accompanied it will move northeastward into
Canada during the day tomorrow (Fri). However, in its wake, a
somewhat tight pressure gradient is forecast to linger across
northeast Montana and western North Dakota. This may result in 15 to
20 mph winds amid relative humidity of 15 to 25 percent on Friday.
However, ongoing precipitation this morning and forecast
precipitation this afternoon/evening may be sufficient to moisten
fuels and limit the concern for large fires.

Elsewhere, localized elevated conditions may be possible in portions
of the Great Basin, but the more consistent moderate mid-level flow
is forecast to remain across the Northwest where higher
moisture/cooler temperatures are forecast.

...Heavy rain from the Ohio Valley to the East Coast...

...Scattered severe storms are likely Thursday afternoon and
evening across the Northern Plains...

...Elevated to Critical Fire Weather conditions are in place
across much of the Interior West...

After a rather stagnant weather pattern over the past couple of
days, things will begin to change more going into the end of the
week.  The persistent upper ridge that has been anchored over the
central U.S. will now give way to a cold front exiting the Rockies
that will emerge over the Plains and bring cooler temperatures to
much of the High Plains.  This same system will also increase the
threat of severe weather across much of the Northern Plains on
Thursday, where the Storm Prediction Center has an Enhanced Risk
of severe storms from western Nebraska to northeast Montana.
Another cold front will be making southern progress across the
Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic region through the end of the week,
bringing some welcomed relief to the recent hot weather for these
areas by Thursday and especially on Friday.   It will also be
pleasantly cool for this time of year across the West Coast and
Intermountain West region before a warming trend ensues for the
weekend.

The historic heavy rainfall and flooding across parts of
Mississippi and Arkansas over the past couple of days will abate
as the slow moving upper level disturbance slowly lifts away from
this region.  The greatest concern for heavy rainfall is now
expected to be across portions of North Carolina, Virginia, and
West Virginia through Friday night.  This is where the combination
of a slow moving mid-upper level disturbance and a surface frontal
boundary, in the presence of a very moist lower atmosphere, will
produce widespread moderate to heavy rain and embedded
thunderstorms.  Rainfall totals are expected to be in the 1 to 3
inch range for many of these areas over the next two days.  The
opposite will be true across much of the Intermountain West and
Rocky Mountains where enhanced wildfire concerns will exist owing
to gusty winds and very low humidity levels.

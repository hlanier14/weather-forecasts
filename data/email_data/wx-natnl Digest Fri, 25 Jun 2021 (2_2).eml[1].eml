Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Fri Jun 25 2021 - 12Z Sun Jun 27 2021

...Unprecedented and dangerous heat likely throughout the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Great Basin this weekend...

...Several rounds of showers and thunderstorms to create numerous
instances of flash flooding today between the Central Plains and
Middle Mississippi Valley...

...Heavy rain and severe weather chances linger from the Southern
Plains to the Great Lakes through Sunday...

Today is expected to be the first of many extremely hot days felt
across the northwestern United States. An anomalous upper-level
ridge is forecast to slowly meander over the region and nearby
southwest Canada through this weekend. Coinciding with the longest
days of the year and widespread severe drought conditions, high
temperatures are forecast to soar well into record-breaking
territory beginning on Saturday and lasting through at least the
middle of next week. High temperatures are expected to increase
each day this weekend and top out near 20 to 30 degrees above
average on Saturday and Sunday over Washington and Oregon. This
equates to widespread temperatures in the upper-90s and triple
digits, including the major metropolitan areas of Portland, OR and
Seattle, WA. High temperatures into the 110s are possible across
the Columbia Basin in western Washington and north-central Oregon.
Starting on Saturday, several high temperature records should fall
throughout the Northwest, with monthly and even all-time records
in jeopardy by Sunday and Monday. Excessive Heat Warnings have
been issued for nearly all of Washington and Oregon, as well as
much of Idaho and northern California. Heat of this magnitude can
be extremely dangerous if proper precautions aren't taken.
Residents are urged to stay hydrated, avoid extended amounts of
time outdoors, and stay in air-conditioned rooms. Nighttime
temperatures are only expected to briefly cool into the 70s
throughout the lower elevations, which can significantly increase
the threat for heat related illnesses.

Elsewhere, active weather is set to be found across the central
U.S. over the next couple of days. A stationary front is forecast
to extend from the Great Lakes to the Southern Plains by this
evening and be the focus for multiple rounds of heavy rain and
thunderstorms. Given the stalled frontal boundary, sufficient
atmospheric moisture, and the slow-moving nature of thunderstorms
in the area, flash flooding will be a major concern from southeast
Kansas to west-central Indiana. Thunderstorms have already led to
significant flash flooding and over 7 inches of rain in far
northeast Kansas early this morning, with the threat slowly
pushing southward today. WPC has issued a Moderate Risk (level
3/4) for Excessive Rainfall through Saturday morning that covers
parts of the Central Plains, Middle Mississippi Valley, and
western Ohio Valley. This means numerous instances of flash
flooding are expected, with significant events possible. Flash
Flood Watches have been posted for this region as well.

Severe weather is also possible throughout the central U.S. today.
The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5)
for severe thunderstorms that extends from the central/southern
High Plains to central Illinois. Isolated tornadoes, damaging
winds gusts, and large hail are all a possibility as storms form
and strengthen along the stalled frontal boundary this
afternoon/evening. By Saturday, the severe weather threat is
forecast to shift southward and into the southern High Plains as
the cold front surges south. Meanwhile, additional downpours and
flash flooding will remain possible from the Rolling Plains of
Texas, throughout central Oklahoma and the Middle Mississippi
Valley, to the Great Lakes.

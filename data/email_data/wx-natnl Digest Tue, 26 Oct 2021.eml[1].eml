Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 AM CDT Mon Oct 25 2021

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments to
the ongoing Elevated Area. Dry downslope flow and warm temperatures
are expected with the development of a lee trough east of the Front
Range this afternoon. Here, above average fuel dryness in addition
to the previously mentioned meteorological conditions may support a
few hours of elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions.
Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains valid with no changes.
Please see the prior outlook for additional information.

..Lyons.. 10/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CDT Mon Oct 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
Surface lee-troughing will intensify across the High Plains as a
well-defined mid-level trough impinges on the central CONUS today.
Initially dry southerly flow will dominate the southern into central
High Plains. Latest guidance consensus depicts 15 mph sustained
southerly winds overlapping with 15-20% RH across far southeast
Colorado into northeast New Mexico and western portions of the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles. With fine (grass-based) fuels anticipated
to be at least modestly receptive to fire spread, Elevated
highlights have been maintained. Locally Critical conditions may
also briefly occur over terrain-favoring areas in northeast New
Mexico by afternoon peak heating.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Midwest/Southeast Thursday followed by the Mid-Atlantic and
the Northeast Friday and into the weekend...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An anomalously deep cyclone forecast to develop over the mid-South
will likely bring a period of active weather across the eastern
U.S. for the latter part of this week and into the weekend.  Model
guidance have generally shown good agreement on the large scale
evolution and track of this system, with some expected
uncertainties in its timing and details.  A general model
consensus appeared to work fine for this system by maintaining
good continuity with the previous forecasts.  This system may
threaten October low pressure records across parts of the
mid-Mississippi to Ohio Valley.

Over the Pacific Northwest, models are in good agreement to bring
a frontal wave onshore with the potential of heavy precipitation
especially across the higher terrain.  The GFS and GEFS tend to
push the associated upper-level shortwave and precipitation
farther south during the weekend than the rest of the model
guidance.  A gradual drying trend should follow as models are
indicating that a cold high pressure system will build over
western Canada and then extend southward into the northern
Plains/Rockies early next week behind the upper trough.
Elsewhere, models continue to indicate a possible southern stream
upper low approaching California next Sat-Mon but with quite a bit
of timing uncertainties.

The WPC medium range forecasts were composed using an even blend
of the the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS mean with a smaller
contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The biggest weather threat during the medium range period will be
the deep low pressure system working across the eastern third of
the U.S. later this week into next weekend, bringing widespread
moderate rain and areas of heavy rains.  An anomalous closed upper
low will slow frontal system progression and sustain moisture feed
from the Atlantic to allow rainfall to expand across the Ohio
Valley/Appalachians/Southeast later this week and then the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into next weekend.  Sustained moisture feed
interacting with favored orographic lift should focus a possible
flood/runoff threat for parts of the central Appalachians Thursday
to Friday and into parts of the Northwest during the weekend.

Out West, shortwave energy progressing towards the West Coast will
direct a plume of moisture to support another round of heavy
rain/mountain snows to mainly parts of the Pacific Northwest, but
also farther inland across the northern Rockies on Thursday into
Friday.  Conditions should finally dry out by next weekend though
as upper ridging builds over the region.

For temperatures, the Midwest/South to the East Coast should
remain near or more likely below normal through much of the period
underneath cloudy and unstable skies.  Humidity levels though
should allow overnight mins to be more above normal.  Behind this,
upper ridging shifting across the central U.S. will initially
bring a period of above normal temperatures (+10-15F+) into the

temperatures back towards normal by the weekend.  By Sunday into
Monday, it appears that a Canadian high pressure system will bring
colder than normal readings down across the northern Rockies and
then into the northern and central Plains.

Extended Forecast Discussion

255 PM EDT Mon Oct 25 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Oct 28 2021 - 12Z Mon Nov 01 2021

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Midwest/Southeast Thursday followed by the Mid-Atlantic and
the Northeast Friday and into the weekend...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An anomalously deep cyclone forecast to develop over the mid-South
will likely bring a period of active weather across the eastern
U.S. for the latter part of this week and into the weekend.  Model
guidance have generally shown good agreement on the large scale
evolution and track of this system, with some expected
uncertainties in its timing and details.  A general model
consensus appeared to work fine for this system by maintaining
good continuity with the previous forecasts.  This system may
threaten October low pressure records across parts of the
mid-Mississippi to Ohio Valley.

Over the Pacific Northwest, models are in good agreement to bring
a frontal wave onshore with the potential of heavy precipitation
especially across the higher terrain.  The GFS and GEFS tend to
push the associated upper-level shortwave and precipitation
farther south during the weekend than the rest of the model
guidance.  A gradual drying trend should follow as models are
indicating that a cold high pressure system will build over
western Canada and then extend southward into the northern
Plains/Rockies early next week behind the upper trough.
Elsewhere, models continue to indicate a possible southern stream
upper low approaching California next Sat-Mon but with quite a bit
of timing uncertainties.

The WPC medium range forecasts were composed using an even blend
of the the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS mean with a smaller
contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The biggest weather threat during the medium range period will be
the deep low pressure system working across the eastern third of
the U.S. later this week into next weekend, bringing widespread
moderate rain and areas of heavy rains.  An anomalous closed upper
low will slow frontal system progression and sustain moisture feed
from the Atlantic to allow rainfall to expand across the Ohio
Valley/Appalachians/Southeast later this week and then the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into next weekend.  Sustained moisture feed
interacting with favored orographic lift should focus a possible
flood/runoff threat for parts of the central Appalachians Thursday
to Friday and into parts of the Northwest during the weekend.

Out West, shortwave energy progressing towards the West Coast will
direct a plume of moisture to support another round of heavy
rain/mountain snows to mainly parts of the Pacific Northwest, but
also farther inland across the northern Rockies on Thursday into
Friday.  Conditions should finally dry out by next weekend though
as upper ridging builds over the region.

For temperatures, the Midwest/South to the East Coast should
remain near or more likely below normal through much of the period
underneath cloudy and unstable skies.  Humidity levels though
should allow overnight mins to be more above normal.  Behind this,
upper ridging shifting across the central U.S. will initially
bring a period of above normal temperatures (+10-15F+) into the
northern High Plains before the next shortwave moderates
temperatures back towards normal by the weekend.  By Sunday into
Monday, it appears that a Canadian high pressure system will bring
colder than normal readings down across the northern Rockies and
then into the northern and central Plains.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 25 2021

SYNOPSIS: Surface high pressure with anomalously cold temperatures is forec=
ast
to shift south from Canada at the beginning of November. The coldest
temperatures so far this fall are expected to affect much of the central an=
d
eastern U.S. next week. Following a very wet pattern throughout the contigu=
ous
U.S. during late October, a drier weather is anticipated during early
November.
Mid-level low pressure over the North Pacific is forecast to increase the r=
isk
for periods of heavy precipitation across southern coastal areas of Alaska
during the first week of November.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Great Plai=
ns,
Corn Belt, Tennessee Valley, and Central to Southern Appalachians, Tue-Fri,
Nov
2-5.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the central and
eastern U.S., Tue-Mon, Nov 2-8.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation (rain and snow) for the Kenai Peninsula,
Prince William Sound, and coastal southeastern Alaska, Tue-Sat, Nov 2-6.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Kenai Peninsula,
Prince William Sound, and coastal southeastern Alaska, Tue-Sat, Nov 2-6.

FOR TUESDAY NOVEMBER 02 - MONDAY NOVEMBER 08: Ensemble means remain consist=
ent
that a high amplitude 500-hPa ridge results in  surface high pressure shift=
ing
south from Canada into the central and eastern U.S. early next week. Based =
on
the better forecast skill, the ECMWF reforecast tool is preferred and suppo=
rts
at least a moderate risk (40 percent chance of minimum temperatures in the
lowest 15th percentile) of much below normal temperatures (Nov 2 to 5) acro=
ss
much of the Great Plains, Corn Belt, Tennessee Valley, and Central to South=
ern
Appalachians. The eastern half of the Corn Belt has yet to have a freeze, b=
ut
the growing season is expected to end next week with subfreezing temperatur=
es
probable. On Nov 4 and 5, there is an increasing chance of the first freeze=
 of
the season to extend as far south as the Tennessee Valley and Southern
Applachians. A slight risk (20 percent chance of minimum temperatures in th=
e
lowest 15th percentile) of much below normal temperatures goes through the
entirety of week-2 based on the ECMWF reforecast tool.



Model solutions are in good agreement that a highly amplified 500-hPa troug=
h
extends south from the eastern Bering Sea to the North Pacific. The 7-day m=
ean
sea level pressure, centered on Nov 5, from the ensemble means show a
moderately strong low pressure system just south of the Alaska Peninsula wi=
th
enhanced onshore flow directed at southeastern Alaska. This surface pattern
along with precipitation tools support a slight risk of heavy precipitation
across the Kenai Peninsula, Prince William Sound, and parts of coastal
southeast Alaska from Nov 2 to 6. This slight risk area covers areas that t=
he
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict that 3-day precipitation amounts hav=
e
at
least a 20 percent chance of exceeding the 85th percentile. A slight risk o=
f
heavy snow is posted for the higher elevations of southeastern Alaska where
total snowfall amounts could total a few feet from Nov 2 to 6. Given the la=
ck
of support from the reforecast tool guidance and a majority of 6Z GFS ensem=
ble
members showing a surface low pressure of 978-hPa or higher, no wind hazard=
s
are posted for Alaska.



If anomalously strong surface high pressure becomes centered over the Great
Basin, then a Santa Ana wind event would likely occur across southern
California during early November. Although the Canadian model supports this
outcome, the GFS and ECMWF models depict surface high pressure remaining
generally to the east of the Continental Divide. Therefore, no wind hazard =
is
posted for southern California at this time. The East Coast will be closely
monitored for precipitation and wind hazards during week-2 as a continued
negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and a negatively-til=
ted
trough increase chances for strengthening low pressure systems near the Eas=
t
Coast.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 31 - NOV 04, 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain early in the period. As time
progresses, agreement among the models deteriorates. The ensemble means fro=
m
today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ECMWF, Canadian, and GEFS depict a pair o=
f anomalous troughs over
eastern Siberia and over the North Pacific off the coast of western North
America. An amplified pattern is depicted downstream across the higher
latitudes with ridges forecast over western Canada and south of Greenland,
while anomalous troughing is predicted from Hudson Bay southward to the Gre=
at
Lakes Region. Generally zonal flow is depicted across the southern tier of =
the
CONUS. As time progresses, a strong trough or closed mid-level low is forec=
ast
to develop near southwestern Alaska. In response, the ECMWF and Canadian
ensemble means maintain a moderately amplified flow pattern downstream with
ridging across the western CONUS and a trough across the East. In contrast =
the
0z GEFS depicts a split-flow over western North America, allowing for a tro=
ugh
to develop over the southwestern CONUS, undercutting the higher latitude ri=
dge
forecast over western Canada. As a result, the GEFS depicts less troughing
downstream over the eastern CONUS later in the period relative to the ECMWF
and
Canadian ensemble means. The deterministic runs of the GFS and ECMWF align
more
closely with the higher amplitude ECMWF and Canadian ensemble mean solution=
s.
Thus, the ECMWF/Canadian solutions were favored today in the manual 500-hPa
height blend.

With strong ridging forecast over western Canada, downstream troughing is
likely to usher in below normal temperatures from the Northern Plains, Uppe=
r
Mississippi Valley, and the western Great Lakes southward to the Southeast.
Above normal temperatures are favored for eastern New England to the east o=
f
the predicted mean trough axis. Above normal temperatures are likely for mo=
st
of Mainland Alaska and much of the Panhandle due to mild, southerly flow
expected ahead of mean surface low pressure expected near southwestern Alas=
ka.
Near to below normal temperatures are favored for the Aleutians behind the
predicted surface low.

An active pattern is likely for Alaska as strong, surface low pressure is
forecast near the Alaska Peninsula. Above normal precipitation is favored f=
or
most of the state extending southward to the extreme northwestern CONUS.
Surface high pressure is expected to dominate farther to the east, leading =
to
increased odds of below normal precipitation for most of the CONUS. However=

above normal precipitation is favored for parts of New England ahead of the
mean trough axis forecast over eastern North America.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions on a high=
ly amplified pattern early
in
the period, offset by large model differences later in the period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 02 - 08 2021

During the week-2 period, the ECMWF and Canadian ensemble means maintain a
fairly amplified pattern with anomalous troughing in the East and strong
ridging over western Canada and the northwest CONUS. In contrast, today=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
GEFS
ensemble means feature a split-flow pattern over western North America earl=
y
in
the period, leading to less amplification across the CONUS for week-2 as a
whole. These differences are highlighted in the deterministic GFS solutions=
,
which are having difficulty resolving the evolution of a potential cut-off =
low
within the forecast split-flow pattern. Agreement is better across Alaska,
where all ensemble means forecast a strong trough over western parts of the
state. The week-2 manual 500-hPa height blend favors the ECMWF and Canadian
solutions, which generally feature above normal heights across the western
CONUS and eastern Alaska, and below normal heights across the eastern CONUS
and
western Alaska.

The week-2 temperature pattern is similar to that forecast for the 6-10 day
period. Troughing forecast over the eastern CONUS favors below normal
temperatures for most of the eastern half of the country. The exception is
over
parts of New York and New England, where near to above normal temperatures =
are
favored ahead of the mean trough axis. Conversely, ridging predicted over
western North America leads to increased odds of above normal temperatures
across the western third of the CONUS. Above normal temperatures are the mo=
st
likely outcome for most of central and eastern Alaska, ahead of a trough
predicted near the west coast of the Mainland. Near to below normal
temperatures are favored for most of the western third of the Mainland, as
well
as the Aleutians, near and behind the predicted trough axis.

An active pattern is likely to persist for much of southern and eastern Ala=

precipitation. Below normal precipitation is slightly favored near and behi=

across the south-central CONUS. Above normal precipitation is also favored =

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Mon Oct 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST COLORADO
AND SOUTHWEST KANSAS INTO THE OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS PANHANDLES...

Latest Hi-res ensemble guidance has come into better agreement on
stronger winds and low RH developing behind a strong lee
trough/dryline across portions of the northern TX Panhandle
Day2/Tue. Here, forecast soundings suggest RH of 10-12% with winds
gusts of 25-35 mph will likely develop through the afternoon.
Short-hour fuels remain supportive for fire growth/spread,
suggesting widespread elevated and critical fire weather conditions
are possible.

Onto the Stacked Plains and the southern TX Panhandle, somewhat
higher RH suggests lower confidence in widespread critical
conditions. However, dry fuels and warm/windy conditions will likely
support elevated fire weather potential through the afternoon. The
rest of the outlook remains valid with minor adjustments for the
latest guidance. See the previous discussion for more information.

..Lyons/Weinman.. 10/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Mon Oct 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
A surface low will rapidly deepen across the central High Plains as
a highly amplified mid-level trough ejects into the central U.S.
tomorrow/Tuesday. A narrow but focused corridor of very dry and
windy conditions are expected behind a sharpening dryline across the
central and southern High Plains, where multiple preceding days of
dry conditions should have sufficiently cured fine fuels to support
grass-fire spread. 15-25 mph sustained southerly flow amid 15-20% RH
behind the dryline warranted the introduction of Elevated highlights
across much of the central into southern High Plains. In addition,
Critical highlights were introduced to parts of southeast Colorado,
southwest Kansas, and the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles, where the
latest guidance consensus depicts widespread sustained 20-25 mph
southerly winds. However, multiple guidance members suggest much of
west Texas to northeast Colorado/northwest Kansas may also
experience overlapping Critical winds/RH, and the current Critical
highlights may need to be expanded farther north and south pending
continued favorable trends and consistency among guidance members.

...Powerful autumn nor'easter to produce high winds and heavy rain
across parts of the Northeast and New England beginning early
Tuesday...

...System recently responsible for heavy rain and high elevation
snow across California to swing across the Intermountain West and
eventually spark severe thunderstorms throughout the
central/southern Plains Tuesday evening...

...Unsettled weather lingers over the Northwest and Northern
Rockies through at least Thursday...

A vibrant weather pattern impacting the Nation this week will
feature two separate storm systems, with each capable of producing
various weather hazards. In the East, a developing autumn
nor'easter is currently gaining strength off the Mid-Atlantic
coastline, while an approaching cold front nears the Appalachians.
A few scattered severe thunderstorms are capable between central
North Carolina and Virginia this evening as the aforementioned
cold front interacts with an abnormally warm and moist airmass
located across the Mid-Atlantic. As the cold front exits the East
Coast and an associated upper-level trough over the Great Lakes
turns negatively tilted, the low pressure system moving northward
near southern New England is forecast to rapidly strengthen. As a
result, widespread moderate to heavy rain is expected to blossom
over the Northeast and New England on Tuesday, which could produce
isolated instances of flash flooding. High northeasterly winds
will also be a concern as widespread gusts up to 50 mph can be
expected throughout the region, with higher winds along southern
New England and the immediate coastlines. The warm autumn
temperatures have resulted in many trees retaining leaves this
late into the season, which could lead to an increasing risk of
tree damage and power outages. Flash Flood and High Wind Watches
have been issued between Cape Cod and southern New Jersey. The
storm system is expected to slowly exit farther into the Atlantic
Ocean on Wednesday, with lingering showers and gusty winds
remaining along coastal regions.

The system responsible for the recent atmospheric river event to
impact California is slowly exiting the Golden State as the
associated cold front and upper-level trough pushes eastward.
Showers and high elevation snow is expected to swing through
southern California and the Great Basin tonight before reaching
the Central Rockies by Tuesday. By Tuesday afternoon and early
evening, a low pressure system is forecast to develop across the
central High Plains and will help surge the previously mentioned
cold front southeastward across the Southern Plains. This will
also aid in sparking a line of potentially severe thunderstorms
Tuesday night from Kansas to central Texas. Damaging wind gusts,
large hail, and isolated tornadoes are possible. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of
severe weather between central Kansas and north-central Texas in
order to highlight the concern. By Wednesday, the low pressure
system and threat of severe thunderstorms is forecast to shift
into southeast Texas and the central Gulf Coast region.

Elsewhere, continued vigorous flow off the Pacific Ocean in
conjunction with an approaching frontal system will help maintain
unsettled weather across the Northwest and Northern Rockies over
the next few days. Isolated instances of flooding are possible,
specifically along coastal regions of Washington and Oregon on
Wednesday.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Midwest/Southeast Thursday followed by the Mid-Atlantic and
the Northeast Friday and into the weekend...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An anomalously deep cyclone forecast to develop over the mid-South
will likely bring a period of active weather across the eastern
U.S. for the latter part of this week and into the weekend.  Model
guidance have generally shown good agreement on the large scale
evolution and track of this system, with some expected
uncertainties in its timing and details.  A general model
consensus appeared to work fine for this system by maintaining
good continuity with the previous forecasts.  This system may
threaten October low pressure records across parts of the
mid-Mississippi to Ohio Valley.

Over the Pacific Northwest, models are in good agreement to bring
a frontal wave onshore with the potential of heavy precipitation
especially across the higher terrain.  The GFS and GEFS tend to
push the associated upper-level shortwave and precipitation
farther south during the weekend than the rest of the model
guidance.  A gradual drying trend should follow as models are
indicating that a cold high pressure system will build over
western Canada and then extend southward into the northern
Plains/Rockies early next week behind the upper trough.
Elsewhere, models continue to indicate a possible southern stream
upper low approaching California next Sat-Mon but with quite a bit
of timing uncertainties.

The WPC medium range forecasts were composed using an even blend
of the the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS mean with a smaller
contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The biggest weather threat during the medium range period will be
the deep low pressure system working across the eastern third of
the U.S. later this week into next weekend, bringing widespread
moderate rain and areas of heavy rains.  An anomalous closed upper
low will slow frontal system progression and sustain moisture feed
from the Atlantic to allow rainfall to expand across the Ohio
Valley/Appalachians/Southeast later this week and then the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into next weekend.  Sustained moisture feed
interacting with favored orographic lift should focus a possible
flood/runoff threat for parts of the central Appalachians Thursday
to Friday and into parts of the Northwest during the weekend.

Out West, shortwave energy progressing towards the West Coast will
direct a plume of moisture to support another round of heavy
rain/mountain snows to mainly parts of the Pacific Northwest, but
also farther inland across the northern Rockies on Thursday into
Friday.  Conditions should finally dry out by next weekend though
as upper ridging builds over the region.

For temperatures, the Midwest/South to the East Coast should
remain near or more likely below normal through much of the period
underneath cloudy and unstable skies.  Humidity levels though
should allow overnight mins to be more above normal.  Behind this,
upper ridging shifting across the central U.S. will initially
bring a period of above normal temperatures (+10-15F+) into the
northern High Plains before the next shortwave moderates
temperatures back towards normal by the weekend.  By Sunday into
Monday, it appears that a Canadian high pressure system will bring
colder than normal readings down across the northern Rockies and
then into the northern and central Plains.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast Friday into Saturday...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An anomalously deep cyclone, capable of threatening October low
pressure records for some places in the Ohio Valley, will be
tracking into the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic by the start of the
medium range period on Friday. This will likely bring a period of
active weather across the eastern U.S. for the latter part of this
week and into the weekend.  Model guidance over the past few
cycles has generally shown good agreement on the large scale
evolution and track of this system, with some lingering
uncertainties in its timing and details. A general model consensus
continues to work well for this system and maintains good
continuity with the previous forecasts.

A frontal system will progress from the Pacific Northwest on
Friday, into the Central U.S. this weekend. The models have
recently come into better agreement with the associated
upper-level shortwave as it skirts the northern tier of the U.S.
and deepens over central Canada. A second shortwave dropping into
the Northern Rockies/Plains behind this one will reinforce the
cold frontal boundary driving it into the Midwest, Ohio Valley,
and south. There is generally good agreement on the large scale,
but enough uncertainties in timing and details to warrant more
support from the ensemble means in the WPC forecast by days 6-7.

Elsewhere, models continue to indicate a possible southern stream
upper low approaching California this weekend, with some lingering
uncertainties. This feature should weaken over the Great Basin as
the next trough slides eastward towards the West Coast early next
week. There is again plenty of uncertainties regarding timing and
details of the upper system and the associated surface front that
a trend towards the ensemble means is best for now (complimented
by the deterministic GFS and ECMWF).


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The biggest weather threat during the medium range period will be
the deep low pressure system working across the Eastern U.S. later
this week into next weekend, bringing widespread moderate to heavy
rain. By Friday, the heaviest rainfall should be impacting much of
the Mid-Atlantic and into the lower Great Lakes, lifting into the
Northeast by Saturday. A sustained Atlantic moisture feed ahead of
the surface front will likely focus a possible flood/runoff threat
across parts of these regions.

The front moving through the Northwest will continue organized
rainfall and mountain snows across parts of the northern
Rockies/Pacific Northwest on Friday, with conditions finally
beginning to dry out by next weekend as upper ridging builds
behind the departing trough. Moisture should sink southward this
weekend into the Great Basin to the central Plains, with some snow
possible during the colder overnight hours, even at the lower
elevations of the High Plains. Rainfall should begin expanding
along the front by early next week from parts of the southern
Plains into the Midwest and Ohio Valley.

For temperatures, much of the Southeast/Central Gulf region should
be as much as 10-15 degrees below normal underneath of the upper
low, but should trend back towards normal as the low lifts into
the Northeast. A period of above normal temperatures across the
Central U.S. to begin the period will be replaced by an expanding
area of below normal values by late this weekend and early next
week as surface high pressure filters into the region. Daytime
highs from the northern High Plains into the south-central Plains
and mid-Mississippi Valley could be 5 to 10 degrees below
climatological values for this time of year.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast Friday into Saturday...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An anomalously deep cyclone, capable of threatening October low
pressure records for some places in the Ohio Valley, will be
tracking into the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic by the start of the
medium range period on Friday. This will likely bring a period of
active weather across the eastern U.S. for the latter part of this
week and into the weekend.  Model guidance over the past few
cycles has generally shown good agreement on the large scale
evolution and track of this system, with some lingering
uncertainties in its timing and details. A general model consensus
continues to work well for this system and maintains good
continuity with the previous forecasts.

A frontal system will progress from the Pacific Northwest on
Friday, into the Central U.S. this weekend. The models have
recently come into better agreement with the associated
upper-level shortwave as it skirts the northern tier of the U.S.
and deepens over central Canada. A second shortwave dropping into
the Northern Rockies/Plains behind this one will reinforce the
cold frontal boundary driving it into the Midwest, Ohio Valley,
and south. There is generally good agreement on the large scale,
but enough uncertainties in timing and details to warrant more
support from the ensemble means in the WPC forecast by days 6-7.

Elsewhere, models continue to indicate a possible southern stream
upper low approaching California this weekend, with some lingering
uncertainties. This feature should weaken over the Great Basin as
the next trough slides eastward towards the West Coast early next
week. There is again plenty of uncertainties regarding timing and
details of the upper system and the associated surface front that
a trend towards the ensemble means is best for now (complimented
by the deterministic GFS and ECMWF).

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR EASTERN COLORADO
INTO FAR WESTERN KANSAS AND THE WESTERN OKLAHOMA/TEXAS PANHANDLES...

...Synopsis...
A surface low and associated sharpening dryline across the
central/southern High Plains will gradually progress eastward
through today as a high-amplitude mid-level trough impinges on the
Plains states. Behind the dryline, a narrow but potent corridor of
favorable wildfire-spread conditions is expected to develop during
the afternoon as the boundary layer mixes. Across the entire
central/southern High Plains, finer/grass-based fuels should have
sufficiently cured given multiple days of dry conditions to support
grass-fire spread.

Widespread 15-25 mph sustained southerly surface winds coinciding
with 15-20% RH is likely from far southwest Nebraska southward along
the KS/CO and TX/NM borders, to the international border, delineated
by Elevated highlights. The best chance for 20-25 mph sustained
southerly surface winds overlapping 15% RH (according to the latest
guidance consensus) continues to be far east Colorado/west Kansas
into the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles, where Critical highlights have
been maintained.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO
INTO FAR SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO AND WESTERN OKLAHOMA/TEXAS
PANHANDLES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR SOUTHERN TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
Through tomorrow/Wednesday, a well-defined mid-level trough will
move eastward in tandem with a surface low, with deep-layer, strong
northwesterly flow dominating the southern High Plains. Though a bit
cooler compared to previous days, dry continental air will
overspread the High Plains, where finer/grass-based fuels are
expected to remain receptive to wildfire-spread. The driest air is
expected to be constrained closer to the lee of the Rockies, with
15% RH straddling the Colorado/New Mexico/Texas border(s). East of
the Texas/New Mexico border, the latest guidance consensus depicts
widespread 15-20 mph sustained northwesterly winds. These
aforementioned conditions warrant the introduction of broad Elevated
highlights expanding from the southern High Plains into Deep South
Texas.

At the moment, two areas exist for the potential of more widespread
Critical conditions. The first is along the Texas/New Mexico border,
where some overlap of 20+ mph sustained northwesterly winds and 15%
RH may occur for a few hours during afternoon peak heating. The
second region is the more immediate post-cold frontal regime across
Deep South Texas, where 20-30 mph sustained northwesterly winds
overlapping 10-15% RH is expected.

...Nor'easter to generate heavy rain and strong winds across
Northeast through Wednesday...

...Deep system responsible for heavy rain across California to
emerge over the Plains today, potentially sparking severe weather
over the Central/Southern Plains...

...Wet pattern continues across the Pacific Northwest and Rockies
through midweek...

A pair of low pressure waves will consolidate into a single
Nor'easter off of the New Jersey coast today. This system will
batter much of the Northeast with high winds, scattered
thunderstorms and heavy rainfall until Wednesday evening when the
Nor'easter will move well enough offshore to end its impacts on
the Northeast. Rainfall totals are expected to be between 1-2
inches with isolated pockets receiving more than 2 inches by
Wednesday evening. Flash flooding is a concern for much of the
Northeast, but especially for northern New Jersey into southern
New England where a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in effect
today. The heavy rainfall can be treacherous as is, but the
addition of high winds due to a tightening pressure gradient north
of the system will mean compounding hazardous weather,
particularly for travel. Seasonal temperatures will return to the
East today as the associated cold front pushes offshore this
morning. Highs will be well below average over the Central
Appalachians and Ohio Valley today.

The system responsible for producing heavy rain across California
will deepen as it ejects out over the Central Plains today. Rain
and scattered thunderstorms will proliferate along this system's
surface fronts oriented meridionally across the Great Plains.
Severe thunderstorm activity is likely to develop out ahead of
what is expected to be a tight and well defined dew point
gradient/dry line extending from northwestern Kansas through
central Texas today. The main severe threat will come in the form
of strong wind gusts and some large hail associated with bowing
convective segments emanating from the dry line. There also exists
the potential for embedded tornadoes within these linear
convective systems. High temperatures will climb into the mid-80s
to low-90s within the warm sector of the system across much of the
Central/Southern Great Plains today before the arrival of the cold
front. Rain and thunderstorms are forecasted to spread into the
Mississippi Valley and Southeast through midweek. Rainfall totals
will generally remain between 1-2 inches for these areas with
locally higher amounts possible for parts of the Middle
Mississippi Valley by Thursday.

Meanwhile, a series of low pressure systems will continue this
seasonal wet pattern for the Pacific Northwest over the next
several days. Low elevation rain and high elevation heavy snow
will impact much of the coastal Pacific Northwest and Cascades
respectfully. A few inches of rain are likely for the low
elevations while 1-2 feet of snow is likely across much of the
highest peaks of the northern Cascades. Lighter snow amounts are
expected over much of the high Rocky Mountain peaks. High
temperatures will drop significantly today as high pressure builds
over the West on the backside of the severe weather system over
the Plains. Highs are expected to drop down to 15-25 degrees below
average for much of the Great Basin and California. Seasonal
temperatures will return to the West on Wednesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1042 AM CST Thu Dec 30 2021

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

Today's fire weather forecast remains on track, with only minor
modifications needed based on the latest ensemble model guidance.
Please see the previous discussion below for more information.

..Elliott.. 12/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0109 AM CST Thu Dec 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions appear probable again this
afternoon for the central to southern High Plains as breezy
downslope winds increase amid a dry air mass.  Early-morning
water-vapor imagery reveals generally broad southwesterly flow aloft
over the southern Rockies/southern High Plains. Gradual height rises
are noted in recent upper-air analyses, which are yielding somewhat
subdued surface pressure falls in the lee of the central/southern
Rockies. However, the southeastward progression of a weak
upper-level disturbance over the northern High Plains will help
strengthen low to mid-level pressure gradients, resulting in
increased downslope winds and lee troughing through the afternoon.

...Central High Plains...
Latest guidance continues to depict a swath of 15-25 mph winds from
east NM/west TX northward into southwest NE. Ensemble probabilities
highlight eastern CO as the most likely region to see sustained 20+
mph winds with gusts up to 30-35 mph likely (and locally stronger
gust possible closer to terrain features). Eastern CO already
features receptive fuels and dry conditions (dewpoints in the single
digits noted), but also very cold temperatures (single digits to low
teens as of early Thursday morning). Relative humidity reductions
this afternoon may depend on the strength of downslope effects and
diurnal heating under mostly clear skies. RH reductions into the
15-20% range appear likely and will support areas of elevated fire
weather conditions. Localized and transient critical conditions are
possible, though confidence in the coverage/duration of this threat
is low.

...Southern High Plains...
The fire weather threat becomes less certain with southward extent
into TX and OK. While sustained winds between 15-25 mph appear
likely, ensemble guidance continues to show low probabilities for
sub-20% RH (though drier pockets down to 15% are possible). However,
recent guidance continues to poorly assimilate upstream dewpoint
observations from eastern and southern NM with a slight moist bias
in model initialization. This may result in lower observed RH values
than currently anticipated. An additional complicating factor is
increasing high-level cloud cover through the day that may limit
peak heating. Regardless of these concerns with the RH forecast,
elevated conditions appear probable and will pose a fire weather
concern given the dry fuels in place. Further forecast refinement is
possible as details become more clear.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST December 30 2021

SYNOPSIS: Areas of mid-level low pressure are forecast to traverse the
contiguous U.S. during week-2, with the GEFS and ECMWF differing in the
evolution of the mid-level flow. While confidence is still high regarding a
significant cold air outbreak over the north-central lower-48 states early =
in
week-2, uncertainty increases toward the middle of the period. The anomalou=
s
cold is also forecast to extend back toward the Pacific Northwest and the
Alaska Panhandle. Increased precipitation chances (coastal rain and high
elevation snow) remain favored across the western lower-48 early in the
period,
but decrease thereafter as mid-level high pressure builds across the East
Pacific. Enhanced frontal activity at the start of week-2 may bring increas=
ed
potential for heavy precipitation (rain changing to snow) to parts of the
northeastern U.S.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Northern Plain=
s,
Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes, Fri, Jan 7.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Northern
Rockies, Northern and Central Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, =
and
western Great Lakes, Fri-Sat, Jan 7-8.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the northwestern
CONUS, Great plains, Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, and Great
Lakes,
Fri-Thu, Jan 7-13.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Grea=

FOR FRIDAY JANUARY 07 - THURSDAY JANUARY 13: Dynamical model guidance depic=
ts
a
progressive pattern during week-2, with increasing spread developing in the
GEFS and ECMWF solutions toward the middle of the period. There remains hig=
h
confidence regarding troughing and associated anomalously cold temperatures
expanding across the north-central CONUS early in the period. Both the GEFS
and
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 60% chance that minimum
temperatures
fall below the 15th climatological percentile across parts of the Northern
Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes, and uncalibrated
guidance from the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict minimum temperatures
dropping
below -10 deg F over parts of the region (below -20 deg F closer to the
Canadian border), supporting a high risk for much below normal temperatures=
 on
Jan 7. The moderate risk for much below normal temperatures is posted throu=
gh
Jan 8, and includes parts of the Northern and Central Plains, Upper and Mid=
dle
Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes, where both reforecast tools
indicate at least a 40% chance minimum temperatures drop below the 15th
climatological percentile. Subzero temperatures are increasingly likely ove=
r a
large portion of the Upper Midwest, with minimum negative temperature
anomalies
of at least -10 deg F indicated in the uncalibrated model ensemble means
across
the highlighted region. The ECMWF ensemble quickly lifts out the trough, wi=
th
a
trend toward higher positive mid-level height anomalies depicted across muc=
h
of
the central and eastern CONUS favoring a moderation in temperatures. Howeve=
r,
both models depict a renewed surge of cold air into the Midwest toward the
middle and later portion of the period, with the GEFS more robust with
troughing redeveloping over the central CONUS compared to the ECMWF ensembl=
e,
which is less amplified with this feature. To account for the model
uncertainty, a slight risk for much below normal temperatures is posted for
all
of week-2 across portions of the central CONUS extending back to the Pacifi=
c
Northwest, but is reduced in spatial coverage compared to yesterday. Some o=
f
the anomalous cold may shift toward the northeastern CONUS at the end of
week-2, but due to the uncertainty earlier in the period, the hazard is not
extended at this time.



Although the aforementioned troughing is forecast to be inland by the start=
 of
week-2, the orientation of the mid-level flow is predicted to be zonal acro=
ss
the West Coast of the CONUS, allowing a continuation of enhanced Pacific fl=
ow
and subsequent increased chances for rounds of heavy precipitation over the
Pacific Northwest and northern and central California. The GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation amou=
nts
exceeding 1.5 inches across parts of these areas, supporting a slight risk =
of
heavy precipitation for the region from Jan 7 to 9, with the highest potent=
ial
on day-8 (Jan 7) based on uncalibrated guidance. With anomalously cold air
favored to be in place, the predicted increase in moisture also supports a
slight risk of heavy snow over the Cascades, Sierra Nevadas, Great Basin, a=
nd
Northern and Central Rockies from Jan 7 to 9. Additionally, the GEFS and EC=
MWF
reforecast tools depict a broad region with at least a 20% chance of wind
speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25-mph across coastal portions of =
the
Pacific Northwest and northern California, supporting a slight risk of high
winds from Jan 7 to 9. By the middle of week-2 more ridging is forecast ove=
r
the Eastern Pacific, favoring a reduction in precipitation chances.



The evolving mid-level pattern with troughing shifting further east and
relatively colder air arriving across the north-central CONUS favors a cold
front to move across the Eastern Seaboard early in the period. The potentia=
l
for impactful weather has decreased compared to yesterday, and is ultimatel=
y
tied to the strength of the troughing upstream. The GEFS reforecast tool
continues to depict probabilities exceeding 20% for 3-day precipitation tot=
als
exceeding the 85th percentile along the East Coast, with the indication tha=
t
the system would be exiting on day-8 (Jan 7). The ECMWF ensemble is faster
with
this system and would push it out of the region prior to the start of the
period. Although the liquid equivalent totals are forecast to be low in ter=
ms
of hazards criteria, the increased potential for a transition to snow behin=
d
the front supports having a slight risk of heavy snow posted for Jan 7 acro=
ss
portions of the Northeast. Increased wind speeds are also possible behind t=
he
front, although hazards criteria are not anticipated to be reached.



Across Alaska, northerly mid-level flow on the backside of the trough axis
forecast over western North America favors below normal temperatures over m=
uch
of Alaska at the onset of week-2. Building mid-level heights over the Berin=
g
Sea and western Mainland Alaska favors a moderation in temperatures,
especially
in the GEFS, with the most anomalous cold being favored over the southeaste=
rn
Mainland and the Panhandle. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate
elevated probabilities for record low temperatures and negative anomalies
potentially exceeding -20 deg F. A high risk of much below normal temperatu=
res
is posted for the Alaska Panhandle for Jan 7 where the reforecast tools dep=
ict
at least a 60% chance minimum temperatures drop below the lowest 10th
climatological percentile. A moderate risk of much below normal temperature=
s
continues through Jan 8, and a broader slight risk remains designated from =
the
eastern Kenai Peninsula through the Alaska Panhandle through Jan 10.

..Elliott.. 12/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CST Thu Dec 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will decrease on Friday and into the weekend,
as a storm system brings increasing precipitation chances and cooler
temperatures to the High Plains where fuels have been dry. An
upper-level trough, currently off the southern CA coast, is forecast
to begin approaching the southern Rockies late Friday. Ahead of this
wave, lee troughing and downslope flow will support 15-25 mph winds
across much of the region. However, cloud cover and precipitation
chances will also spread eastward through the day, limiting the
potential for strong diurnal heating. Ensemble guidance currently
highlights east-central NM into western OK as a favorable corridor
for receiving measurable rainfall, which could further mitigate fire
weather concerns. Elevated conditions might evolve across southeast
CO where broken cloud cover can support stronger daytime heating and
20-25 mph winds are likely. Confidence in the coverage of sub-20% RH
is somewhat low and may be confined to the immediate lee of local
terrain features where downslope effects will be more prominent. Due
to this uncertainty, no risk areas are introduced, though trends
will continue to be monitored.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu December 30 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 05 - 09 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
predicting an amplified
500-hPa circulation pattern across the forecast domain. During the 6-10 day
period, strong ridging is forecast centered over Eastern Siberia, and a tro=
ugh
is forecast  downstream over the northern CONUS with below normal 500-hPa
heights extending from the Gulf of Alaska to the Great Lakes region. The
predicted trough over the CONUS has shifted to the east relative to
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
6-10 day manual blend. Anomalous ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomal=
ies
are predicted across the Southwest and over mush of the Atlantic Coast.

Increased probabilities of below normal temperatures are indicated over Ala=
ska
under enhanced northerly flow ahead of the predicted center of high pressur=
e.
A
trough over the western and north-central CONUS favors elevated probabiliti=
es
for below normal temperatures over parts of the Pacific Northwest and over
much
of the central CONUS. Although, the GEFS predicts more extensive below norm=
al
temperatures, extending into the Southern Plains, compared to the ECMWF
ensemble temperature forecasts. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the
Southwest and over the Atlantic Coast lead to increased chances of near to
above-normal temperatures from the Four Corners region, along the Rio Grand=
e
Valley and the Gulf Coast, and along the Atlantic Coast.

Mean northerly flow, associated with above normal 500-hPa heights, leads to
increased chances of below normal precipitation over most of the state of
Alaska, outside the Alaska Panhandle where near normal precipitation is
favored. The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of above
normal precipitation for much of the western CONUS extending to the norther=
n
Great Plains and Great Lakes region. Above normal precipitation is also
favored
over much of the eastern CONUS, ahead of the predicted trough. Near to belo=
w
normal precipitation is favored for the Southern Plains consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on most features of the longwave circulation pattern,
offset by some significant differences among the model temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 07 - 13 2022

The week-2 manual blend of model forecasts is generally similar to the 6-10
day
period forecast. Although, predicted 500-hPa height anomalies are
significantly
less amplified than in the 6-10 day period blend, as uncertainty among the
model forecasts increases. Ridging persists to the west of Alaska into the
week
2 period, with downstream troughing progressing slightly eastward in week 2
relative to the 6-10 day period forecasts.

Below normal temperatures are slightly favored for most of Alaska for week =
2,
under continued anomalous northerly flow. Below normal temperatures are
favored
along the northern tier of the CONUS, as well as for the Central and Upper
Mississippi Valley and much of the Midwest, under a predicted trough, altho=
ugh
uncertainty has increased among the model temperature tools. Near to above
normal temperatures are favored over most of the West in week 2, as mid-lev=
el
heights are predicted to rise during the period. Above normal temperatures =
are
expected to persist along the Gulf Coast in week 2, supported by the
temperature consolidation tool.

There is significant uncertainty in the precipitation forecast for week 2, =
as
the circulation pattern changes. Near to below normal precipitation is
slightly
favored for much of Mainland Alaska, under the predicted positive 500-hPa
height anomaly. Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for the
northwestern CONUS across the Northern Plains into the western Great Lakes
region, supported by dynamical model forecasts. Near to below normal
precipitation continues to be favored for the Southern Plains, supported by
the
precipitation consolidation tool. Near normal precipitation is indicated fo=
r
most of the eastern CONUS, where there is significant uncertainty among
precipitation tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
only fair model agreement on the circulation pattern for week 2, as well as
weak signals in the temperature and precipitation tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

...More heavy mountain snow to overtake much of the Intermountain
West to close out 2021; bitterly cold wind chills to stick around
in the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains; Slight Risk for
Excessive Rainfall in Southern California today...

...Record breaking Spring-like temperatures in the South to reach
the portions of the East Coast; Slight Risks for severe storms and
Excessive Rainfall on Friday...

...Both winter weather and severe weather possible to kick off the
new year this weekend...

The continental U.S. remains under the influence of prolonged
troughing in the Intermountain West and ridging in the Southeast.
The next weather-making system embedded within the large-scale
trough has pushed inland over the Pacific Northwest this
afternoon, which will focus another moderate-to-heavy snow chances
throughout much of the Intermountain West today and tomorrow as it
dives toward the Great Basin. Further south, a developing storm
system off the California coast will continue to usher Pacific
moisture into Southern California and the Southwest today and
Friday. Locally heavy rainfall rates supporting 1-2 inches of
rainfall could cause isolated to scattered flash flooding in
Southern California (Slight Risk today in the Los Angeles metro
area) and south-central Arizona (Marginal Risk for Excessive
Rainfall on Friday), while also ushering in a round of moisture
into the southern Rockies. This combined with the arrival of
another Arctic air-mass makes for another period of heavy mountain
snow Friday night. By Saturday morning, mountain ranges such as
the Cascades, Sawtooth, Wasatch, and both the central and southern
Rockies can expect 1 to 2 feet of snow with totals exceeding 3
feet in the highest elevations of Utah and Colorado. A myriad of
winter weather alerts; from Warnings and Watches to Advisories,
have been issued in these areas. Precipitation aside, another
injection of frigid Arctic air causes temperatures to plummet
throughout the West on Friday and into Saturday morning, with
sub-zero temperatures expected from the Upper Mississippi Valley
to the Northern Rockies. Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories remain
in effect for the far North Central U.S. through Saturday, with
more bitterly cold wind chills anticipated through New Year's
weekend.

Farther east on the warm side of the front, abnormally warm and
humid conditions will stick around in the Southeast with
considerably milder conditions spreading as far north as the
Northeast by New Year's Day. Numerous record warm lows and highs
are expected from the Gulf Coast to the northern Mid-Atlantic
through Saturday morning. Moreover, the troughing in the West and
the strong ridge of high pressure over the Southeast are working
together to funnel rich Gulf of Mexico moisture into the Mid-South
late Friday. A Slight Risk for severe weather and a Marginal Risk
of Excessive Rainfall over parts of the Southeast today, but the
next developing storm system in the Plains will set the stage for
another active day of severe weather from North Texas to the
southern Appalachians on Friday. Ample moisture and instability is
also present to support high rainfall rates, making flash flooding
a concern in the Middle Mississippi and Ohio/Tennessee River
Valleys. As a result, Slight Risks have been issued for both
severe storms and flash flooding in these regions on Friday, with
concerns for nocturnal severe weather and localized flooding.

As the storm system responsible for Friday's potential severe
weather and flash flooding event emerges into the South Central
U.S. Saturday morning, the New Year is forecast to start off in
wintry fashion as measurable snowfall and an icy wintry mix are
expected to paint a swath of widespread hazardous travel
conditions New Year's Day from the Central Plains to the Great
Lakes. Several inches of snowfall are likely with this impending
storm, with 6-8+ inches of snowfall possible within heavier
snowfall bands. All the while, significant mixed precipitation is
possible south of the heavy snow activity, leading to widespread
moderate potential winter storm impacts over the Central Plains
and Midwest per the WPC Winter Storm Severity Index. Meanwhile,
within the storm's warm sector, another busy day of severe weather
and Excessive Rainfall is likely in the Mid-South, with another
round of severe weather and Excessive Rainfall Slight Risks
hoisted from the Ohio/Tennessee River Valleys southwestward toward
ArkLaTex. Residents in these regions are encouraged check for the
latest forecasts from their local NWS offices and National Centers
as a plethora of weather hazards strike to kick off 2022.

...Heavy rain threat for the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic Sunday along
with snow/ice potential from the southern Appalachians to the
Northeast...
...Coastal heavy rain and mountain focusing heavy snow threat
Sunday-Thursday for the Northwest/northern California spreads to
the northern Great Basin/Rockies...
...Another Arctic Blast for the North-Central U.S.
Tuesday-Thursday with lead low snows into the Great Lakes and
interior Northeast...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Weather/Hazards
Highlights...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a
composite of reasonably well clustered guidance from the 06 UTC
GFS and 00 UTC ECMWF days 3/4 (Sunday/Monday) along with the 13
UTC NBM in a pattern with overall above normal predictability.
However, there are lingering model differences with the
timing/phasing of frontal waves over the Southeast/East and
subsequent coastal low potential in this period. This composite
develops a surface system seemingly most consistent with mean
upper trough ejection, albeit with less stream separation aloft
than the 00 UTC Canadian/UKMET and 12 UTC Canadian. WPC progs
develop a better defined inland system/coastal low than continuity
that acts to hold precipitation back into the Mid-Atlantic. A 12
UTC GFS/ECMWF/UKMET composite is in line with that solution.
Expect record breaking warmth to linger into Sunday in advance of
the starkly temperature contrasting front over the Southeast/East.

The main weather focus into next week turns to another Arctic
outbreak down through the north-central U.S. with lead low snows
and modest trailing front rains over the east-central states. The
pattern will also feature upstream a multi-day precipitation
episode for the Northwest and California with the threat of
coastal heavy rains and inland/mountain snows, with the snow
threat spreading into the northern Great Basin/Rockies with
dynamic/amplifying Pacific system energies/height falls and modest
moisture influx surges over the Pacific.  Model differences,
especially at the surface become increasingly problematic
Tuesday-Thursday despite a generally compatible larger scale
pattern evolution aloft. The WPC medium range product suite in
this period was instead mainly derived from a composite of
reasonably well clustered guidance from the 06 UTC GEFS mean and
00 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean that forged a solution near the middle
of the full envelope of model solutions. The main guidance trend
was to limit the southward extent of height falls and heavy
precipitation down into California compared to earlier runs and
that seems reasonable considering upstream Omega block orientation
over the northeast Pacific.

The continental U.S. remains under the influence of prolonged
troughing in the Intermountain West and ridging in the Southeast.
The combination of cold air aloft and Pacific moisture will focus
another moderate-to-heavy snow chances throughout much of the
Intermountain West as the system dives toward the Great Basin.
Further south, a developing storm system off the California coast
will continue to usher Pacific moisture into Southern California
and the Southwest Friday.  By Saturday morning, mountain ranges
such as the Cascades, Sawtooth, Wasatch, and both the central and
southern Rockies can expect 1 to 2 feet of snow with totals
exceeding 3 feet in the highest elevations of Utah and Colorado.
Another injection of frigid Arctic air causes temperatures to
plummet throughout the Plains on Friday and into Saturday morning,
with sub-zero temperatures expected from the Upper Mississippi
Valley to the Northern Rockies. Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories
remain in effect for the far North Central U.S. through Saturday.

Farther south and east on the warm side of the front, abnormally
warm and humid conditions will stick around in the Southeast with
considerably milder conditions spreading as far north as the
Northeast by New Year's Day. Numerous record highs are expected
from the Gulf Coast to the northern Mid-Atlantic through Saturday
morning, with some record warm low temperatures most likely in the
Southeast.  The troughing in the West and the strong ridge of high
pressure over the Southeast will funnel moisture into the
Mid-South late Friday.  The developing storm system in the Plains
will set the stage for another active day of severe weather from
North Texas to the southern Appalachians on Friday.  Ample
moisture and instability is also present to support high rainfall
rates, making flash flooding a concern in the Middle Mississippi
and Ohio/Tennessee River Valleys.  As a result, Slight Risks have
been issued for both severe storms and flash flooding in these
regions on Friday, with concerns for nocturnal severe weather and
localized flooding.

As the storm system responsible for Friday's potential severe
weather and flash flooding event emerges into the South Central
U.S. Saturday morning, the New Year is forecast to start off
wintry as measurable snowfall and an icy wintry mix are expected
to cause widespread hazardous travel conditions New Year's Day
from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes. Several inches of
snowfall are likely with this impending storm, with 6-8+ inches of
snowfall possible within heavier snowfall bands.  Significant
mixed precipitation is possible south of the heavy snow activity,
leading to widespread moderate potential winter storm impacts over
the Central Plains and Midwest per the WPC Winter Storm Severity
Index.  Within the storm's warm sector, another busy day of severe
weather and Excessive Rainfall is likely in the Mid-South, with
another round of severe weather and a moderate risk of Excessive
Rainfall from the Ohio/Tennessee River Valleys southwestward
toward ArkLaTex.  By Sunday, the progressive system shifts the
heavy rain and severe weather threat into the Southeast and
southern Appalachians.

...Coastal heavy rain and mountain focusing heavy snow threat from
northern California to Washington...
...Another arctic blast for the north-central U.S.
Tuesday-Thursday with snow likely for the Great Lakes and interior
Northeast...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A cold Canadian surface high will settle southward across much of
the central/eastern U.S. in the wake of the strong cold front that
will be exiting the East Coast for the beginning of the week.
Surface cyclogenesis ensues over the Northern Plains by Tuesday in
response to an amplifying upper trough, and another surge of
arctic air behind it.  Another low pressure system is on the
horizon to close out the week across the East Coast, and a
disturbance also takes aim at the Pacific Northwest around this
same time.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00z model guidance suite appears to be in above average
agreement on the synoptic scale with more differences noted in
mesoscale features regarding the low pressure systems expected to
affect the continental U.S.  Timing differences are more apparent
by Wednesday across the Midwest and Great Lakes region, with the
GFS slower and a bit more amplified with the trough, and the
CMC/UKMET slightly stronger with the southern stream shortwave
crossing Texas, although these differences are well within the
ensemble spread.  By the end of the week, the GFS is not as
amplified with the system near the East Coast compared to the
CMC/ECMWF, although their overall placement is similar with the
surface low.  There is still very good agreement on another cold
surface high settling southward across the Plains by Friday.

Taking these factors into account, the WPC forecast was primarily
based on a multi-deterministic model blend through early
Wednesday, and then ECMWF/GFS/some CMC with gradually increasing
use of the GEFS/ECENS for Thursday and Friday.

...Sensible Weather and Hazards...

Heavy coastal rain and heavy mountain snow is expected from
northern California to western Washington for early to middle part
of the week as a storm system moves inland across the Pacific
Northwest.  Unlike recent events, this storm is not currently
expected to produce heavy precipitation for central/southern
California.  The surface low over the north-central U.S. for
Tuesday-Wednesday will likely have a swath of light to moderate
snow, with some blowing/drifting snow as winds increase with the
arctic airmass moving into the region.  Depending on what happens
along the East Coast late in the week, moderate to locally heavy
rain and snow for the Appalachians may be something worth
monitoring.

In the temperature department, there will be a return to
seasonably cold conditions across much of the Deep South and the
East Coast after days of well above average temperatures and
humidity levels.  There is likely a brief moderation across the
Plains and Midwest states on Tuesday ahead of the next arctic
front, which will herald a return to frigid conditions across the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest by Wednesday and beyond, with
highs running a good 15-30 degrees below seasonal averages in many
cases.  This will equate to subzero high temperatures once again
across portions of northern Montana, North Dakota, and northern
Minnesota.  Wind chills will also reach hazardous levels for these
same areas.  Out West, readings are likely to be within 10 degrees
either side of average for most areas next week west of the
continental divide.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CST Fri Dec 31 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a strong trough will consolidate across the Four
Corners and southern Rockies through the day as a shortwave within
the subtropical stream merges with the advancing pacific wave. As
the trough ejects eastward, a lee low will develop supporting
widespread precipitation across the central US. Following the low, a
powerful arctic front will move south through the Plains ushering in
a frigid air mass and changing the northern half of the ongoing
precipitation to a wintry mix. Given the expected precipitation,
fire weather concerns are expected to decrease. The only exception
may be across far southeastern Colorado where downslope winds ahead
of the front may support locally elevated fire weather conditions
for a few hours. However, uncertainty remains large and no areas
will be included at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CST Fri Dec 31 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A deep and progressive trough is forecast to move across the
south-central CONUS through the forecast period on Day2/Sat. Strong
flow aloft along the back of the trough will overspread portions of
the southern Plains and southwest Texas ahead of a fast moving
surface low and Arctic front. Widespread precipitation, (some
wintry) is expected to be ongoing across the central and southern
Plains through much of the period. While dry and windy conditions
appear possible ahead of the front, considerable uncertainty exists
regarding available fuels and the resulting risk for sustained fire
weather conditions.

...Southwest Texas...
Strong/gusty westerly surface winds are forecast across portions of
southwest Texas ahead of the cold front with gusts of 20-30 mph
possible through the day. Uncertainty remains high regarding surface
conditions given widespread precipitation and cooler temperatures
associated with the advancing cold front. Hi-res ensemble guidance
suggests only localized pockets of near-critical humidity are
possible. In addition, fuel availability is questionable given the
potential for precipitation casting further doubt on any sustained
fire weather threat. Nonetheless, some potential for locally
elevated fire weather conditions will be possible given the strength
of the low-level wind field and locally receptive fuels.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Fri Aug 06 2021

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 08/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Fri Aug 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a shortwave trough is forecast to move across the
Great Basin and central Rockies through the forecast period. In
response to the trough passage, a surface low and cold front will
move east across the Rockies and into the Great Plains by this
evening. Gusty westerly winds and dry surface conditions in the wake
of the trough will support localized fire weather potential across
the Rockies and Great Basin.

...Western Slope central Rockies and the Central High Plains...
As a mid-level trough approaches from the eastern Great Basin,
southwesterly mid-level flow will begins to increase across the
central Rockies. A cold front will advect a drier airmass across
western Colorado and Wyoming as it progresses eastward through the
day. Hi-res guidance shows widespread surface humidity values below
15% from western Colorado through southern Wyoming and onto the High
Plains. Strong west/southwesterly flow behind the front will be
amplified by increasing mid-level momentum transfer and a deepening
lee low/trough. Surface winds of 15-25 mph with higher gusts appear
likely, supporting favorable meteorological conditions for fire
spread. However, fuels across the region remain mostly unperceptive
for widespread activity given abundant monsoon precipitation over
the last several weeks. As such, coverage of elevated and critical
fire weather conditions will likely remain local in nature and
confined the lower elevations where less precipitation has fallen
over the previous weeks.

...Dry Thunderstorms Central Rockies...
Despite decreasing moisture content, lift from the passing
trough/cold front and heating across the higher terrain should
result in scattered storm development by early afternoon. Model
soundings show well-mixed profiles favorable for dry lightning
strikes across much of the higher terrain of Colorado and Wyoming.
However, fuels in this region remain wetter than normal given recent
precipitation. While dry strikes are expected, fuels are general
unsupportive, and dry thunder probabilities will be withheld.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
151 PM EDT Fri Aug 06 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Aug 09 2021 - 12Z Fri Aug 13 2021

...Overview...
A typical August pattern is expected to evolve over the CONUS
during the middle of next week with building heights aloft to the
south of a persistent and strong low over central and
north-central Canada.  Outside of the Great Basin and Northwest,
daytime heating should lead to thunderstorms across the Southwest,
Midwest, Southeast, Great Lakes, and East due to ample moisture
availability.  Temperatures will be above average for much of the
country with some bouts of excessive heat likely.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
The guidance shows general agreement, with the biggest issues
related to how strong the trough mid-continent becomes and how far
west its axis ends up, with the 06z GFS uncharacteristically on
the west side of the guidance and the 00z Canadian showing a
closed mid-level center along the trough axis (which is prone to
forecasting stronger mid-level features).  Strengthening positive
500 hPa height anomalies near 140W and 60W between 50-55N latitude
support a broad trough somewhere in the middle.  A blend of the
available guidance sorts out this issue effectively.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
Rain is expected across AZ, the Midwest, Southeast, and East ahead
of the main frontal zone, with little overlap expected with severe
drought areas in the West and Northern Plains (which would broadly
worsen drought conditions).  Detail issues in the rainfall
forecast abound, particularly in the upper Midwest and around the
western and southern side of the Great Lakes concerning the
when/where of thunderstorm complexes early in the period.
Rainfall could be heavy at times.

Temperatures will be about 5-15F cooler than normal in the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies behind the lead cold front into
Monday with significant moderation thereafter; 5-15F warmer than
average anomalies reappear as soon as Wednesday which would be
sufficient for renewed excessive heat concerns. Ahead of this cold
front, temperatures will be 5-15F above normal over the Plains
Monday and Tuesday which expands/shifts to the Northeast Monday
through Friday, closer to the intensifying 500 hPa height anomaly
across eastern Canada. Heat and humidity combined will bring heat
indices into the low 100s for many.  With little relief expected
overnight, excessive heat is possible most notably in and around
Arkansas and also parts of the Mid-Atlantic later in the week,
particularly within urban areas.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
151 PM EDT Fri Aug 06 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Aug 09 2021 - 12Z Fri Aug 13 2021

...Overview...
A typical August pattern is expected to evolve over the CONUS
during the middle of next week with building heights aloft to the
south of a persistent and strong low over central and
north-central Canada.  Outside of the Great Basin and Northwest,
daytime heating should lead to thunderstorms across the Southwest,
Midwest, Southeast, Great Lakes, and East due to ample moisture
availability.  Temperatures will be above average for much of the
country with some bouts of excessive heat likely.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
The guidance shows general agreement, with the biggest issues
related to how strong the trough mid-continent becomes and how far
west its axis ends up, with the 06z GFS uncharacteristically on
the west side of the guidance and the 00z Canadian showing a
closed mid-level center along the trough axis (which is prone to
forecasting stronger mid-level features).  Strengthening positive
500 hPa height anomalies near 140W and 60W between 50-55N latitude
support a broad trough somewhere in the middle.  A blend of the
available guidance sorts out this issue effectively.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
Rain is expected across AZ, the Midwest, Southeast, and East ahead
of the main frontal zone, with little overlap expected with severe
drought areas in the West and Northern Plains (which would broadly
worsen drought conditions).  Detail issues in the rainfall
forecast abound, particularly in the upper Midwest and around the
western and southern side of the Great Lakes concerning the
when/where of thunderstorm complexes early in the period.
Rainfall could be heavy at times.

Temperatures will be about 5-15F cooler than normal in the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies behind the lead cold front into
Monday with significant moderation thereafter; 5-15F warmer than
average anomalies reappear as soon as Wednesday which would be
sufficient for renewed excessive heat concerns. Ahead of this cold
front, temperatures will be 5-15F above normal over the Plains
Monday and Tuesday which expands/shifts to the Northeast Monday
through Friday, closer to the intensifying 500 hPa height anomaly
across eastern Canada. Heat and humidity combined will bring heat
indices into the low 100s for many.  With little relief expected
overnight, excessive heat is possible most notably in and around
Arkansas and also parts of the Mid-Atlantic later in the week,
particularly within urban areas.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 06 2021

SYNOPSIS: An amplified pattern is forecast to develop across North America
late
in week-1, persisting into early week-2. Mid-level high pressure is predicted
over the East Pacific and western lower 48 states favoring elevated chances
for
excessive heat over some areas of the West. Mid-level high pressure is also
favored over the Northeast U.S., although this feature is forecast to weaken
with time as upstream troughing moves closer to the region. Increased moisture
flow along the South Coast of Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle may bring
episodes of wet weather to these regions, especially early in the period.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat across portions of the Pacific Northwest and
Intermountain region, Sat-Sun, Aug 14-15.

Slight risk of excessive heat across portions of the Pacific Northwest,
California, Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and the Northern High Plains
Sat-Mon, Aug 14-16.

Slight risk of excessive heat across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast, Sat-Sun, Aug 14-15.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of southeastern Mainland
Alaska and the northern Panhandle, Sat, Aug 14.

Flooding possible across portions of the southwest CONUS.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY AUGUST 09 - FRIDAY AUGUST 13:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!r6ZPX63LzLjncvu-KvrfIpnvOObxVfL_BPLvWJvAqibRpdGgyX6_wgTZSwFqlNiCDVKnPiOf$

FOR SATURDAY AUGUST 14 - FRIDAY AUGUST 20: There continues to be relatively
good agreement in the 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensemble means, which all
depict positive mid-level height anomalies over most of the CONUS early in
week-2, with the highest height anomalies (greater than +60 meters) indicated
over the northwestern and northeastern CONUS. Troughing forecast across
southeastern Canada is likely to result in a moderation of temperatures over
the Northeast CONUS, with the ECMWF ensemble depicting a higher amplitude
trough compared to the GEFS. Because of this, the ECMWF ensemble and its
corresponding reforecast tool decrease the probabilities of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th climatological percentile across much of the
Northeast. The GEFS is weaker with the trough and continues to depict positive
500-hPa height anomalies across the Northeast through day-10, with warmer
temperatures persisting longer over the Northeast compared to the ECMWF. As a
result of the upstream trough, southerly mid-level flow favors an anomalously
humid air mass across the region. This will lead to higher heat indices in
addition to above normal temperatures persisting into the overnight hours.
Although confidence is high regarding warm and muggy conditions over the
region, there is less certainty regarding if hazards thresholds will be
reached, especially across interior portions of the Northeast and New England
where enhanced cloud cover and precipitation may add a cooling effect. The
slight risk for excessive heat is continued across lower portions of the
Northeast and mid-Atlantic for Aug 14-15, as these areas are forecast to be
further displaced from the trough and still have an elevated potential (>20%)
for maximum temperatures in the 90s deg F based on both reforecast tools, and
heat indices around 105 deg F.



Todays models continue to depict ridging developing over the western CONUS
during week-1 and persisting into week-2, with the highest amplification seen
in the ECMWF and Canadian ensembles. A moderate risk for excessive heat is
posted across parts of the Intermountain West and Pacific Northwest for Aug 14
and 15, supported by both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools which both
depict
at least a 40% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
climatological
percentile over some of the highlighted areas. Additionally, the National
Blend
of Models indicates the potential for daily record high temperatures over
parts
of the moderate risk region during this period, with highs over 100 deg F
depicted in some of the interior valleys. The slight risk for excessive heat
continues through Aug 16 over parts of the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin,
California, Northern Rockies, and the Northern High Plains, where both
reforecast tools depict at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding
the 85th climatological percentile. This translates into elevated chances for
triple digit heat for the California Central Valley and mid to upper 90s deg F
for lower elevations of the Great Basin and Northern Rockies, and also
extending into the Northern High Plains. Some of this heat may build further
east over the Great Plains, but there continues to be a large discrepancy
between the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles, with the GEFS being about 10 deg F
warmer
than the ECMWF. However, even the GEFS is relatively cooler compared to
yesterday, depicting maximum temperatures in the upper 90s deg F, which would
not warrant a related heat hazard.



Due to the enhanced phase of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), there is an
increased potential for tropical cyclone activity in the East Pacific during
the period which could promote enhanced moisture and precipitation across
parts
of the Southwest. The National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring a
disturbance off the southern coast of Mexico, which is forecast to further
develop and track west to northwestward across the Eastern Pacific. Both the
deterministic GFS and ECMWF and their respective ensembles also indicate a
second disturbance developing behind it. Both of these systems have the
potential to bring moisture surges from the Gulf of California late in week-1
into early week-2 across portions of the Southwest, leading to areas of
convective rainfall and localized flash flooding. For this reason, a flooding
possible area is introduced across portions of the Southwest CONUS.



Deep troughing is forecast across the Bering Sea late in week-1 along with the
aforementioned ridging downstream over the East Pacific. This favors a tight
mid-level pressure gradient and increased southerly flow across Alaska, with
an
ongoing heavy precipitation threat continuing over the southeast Mainland
Coast
and extreme northern Alaska Panhandle at the start of week-2. A slight risk
for
heavy precipitation is highlighted across these areas on Aug 14 where
uncalibrated model ensemble means still depict upwards of a half inch of
precipitation in 24-hours. While this alone would not be too impressive in
terms of a hazard, higher totals are forecast in the days leading up to the
period. Therefore, any additional heavy precipitation will likely exacerbate
ongoing flooding impacts over the region. The trough is projected to weaken by
the middle of week-2 decreasing the chances for heavy precipitation.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri August 06 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 12 - 16 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement that a strong ridge will develop
south of Alaska during the 6-10 day period, with large positive height
anomalies depicted across the Alaska Panhandle and western half of the CONUS.
Upstream of this ridge, a trough is forecast, centered over western Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians. In the eastern U.S., ridging is forecast to persist
for much of the 6-10 day period, although a trough is predicted to move across
the Great Lakes Region by the end of the period. Models have trended towards
strengthening this trough over the past several days, but are in disagreement
on how long this trough will persist. This leads to increased uncertainty and
lower forecast probabilities over parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
Nevertheless, above normal 500-hPa heights are predicted for most of the CONUS
during the 6-10 day period.

Troughing, associated with negative height anomalies, is predicted across
nearly all of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, favoring below normal
temperatures in those areas. Farther south, the Panhandle is expected to be
under positive height anomalies, favoring above normal temperatures there.
Strong ridging centered near the west coast of the CONUS significantly
enhances
the likelihood of above normal temperatures for most of the western half of
the
CONUS. Despite the forecast trough developing near the Great Lakes Region,
positive height anomalies are forecast to persist across the Eastern U.S.,
increasing the chances of above normal temperatures for most of the eastern
CONUS.

East of the trough predicted near western Mainland Alaska, above normal
precipitation is favored for most of Alaska. The strong ridge near the western
U.S. is forecast to suppress storm system activity downstream, significantly
increasing the odds of below normal temperatures for the Northwest, northern
Great Basin and Rockies, and Northern Plains. Conditions are forecast to be
favorable for the monsoon for parts of the Southwest, enhancing chances of
above normal precipitation there. Predicted surface high pressure favors below
normal precipitation for parts of the Gulf Coast. A forecast frontal passage
favors above normal precipitation for parts of Texas and Oklahoma, east
through
the Ohio and Tennessee Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 60% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the dynamical models, offset slightly by some
inconsistencies between the tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 14 - 20 2021

By the week 2 period, the large-scale 500-hPa pattern is forecast to become
less amplified due to increased model spread. Models are in some disagreement
about how much troughing will persist from the Great Lakes Region, southward
to
the Southern Plains, especially among the latest few GFS deterministic runs.
However, given the trend in the models to strengthen this trough over the past
few days, its expected that enough troughing will occur to favor near to below
normal temperatures across parts of the Southern and Central Plains, and parts
of the Mississippi Valley. Elsewhere across the U.S., temperature forecast
probabilities are comparable to the 6-10 day period due to a very similar
500-hPa pattern. The precipitation probability forecast is also very similar
to
the 6-10 day period, except that the potential for another frontal passage
favors increased chances for near to above normal precipitation for the
Southeast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's
operational 0z GFS centered on Day 11, and 70% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the dynamical models across most of the domain, offset by
increased model spread over parts of the Eastern U.S.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0219 PM CDT Fri Aug 06 2021

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 08/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Fri Aug 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
As the shortwave trough across the High Plains continues eastward,
shortwave ridging is forecast to temporarily build over the Rockies.
A second shortwave trough is forecast to move onshore through the
day, overspreading the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies. Dry
and windy conditions may develop in the lee of the Cascades and
northern Rockies, supporting elevated fire weather conditions.

...Northern Rockies/Plains...
As mid-level flow increases ahead of the second shortwave across the
Pacific Northwest, surface flow will trend more westerly as surface
high pressure strengthens over the Great Basin. With downslope
trajectories expected, drying of the airmass is forecast across the
northern Rockies/Plains through the day. Bolstered by the increasing
mid-level flow ahead of the trough, westerly surface winds of 15-20
mph appear likely. Lingering clouds may somewhat limit diurnal RH
minimums, but surface humidity values below 25% will support
elevated fire weather conditions given dry fuels.

...Lee of the Cascades...
As westerly flow increases through the day, gap winds will likely
develop with some potential for stronger flow to spill into the
lower basins. Surface RH values are not forecast to be overly
supportive of fire weather potential given strong marine influences
and mid-level moisture. However, the presence of dry fuels and
strong flow suggests some potential for locally elevated fire
weather conditions through the afternoon.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
320 PM EDT Fri Aug 06 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Aug 09 2021 - 12Z Fri Aug 13 2021

...Overview...
A typical August pattern is expected to evolve over the CONUS
during the middle of next week with building heights aloft to the
south of a persistent and strong low over central and
north-central Canada.  Outside of the Great Basin and Northwest,
daytime heating should lead to thunderstorms across the Southwest,
Midwest, Southeast, Great Lakes, and East due to ample moisture
availability.  Temperatures will be above average for much of the
country with some bouts of excessive heat likely.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
The guidance shows general agreement, with the biggest issues
related to how strong the trough mid-continent becomes and how far
west its axis ends up, with the 06z GFS uncharacteristically on
the west side of the guidance and the 00z Canadian showing a
closed mid-level center along the trough axis (which is prone to
forecasting stronger mid-level features).  Strengthening positive
500 hPa height anomalies near 140W and 60W between 50-55N latitude
support a broad trough somewhere in the middle.  A blend of the
available guidance sorts out this issue effectively.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
Rain is expected across AZ, the Midwest, Southeast, and East ahead
of the main frontal zone, with little overlap expected with severe
drought areas in the West and Northern Plains (which would broadly
worsen drought conditions).  Detail issues in the rainfall
forecast abound, particularly in the upper Midwest and around the
western and southern side of the Great Lakes concerning the
when/where of thunderstorm complexes early in the period.
Rainfall could be heavy at times.

Temperatures will be about 5-15F cooler than normal in the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies behind the lead cold front into
Monday with significant moderation thereafter; 5-15F warmer than
average anomalies reappear as soon as Wednesday which would be
sufficient for renewed excessive heat concerns. Ahead of this cold
front, temperatures will be 5-15F above normal over the Plains
Monday and Tuesday which expands/shifts to the Northeast Monday
through Friday, closer to the intensifying 500 hPa height anomaly
across eastern Canada. Heat and humidity combined will bring heat
indices into the low 100s for many.  With little relief expected
overnight, excessive heat is possible most notably in and around
Arkansas and also parts of the Mid-Atlantic later in the week,
particularly within urban areas.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
320 PM EDT Fri Aug 06 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Aug 09 2021 - 12Z Fri Aug 13 2021

...Overview...
A typical August pattern is expected to evolve over the CONUS
during the middle of next week with building heights aloft to the
south of a persistent and strong low over central and
north-central Canada.  Outside of the Great Basin and Northwest,
daytime heating should lead to thunderstorms across the Southwest,
Midwest, Southeast, Great Lakes, and East due to ample moisture
availability.  Temperatures will be above average for much of the
country with some bouts of excessive heat likely.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
The guidance shows general agreement, with the biggest issues
related to how strong the trough mid-continent becomes and how far
west its axis ends up, with the 06z GFS uncharacteristically on
the west side of the guidance and the 00z Canadian showing a
closed mid-level center along the trough axis (which is prone to
forecasting stronger mid-level features).  Strengthening positive
500 hPa height anomalies near 140W and 60W between 50-55N latitude
support a broad trough somewhere in the middle.  A blend of the
available guidance sorts out this issue effectively.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
Rain is expected across AZ, the Midwest, Southeast, and East ahead
of the main frontal zone, with little overlap expected with severe
drought areas in the West and Northern Plains (which would broadly
worsen drought conditions).  Detail issues in the rainfall
forecast abound, particularly in the upper Midwest and around the
western and southern side of the Great Lakes concerning the
when/where of thunderstorm complexes early in the period.
Rainfall could be heavy at times.

Temperatures will be about 5-15F cooler than normal in the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies behind the lead cold front into
Monday with significant moderation thereafter; 5-15F warmer than
average anomalies reappear as soon as Wednesday which would be
sufficient for renewed excessive heat concerns. Ahead of this cold
front, temperatures will be 5-15F above normal over the Plains
Monday and Tuesday which expands/shifts to the Northeast Monday
through Friday, closer to the intensifying 500 hPa height anomaly
across eastern Canada. Heat and humidity combined will bring heat
indices into the low 100s for many.  With little relief expected
overnight, excessive heat is possible most notably in and around
Arkansas and also parts of the Mid-Atlantic later in the week,
particularly within urban areas.

...Heavy rainfall and the chance for flash flooding continues for
portions of the Southeast along a persistent frontal boundary...

...Heavy rainfall and severe storms expected from the
Northern/Central Plains to the Midwest today and Saturday...

...Hot in the High Plains, poor air quality due to wildfire smoke
continues in the Midwest and Intermountain West...


A persistent quasi-stationary frontal boundary continues to
meander across the Southeast today. An upper-level trough moving
across the Southeast, as well as waves of low pressure along the
boundary, will continue to promote showers and storms in the
vicinity of the boundary into Saturday. There is a Marginal Risk
(level 1 of 4) of excessive rainfall in effect through tomorrow
from the Big Bend of Florida northward through Georgia and into
the Carolinas.  As the western portion the stationary front begins
to dissipate and the upper-level trough moves east, the threat for
heavy rain will shift northeastward into the Carolinas and
southern Mid-Atlantic. A Slight Risk (level 2 of 4) of excessive
rainfall is in effect for portions of eastern North Carolina and
southeastern Virginia as widespread heavy rain totals between 1 to
2 inches, with locally higher amounts, may result in a few
instances of localized flooding.

A series of fronts as well as the next upper-level trough moving
east out of the Rockies will lead to the chance for heavy rain and
severe weather across the Northern Plains and the Midwest today
through Sunday. A Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall is in effect
for today for some instances of heavy rain through tomorrow
morning ahead of a cold front across the Great Lakes. The greater
threat for heavy rain and severe weather will begin further west
over the Northern High Plains as a low pressure system and
associated fronts moves east across the area this evening. The
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2 of 5)
for severe weather for portions of northeastern Wyoming, the Black
Hills of South Dakota, and northwestern Nebraska ahead of a cold
front moving east out of the Rockies. High winds should be the
main threat with these storms. The low pressure system will move
east across the Northern/Central Plains tomorrow morning. A warm
front lifting northward across the Upper Missouri and Mississippi
Valleys will help advect a moist, buoyant airmass northward across
the region. Numerous, organized showers and storms are expected to
develop along this warm front as well as ahead of the cold front
on Saturday. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in effect from
Saturday through Sunday morning for west-central Wisconsin, with a
broader Marginal Risk in effect from the Upper Mississippi Valley
southwestward into the Central Plains. Heavy rain totals of 1-2
inches, with locally higher amounts in the Slight Risk area, may
pose the risk for flooding. A Slight Risk remains in effect for
much of southern Wisconsin, eastern Iowa, and northwestern
Illinois on Sunday as any organized storms from the previous night
continue and new storms form across the region. In addition for
the threat for heavy rain, the Storm Prediction Center has issued
a Slight Risk for severe weather on Saturday for the threat of
hail, wind, and a couple of tornadoes.

Hot weather is expected to continue for the Southern and Central
High Plains on Saturday, with highs in the mid-upper 90s. The heat
will spread northward into the Northern High Plains on Saturday
with high temperatures in the low to mid-90s likely. Air quality
will remain an issue due to western wildfires across portions of
the Intermountain West and upper-Midwest. Elsewhere, much below
normal temperatures are expected in the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies behind the storm system currently moving across
the Rockies and a second storm system moving east from the
Pacific. High temperatures in the mid-70s will be common, with 60s
possible in the Northern Rockies. There will be a warming trend in
the Southeast as the persistent frontal system finally moves into
the Atlantic, with high temperatures into the low 90s likely by
Sunday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
148 AM EDT Sat Aug 07 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Aug 10 2021 - 12Z Sat Aug 14 2021

...Overview...
A typical August-like pattern is expected to evolve during the
medium range period with building heights aloft across much of the
western and southern CONUS. This will bring periods of excessive
heat to some as temperatures rise above normal. Frontal systems
should be confined to northern parts of the country as an upper
trough shifts east from the northern Plains Tuesday and settles
across the Great Lakes/Northeast by next weekend.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Compared to recent days, the guidance is showing better agreement
regarding the details of individual shortwaves moving through
within the broad northern stream trough. Run to run continuity has
improved the last couple of model cycles with some wobble in the
exact trough axis, though fairly typical at these time ranges. A
general blend of the deterministic solutions provides a good
starting point for the forecast. The only other thing to note is
some timing differences in troughing as it moves into the Gulf of
Alaska or far western Canada. The GFS and CMC are faster while the
ECMWF holds the energy farther west. A blend of the GFS and ECMWF
along with modest amounts of the more agreeable ensemble means
seems to sort this out. This overall approach also provides good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
Upper troughing and surface frontal systems should bring showers
and thunderstorms to portions of the Midwest/Upper Great Lakes
next week with rain chances moving into the Northeast as well by
late week and next weekend. Rain could be heavy at times in some
places, but detail issues results in plenty of uncertainty exactly
where and how impactful it may be. Across the Eastern U.S. into
the Deep South, daily scattered storm chances are likely within a
warm and moist environment. Monsoonal moisture is also expected to
result in diurnally driven rain and thunderstorms across parts of
the Southwest as well through much of the week.

Much of the country will be either near or above normal in terms
of temperatures through next week. Values 5-10 degrees, locally
higher, will shift eastward from the Central Plains/Midwest into
the Ohio Valley and the Northeast ahead of the main cold front.
Even though the temperature anomalies aren't all that impressive,
the combined heat and humidity could bring heat indices into the
low 100s for many. With little relief expected overnight,
excessive heat is possible most notably in and around Arkansas and
also parts of the Mid-Atlantic I-95 urban corridor. Out West,
temperatures will rise once again as strong upper ridging moves
in. By mid-week, expect daytime highs 10 to 15+ above normal,
especially for parts of the interior Northwest where daily high
temperature records could be challenged for a handful of locations.

general blend of the deterministic solutions provides a good
starting point for the forecast. The only other thing to note is
some timing differences in troughing as it moves into the Gulf of
Alaska or far western Canada. The GFS and CMC are faster while the
ECMWF holds the energy farther west. A blend of the GFS and ECMWF
along with modest amounts of the more agreeable ensemble means
seems to sort this out. This overall approach also provides good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
Upper troughing and surface frontal systems should bring showers
and thunderstorms to portions of the Midwest/Upper Great Lakes
next week with rain chances moving into the Northeast as well by
late week and next weekend. Rain could be heavy at times in some
places, but detail issues results in plenty of uncertainty exactly
where and how impactful it may be. Across the Eastern U.S. into
the Deep South, daily scattered storm chances are likely within a
warm and moist environment. Monsoonal moisture is also expected to
result in diurnally driven rain and thunderstorms across parts of
the Southwest as well through much of the week.

Much of the country will be either near or above normal in terms
of temperatures through next week. Values 5-10 degrees, locally
higher, will shift eastward from the Central Plains/Midwest into
the Ohio Valley and the Northeast ahead of the main cold front.
Even though the temperature anomalies aren't all that impressive,
the combined heat and humidity could bring heat indices into the
low 100s for many. With little relief expected overnight,
excessive heat is possible most notably in and around Arkansas and
also parts of the Mid-Atlantic I-95 urban corridor. Out West,
temperatures will rise once again as strong upper ridging moves
in. By mid-week, expect daytime highs 10 to 15+ above normal,
especially for parts of the interior Northwest where daily high
temperature records could be challenged for a handful of locations.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Sat Aug 07 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough over the central Rockies will eject eastward into
the central Plains while a second shortwave trough moves onshore
across the Pacific Northwest and southern Canada. At the surface, a
weak cold front will shift eastward with the trough, while a
secondary cold front moves south out of Canada into Montana. Ahead
of the front, strong westerly winds in the lee of the Cascades and
northern Rockies may support elevated fire weather conditions.

...Northern Rockies/Plains...
As the shortwave trough across the Pacific Northwest continues
eastward, increasing mid-level flow is forecast to overspread much
of Montana by early afternoon. Amplified surface momentum transfer
and a strengthening area of low pressure to the northwest should
support an increase in westerly surface winds to 15-25 mph by early
afternoon. Lift ahead of the trough will bring widespread mid and
high-level cloud cover which may serve to limit diurnal heating
somewhat. Despite this, the strong winds coincident with daily RH
minimums near 25% should support elevated fire weather conditions
given dry fuels across the northern Rockies and Plains.

...Cascade Gaps...
Westerly flow largely orthogonal to the Cascades ahead of the trough
should favor moderate gap winds and downsloping along much of the
range through the day. Modified by cloud cover and the maritime
airmass, surface RH values are not expected to be much below 35%.
However, strong winds greater than 20 mph may periodically spill
into the lower basins through the day supporting localized fire
weather concerns where pockets of lower humidity and dry fuels
exist.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CDT Sat Aug 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime with shortwave troughing over the
Pacific northwest will drive a strong cold front through much of the
northern Rockies/ High Plains Sunday. Strong northwesterly flow and
relatively dry surface conditions will support brief elevated fire
weather conditions along and ahead of the front from Montana into
the northern Great Basin.

...Northwestern Great Basin...
Westerly surface winds are expected through much of the day across
the northern Great Basin. On the fringes of high pressure farther
south, mid-level flow should increase ahead of the trough supporting
deep vertical mixing and drying. Widespread surface RH below 15% is
forecast to align with the corridor of enhanced winds supporting
elevated fire weather conditions across much of northern Nevada and
the Great Basin.

Later in the evening, the southern portion of the cold front across
the northern Rockies will begin to pass through the Great Basin and
Intermoutnain west. Winds along and behind the front should increase
substantially, with gusts near 30 mph possible. Surface RH should
rapidly recover behind the front limiting the potential for greater
sustained fire weather conditions. However, the strong and shifting
winds may briefly enhance the fire weather threat early in the
evening.

...Northern Rockies/Plains...
Ahead of the cold front moving southeast out of Canada and the
Pacific Northwest, surface winds are forecast to increase markedly
through the day across portions of southern Montana and northern
Wyoming. A dry airmass enhanced by downslope flow on the backside of
a stalled surface trough will support low surface RH near 20%. As
winds increase near the front where surface pressure gradients will
be maximized, west-northwest winds of 20-30 mph and higher gusts are
expected. The overlap of strong winds and dry conditions will
briefly increase the potential for fire weather conditions to
elevated and near critical levels. Uncertainty remains high on the
longevity of any sustained fire weather potential given the rapid
decline in favorable conditions behind the front. However, mostly
dry fuels and the presence of strong shifting winds suggests some
threat is possible. No areas will be delineated at this time given
the expected brief nature of sustained fire weather threats.
However, this will be reassessed in subsequent outlooks.

...Heavy downpours and severe storms expected from the
Northern/Central Plains to the Midwest today and Sunday...

...Heavy rainfall and the chance for flash flooding for portions
of the Southeast and Pacific Northwest this weekend...

...Hot in the Great Plains, poor air quality due to wildfire smoke
continues in the Midwest and Intermountain West...

An upper level disturbance is responsible for the development of a
frontal system in the northern Plains and Midwest that generates
strong-to-severe thunderstorms later today. Severe storms from the
TX/OK Panhandles to the Upper Mississippi Valley could produce
damaging wind gusts, large hail, and tornadoes. In addition to the
severe threat, flash flooding is also a concern this afternoon,
especially in northern Wisconsin where a Slight Risk for Excessive
Rainfall has been issued. By Sunday, the wave of low pressure
inches east across the Midwest, setting up the next round of
potentially severe storms from southern Wisconsin on south into
eastern Kansas. Portions of the Upper Mississippi Valley may also
contend with areas of flash flooding on Sunday. In total, anywhere
from 2 to 4 inches of rain in the hardest hit areas of the Midwest
is possible this weekend.

Two other areas expected to receive measurable rainfall this
weekend are the Northwest and Southeast. Starting with the latter,
a weakening frontal boundary with a wave of low pressure tracking
northeast along it will induce heavy showers and thunderstorms
from the southern VA/northern NC Piedmont to the Mid-Atlantic
coast. Some storms could be severe and/or cause areas of flash
flooding. In fact, a Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall remains in
place in these aforementioned areas as well as a Flash Flood Watch
through this evening. The wave of low pressure heads off the coast
by Sunday, making for a drier day on Sunday for all but those
along the northern Mid-Atlantic coast. In the Northwest, a potent
Pacific cold front ushers in wet and cooler conditions this
weekend. The cold front reaches the northern Rockies and High
Plains by Sunday with a threat for severe storms expected to take
shape the second half of the day.

Temperature-wise, above normal temperatures will be observed from
California and the Southwest to the central Plains and into New
England. Parts of the central and southern High Plains could
eclipse the century mark while hotter and more humid conditions
return to the Northeast. Saturday's coolest temperatures versus
normal will be focused in the Southeast and Pacific Northwest. The
Southeast begins to warm up on Sunday while the cold front in the
Northwest injects below normal temps into the interior Pacific
Northwest. The Plains will also heat up with highs ranging from
90-100 degrees up and down the Great Plains. Last but certainly
not least, thick wildfire smoke continues to cause poor air
quality levels in parts of the Intermountain West and Upper
Midwest. Elevated fire weather conditions have been issued for the
northern High Plains on Montana today and the northern Great Basin
on Sunday.

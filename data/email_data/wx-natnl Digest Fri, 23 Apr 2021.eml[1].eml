Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1056 AM CDT Thu Apr 22 2021

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHWEST INTO SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NORTH DAKOTA...

The primary change to the outlook is to shift the eastern edge of
the elevated/critical areas in the southern High Plains westward.
Morning observed soundings in the region indicate relatively moist
layer up to 1-1.5 km or so with an isothermal/slight temperature
inversion layer above that to near 2 km. These factors coupled with
the surface low's position generally remaining northwest of this
area for a majority of the day does not bode well for this region
deeply mixing and drying this afternoon. Nevertheless, perhaps up to
1-2 hours of near-critical to critical conditions are still possible
late this afternoon conditional on greater eastward progression of
the surface trough/dryline. As such, the westward shift was
relatively conservative.

Within the northern Plains, morning surface observations show
near-elevated to elevated conditions now occurring in southwestern
Minnesota. Given these trends, ensemble guidance, and EACC showing
dry fuels, it seems likely several hours of elevated conditions are
probable this afternoon and the elevated area has been expanded
southeastward. A weak mid-level shortwave trough/cloud cover is
evident on visible satellite in Nebraska/South Dakota. Timing this
feature suggests that cloud cover will not impact southwestern
Minnesota until very late in the afternoon, beyond peak heating.

..Wendt.. 04/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1153 PM CDT Wed Apr 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
...Southern High Plains...
Strong lee cyclogenesis is forecast in southeastern Colorado through
the day as a mid-level shortwave trough traverses the Rockies.
Moderate to strong mid-level southwesterly flow will accompany this
mid-level trough and overspread portions of the Southwest and
Southern Plains. Surface winds are expected to increase through the
day as the pressure gradient tightens. Deep mixing in excess of 3km
will help to transport some of the stronger mid-level flow to the
surface where relative humidity of 8 to 13 percent is forecast.

...Northern Plains...
Very dry and breezy conditions are expected in the northern Plains
this afternoon. Sustained winds are expected to be around 15 mph
across much of north Dakota and northwest Minnesota, but some
sustained winds may exceed 20 mph, especially across eastern North
Dakota. Forecast wind speeds are borderline for critical conditions,
but relative humidity is forecast to be between 10 and 15 percent
and this specific region has seen very little precipitation in the
past month with record low fuel moisture observed. Therefore, the
extreme dryness from fuels and relative humidity supports the need
for a critical delineation.

...Southeast Oregon into southwest Idaho and northern Nevada...
A mid-level shortwave trough will dig southeastward through the
Pacific Northwest today. Some surface cyclogenesis is expected in
the Columbia Basin and northern Great Basin. This will strengthen
the pressure gradient across Oregon. Surface winds will increase as
a result of the tightening pressure gradient. In addition, deep
mixing in excess of 3 km will transport stronger mid-level flow
downward and aid in strengthening northwesterly surface flow.
Critical meteorological conditions will likely be met across a large
portion of the elevated area, but fuels in this region are currently
only marginally dry. Therefore, no critical delineation has been
added.

...Mid Atlantic into the Carolinas...
Dry and breezy conditions are expected in the post frontal airmass
along the East Coast. However, the large-fire threat should be
mitigated as the strongest winds and lowest relative humidity are
expected in areas which received precipitation today with weaker
winds expected farther south across the Carolinas where fuels remain
more dry.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 22 2021

SYNOPSIS: In general, hazard risks over the U.S. seem more marginal today,
with
disparities in the model guidance and tools adding to uncertainty in the
week-2
outlook. A cold front moving across the Eastern Seaboard is likely to bring
enhanced precipitation across portions of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic by
the
start of week-2. Developing mid-level low pressure favors possible heavy
precipitation over parts of the Plains and the Mississippi Valley during the
middle of the outlook period.

HAZARDS

No hazards are depicted in today's outlook as odds are not anticipated to
reach
pre-defined criteria during the forecast period at this time.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY APRIL 25 - THURSDAY APRIL 29:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!sfMB_xzgpVb3iW96PDWRRXsEmVWI3_4zq6NmKphT4IIFGUZUSBIaBRL3q3R6uahFEajHOk1y$

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 30 - THURSDAY MAY 06: During early week-2, both the 0z GEFS
and 0z ECMWF ensemble mean 500-hPa height anomalies continue to feature a
shortwave trough traversing the eastern CONUS. Compared to previous ensemble
runs, the ECMWF is considerably weaker with this mid-level feature, as it is
predicted to deamplify over the southeastern U.S by early May. Farther west,
both models continue to feature an amplifying mid-level ridge over the East
Pacific allowing for the development of downstream anomalous troughing over
portions of the western and central CONUS later in the period. The GEFS
continues to be stronger than the ECMWF with this developing mid-level
feature,
while favoring an elevated potential for anomalous cold returning over
portions
of the Rockies and the Plains, as well as possible heavy precipitation mainly
over the Mississippi Valley tied to surface low development by the middle of
the outlook period. However, the ECMWF guidance has become less supportive of
this potential, which introduces added uncertainty in today's hazard outlook.



Surface low pressure remains forecast to track across the Great Lakes with a
large cold front extending into the Gulf of Mexico by the end of week-1. Based
on the ensemble mean precipitation totals from the GEFS and ECMWF, the highest
precipitation amounts are expected over the Mississippi Valley prior to the
start of week-2, although there is some support in the ECMWF reforecast tool
suggesting some heavy precipitation may persist into the start of the outlook
period. However, given the low probabilities for precipitation amounts
exceeding an inch on day 8 (Apr 30) in the 0z ECMWF ensemble, and little
signal
in the GEFS reforecast tool, the slight risk for heavy precipitation is
removed
from the outlook. As this frontal system tracks across the Eastern Seaboard,
below normal temperatures are likely to prevail from the Southern Plains to
the
Great Lakes early in the period, with the potential for minimum temperatures
falling below 40 degrees F over portions of the Midwest which may lead to
frost
over sensitive vegetation in the region. Farther south, increased wind speeds
are also possible, as reforecast tools maintain elevated probabilities for
sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile over the Southeast. However,
wind
speeds are not expected to exceed hazard thresholds and no wind-related
hazards
are issued.



By day 10 (May 2), the 0z and 6z GEFS continue to feature a broad area of
surface low pressure over the southern High Plains tied to the aforementioned
troughing aloft.  Since yesterday, the strength of this mean low pressure area
in the GEFS has lessened and ensemble mean precipitation amounts over the
south-central CONUS have also decreased.  While the GEFS reforecast tool
maintains at least a 20% chance that 3-day accumulations exceed the 85th
percentile and 1 inch over the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, this
signal
is now absent in the ECMWF reforecast tool where there is also a significant
reduction in probabilities for precipitation exceeding an inch over the region
in the raw ECMWF ensemble during the middle of the period. Given the drier
trend and disagreement in the reforecast tools, there is insufficient
confidence that precipitation amounts will exceed hazard thresholds, and the
slight risk area for heavy precipitation is omitted from the outlook. It is
important to note that any above-normal precipitation that occurs over the
Lower Mississippi Valley during week-2 is likely to worsen anomalously wet
antecedent conditions and may trigger localized flooding in the region.



Across western North America, anomalous mid-level ridging forecast is expected
to promote above-normal temperatures and below normal precipitation over much
of the West Coast and Alaska early in the period. There is agreement in the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicating elevated probabilities of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile from the Central California Valley
to the Desert Southwest, however these temperatures are not expected to
surpass
hazardous thresholds as temperatures exceeding 95 degrees F are likely to be
confined to the Sonoran Desert. In Alaska, the anomalously warm conditions
favored by the GEFS are likely to translate into maximum temperatures climbing
upwards of 40 and 50 degrees F over portions of the central and southern
Mainland during week-2. Such temperatures are likely to accelerate ice and
snow
melt during river ice break up season heading into early May.

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 25 2021 - 12Z Thu Apr 29 2021

...Heavy snow possible for the Sierra Nevada Sunday...

...Heavy rain threat for parts of the Southern Plains into the
South next week...

...Overview...

The dominant feature of the period will be an eastern Pacific/West
Coast upper trough that should make its way through the West
during the first part of next week and reach the central U.S. by
next Wednesday or so.  The low pressure/frontal system and broad
flow of moisture ahead of the trough will spread precipitation
over a large portion of the West, including appreciable to perhaps
significant snow in higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada.
Meaningful totals should also extend into the Great Basin and
Rockies.  Once the upper trough reaches far enough east, expect
southerly flow from the Gulf to strengthen and add moisture to an
unstable environment--leading to the potential for severe weather
and heavy rainfall from portions of the Southern Plains eastward.
The rest of the east-central U.S. may see somewhat less extreme
but still possibly significant rainfall.  Corresponding to
guidance differences for specifics of energy within the upper
trough and potential influence of upstream Pacific flow, there is
still a fair degree of uncertainty in the details of the rainfall
threat.  However confidence is higher in the general theme of a
heavy rainfall event.  This system will separate well above normal
temperatures to its east and chilly but slowly moderating readings
in its wake.  Meanwhile early in the period strengthening low
pressure will track from near the Mid-Atlantic coast into the
Canadian Maritimes and affect the Northeast into early next week.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The primary forecast consideration was to continue leaning slower
than most recent GFS runs for the main system of interest,
especially by the latter half of the period.  The 00Z GFS was
somewhat closer to existing consensus from the 00Z models and
00Z/06Z ensemble means so that run provided the modest GFS input
for the blend.  Trends over the past couple days have leaned
slower, and in fact the new 12Z CMC/UKMET close off a
slower/southward western upper low to extend this recent trend.
The 12Z ECMWF upper low over the West also wobbles southward by
late Tuesday but ultimately is not far from continuity the rest of
the way.  Guidance has been having difficulty in resolving the
specifics of upstream Pacific flow for multiple days, leading to
wide variance in when/how much shortwave energy and moisture may
reach the Northwest and having some influence on the
western-central U.S. system.  Latest trends from 12Z guidance
support a stronger ridge moving into the West.  A consensus
operational model blend with somewhat more ECMWF input early in
the period, followed by a transition to a model/mean mix tilting
more to recent ECMWF runs/00Z CMC/00Z ECMWF mean relative to the
06Z GEFS/00Z GFS represented preferences before arrival of 12Z
solutions.  The system affecting the Northeast early in the period
has trended a bit weaker/faster over recent days.  Among latest
guidance the 12Z CMC is the oddball in pulling the upper energy
and surface low well south of consensus.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system affecting the Northeast early in the period will wrap
around showers (some snow in higher elevations) on Sunday into
Monday. Some enhanced rainfall is possible over New England with
windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens and tracks into
the Canadian Maritimes.  Moderately below normal temperatures will
prevail immediately behind this system.

In the West, the incoming Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will likely push through California Sunday and the Great
Basin Monday.  This system will spread lower elevation
rain/mountain snow focused over southwestern Oregon down into
northern and central California, especially along the Sierra
Nevada. Moderate rain/snow will also fall across the Great Basin
and central Rockies with lowering snow levels behind the front.
Expect highest totals with this system to be over the Sierra
Nevada where over a foot of snow is possible.  Lesser amounts of
moisture should extend to the north and south of this corridor.
Also some leading precipitation may stream across the extreme
northern tier into the Upper Great Lakes, with a little snow
possibly included near the Canadian border.  Once the system moves
to the Plains by Tuesday or midweek, potential will increase for
severe weather (see SPC for details) and areas of heavy rainfall.
The best signal for highest rainfall totals currently exists
over/near Arkansas into the Lower Ohio Valley but a much broader
area from the Plains into Lower Mississippi Valley/Tennessee
Valley could see at least some heavy rainfall in this event.
There is good confidence in a significant rainfall event overall
but the details remain in question.

Ahead of the initial western system, an area of above normal
temperatures will progress from the central-southern Plains into
the East over the course of the period.  Warmest anomalies in the
plus 10-20F range should extend from the southern two-thirds of
the High Plains through the Midwest, Great Lakes/Ohio Valley, and
Northeast.  Some areas may approach or reach their warmest
readings so far this season.  Cooler air behind the western cold
front will likely bring high temperatures down to 10-20F below
normal over parts of the southern half of the West early next
week.  In modified form (with decreasing coverage of double-digit
anomalies) the cool air will reach the Plains by midweek or so.
The West Coast into western Great Basin should rebound to above
normal by next Thursday as an upper ridge builds in.  Expect parts
of the Northern Plains and vicinity to be on the chilly side into
Tuesday before warming to near or above normal by Wednesday or
Thursday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEASTERN ARIZONA INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Southwest...southern High Plains...
The forecast generally remains on track. The primary area of concern
for critical fire weather will be parts of the Trans-Pecos into the
South Plains as the mid-level winds will be stronger in these areas.
The Trans-Pecos has seen ERC values dip below normal, though 5-15%
RH and winds of 25-30 mph will tend to compensate. The overall
magnitude of critical conditions is somewhat uncertain in New
Mexico. An increase in mid-level moisture will likely lead to broad
areas of cumulus build-ups and isolated thunderstorms in the higher
terrain. How much this will affect lower elevation RH, where fuels
are more receptive, is not clear enough for a change in the
categorical forecast.

...Mid-Atlantic...southern New England...
With today's surface conditions reaching near-elevated to elevated
in some locations, there is some possibility that tomorrow will see
similar conditions, though likely with less cloud cover/higher
temperatures. There are fuels questions given rainfall on Wednesday.
At present, the greatest potential for sustained elevated conditions
is in portions of New Jersey where EACC shows relatively more
receptive fuels than nearby locations.

..Wendt.. 04/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1203 AM CDT Thu Apr 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Friday, a surface low is forecast to slowly drift from southeast
Colorado into the Texas Panhandle while slowly deepening. This will
tighten the pressure gradient and increase wind speeds across much
of the Southwest and southern Plains. The strongest winds are
forecast from northern Arizona across New Mexico and into Southwest
Texas where deep mixing is forecast to bring stronger mid-level flow
to the surface. Wind speeds in this region are expected to be 20 to
30 mph with relative humidity from 10 to 15 percent. Fuel dryness
will vary across the region with more moist fuels at higher
elevations. However, at least some fuels are cured sufficiently to
carry fire as seen by numerous smoke plumes observed on visible
satellite over the past week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu April 22 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 28 - MAY 02, 2021

Todays model solutions are in fair agreement on the overall 500-hPa flow
pattern across the forecast domain. Cyclonic flow is forecast across most of
the CONUS punctuated by a mean trough that is expected across Southern Plains
and lower Mississippi Valley. Ridging and above normal eights are predicted on
either side of this trough across the West Coast and Eastern Seaboard,
respectively. Weak 500-hPa flow is forecast across most of Alaska as a trough
forecast to the south of the Aleutians is expected to keep enhanced westerlies
mostly to the south of the state. A strong Western Pacific MJO event (Phase 7
in the Wheeler-Hendon classification) is currently ongoing, which is likely to
influence the overall pattern during the outlook period. A composite from past
strong (defined in this case as a MJO index amplitude greater than 1.0) Phase
7
MJO events this time of year generally correspond with troughing across the
Great Lakes and ridging over much of the western CONUS, which would represent
an eastward displacement of the overall features relative to the manual 500-
hPa
height blend. The manual height blend consists primarily of ensemble mean
solutions from the NCEP, ECMWF, and Canadian centers and was based on
considerations of recent skill.

Ridging forecast across the West Coast and Eastern Seaboard favors above
normal
temperatures across these regions. Above normal temperature probabilities are
reduced across the Central CONUS underneath predicted mean toughing. Near
normal temperatures are favored across this region due to conflicting signals
among dynamical and statistical tools. Below normal temperatures are favored
for southeastern Alaska due to dynamical guidance from the ECMWF ensembles,
analogs based on the manual blend, and below normal SSTs across parts of the
South Coast. Near to above normal temperatures are favored across much of
western Alaska consistent with calibrated dynamical model guidance.

Above normal precipitation is likely across much of the east-central CONUS
ahead of a mean trough forecast over the Plains. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored across most of the remainder of the CONUS underneath
predicted ridging and associated near to above normal heights. Drier than
normal conditions are likely across most of Alaska, as a trough predicted to
the south of the Aleutians is expected to steer the mean storm track mostly to
the south of the state. However, enhanced Pacific flow is possible for parts
of
the Southern Panhandle southward to the Pacific Northwest, where above normal
precipitation is slightly favored.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered on
Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
fair model agreement with some disagreement among the temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 30 - MAY 06, 2021

During the week-2 period, mean cyclonic 500-hPa flow is expected to persist
across most of the CONUS. The location of the associated trough axis is
forecast to shift westward relative to the 6-10 day period, to a mean position
across the west-central CONUS, and deamplify. Ridging and associated above
normal heights are forecast to persist across the Northeastern CONUS. Ridging
predicted over the West Coast during the 6-10 day period is generally forecast
to weaken and retrograde off the coast during week-2. Enhanced westerlies are
expected to remain mostly to the south of Alaska. As a result, weak 500-hPa
flow is expected to continue over most of the state.

Above normal temperatures are likely across the Eastern Seaboard, as above
normal heights are generally forecast to persist across the region. Above
normal temperature probabilities are forecast to weaken across most of the
western CONUS relative to the 6-10 day period as ridging is expected to
subside
and retrograde off the coast. The retrogression of this ridge may result in a
more northerly component of the mid-level flow over the Pacific Northwest,
slightly favoring below normal temperatures there. Enhanced below normal
temperature probabilities also extend northward to southeastern Alaska, due to
strong support from ECMWF dynamical model guidance. Near to above normal
temperatures are favored for the remainder of the state, due to support from
the GEFS and from MJO composites.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored across most of the CONUS,
underneath predicted mean cyclonic 500-hPa flow. However, below normal
precipitation is slightly favored for parts of northern New England, close to
a
predicted mean ridge axis. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for
the southwestern CONUS as the mean storm track is expected to remain to the
north of these areas and much of this region is climatologically dry this time
of year. Dry conditions are likely to persist across much of mainland Alaska,
as enhanced westerlies are expected to remain to the south of the region.
However, enhanced Pacific flow may clip the southern Panhandle, resulting in a
slight tilt toward above normal precipitation there. The predicted enhanced
Pacific flow also extends farther to the south, tilting the odds toward above
normal precipitation for parts of the Pacific Northwest

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 45% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Much below average, 1 out of 5,
due to conflicting dynamical model guidance across large portions of the
forecast domain.

...Another night of well below-normal temperatures is expected
across the eastern U.S., with freeze warnings and frost advisories
in place across much of the Ohio Valley and Mid Atlantic...

...A complex low pressure system will bring severe thunderstorms
and heavy rains to parts of the southern Plains and central Gulf
Coast states on Friday and the Southeast on Saturday...

...Critical fire weather conditions are expected to continue from
the Southwest into the southern High Plains on Friday...

The low pressure system responsible for bringing late April snows
to portions of the Ohio Valley and the Northeast will remain
centered over southeastern Canada, supporting additional windy
conditions and snow showers across the Northeast into Friday
morning.  Another night of unseasonably cold temperatures is
expected across much of the eastern U.S., with Freeze Warnings and
Frost Advisories in effect across a large portion of the Ohio
Valley and Mid-Atlantic States.  As high pressure over the region
begins to move offshore and winds turn to the south, temperatures
are expected to begin to climb closer to more seasonable norms
during the day on Friday.

Isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms are forecast to
develop from parts of the southern Plains into the lower
Mississippi Valley and the central Gulf Coast states on Friday
into Friday night.  These storms may become strong to severe, with
large hail, damaging winds, and isolated tornadoes possible.
Heavy rainfall and possible flooding is also a concern, especially
across northern and central Louisiana to central Alabama.  On
Saturday, showers and storms are expected to move east from the
Mississippi Valley into the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, and then
the eastern U.S.  Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are
expected across the Southeast on Saturday, with large hail,
damaging winds, and a few tornadoes expected.  Heavy rainfall will
also remain a threat, especially from Alabama and the Florida
Panhandle eastward across Georgia into South Carolina.

In stark contrast, the Southwest, southern Rockies and High Plains
will remain dry.  Gusty winds and low relative humidities have
prompted Red Flag Warnings on Thursday from southeastern Arizona
to the southern High Plains, including much of New Mexico.
Continued dry and windy conditions are expected to promote
additional critical fire weather conditions from northern Arizona
to the southern High Plains on Friday.

Lastly, a system moving into the northwestern U.S. is expected to
spread a combination of low elevation rains and mountain snows
from the Pacific Northwest and Northern California to the northern
Rockies and High Plains on Saturday.

...Heavy snow possible for the Sierra Nevada Sunday...

...Heavy rain threat for parts of the Southern Plains into the
South next week...

...Overview...

The dominant feature of the period will be an eastern Pacific/West
Coast upper trough that should make its way through the West
during the first part of next week and reach the central U.S. by
next Wednesday or so.  The low pressure/frontal system and broad
flow of moisture ahead of the trough will spread precipitation
over a large portion of the West, including appreciable to perhaps
significant snow in higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada.
Meaningful totals should also extend into the Great Basin and
Rockies.  Once the upper trough reaches far enough east, expect
southerly flow from the Gulf to strengthen and add moisture to an
unstable environment--leading to the potential for severe weather
and heavy rainfall from portions of the Southern Plains eastward.
The rest of the east-central U.S. may see somewhat less extreme
but still possibly significant rainfall.  Corresponding to
guidance differences for specifics of energy within the upper
trough and potential influence of upstream Pacific flow, there is
still a fair degree of uncertainty in the details of the rainfall
threat.  However confidence is higher in the general theme of a
heavy rainfall event.  This system will separate well above normal
temperatures to its east and chilly but slowly moderating readings
in its wake.  Meanwhile early in the period strengthening low
pressure will track from near the Mid-Atlantic coast into the
Canadian Maritimes and affect the Northeast into early next week.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The primary forecast consideration was to continue leaning slower
than most recent GFS runs for the main system of interest,
especially by the latter half of the period.  The 00Z GFS was
somewhat closer to existing consensus from the 00Z models and
00Z/06Z ensemble means so that run provided the modest GFS input
for the blend.  Trends over the past couple days have leaned
slower, and in fact the new 12Z CMC/UKMET close off a
slower/southward western upper low to extend this recent trend.
The 12Z ECMWF upper low over the West also wobbles southward by
late Tuesday but ultimately is not far from continuity the rest of
the way.  Guidance has been having difficulty in resolving the
specifics of upstream Pacific flow for multiple days, leading to
wide variance in when/how much shortwave energy and moisture may
reach the Northwest and having some influence on the
western-central U.S. system.  Latest trends from 12Z guidance
support a stronger ridge moving into the West.  A consensus
operational model blend with somewhat more ECMWF input early in
the period, followed by a transition to a model/mean mix tilting
more to recent ECMWF runs/00Z CMC/00Z ECMWF mean relative to the
06Z GEFS/00Z GFS represented preferences before arrival of 12Z
solutions.  The system affecting the Northeast early in the period
has trended a bit weaker/faster over recent days.  Among latest
guidance the 12Z CMC is the oddball in pulling the upper energy
and surface low well south of consensus.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system affecting the Northeast early in the period will wrap
around showers (some snow in higher elevations) on Sunday into
Monday. Some enhanced rainfall is possible over New England with
windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens and tracks into
the Canadian Maritimes.  Moderately below normal temperatures will
prevail immediately behind this system.

In the West, the incoming Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will likely push through California Sunday and the Great
Basin Monday.  This system will spread lower elevation
rain/mountain snow focused over southwestern Oregon down into
northern and central California, especially along the Sierra
Nevada. Moderate rain/snow will also fall across the Great Basin
and central Rockies with lowering snow levels behind the front.
Expect highest totals with this system to be over the Sierra
Nevada where over a foot of snow is possible.  Lesser amounts of
moisture should extend to the north and south of this corridor.
Also some leading precipitation may stream across the extreme
northern tier into the Upper Great Lakes, with a little snow
possibly included near the Canadian border.  Once the system moves
to the Plains by Tuesday or midweek, potential will increase for
severe weather (see SPC for details) and areas of heavy rainfall.
The best signal for highest rainfall totals currently exists
over/near Arkansas into the Lower Ohio Valley but a much broader
area from the Plains into Lower Mississippi Valley/Tennessee
Valley could see at least some heavy rainfall in this event.
There is good confidence in a significant rainfall event overall
but the details remain in question.

Ahead of the initial western system, an area of above normal
temperatures will progress from the central-southern Plains into
the East over the course of the period.  Warmest anomalies in the
plus 10-20F range should extend from the southern two-thirds of
the High Plains through the Midwest, Great Lakes/Ohio Valley, and
Northeast.  Some areas may approach or reach their warmest
readings so far this season.  Cooler air behind the western cold
front will likely bring high temperatures down to 10-20F below
normal over parts of the southern half of the West early next
week.  In modified form (with decreasing coverage of double-digit
anomalies) the cool air will reach the Plains by midweek or so.
The West Coast into western Great Basin should rebound to above
normal by next Thursday as an upper ridge builds in.  Expect parts
of the Northern Plains and vicinity to be on the chilly side into
Tuesday before warming to near or above normal by Wednesday or
Thursday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0119 AM CDT Fri Apr 23 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND
SOUTHWESTERN TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals an upper-level trough
translating eastward across northern Mexico towards the southern
High Plains. A lee trough currently in place along the High Plains
will consolidate through the day as the wave moves into the southern
Plains region. Strong westerly flow off the southern Rockies will
help mix a dryline eastward into west TX and introduce a broad swath
of dry and windy conditions across a region with dry fuels.
Additionally, lift and mid-level moisture associated with the main
upper-level trough will support the potential for a few dry
thunderstorms over portions of New Mexico.

...Southern High Plains and Four Corners...
Recent guidance continues to show a high probability for widespread
winds between 20-25 mph and relative humidity values in the single
digits to low teens in a post-dryline air mass across east NM and
west/southwest TX this afternoon. Mid-level winds will likely be
strongest over the Trans-Pecos region of southwest TX on the
southern/southwestern periphery of the main upper-level wave. Deep
boundary-layer mixing above 700 mb and a uni-directional wind
profile should facilitate efficient downward transport of 30-40 mph
winds by late afternoon.

Further to the northwest into central NM and northeast AZ, transient
and more localized critical conditions are possible. However,
scattered overnight precipitation (mainly across northeast AZ), as
well as lower confidence in mid-level wind support, have lowered
confidence in the potential for widespread/persistent critical
conditions.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Evening soundings across the Southwest show sufficient mid-level
moisture in place to support a few thunderstorms across central AZ
within the main upper-level trough. This moisture, along with cooler
temperatures aloft, are forecast to shift eastward into NM over the
next 24 hours. Despite very dry boundary-layer conditions, forecast
soundings suggest enough instability, along with weak synoptic lift
and localized orographic ascent, will be in place to support
isolated dry thunderstorms this afternoon over a region with dry
fuels.

...Heavy rain threat from parts of the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley into the Midwest next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The dominant feature of the period will be shortwave energy which
enters the Northwest U.S. Monday/day 3 and should amplify as it
makes its way eastward into the Upper Midwest/East Coast by late
next week. The models and ensembles show good agreement on the
overall large scale pattern in the medium range, but continue to
differ in timing and details, particularly later in the period.
The GFS continues to be the fastest to move the trough eastward,
but has trended slower its past few runs, which brings it closer
in line to the slower ECMWF/CMC/UKMET. The presence of a cut off
southern stream low over northern Mexico (now shown by the ECMWF
along with the CMC and UKMET) could be the difference in timing.
The northern stream energy shows good timing even as far out as
day 7, although the GFS is still an outlier with a much
stronger/closed low solution. One other feature of note is with a
closed low exiting the Northeast on Monday, with the UKMET the
quickest to lift it northward and the CMC continuing to be the
oddball in pulling the upper low well south/east of the remaining
guidance.

WPCs blend for this cycle favors a majority deterministic model
blend (leaning more towards the slower solutions for the main
trough) the first half of the period, gradually increasing the
ensemble mean contributions late period to account for normal
differences in the details. This approach fits well with previous
shift continuity.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system affecting the Northeast early in the period will wrap
around showers (some snow in higher elevations) into Monday across
northern New England. Windy conditions are also expected across
much of the Northeast as the low deepens and tracks into the
Canadian Maritimes.

The main system tracking into the West on Monday will spread lower
elevation rain/mountain snow through parts of the Great Basin and
Rockies Monday into Tuesday. Some leading precipitation may also
stream across extreme northern tier into the Upper Great Lakes.
Once the system reaches the Plains by midweek, leading moisture
flow out of the Gulf of Mexico and plenty of warmth will increase
potential for severe weather (see SPC for details on the severe
threat) and areas of heavy rainfall. Currently, the best signal
for highest rainfall totals exists from eastern TX/Lower
Mississippi Valley northward into the Midwest/Ohio Valley Tuesday
and Wednesday. Some moderate to locally heavy rainfall should also
spread into the East and Southern states later in the period ahead
of the cold front.

Ahead of this trough, an area of above normal temperatures will
progress from the central-southern Plains into the East over the
course of the period. Warmest anomalies in the plus 10-20F range
should extend from the southern two-thirds of the High Plains
through the Midwest, Great Lakes/Ohio Valley, and Northeast. Some
areas may approach or reach their warmest readings so far this
season. Cooler air behind the western cold front will likely bring
high temperatures down to 10-20F below normal over parts of the
southern half of the West early next week. In modified form (with
decreasing coverage of double-digit anomalies) the cool air will
reach the Plains by midweek or so. The West Coast into western
Great Basin should rebound to above normal by next Thursday as an
upper ridge builds in.  Expect parts of the Northern Plains and
vicinity to be on the chilly side into Tuesday before warming to
near or above normal by Wednesday or Thursday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Fri Apr 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level wave is forecast to strengthen off the CA/OR coast
early this weekend. An associated upper-level jet will begin to nose
into the Great Basin by Saturday afternoon, which should support a
broad region of modest surface pressure falls across the
inter-mountain West. As a result, increasing pressure-gradient winds
across a region with dry fuels will lead to heightened fire weather
concerns.

...Great Basin and Southwest...
Surface winds are forecast to increase to 15-25 mph across a broad
swath from the southern Great Basin into portions of eastern NM.
Limited moisture return in the wake of Friday's system will help
relative humidity values remain in the 10-15% range across much of
the region. Enhanced mid-level flow associated with the approaching
wave will generally remain on the southern periphery of the Great
Basin from southern NV into northern AZ/southern UT. Forecast
soundings suggest boundary-layer mixing may be sufficient to allow
for wind gusts up to 35 mph across this region, though cloud cover
could limit mixing potential and the coverage of stronger winds.
Ensemble guidance supports this idea to some degree with pockets of
higher probabilities for sustained 20+ mph winds within this
corridor. This suggests that while areas of critical conditions are
possible, widespread elevated conditions appear more likely at this
time. Further to the east across NM, modest lee troughing and poor
mid/upper-level wind support should yield only elevated conditions.

...There is an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Lower Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains on Friday...

...There is a slight risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southern Plains and the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys on
Friday...

...Critical fire weather conditions are expected to continue from
the

Southwest into the Southern High Plains on Friday...

Low pressure over the Southern Plains will move eastward to off
the Mid-Atlantic Coast by Sunday.  The system will produce severe
thunderstorms and heavy rain from the Southern Plains to the
Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic.  The SPC has issued an enhanced
risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Southern Plains on Friday into Saturday morning.  The main
hazards with these storms will be frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  There is an
added risk of a 10% or greater probability of two-inch or larger
hail over parts of central Texas and Oklahoma.  Additionally, the
WPC has issued a slight risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Southern Plains and the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys on
Friday into Saturday.  The thunderstorms will produce heavy rain
with scattered flash flood areas possible.  The most vulnerable
places will be urban areas, roads, and small streams.

A second front over the Upper Midwest will move eastward to the
Lower Great Lakes by Sunday.  The system will produce rain over
parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes into parts
of the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast through
Sunday.  The storm will also produce light snow over parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley and the Upper Great Lakes from Friday
evening into Sunday morning.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy and troughing will produce light
snow over parts of the Northern Rockies/Northern High Plains into
the Central Rockies on Friday that will end by Friday evening.
Furthermore, additional upper-level energy will move onshore over
the Pacific Northwest on Friday evening into Saturday.  The
developing front will move from the Northwest to the Northern High
Plains/Northern Rockies to the Great Basin and Southern California
by Sunday.  The system will produce rain and higher elevation
light snow over parts of the Northwest/Northern California to the
Northern Rockies/Great Basin starting overnight Friday into
Sunday.

The Southwest, Southern Rockies, and Southern High Plains will be
dry.  Gusty winds and low relative humidity have prompted the SPC
to issue an elevated/critical risk of fire weather from northern
Arizona/southeast Utah to the Southern High Plains, including much
of New Mexico and western Texas, on Friday.

to issue an elevated/critical risk of fire weather from northern
Arizona/southeast Utah to the Southern High Plains, including much
of New Mexico and western Texas, on Friday.

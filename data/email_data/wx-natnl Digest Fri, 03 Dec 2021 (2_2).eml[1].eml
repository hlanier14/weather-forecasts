...Record breaking warmth continues from the Southeast to the
Southern Plains today, with widespread above average temperatures
lingering throughout much of the Nation this weekend...

...Heavy snow to impact portions of the Northern Plains and Upper
Midwest beginning Saturday morning...

The tranquil, dry, and warm weather pattern in place over the last
few days is expected to remain over much of the Lower 48 today
before cooler and more active weather enters this weekend. A
potent ridge of high pressure will influence above average
temperatures for nearly the entire Nation over the next few days,
with the Northeast and Northwest being the only exceptions. A weak
cold front bisecting the eastern U.S. will allow for record
breaking warmth to be confined to the southern third of the
country to end the workweek. Highs into the 70s and low 80s will
be found throughout the Southeast, Lower Mississippi Valley,
Southern Plains, as well as the Southwest. Slightly cooler, but
still well above average temperatures are forecast to remain
across this region and extend into the Midwest this weekend. For
the Northeast, cold and blustery northwest winds will keep
temperatures below average for early December. As a result,
consistent lake effect snow showers are possible through Sunday
morning with some enhancement possible on Saturday as a low
pressure system passes just to the north. A few inches of snowfall
are most likely across the eastern U.P. of Michigan and the Tug
Hill Plateau of New York.

Meanwhile, more widespread and impactful winter weather is likely
throughout the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest to kick off the
first weekend of December. An impulse of upper level energy
entering the Northwest on Saturday combined with an arctic airmass
located just north of the U.S.-Canada border will allow for an
area of snowfall to develop over the Northern High Plains on
Saturday morning. Snow is also likely across the far Northern
Rockies and the Washington Cascades as moisture enters from the
Pacific. By Saturday night into Sunday morning, a developing area
of low pressure over central Montana is expected to move east with
the associated precipitation, leading to a swath of
moderate-to-heavy snow from northeast Montana to northern
Minnesota. Widespread snowfall amounts greater than 5 inches is
likely across the northern half of North Dakota, mainly north of
Interstate 94. This amount of snowfall and the potential for
periods of heavy snow may lead to difficult travel conditions.
Winter Storm Watches have been issued.

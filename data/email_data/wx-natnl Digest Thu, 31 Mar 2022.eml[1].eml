Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Wed Mar 30 2022

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MOST OF SOUTHERN TEXAS FROM THE
BIG BEND TO THE GULF OF MEXICO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE TX/OK PANHANDLES
INTO FAR WEST OKLAHOMA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE WESTERN APPALACHIANS INTO THE
OHIO VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
FLORIDA...

The Critical area over the TX/OK Panhandles was reduced in size
based on the latest visible satellite imagery, mosaic radar imagery,
and surface observations. While north-northwesterly surface winds
remain strong across this area, the cooling effects from ongoing
precipitation and cold advection will limit RH reductions. With that
said, low-end critical conditions remain possible where it rained
the least. Farther north, the Elevated area was expanded across
parts of western KS and eastern CO, where clear skies will support
20 percent RH reductions amid the strong north-northwesterly surface
winds.

Elsewhere, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Weinman.. 03/30/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Wed Mar 30 2022/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough will move from South Texas to the
eastern Great Lakes during the day today. A very strong surface low
will deepen through the day as it moves from the Plains to the Great
Lakes. This surface low will lead to a significant surface pressure
gradient across much of the central and eastern CONUS and therefore,
winds will be very strong. A dry airmass will be in place in several
locations which will lead to fire weather concerns across broad
regions in the CONUS.

...South Texas...
Once the dryline/cold front move east of the Plains this morning, a
well-mixed airmass will remain across the southern Plains.
Therefore, with minimal surface heating, very strong winds from
aloft will start to transfer some of their momentum toward the
surface. Sustained surface winds of 20 to 25 mph are expected from
southern New Mexico to southeast Texas. Relative humidity will be
drier with southern extent with values less than 15 percent near the
Rio Grande and across far southern Texas. Fuels are very dry across
the region with near-record ERCs across much of South Texas. The
northern edge of the critical/elevated delineation attempts to track
the southern extent of significant precipitation from overnight
convection. There is still uncertainty with the southern extent of
the wetting rains, which may necessitate shifts in the northern
fringe of the threat during the outlook update late this morning.

Local extremely critical conditions cannot be ruled out across parts
of South Texas from Del Rio to west of Corpus Christi. This is the
region beneath the core of the mid-level jet where downward momentum
transfer should be the greatest. However, the threat appears too
localized/short lived to justify an extremely critical area.

...Far southeast Colorado southeastward to portions of North
Texas...
A mid-level shortwave trough, currently near the Montana/North
Dakota border, will move south through the day today. This will
overspread moderate mid-level flow across the southern High Plains.
A dry/well-mixed airmass will be in place in the wake of the
dryline/cold front. Therefore, some of this stronger mid-level flow
may reach the surface with winds of 15 to 25 mph expected and
relative humidity of 15 to 25 percent. Additionally, this overlaps
the region that had extremely critical fire weather conditions on
Tuesday with numerous large fires. Therefore, any ongoing fires
could start to run again today with a wind direction from the
northwest.

...Southeast into the Western Appalachians and the Ohio Valley...
Strong southerly flow will develop today across most of the eastern
CONUS as a surface low deepens and moves into the Great Lakes. This
southerly flow will bring Gulf moisture northward in the Mississippi
Valley and into the Lower Ohio Valley. However, farther east a
continental airmass remains in place, with trajectories keeping a
dry low-level airmass through the afternoon/evening. Therefore,
relative humidity of 25 to 35 percent is expected from southern
Georgia into the western Appalachians and southern Ohio Valley. The
airmass across eastern Kentucky and Tennessee will likely dry even
further due to downslope flow off the Appalachians. In addition,
terrain influences on the downslope side of the Appalachians will
bring very strong winds with wind gusts in excess of 80 mph in some
locations.

The region from eastern Tennessee to far southern Ohio will have the
greatest fire weather concern. This should result from additional
drying from the downslope flow, and relative humidity of 20 to 30
percent, combined with winds of 15 to 20 mph. ERC percentiles also
will be near record for this time of year. Therefore, a critical
delineation is warranted across this region where the worst
conditions are expected.

...Portions of central and South Florida...
Winds will be mostly parallel to the Peninsula across Florida today
which will allow for some inland drying and mixing. Expect winds of
15 to 20 mph for much of the Peninsula with relative humidity of 30
to 35 percent. ERC percentiles are high, particularly across south
Florida where values are near record for this time of year. Evidence
of this could be seen on visible satellite imagery Tuesday afternoon
as a large smoke plume was seen across south Florida.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 30 2022

SYNOPSIS: A storm system is forecast to move northeastward from the
Mississippi
Valley toward the Great Lakes and Northeast. While the threat of heavy
precipitation looks to be moving off the eastern seaboard early in the peri=
od,
surface high pressure descending from Canada in the wake of the surface low
increases the risk for much below normal temperatures mainly across the
southeastern lower 48, which may impact emerging spring vegetation. Strong
surface pressure gradients favored also increases the risk of high winds
across
the eastern CONUS associated with the departing surface low. Over the
north-central contiguous U.S., snow melt coupled with daytime high
temperatures
remaining near or above freezing throughout week-2 increases the risk of
flooding near the Red River along the Minnesota-North Dakota border. In
Alaska,
a potentially strong storm system in the Gulf of Alaska early in week-2 may
bring high winds to parts of the Panhandle.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for parts of the Great Plains=
,
Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and th=
e
Southeast, Fri-Sun, Apr 8-10.

Slight risk of much above-normal temperatures for parts of the Central
California Valley and the Desert Southwest, Thu-Sat, Apr 7-9.

Slight risk of high winds for the eastern half of the CONUS, Thu-Sat, Apr 7=
-9.

Slight risk of high winds for the Alaska Panhandle, Thu-Sat, Apr 7-9.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 02 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 06:

A-zxlXeUpjn$

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 07 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 13: At the beginning of week-2, the=
re
is good agreement among the ECMWF, GEFS and Canadian ensembles featuring
fairly
amplified ridging (troughing) across the western (eastern) CONUS. The favor=
ed
downstream troughing remains the focal point for hazard potential during th=
e
period, as ensemble guidance has become more robust with this feature over =
the
past few days.  At the surface, there is good run-to-run continuity with a
surface low and accompanying frontal system ahead of the mid-level trough a=
xis
tracking from the Great Lakes into southeastern Canada.  Behind the front,
surface high pressure descending from Canada and anomalously cold air remai=
ns
favored for many areas east of the Rockies early in the period. While the
coldest minimum temperatures are expected over the upper Midwest, reforecas=
t
tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below =
the
15th percentile and below 40 degrees F from the Southern Plains to the
southeastern CONUS, supporting the continuation of a slight risk of much be=
low
normal temperatures for the region (Apr 8-10). The continued potential for
frost and subfreezing temperatures may negatively impact susceptible spring
vegetation that is emerging across the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee
Valleys.



As the system tracks eastward, increased precipitation amounts are favored
along the frontal boundary. There is good agreement in the multi-model
uncalibrated precipitation guidance depicting the highest precipitation
amounts
occurring late in week-1 across the eastern CONUS, with decreased amounts b=
y
day 8 (Apr 7) suggestive of heavy precipitation potential timing off. This =
is
reflected in both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools, which no longer show
increased chances of 3-day amounts exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch
across the eastern U.S., prompting the removal of the corresponding slight
risk
of heavy precipitation in today's outlook. Given the cooler and drier
conditions favored in the wake of the system over the southeastern CONUS, t=
he
flooding possible area highlighted over portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley and the Southeast is also removed from the outlook. While there is s=
ome
potential for additional surface low development resulting in another perio=
d
of
increased precipitation over the southeastern CONUS late in week-2, dynamic=
al
models have been trending more towards a pattern change later in April, wit=
h
more anomalous ridging favored over the eastern CONUS to promote the
suppression of rainfall over the saturated region.  Upstream however, a
flooding possible hazard remains issued along the Red River of the north,
where
snow-melt is likely to continue due to above-freezing daytime high
temperatures
during week-2.



With models favoring more amplified mid-level troughing over the eastern
CONUS,
a slight risk of high winds remains issued for Apr 7-9 but is expanded
westward
in the Great Plains relative to yesterday's outlook. The expanded high wind
risk is supported by several deterministic solutions which show strong 850-=
hPa
northwesterly flow throughout the Mississippi Valley, as well as reforecast
tools which indicate at a broad region over the eastern with least a 20%
chance
of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile during and following the passa=
ge
of the system early in the period.



Across the western CONUS, the amplified mid-level ridging favored upstream =
is
expected to promote anomalously warm temperatures early in the period. The
GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools have become more bullish with this warm signal
compared to yesterday, indicating at least a 60% percent chance of maximum
daytime temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile.  Although actual daytim=
e
temperatures are not likely to exceed hazard thresholds, a slight risk of m=
uch
above-normal temperatures is issued for the California Valley and the Deser=
t
Southwest (Apr 7-9) in consideration of possible adverse ground impacts
associated with this warm signal. These include the potential for continued
rapid snowmelt across Sierra Nevada's (following the well above normal
temperatures observed over the region this past weekend), and the worsening=
 of
widespread drought conditions registered throughout the West Coast.



In Alaska, a slight risk of high winds remains posted for the Panhandle Apr
7-9, associated with the potential for a strong surface low pressure system
over the Gulf of Alaska early in the period. Reforecast tools indicate at
least
a 20 percent chance for wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile, with the
ECMWF reforecast tool indicating some locations having greater than a 40
percent chance of wind speeds exceeding this percentile threshold. The
orientation of the surface flow could also result in locally higher wind
speeds
(upwards of 40 mph) near coastal areas and in the channels, due to orograph=
ic
enhancement.

0148 PM CDT Wed Mar 30 2022

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

The forecast remains on track, and no changes were needed with this
update. For details, see the previous discussion below.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0207 AM CDT Wed Mar 30 2022/

...Synopsis...
High pressure will build across the Plains on Thursday which should
keep winds light and limit overall fire weather concerns. Windy
conditions will remain across the eastern CONUS as the surface low
moves east across eastern Canada. However, moist and/or cool
conditions will prevail, which will keep fire weather concerns
minimal. The only exception will be across portions of central and
southern Florida. A dry and well-mixed airmass is expected to
develop across the Peninsula with sustained winds around 15 mph and
relative humidity of 25 to 35 percent. For now, the stronger winds
are forecast to stay west of the drier low-level airmass, but if
these stronger winds overlap the drier surface conditions, a
critical delineation may be needed in later outlooks.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
256 PM EDT Wed Mar 30 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 2 2022 - 12Z Wed Apr 6 2022

...Heavy rain becoming more likely for portions of the
south-central U.S. next week...

19Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is initially in above
average agreement on the synoptic scale for this weekend, with the
GFS slightly more progressive with the shortwave trough over the
Midwest and Ohio Valley.  By Monday, the CMC becomes slower and a
bit more amplified with the building trough over the southwestern
U.S., whereas the GFS is slightly more progressive than the
ensemble means as this disturbance crosses the Gulf Coast region
by mid-week.  Additionally, consensus has improved with a well
developed closed upper low forming over the Upper Midwest by next
Wednesday as the overall pattern becomes more amplified.  In terms
of heavy rainfall prospects next week, there is an increasing
likelihood of heavy rain and strong storms from eastern Texas and
across the Deep South as favorable dynamics and instability
parameters are expected, with some 2-4 inch rainfall totals
possible.  The previous forecast discussion is appended below for
reference. /Hamrick

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a blend
of reasonably well clustered mid-larger scale guidance from the 18
UTC GFS/GEFS mean and the 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian/ECMWF
ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models days
3-7 (Sat-next Wed). However, embedded smaller scale system
differences and ample run to run continuity variances remain
problematic. Accordingly, blend weighting was transitioned from
primarily the models days 3-5 to the ensemble means days 6/7 to
mitigate less predictable forecast components amid steadily
growing forecast spread. Overall, WPC product continuity is best
maintained with this plan and the forecast seems in line with a
similar composite of newer 00 UTC guidance.

...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A closed upper trough and deepened surface low will work into the
Canadian maritimes by Saturday. Expect lingering high winds across
New England in the wake of the low. The southern portion of a
trailing western Atlantic cold front will slow over Florida, the
Gulf of Mexico and into Mexico. Scattered to widespread showers
are expected near the front, particularly across Florida and
possibly the Gulf coast Saturday.

Across the West, a leading series of upper troughs and low
pressure systems with modest precipitation potential are expected
track through with varying degrees of uncertainty through the
weekend. Infusion of highly energetic Pacific jet flow will then
up the ante and work increasingly inland from the Northwest to the
Rockies/Plains early-mid next week. This should act to transport
deeper moisture to fuel an emerging precipitation focus for some
heavier rains and mountain enhancing snows, mainly across the
Northwest.

Downstream progression and systems out from the West and
increasing northern stream phasing potential over time may combine
to support uncertain cyclogenesis/frontogenesis over the central
and eastern states next week. There is a growing guidance signal
for development of a building area of moderate to heavy rainfall
across the east-central U.S. and especially a more
unstable/convective South early-mid next week as deeper Gulf
moisture returns and interacts with the complex series of wavy
fronts and a stalled lead front.

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensembles are i=
n good agreement on the
predicted 500-hPa height pattern over North America during the 6-10 day
period.
A trough is predicted in all ensemble means over southwestern Alaska and th=
e
adjacent North Pacific, with a ridge downstream over the Pacific coast of t=
he
CONUS. The ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are more amplified i=
n
all of today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ensemble means relative to yesterd=
ay=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecasts. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
GEFS,
ECMWF and Canadian ensemble means depict a more amplified trough and negati=
ve
500-hPa height anomalies over the eastern CONUS. The manual blend of model
500-hPa heights favors negative height anomalies over Alaska, except for th=
e
far western Aleutians, positive height anomalies from the Pacific Coast to =
the
Rocky Mountains, negative height anomalies over most of the CONUS to the ea=
st
of the Rockies, and near average 500-hPa heights over most of the Eastern
Seaboard, with some positive height anomalies over the Northeast.

Near to below normal temperatures are favored for all of Alaska, under belo=
w
normal 500-hPa heights in the manual blend, with some differences among mod=
el
temperature tools. Near to below normal temperatures are favored for northe=
rn
areas of the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Rockies, supported by the
model
temperature consolidation. Above normal temperatures are favored for most
remaining areas of the western CONUS extending into western and southern
Texas,
as well as for the Northern Plains, under and ahead of the predicted ridge.
Above normal temperatures are also favored for the Eastern Seaboard,
consistent
with the model temperature consolidation. Below normal temperatures are
favored
for the Central Mississippi Valley, under a trough.

Probabilities of above normal precipitation are slightly enhanced for the
southeastern Alaska Mainland, with greater chances over the southern Alaska
Panhandle, ahead of the trough over the North Pacific. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored for most of the western CONUS from the Pacific coa=
st
to the Rockies, as well as for the southern Great Plains, under and ahead o=
f
the predicted ridge. Above normal precipitation is slightly favored from th=
e
Mississippi Valley eastward to the Atlantic coast, under  a trough and
supported by the model precipitation consolidation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model and tool agreement, offset by uncertainty associated with a
changing
pattern.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 07 - 13 2022

Dynamical model forecasts of the 500-hPa height pattern for week-2 are in o=
nly
fair agreement. Models indicate an evolution of the predicted circulation
pattern from the 6-10 day period, including increasing positive 500-hPa hei=
ght
anomalies over the Aleutians. The trough over the North Pacific deamplifies=
,
while a ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the western CONUS
weaken but expand further eastward into the Southern Plains in the week 2
period. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies persist over northern areas of th=
e
eastern CONUS in the week-2 manual blend.

Below normal temperatures continue to be favored over most of the Alaska
Mainland, except the southwest and Aleutians, under anomalously northerly
flow.
Below normal temperatures are favored for the Alaska Panhandle and parts of
the
Pacific Northwest, supported by the model temperature consolidation. Above
normal temperatures are favored across a large area of the West from
California
across the Great Basin and Southern Rockies, under a predicted ridge. Below
normal temperatures are favored for much of the eastern central CONUS, unde=
r a
trough and consistent with dynamical model temperature tools. Near to above
normal temperatures are favored for the Northeast and Eastern Seaboard,
consistent with model temperature forecasts.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored across much of the Alaska
interior, supported by model precipitation forecasts. As the circulation
becomes more zonal over the western CONUS, near to above normal precipitati=
on
is favored across the northern tier. Near to below normal precipitation is
favored over southern areas of the West and the Southern and Central Plains=
,
under weak positive 500-hPa height anomalies in the manual blend. Above nor=
mal
precipitation is favored for northern areas of the Great Lakes region, and =
the
Northeast, associated with a mean trough predicted over the region.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
fair agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by a changing patt=
ern
and increasing uncertainty in temperature and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall threat possible
through Friday morning...

...Heavy snow over the Upper Great Lakes and widespread
rain/freezing rain from parts of the Great Lakes to Central
Appalachians/Northern New England...

...Multiple areas with a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts
of the Southern Plains, Ohio/Tennessee Valley, and parts of the
Florida Peninsula today...

Very strong/severe thunderstorms are tracking through the
Lower/Mid-Mississippi Valley/Ohio and Tennessee Valleys today
ahead of an advancing cold front and are capable of producing
strong wind gusts, hail, heavy rainfall and possibly a few
tornadoes. SPC has highlighted much of the Deep South to south of
Lake Michigan as having up to a Moderate Risk for severe weather.
WPC has identified part of this same region as having a Slight
Risk for excessive rainfall and local flash flooding concerns;
particularly urban areas, roads, and small streams being the most
vulnerable. The area of thunderstorms will progress over the East
through Thursday, thus shifting the areas of concern for severe
weather and flooding over the eastern U.S. Although the rainfall
may be excessive for some locations, overall it will be beneficial
to those areas that have been very dry of late and have
elevated/critical risk for the spread of wildfires. Parts of the
Southern Plains, Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Florida have gusty
winds, low relative humidity, and dry fuels. The wetting rains
will reduce the risk to just Florida by Thursday.

Rain and snow over parts of the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi
Valley today will continue to progress to the east. An area of
light rain/freezing rain will develop over a wide area from the
Upper Great Lakes and parts of the Central Appalachians Wednesday
into Thursday morning. Snow and rain/freezing rain is expected to
continue over parts of northern New England into Thursday morning.
A multiple-day heavy snow event is forecast for northern Michigan
near Lake Superior and for parts of the Ohio Valley on Thursday.
The snow will slowly decrease over parts of the Northeast and
Central Appalachians.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1249 AM CDT Thu Mar 31 2022

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move from the Southeast into the
Northeast CONUS today. A strong surface low, currently in the Great
Lakes, will move into eastern Canada by this evening. The pressure
field from this surface low is expansive, and windy conditions are
expected across the entire eastern CONUS today. Most areas will be
plenty moist, which will limit fire weather concerns. However, some
dry conditions are expected across Florida with relative humidity in
the 30 to 40 percent range. In addition, sustained winds of 15 to 18
mph are expected in this same region. Therefore, there is an
elevated fire weather threat across portions of the central Florida
Peninsula this afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1257 AM CDT Thu Mar 31 2022

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
A weak mid-level trough will cross the central Rockies on Friday. As
a result, a compact lee cyclone will develop and move south along
the High Plains. This will lead to some dry and breezy conditions
from the OK/TX Panhandles southward into portions of West Texas. The
latest guidance shows some critical conditions, especially across
the Texas Panhandle. However, portions of this area are receiving
light rain and snow this morning. This may lead to some questionable
fuel dryness even with all day Thursday for fine fuels to cure.
Therefore, will wait to get a better handle on fuels status before
considering a critical delineation.

Additionally, thunderstorms are forecast to develop somewhere across
the central or eastern Texas Panhandle. These storms will likely be
on the drier side and could pose a threat for fire ignitions.
Considering the aforementioned fuel questions and the relatively
small region with the potential for dry thunderstorms, will not add
a delineation at this time.

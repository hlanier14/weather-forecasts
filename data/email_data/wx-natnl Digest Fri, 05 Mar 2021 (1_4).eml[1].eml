0946 AM CST Thu Mar 04 2021

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND MUCH OF
WEST TEXAS...

The ongoing forecast is on track.  Widespread critical conditions
remain likely along much of west Texas and eastern New Mexico west
of a sharpening surface trough expected to materialize later today.
A few showers have been noted across the Texas Panhandle this
morning with occasional lightning strikes, although these showers
are not expected to wet fuels enough to hinder the fire-weather
threat that should emerge this afternoon.

See the previous discussion below for more information.

..Cook.. 03/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CST Thu Mar 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected in portions of the
southern High Plains today.

...Southern High Plains...
A closed mid-level low will move eastward across the southern
Rockies today. Lee cyclogenesis is expected to begin in southeast
Colorado early today before the surface low shifts southeastward
into the Texas Panhandle by evening. As this pressure gradient
tightens, winds are expected to increase to 20 to 30 mph across much
of the southern High Plains. The strongest winds will be from
southeast New Mexico into the western Texas Panhandle and eastern
New Mexico where the pressure gradient will be strongest and where
strong mid-level flow amid deep mixing will transport stronger winds
to the surface. Some breezy southeasterly conditions are expected
across Oklahoma and Kansas, but higher relative humidity and fuel
moisture will mitigate the overall fire weather threat in these
areas.

...North Carolina...
Dry and breezy downslope flow is expected in the lee of the
Appalachians today. The strongest winds of 15 to 20 mph are expected
in North Carolina where relative humidity is also forecast to drop
to 18 to 20 percent. Similar downslope flow scenarios and
Wednesday's observed relative humidity suggests relative humidity
may be even lower than this forecast. However, despite these dry and
breezy conditions expected, fuels are still somewhat moist in the
region. Coordination with local NWS offices suggests another day or
two of drying may be sufficient to support large fire spread, but at
this time, fuels are not supportive and therefore, no elevated
delineation has been added.

1145 AM CST Thu Mar 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The ongoing forecast is on track and large-scale fire-weather
conditions will generally be limited.  See the previous discussion
below for more information.

..Cook.. 03/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CST Thu Mar 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
...Great Basin into the Northwest...
Some dry and breezy conditions are expected in portions of the
western Great Basin into eastern Oregon on Friday as strong
mid-level flow overspreads the region and the surface pressure
gradient strengthens. However, fuels in this area are still moist
and therefore, no fire weather delineation is warranted.

...Texas...
Breezy conditions are expected in the wake of a cold front across
Texas on Friday, but high relative humidity and cool temperatures
will preclude the fire weather threat for much of this region. There
will be a narrow area near the Rio Grande which may have elevated
fire weather concerns, but this area is too small and conditions are
too marginal at this time for an elevated area to be added.

...Carolinas...
Dry downslope flow is expected on Friday in the Carolinas. Low
relative humidity is expected and fuels will likely be more dry
after dry and breezy conditions on Thursday. However, winds are
currently forecast to be lighter on Friday than Thursday which
precludes fire weather concerns. However, this will be monitored and
if 15+ mph winds appear more likely, an elevated area could be
needed.

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 12 - THURSDAY MARCH 18: The 06z GEFS and 00z ECMWF are in
good
agreement regarding the mid-level troughing forecast to move into the weste=
rn
CONUS. Shortwave impulses are likely to propagate through the mean trough
axis,
enhancing precipitation chances (rain and high elevation snow) across porti=
ons
of the Pacific Northwest and California throughout the period. Exact timing
and
spatial coverage is uncertain, and the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools keep
probabilities under 20% in most places for 3-day precipitation exceeding th=
e
85th percentile. Therefore, no related precipitation hazards are depicted a=
t
this time.



The predicted trough over the western CONUS favors below normal temperature=
s
across the region. The GEFS reforecast tool has greater spatial coverage of
20%
or greater probabilities for minimum temperatures dropping below the 15th
percentile compared to the ECMWF reforecast tool. The ECMWF reforecast tool=
 is
confined to mostly California and the Southwest with these enhanced
probabilities, and only for the early part of the period.



The much below normal minimum temperatures hazard is valid for 3/12-3/14
coinciding with the elevated probabilities in the ECMWF reforecast tool.
Subfreezing overnight temperatures are favored across most of the highlight=
ed
area, with minimum temperatures over some of the mountainous regions possib=
ly
falling into the teens (deg F). Although slightly warmer temperatures are
forecast across the California Central Valley, patchy frost will be a conce=
rn
with overnight temperatures possibly dropping below 40 deg F.



This same trough axis is also forecast to result in one or more areas of
surface low pressure ejecting out of the Rockies during week-2. Impacts wil=
l
be
dependent on the exact track and strength of the lows, but increased chance=
s
of
heavy precipitation are forecast across portions of the Northern Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Tennessee Valley, and the Ohio Valley wher=
e
the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools both have consistently depicted at leas=
t a
20% chance that 3-day precipitation totals will exceed the 85th percentile.=
 A
slight risk for heavy precipitation is posted across these regions for all =
of
week-2.



Wintry precipitation is possible on the northwestern side of these systems,
with increased frontal convergence and rain favored in the warm sector to t=
he
southeast of the surface low tracks. River flooding is ongoing across porti=
ons
of the Ohio River Valley. Although dry conditions are generally forecast pr=
ior
to the start of week-2, river levels may remain elevated in some areas, and
any
additional precipitation during week-2 could bring some areas back above fl=
ood
stage. Therefore a flooding possible hazard is depicted across the region.



A transient pattern is forecast across Alaska, with zonal flow developing
across the state and troughing upstream over the Bering Sea. This favors
multiple surface low pressure systems to impact the Aleutians and Mainland
Alaska during week-2. Given that temperatures are also likely to average be=
low
normal, increased snowfall is also favored across southwestern Mainland
Alaska.
The surface lows crossing the Bering Sea are likely to increase the risk of
high winds along the coast of the southwestern Mainland and over the
Aleutians,
however, wind speeds are not forecast to reach hazards thresholds.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
153 PM EST Thu Mar 04 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 07 2021 - 12Z Thu Mar 11 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensembles this morning show decent agreement that
slow-moving upper troughing will dominate the western U.S. as
upper ridging builds across the Plains into the eastern U.S.
during the medium-range forecast period.  Much of the uncertainty
will be focused across the northern Plains as upper-level energy
is forecast to lift across the central Plains and then interact
with the northern stream by midweek, but the amount of model
spread is quite reasonable for a Day 6 and 7 forecast.

The feature of interest will be an amplified eastern Pacific mean
trough aloft that gradually makes its way into the western U.S.
from Sunday through most of next week.  This trough will support a
broad area of rain and higher elevation snow across the West along
with below normal temperatures.  Meanwhile by Tuesday-Wednesday, a
fairly vigorous shortwave expected to eject from the trough is
likely to produce a significant northern Plains storm system that
should spread a broad area of precipitation across the
central/east-central U.S.  Ahead of this evolution, an amplified
East Coast upper trough will depart after Sunday and eastern U.S.
heights will continue to rise through the period as ridging moves
in from the central U.S. and an upper high builds from Mexico into
the Gulf around midweek.

There is decent consensus for the overall evolution within the
East Pacific into western U.S. upper trough.  The most likely
scenario has an upper low drifting southward off the Pacific
Northwest while energy flowing around the western/southern side of
this low reaches the West by Tuesday and then continues
northeastward to provide the dynamic support for the midweek
Northern Plains storm.  The primary forecast challenges involve
the timing and evolution of the ejecting energy as well as the
overall amplitude of flow to the southeast--affecting specifics of
the surface system and how far southeastward the trailing front
extends.  Overall preference is to stay closest to the ensemble
means for timing later in the period, given reasonable continuity
thus far and intermediate position between faster GFS runs and
slower ECMWF runs.  The 00Z CMC offers a faster solution than the
GFS but its ensemble mean compares well with the GEFS and the EC
mean.  Meanwhile, energy from the upper low off the Northwest
should drop southeastward and possibly combine with upstream flow
to yield an upper trough that reaches near the Great
Basin/Southwest by day 7 Thursday.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived based on
multi-model consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z
GFS/GEFS with smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.
Beginning on Day 5, more of the 06Z GEFS together with the 00Z EC
mean were used to account for the increasing
forecast uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect a large portion of the West to see at least some
rain/higher elevation snow during the period.  Heavier
precipitation should extend from southwestern Oregon through
favored terrain in California, with highest amounts most likely
along the Sierra Nevada.  Meaningful though more moderate
precipitation is likely across the Interior West and Rockies.
Energy ejecting into the Plains should produce a fairly strong
storm system that tracks across northern tier locations Tuesday
onward, with a broad area of precipitation extending across the
northern/eastern Plains and into the east-central U.S.  Some
wintry weather may be possible over extreme northern locations
depending on exactly how the storm evolves.  Farther south there
may be locally moderate to heavy rainfall with the mid-Mississippi
Valley and lower Ohio Valley currently the most likely areas to
see highest rainfall totals.  Check future outlooks as the
system's details come into clearer focus.  Around the end of the
period and beyond, the cold front anchored by the surface low
could stall with continued Gulf inflow helping to add to the
rainfall potential.  There is currently enough spread to temper
confidence in this scenario somewhat but it requires monitoring.

Much above normal temperatures will persist over the northern
Plains/Midwest and expand into the Great Lakes through the first
part of next week with readings generally 10-25F above normal.
Daily records should be more numerous for warm lows than daytime
highs.  Development/progression of the northern Plains low
pressure system and trailing front Tuesday onward will finally
push this warmth more into the eastern half of the country by
mid-late week.  At that time, morning lows should remain as warm
as 15-25F above normal while highs will likely be somewhat less
extreme.  The West will see a cooling trend spreading across the
region from west to east during the period with highs tending to
drop to 5-10F or so below normal.  The East Coast states will
start out chilly with similar negative anomalies on Sunday
followed by a steady warming trend.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
153 PM EST Thu Mar 04 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 07 2021 - 12Z Thu Mar 11 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensembles this morning show decent agreement that
slow-moving upper troughing will dominate the western U.S. as
upper ridging builds across the Plains into the eastern U.S.
during the medium-range forecast period.  Much of the uncertainty
will be focused across the northern Plains as upper-level energy
is forecast to lift across the central Plains and then interact
with the northern stream by midweek, but the amount of model
spread is quite reasonable for a Day 6 and 7 forecast.

The feature of interest will be an amplified eastern Pacific mean
trough aloft that gradually makes its way into the western U.S.
from Sunday through most of next week.  This trough will support a
broad area of rain and higher elevation snow across the West along
with below normal temperatures.  Meanwhile by Tuesday-Wednesday, a
fairly vigorous shortwave expected to eject from the trough is
likely to produce a significant northern Plains storm system that
should spread a broad area of precipitation across the
central/east-central U.S.  Ahead of this evolution, an amplified
East Coast upper trough will depart after Sunday and eastern U.S.
heights will continue to rise through the period as ridging moves
in from the central U.S. and an upper high builds from Mexico into
the Gulf around midweek.

There is decent consensus for the overall evolution within the
East Pacific into western U.S. upper trough.  The most likely
scenario has an upper low drifting southward off the Pacific
Northwest while energy flowing around the western/southern side of
this low reaches the West by Tuesday and then continues
northeastward to provide the dynamic support for the midweek
Northern Plains storm.  The primary forecast challenges involve
the timing and evolution of the ejecting energy as well as the
overall amplitude of flow to the southeast--affecting specifics of
the surface system and how far southeastward the trailing front
extends.  Overall preference is to stay closest to the ensemble
means for timing later in the period, given reasonable continuity
thus far and intermediate position between faster GFS runs and
slower ECMWF runs.  The 00Z CMC offers a faster solution than the
GFS but its ensemble mean compares well with the GEFS and the EC
mean.  Meanwhile, energy from the upper low off the Northwest
should drop southeastward and possibly combine with upstream flow
to yield an upper trough that reaches near the Great
Basin/Southwest by day 7 Thursday.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived based on
multi-model consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z
GFS/GEFS with smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.
Beginning on Day 5, more of the 06Z GEFS together with the 00Z EC
mean were used to account for the increasing
forecast uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect a large portion of the West to see at least some
rain/higher elevation snow during the period.  Heavier
precipitation should extend from southwestern Oregon through
favored terrain in California, with highest amounts most likely
along the Sierra Nevada.  Meaningful though more moderate
precipitation is likely across the Interior West and Rockies.
Energy ejecting into the Plains should produce a fairly strong
storm system that tracks across northern tier locations Tuesday
onward, with a broad area of precipitation extending across the
northern/eastern Plains and into the east-central U.S.  Some
wintry weather may be possible over extreme northern locations
depending on exactly how the storm evolves.  Farther south there
may be locally moderate to heavy rainfall with the mid-Mississippi
Valley and lower Ohio Valley currently the most likely areas to
see highest rainfall totals.  Check future outlooks as the
system's details come into clearer focus.  Around the end of the
period and beyond, the cold front anchored by the surface low
could stall with continued Gulf inflow helping to add to the
rainfall potential.  There is currently enough spread to temper
confidence in this scenario somewhat but it requires monitoring.

Much above normal temperatures will persist over the northern
Plains/Midwest and expand into the Great Lakes through the first
part of next week with readings generally 10-25F above normal.
Daily records should be more numerous for warm lows than daytime
highs.  Development/progression of the northern Plains low
pressure system and trailing front Tuesday onward will finally
push this warmth more into the eastern half of the country by
mid-late week.  At that time, morning lows should remain as warm
as 15-25F above normal while highs will likely be somewhat less
extreme.  The West will see a cooling trend spreading across the
region from west to east during the period with highs tending to
drop to 5-10F or so below normal.  The East Coast states will
start out chilly with similar negative anomalies on Sunday
followed by a steady warming trend.

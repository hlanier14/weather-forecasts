Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Sun Sep 19 2021

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

...Southeastern Colorado...
An Elevated fire weather area was introduced across portions of
southeastern Colorado, where downsloping westerly surface winds of
15-20 mph (stronger gusts) are forecast to overlap minimum RH values
between 15-20% for several hours this afternoon. Locally critical
conditions are most likely where fuels are most receptive along/near
the I-25 corridor from Colorado Springs southward to the New Mexico
border (ERCs exceeding the 92nd percentile).

...California...
Elevated fire weather conditions are possible late tonight (e.g.,
around 2-5AM PDT Monday) across portions of the North Bay and the
coastal ranges of the Sacramento Valley as strong/gusty northerly
winds develop southward across the region. While parts of this area
did receive some beneficial rainfall yesterday into last night,
rainfall amounts were generally light, which suggests fuel
receptiveness should quickly rebound with the forecast gusty/dry
winds. Poor overnight RH recoveries coupled with RH values falling
through the overnight will likely yield a few hours of Elevated fire
weather conditions prior to sunrise. Locally critical conditions are
most likely at higher elevations where surface winds speeds will be
strongest. The fire weather threat is forecast to continue into Day
2/Monday morning across this area as RH values fall further. Please
see the Day 2/Monday fire weather forecast for more information.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
today's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 09/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1242 AM CDT Sun Sep 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning observations show a cold front gradually shifting
east/southeastward across the Pacific Northwest into the
inter-mountain West. This front, along with attendant clouds and
showers, will continue to overspread much of the West, minimizing
fire weather concerns in the process. Regional fire weather concerns
are probable across the central High Plains and southern Great
Basin, and more localized concerns are possible across parts of
California. However, the potential for widespread or robust fire
weather threats appears low.

...Eastern Wyoming...
A belt of stronger flow associated with the leading edge of an
upper-level trough will be positioned over the northern Rockies by
late afternoon. A combination of lee troughing and downslope
warming/drying will likely support areas of dry and breezy
conditions. Winds between 15-25 mph are likely with RH reductions
near 20% probable - though confidence in the coverage of ~20% RH is
somewhat low. However, fuels remain dry across the High Plains after
recent days of dry, windy weather, which should support at least a
low-end fire weather concern. Elevated conditions may evolve as far
south as eastern CO, but confidence in the wind/RH forecast is lower
for this region.

...Southern Great Basin...
Warm conditions and deep boundary-layer mixing are anticipated ahead
of the approaching cold front across southern NV into parts of
west/southwest UT. Relative humidity values in the teens to low 20s
are likely amid winds approaching 20 mph. Modest flow aloft will
limit the potential for stronger winds, and the passage of the front
may limit the duration of elevated conditions.

...California...
Localized elevated conditions are possible through California's
Central Valley this afternoon as northerly winds increase to 10-15
mph. Slightly above average dewpoint values are noted in upstream
observations across northern CA, which casts some uncertainty into
the coverage of sufficiently low RH. A few locations may see RH
reductions into the 20-30% range where stronger boundary-layer
mixing can occur. Elevated conditions appear more likely across the
southern Sierra where breezy downslope winds and 10-20% RH are
expected. However, these conditions will likely remain too localized
to warrant a broader risk area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1240 PM CDT Sun Sep 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Northern California...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are forecast to
already be ongoing across the coastal ranges of northern California
at the start of Day 2/Monday (i.e., 5 AM PDT). Fire weather
conditions should continue to worsen through the morning with
critical conditions quickly developing as sustained surface winds in
excess of 20 mph (gusts generally 20-35 mph) overlap RH values less
than 15%. Despite at least some beneficial rainfall yesterday into
last night, amounts remained rather light in many places, which
should allow fuels to quickly rebound -- especially with the
strong/dry low-level flow. While fire weather conditions may start
to improve by late afternoon as wind speeds decrease, at least
locally elevated fire weather conditions may return overnight due to
poor RH recoveries and increasing surface winds (especially at
higher elevations).

...Southern California...
Locally elevated fire weather conditions are expected over Los
Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties as dry/breezy offshore
winds and lowered RH values overspread the region. At this time,
fire weather conditions appear to be too spotty/brief for an
Elevated fire weather area.

...New Mexico...
Trends in latest high-resolution ensemble guidance as well as
updated fuel information suggest that the fire weather threat should
remain mostly localized Day 2/Sunday across northwest New Mexico.
Thus, the Elevated fire weather area was removed with this forecast
update. Nevertheless, a few hours of brief/spotty Elevated
conditions are still possible across the area during the afternoon.

..Elliott.. 09/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0134 AM CDT Sun Sep 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
A cold air intrusion into the western US and Great Plains will
continue to mitigate most fire weather concerns for Monday, though a
couple regional threats are possible across the Four Corners region
and northern California.

...New Mexico...
Although zonal mid/upper-level flow will remain in place over the CO
Rockies, a southward surging cold front along the High Plains will
likely result in modest lee pressure falls on Monday. However, this
may be sufficient to drive 15-20 mph pressure gradient winds across
northern NM and southern CO. Coincident RH reductions into the
15-25% range and unseasonably dry fuels may result in areas of
elevated fire weather concerns, though the coverage of these
conditions remains uncertain due to high spread in guidance.

...Northern California...
Building high pressure over the Pacific Northwest will augment
northerly winds through the northern Sacramento Valley Monday
afternoon. Dry air advecting into the region, coupled with downslope
affects, should yield RH values in the low teens to low 20s. With
dry fuels already in place (ERC values near the 90th percentile),
elevated fire weather conditions appear possible within the Valley.

...Widespread Heavy Rainfall/Runoff Threat from the Great
Lakes/Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Mid-Late Week...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

Guidance highlights a widespread heavy rainfall and runoff threat
with development of a closed upper low over the Ohio Valley and
Great Lakes region by Thursday that slowly lifts to the northeast
later week as an associated cold front underneath steadily tracks
across and offshore the East Coast. Upstream, another amplifying
upper trough and cold front is expected to dig southeastward from
western Canada into the north-central U.S./Midwest late week,
although not as strong and nearly as wet as the preceding system.
Meanwhile, modest upper trough digging down the West Coast and
back offshore California may focus lift/moisture to fuel local
showers mid-late week should be replaced by a warming upper ridge
to center over the Intermountain West into next weekend.

...Guidance and Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast spread has decreased days 3-5
(Wed-Fri), bolstering forecast confidence to above normal levels.
The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from
composite blend of reasonably well clustered guidance from the 00
UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian days 3-5 along with the 13 UTC National
Blend of Models (NBM). Uncertainty grows through next weekend, in
particular with the extent of amplification of an upper trough
slated to work into the north-central U.S./Midwest later week.
Model run to run continuity in this energetic northern stream flow
has been suspect, suggesting instead an ensemble forecast approach
with the generally compatible 06 UTC GEFS and 00 UTC ECMWF
ensemble means and the NBM. newer 12 UTC guidance is mixed, but
may overall offer better clustering with this stream. Out West,
the 06 UTC GFS offered a more outlier inland track of digging
upper trough energies that consensus over the West/Southwest, but
the 12 UTC GFS is now more in line with other models and ensembles
days 3-7.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The mid-later week weather pattern will be highlighted by a
gradually progressive heavy rainfall and local runoff episode from
the Great Lakes/OH Valley to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Wed-Fri as
fueled by pooling moisture/instability with a developing a closed
upper low. The system will be accompanied by a strong cold front
that will progress across the eastern U.S. that will also provide
some focus for more modest rainfall down across the Southeast. The
lead large surface high and upper ridge that will be across the
eastern U.S. early in the week will eventually give way to the
approaching trough and front, which will herald a pattern change
compared to the recent extension of summer-like heat and humidity.
Steady and amplified upstream upper trough progression through
western Canada still in guidance Wed/Thu would also be primed as a
kicker to dig into an unsettled/cooled north-central U.S./Midwest
later next week along with another associated frontal system, but
with much less precipitation potential with depleted moisture
availability in the wake of the main lead system. Best potential
may over vicinity of the Great Lakes under main trough
position/possible closed low. Meanwhile, upper trough energy set
to reach the Northwest midweek is set to dig southward and
re-emerge over the eastern Pacific off CA offshore. This system
offers modest precipitation potential with track and with CA
proximity.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun September 19 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
357 PM EDT Sun Sep 19 2021

Valid 00Z Mon Sep 20 2021 - 00Z Wed Sep 22 2021

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Tennessee Valley/Southeast through Monday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees below average over parts
of the Northern Rockies into the Northern Plains...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
western third of the country through Monday morning...

An upper-level low over the Middle Mississippi and Western Ohio
Valleys and abundant moisture over the Southeast/Tennessee Valley
into parts of the Ohio Valley will produce showers and
thunderstorms over the region through Monday. Some of the
thunderstorms will produce heavy rain. Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Tennessee Valley/Southeast through Monday morning. The associated
heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash flooding.
Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger
rivers through Monday morning.  The excessive rainfall threat
weakens slightly over parts of the Tennessee Valley and the
Southeast Coast on Monday into Tuesday morning.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Upper Midwest roughly
southwestward to the Great Basin will move eastward to the Great
Lakes and southward to the Gulf Coast by Tuesday evening.  Showers
and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the boundary
starting overnight Sunday over parts of the Northern/Central
Plains that will move into the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper
Great Lakes by Monday evening.

On Tuesday, the front will intersect the moisture over the
Tennessee Valley, increasing the threat of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. Furthermore, upper-level
energy moving across the Pacific Northwest into the Northern
Rockies will produce rain with wet snow at the highest elevations
of the Northern Rockies/Northern Intermountain Region ending by
Monday evening.

Additionally, dry conditions and gusty winds across the West led
to an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the western
third of the country through Monday morning. Therefore, Red Flag
Warnings are out for parts of California and Colorado. Moreover,
temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees below average over parts of
the Northern Rockies into the Northern Plains.  Therefore, Freeze
Watches are up over parts of Idaho and Freeze Watches over parts
of Colorado.

***Heavy rainfall expected for portions of the Northeast U.S. to
close out the work week***

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The longwave trough that is currently crossing the central U.S. is
forecast to evolve into a closed upper low over the Ohio Valley
and Great Lakes region by early Thursday, and then lifting to the
northeast by the end of the week as the cold front exits the East
Coast.  Another trough and surface cold front will be tracking
from the Pacific Northwest to the Upper Midwest by Friday night
and this may also evolve into an upper low, although not as strong
as the preceding system based on current model guidance.  In its
wake will likely be a developing upper ridge centered over the
Intermountain West for next weekend, along with a weak upper low
trapped under the ridge near the California coast that may bring
some moisture northward across portions of the Desert Southwest.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

There has actually been an increase in model uncertainty with the
evolving upper low over the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley for the
end of the week compared to yesterday, and forecast confidence for
this system is below average for a day 3 and 4 forecast, while
near to above average for the remainder of the nation.  The ECMWF
and CMC are considerably slower and more southwest with the core
of the upper low compared to the more progressive GFS and GEFS
mean.  The UKMET and also the ICON model are generally between
these two sets of solutions, and after reviewing trends in the
guidance and previous WPC continuity, the forecast was hedged more
in the faster direction through Friday.  However, if the slower
CMC/ECMWF solutions come to pass, the passage of the cold front
could be delayed and heavier rainfall will likely persist longer
across the Northeast.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., another synoptic scale
trough is likely to develop over the Great Lakes region in time
for the weekend with perhaps a closed low forming over Michigan
and southern Ontario, with the GFS slightly faster and holds onto
the feature longer over the Northeast U.S. by next Monday, whereas
the other guidance lifts the trough out faster.  There are also
some longitudinal differences with the upper low near the
California Coast, with the CMC/ECMWF farther offshore and the
GFS/GEFS mean near the coast.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily based on the
12Z/18Z GFS, UKMET, and 18Z GEFS mean for Thursday and Friday,
particularly for the East Coast storm system with slightly more
weighting on the 12Z UKMET given its middle ground solution with
the closed low over the northern Ohio Valley.  The ECMWF and its
ensemble mean were introduced into the forecast blend for the
second half of the forecast period after the departure of the East
Coast system.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread moderate to locally heavy rain is expected to be
ongoing Thursday across northern portions of the Mid-Atlantic and
much of the Northeast U.S. as the cold front intercepts a deep
plume of moisture ahead of it.  The potential exists for
widespread 1-2 inch rainfall totals, with isolated amounts up to 3
inches possible through Friday evening, particularly across the
elevated terrain of upstate New York and New England.  There may
be some instances of flooding if higher rainfall rates repeatedly
affect the same areas and for those regions with saturated soils.
There may be some strong thunderstorms as well, but the overall
severe potential appears limited for now.

In terms of temperatures, it will feel fall-like behind the cold
front across the Ohio Valley and the Appalachians on Thursday, and
the cold front should make it to the East Coast by Friday along
with improving humidity levels.  It should also feel more pleasant
across the Deep South and Southeast after the front passes through
the region.  The opposite will hold true across much of the
western U.S. as a warming trend is likely to commence by next
weekend in response to a building upper level ridge, with highs
expected to be on the order of 10 to 20 degrees above normal
across the western High Plains next Sunday and then expanding
eastward to the Midwest by Monday.  Meanwhile, temperatures should
be close to seasonal averages for the eastern third of the nation
for this same time period.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
In the wake of an upper-level trough moving across the northern
Rockies this morning, strong northwesterly flow aloft will extend
from the Pacific Northwest into the central Great Basin.  In
response at the surface, high pressure will build into the northern
Intermountain West increasing the pressure gradient across
California.

...Northern California...
Low-level northerly winds have increased across the region this
morning per VAD wind profiles, indicating wind speeds over 40 mph
around 1 kft above the ground.  While the low-level winds will
weaken and become more easterly through the afternoon, the surface
pressure gradient will continue to increase through the morning,
resulting in sustained surface winds over 20 mph.  As heating and
mixing commence at sunrise, RH values will fall below critical
values by mid morning, resulting in a few hours of overlapping
critical winds and RH values.

...Southern California...
Locally elevated fire weather conditions are possible across Los
Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties as the surface pressure
gradient supports offshore flow resulting in dry and breezy
conditions in terrain-favored locations.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to deepen as it moves across the
central Plains on Tuesday while an upper-level ridge moves eastward
across the Great Basin.  At the surface, a cold front will progress
eastward across the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys as high pressure
builds into the central Plains.

...Southern California...
The surface pressure gradient will continue to support offshore dry
and breezy winds on Tuesday across Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa
Barbara Counties, promoting locally elevated fire weather
conditions.  As the surface high pressure moves eastward toward the
central Plains, the pressure gradient will relax late on Tuesday
resulting in weakening offshore flow.

...Southern Plains...
Although northerly winds are likely to exceed 20 mph on Tuesday
across portions of southern Oklahoma and northern Texas in the wake
of the cold front, RH values are expected to stay above critical
thresholds given the relatively cool temperatures behind the front,
limiting the fire weather concerns.

...Strong to locally severe thunderstorms are possible from the
upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes to the Ozarks on Monday...

...Elevated to critical fire weather conditions expected to
continue across portions of Northern California through Monday
into Tuesday...

...Heavy rainfall and localized flash flooding possible across
portions of the Tennessee Valley, southern Appalachians, and the
Southeast Monday and Tuesday...

A strong cold front will continue to advance east from the
northern and central Great Plains into the upper and mid
Mississippi Valley on Monday.  Ongoing showers and storms along
the front are expected to weaken by late morning before
redeveloping with the return of daytime heating later in the
afternoon.  These storms may become strong to locally severe
during the afternoon and evening hours, impacting areas from the
upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes to the Ozarks. In
addition to locally damaging winds, there is the potential for
heavy rainfall and isolated flash flooding.  The front is forecast
to continue to push east across the Great Lakes and east of the
mid Mississippi Valley into the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys
on Tuesday.  Although the recurrence of severe thunderstorms
appears unlikely, heavy rainfall with localized flash flooding is
possible -- especially for parts of the lower Ohio Valley
northward into Lower Michigan.

Back to the west, unseasonably cool temperatures will spread
across the Great Basin and northern Rockies -- supporting high
elevation snows across portions of the northern Rockies on Monday
and Freeze Watches and Warnings for parts of Wyoming and Colorado
Monday night into Tuesday morning.

High pressure is expected to build across the West -- supporting
dry conditions for most areas west of the Rockies through midweek.
 Dry, gusty northerly to northeasterly winds are expected to
support elevated to critical fire weather conditions, with Red
Flag Warnings in effect for portions of Northern California
through Monday into Tuesday.

Moisture and the upper level circulation associated with the
remnants of tropical cyclone Nicholas will continue to pose a
heavy rainfall and flash flooding threat, especially for portions
of the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys and the southern
Appalachians on Monday.  Meanwhile, onshore winds along the
Southeast coast will reinforce the already rich tropical airmass
in place -- supporting heavy rains and localized flash flooding,
especially along the southern South Carolina and Georgia coasts on
Monday, before shifting farther north along the northern South
Carolina coast into southeastern North Carolina on Tuesday.

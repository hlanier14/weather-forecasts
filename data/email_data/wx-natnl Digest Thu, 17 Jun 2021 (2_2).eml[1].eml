Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0232 AM CDT Thu Jun 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE FOUR CORNERS REGION...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level moisture will continue to advect westward into the
Southwest over the next 48 hours, largely thanks to an upper-level
high anchored over the general Four Corners. This influx of moisture
combined with strong diurnal heating will result in a widespread
area of 100-500 J/kg MUCAPE rooted above deep, dry boundary layers,
conducive for dry thunderstorms. With dry fuels already present
across most of the Southwest, the dry thunderstorm potential will
present a fire weather threat. The presence of the upper-level high
will also limit mid and upper-level flow over the region, resulting
in only localized wind/RH driven fire weather concerns.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated to scattered dry thunderstorms are possible from central CO
westward into southeastern CA. Guidance is in very good agreement
that PWAT values will generally be limited to 0.5 to 0.75 inches
with increasing values from west to east. Confidence in the
potential for dry thunderstorms is fairly high, but convective
coverage is slightly less certain. Thunderstorm chances will be
highest along and east of the continental divide in CO, but an
easterly up-slope flow regime and PWAT values between 0.75 to 1.0
inch suggest that wetting rainfall is probable. To the west of the
divide, orographic lift and low-level parcels reaching their
convective temperatures will be the primarily driving factors. HREF
and SREF guidance show thunder probabilities between 30-50% across
the Four Corners, and nearly all CAM forecast soundings show
adequate instability to support convection in this region. As such,
confidence in scattered dry thunderstorms is highest over the higher
terrain of the Four Corners region.

...Southern Wyoming...
Although mid-level flow will generally be weak over the region,
localized elevated conditions are possible across the northern Great
Basin and northern Rockies where terrain-enhanced winds can reach
15-20 mph. Confidence in persistent elevated conditions is highest
across southern WY along the I-80 corridor where terrain induced
downslope slow will support 15-20 mph winds and RH values in the low
teens.

...West-central Minnesota...
Winds are forecast to increase to near 15 mph (with gusts upwards of
20-25 mph) ahead of a weak cold front Friday afternoon across
west-central MN. Fuels across the state remain very dry despite
recent rainfall. Localized fire weather conditions are possible
where breezy conditions can coincide with RH reductions down to 25%,
though confidence in the coverage and duration of these conditions
is low.

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat will continue across
portions of the West and Central Plains, along with fire danger...

...Severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall causing flash flooding
are possible throughout the Midwest on Thursday and Ohio Valley on
Friday...

...Tropical rains and potential for flash flooding are expected to
approach the central Gulf Coast beginning Friday...

The persistent and extreme heat wave being felt across the western
U.S. is set to continue and even expand over the next couple of
days. A strong upper-level ridge over the Southwest is expected to
remain in place through the end of the week, while only slightly
weakening. High temperatures 10 to 25 degrees above average will
spread into central and northern California today, before reaching
portions of the Northern Great Basin by Friday. Dangerous and
potentially deadly heat will continue throughout the Southwest and
Intermountain West during this time period as well--highs into the
110s and even 120s are likely throughout the Desert Southwest.
Meanwhile, widespread triple digits will be felt throughout
California and lower elevations of the Central Great Basin and
Central Rockies. A brief period of sweltering heat should also
impact areas farther east across the Central Plains and Middle
Mississippi Valley to end the workweek, with highs in the upper
90s and low 100s stretching from eastern Colorado to southern
Illinois. Much of the aforementioned regions from the West to
Midwest could see dozens of daily record high temperatures set. A
few monthly and even all-time records have already been
tied/broken this week associated with the current stretch of heat.
Widespread Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories are in
effect for the southwestern quadrant of the country as well as the
Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley today. Residents enduring
the abnormal heat are urged to stay hydrated and avoid extended
periods of time outdoors if possible.

With warm temperatures and dry soil in place, fire danger is
another threat. A Critical Risk of fire weather is in place today
for southern Wyoming, while Elevated Risks stretch across much of
the Great Basin to Rockies and Northern Plains. Dry thunderstorms
(containing lightning that could start fires with no rain reaching
the surface) are also a concern across portions of California,
Nevada, and the Four Corners states through at least Friday.

A weak area of low pressure and associated frontal boundaries will
fuel scattered showers and thunderstorms over the Midwest today
into tonight. An Enhanced Risk of severe weather and a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall are in place there today, as these storms
are capable of producing damaging wind gusts, large hail,
tornadoes, and flash flooding. Then on Friday, storms are forecast
to shift into the Ohio Valley. Slight to Enhanced Risks of severe
weather are in place for Illinois to western Pennsylvania, with
scattered flash floods possible for that region as well.

Farther south, an area of low pressure in the Bay of Campeche is
likely to develop into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours
per the National Hurricane Center. Regardless of tropical cyclone
status, however, the low is expected to drift northward across the
Gulf of Mexico and spread abundant tropical moisture into the
central Gulf Coast beginning Friday, causing heavy rainfall. Much
of southern Louisiana has received double their normal rainfall
over the last month; therefore, tropical moisture entering the
region would exacerbate flooding concerns. A Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall is currently in place for the central Gulf
Coast for Friday into Friday night, with a Moderate Risk beginning
Saturday.

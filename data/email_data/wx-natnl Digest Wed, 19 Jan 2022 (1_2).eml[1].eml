...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE TEXAS ROLLING
PLAINS INTO THE BIG COUNTRY...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, with no changes
made to the fire weather highlights. Sunny skies are supporting
boundary-layer mixing, with RH percentages dropping into the 20s and
sustained southwesterly surface winds increasing to 20 mph (with
higher gusts noted). Continued heating will support 15-20 percent
minimum RH and 20+ mph sustained southwesterly winds across the
Critical area over the Texas Rolling Plains into the Big Country.
The 12Z MAF, EPZ and ABQ observed soundings depict modest 850-600 mb
moisture, which may progress eastward to the southern High Plains
and mix down to the surface, subduing RH from dipping into solidly
Critical territory across southwest TX. However, at least locally
Critical conditions are still expected from the Caprock westward.

..Squitieri.. 01/18/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0100 AM CST Tue Jan 18 2022/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level disturbance, currently noted over southern California
in early-morning water-vapor imagery, is forecast to translate
eastward towards the southern Plains through the day. Strengthening
zonal flow over the southern Rockies associated with this wave will
deepen a surface low currently over the OK/TX Panhandles. A
combination of a surface mass response and strengthening mid-level
flow will support a swath of 15-25 mph winds from eastern NM into
north-central TX and southwest OK. Boundary-layer mixing up to
around 850 mb should support wind gusts between 25-35 mph.

00Z AMA and MAF soundings reveal a 1-3 km deep dry layer, and
widespread dewpoints in the single digits/low teens across east
NM/west TX suggest this dry air mass is fairly widespread. While
modest moisture advection from the south is expected, westerly
downslope winds will help maintain dry conditions across the TX
Panhandle into northwest TX. Latest guidance suggests RH reductions
to near 20% will be common west of a diffuse dryline, and a few
locations may see RH values fall into the teens by late afternoon.
Critical wind/RH conditions appear most likely to occur across the
Rolling Plains of northwest TX, where diurnal warming under the
low-level thermal ridge axis should be most favorably overlapped
with strong low/mid-level flow. Outside of this region, breezy
conditions with modestly dry RH are expected, and transient critical
conditions may occur. To the northwest across the TX Panhandle, RH
reductions into the teens appear likely, but winds should be
somewhat weaker under the nearly stationary surface low. Latest fuel
guidance continues to show region ERC values in the 80-90th
percentile for mid-January, indicating receptive fuels that will
support the fire weather threat.

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions
made. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 01/18/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CST Tue Jan 18 2022/

...Synopsis...
The potential for robust fire weather concerns appears low across
the central and southern High Plains where fuels are currently the
driest. Fire weather threats will be mitigated largely due to the
passage of a southward-surging cold front through the morning hours
Wednesday. While breezy northerly winds are likely, falling
temperatures behind the front will keep RH values above elevated
thresholds. Further south across southwest TX, westerly winds ahead
of the cold front may support enough downslope warming/drying for RH
reductions into the 20-30% range. Dry pockets may overlap with winds
near 15 mph and support a couple hours of patchy elevated
conditions. However, the duration and coverage of such conditions
remains uncertain and will be determined by the southward
progression of the cold front.

...Heavy Snow/Ice Threat for the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
into Friday/Saturday...

...Overview...

Arctic high pressure will push a cold front through the Deep South
and East later this week, leading to much below normal
temperatures. Moist air fed into the southern and eastern
periphery of the cold airmass is increasingly likely to fuel a
heavy snow/ice threat from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic into
Fri. Potential coastal storm development would enhance Mid-Atlanic
to Northeast heavy snow potential Sat. Meanwhile, upper ridging
builds off/along the West Coast as digging Intermoutain
West/Rockies shortwave energy spills snows southward in route to
producing a Southwest closed low by the weekend slated to eject
across the U.S. southern tier early next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Weather
Highlights/Threats...

Guidance remains in decent agreement with the large scale mean
flow over the lower 48 highlighted by an upper ridge off/along the
West Coast and upper troughing over the central and eastern U.S..
However, the models have recently been horrendous with run to run
continuity of embedded shortwaves that dig through the mean upper
trough position. In particular, forecast spread remains a
significant timing and amplitude issue with a main shortwave over
the east-central to eastern states Fri/Sat that produces major
placement differences with a potentially impactful coastal low
genesis in the western Atlantic. The 12z ECMWF is faster and more
northerly than last nights 00z run. This is consistent with its
current trend. The 12z GFS is considerably more progressive than
the 12z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC suite, but consistent with its 00z
predecessor with its solution placing the shortwave axis farther
north than the other deterministics.

There is potential for heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain
particularly from the southern Appalachians and
Carolinas/Mid-Atlantic into Fri, potentially into the Northeast by
Sat. The pattern will also be favorable for lake effect snow given
the arctic airmass in place. Into early next week, guidance agrees
to hold an amplified mean upper trough over the cooled
east-central U.S., ableit with variations with embedded shortwaves
set to dig and reinforced the feature underneath a deep low
centered just east of the Hudson Bay.

Meanwhile out West, models genrally agree to dig shortwave energy
southward across the Intermountain West Friday leading to a
Southwest U.S/northern Mexico closed low by the weekend. Lead flow
response in advance of expected system ejection out across the
U.S. southern tier early next week would support a modest swath of
overrunning precipitation within a cooled airmass from Texas
eastward across the Gulf Coast. The best chance for snow will
Fri/Sat down through the Rockies as the shortwave impulse moves
through. Other than that, conditions should remain mostly dry,
with slightly warmer than normal conditions for the West Coast
states underneath the ridge, and above normal temperatures are
then expected for the High Plains early next week.

300 PM EST January 18 2022

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast across the eastern U.S. during
the
early portion of week-2, continuing the recent stretch of anomalously cold
temperatures extending from the Midwest to the Atlantic Coast. However, the=
re
are increasing signals for a pattern change toward the later half of week-2=
,
with mid-level high pressure predicted to retrograde over the Eastern Pacif=
ic,
resulting in a deamplication of the mid-level height pattern over the
contiguous U.S. As a result, a moderation of temperatures is favored, first
across the Midwest by the middle of the period, and then along the East Coa=
st
toward the end of the period. Surface low pressure forecast over the Gulf o=
f
Alaska favors increased wind speeds along the southern coast of the Alaska
Mainland and the Panhandle early in week-2.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Upper and
Middle Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes, Wed, Jan 26.

High risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the eastern Ohi=
o
Valley, Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, Wed-Fri, Jan 26-28.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Upper a=
nd
Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys,
Appachachians, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast, Wed-Sat, Jan 26-29.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the eastern half =
of
the CONUS, Wed-Sun, Jan 26-30.

Slight risk of high winds for much of the Southern and Central Plains, Fri-
Tue,
Jan 28-Feb 1.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of coastal southeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, Wed-Fri, Jan 26-28.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of southern Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle, Wed-Fri, Jan 26-28.

FOR WEDNESDAY JANUARY 26 - TUESDAY FEBRUARY 01: The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensembles depict an amplified 500-hPa geopotential height pattern
across North America early in week-2, with troughing in the East and upstre=
am
ridging over the western CONUS and eastern Pacific. By the end of January, =
the
Pacific-North American Pattern (PNA) is favored to trend toward a negative
phase, suggestive of a pattern change over the U.S. This is evidenced in th=
e
daily 500-hPa progression in the models, which depicts anomalous ridging
retrograding over the Eastern Pacific, and the initial troughing becoming m=
ore
focused along the East Coast by the middle of the period, and lifting out
completely by the end of week-2. The highest probabilities for anomalous co=
ld
are over the eastern U.S. early in week-2, with a high risk for much below
normal temperatures designated across the Upper and Middle Mississippi Vall=
ey
and Great Lakes on day-8 (Jan 26) only, and a separate high risk area
highlighted for portions of the eastern Ohio Valley, Appalachians, and
Mid-Atlantic through day-10 (Jan 28) to account for the forecast eastward
progression of the trough. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts probabilities =
of
at least 60 percent for temperatures falling below the 15th percentile over
the
highlighted high risk areas during their respective time frames. Across the
Upper Midwest, subzero (deg F) minimum temperatures are likely based on
uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF guidance, with minimum temperatures in the sing=
le
digits and teens deg F forecast for portions of the Eastern Seaboard.



A moderate risk for much below normal temperatures continues through day-11
(Jan 29) from the Midwest to portions of the Atlantic Coast. However, a qui=
ck
moderation of temperatures is favored across the Midwest, and the ECMWF
reforecast tool no longer depicts probabilities greater than 20 percent for
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile after day-9 (Jan 27)=
.
While a broad moderate risk shape is drawn, it must be noted that the great=
est
potential of hazardous cold is forecast to become focused over the Eastern
Seaboard by the middle of the period. The slight risk for much below normal
temperatures extends an additional day (Jan 30), and covers much of the
eastern
U.S. The deamplification of the pattern, and associated moderation in
temperatures forecast by the end of week-2, supports a discontinuation of t=
he
slight risk after Jan 30.



Mid-level heights are forecast to decrease across the western CONUS late in
week-2 due to the retrogression of the ridge, with weakly amplified troughi=
ng
being depicted in the dynamical models over the West. This is consistent wi=
th
a
trend toward a negative PNA as well as the continuing La Nina conditions. A=
s a
result of this troughing and subsequent surface low pressure development ov=
er
the Rockies, increased wind speeds are possible across parts the Central an=
d
Southern Plains during the middle and later parts of the period, with a sli=
ght
risk for high winds indicated from Jan 28-Feb 1. The ECMWF reforecast tool
depicts at least a 20 percent chance wind speeds exceed the 85th
climatological
percentile and 20-mph over the highlighted region. This feature may also
result
in enhanced snowfall across parts of the Northern Rockies and Great Basin
during the second half of week-2, as well as increased precipitation chance=
s
downstream over the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley, but probabiliti=
es
for reaching hazards thresholds are too low to issue any related precipitat=
ion
hazards at this time.



During week-2, increasing ridging is forecast to build across the eastern
North-Pacific, including Alaska. Despite this, dynamical models indicate an
area of surface low pressure over the Gulf of Alaska and when combined with
surface high pressure favored over the Mainland, this would favor a tight
pressure gradient and increased wind speeds over the southern Mainland coas=
t
and the Panhandle. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts parts of these areas
having at least a 20 percent chance wind speeds exceed the 85th climatologi=
cal
percentile and 25-mph early in week-2, and therefore a slight risk for high
winds is indicated over these areas from Jan 26-28. Rounds of heavy
precipitation are also possible over the extreme southeastern Mainland and =
the
Panhandle. Total precipitation forecast over the 3-day period is in the ran=
ge
of 1-2 inches in the uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble mean over most areas, whic=
h
is
on the low side in terms of hazards criteria. However, additional
precipitation
combined with the antecedent wet pattern and the increased potential for
snowmelt could exacerbate impacts. Therefore a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is highlighted over these areas from Jan 26-28.

...Snow, rain, and thunderstorms to accompany a storm system and
cold front from the Plains to the East Coast...

...Frigid temperatures to overspread the Plains and Midwest....

...Lower elevation rain and mountain snow for the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies Wednesday into Thursday...

A easterly moving storm system over the northern tier of the
country accompanied by a strong cold front will be the main
weather story for the short-term forecast period (Tuesday evening
through Thursday evening). A strong low pressure center currently
located over the western Great Lakes will move to the northeast
through southeastern Canada and eventually into the open Atlantic
by Thursday. On Tuesday afternoon, an occluded front extended to
the south with a cold front continuing southwest across the
Central Plains before curving back northwestward through the
Central and Northern Rockies. Snow will continue through this
evening across the Upper Great Lakes with a few more inches
expected. Snow will also continue for the Northern Rockies and
adjacent areas of the Northern High Plains, with a few inches of
snow expected in these areas as well, particularly across Montana.
Areas ahead of the cold front across the Central Plains will
remain dry through the night. This will change on Wednesday as
moisture increases ahead of the front as it progresses to the
southeast. On the northern end near the surface low, the snow move
into northern New England and upstate New York while a wintry mix
will move across the Lower Great Lakes. The snow will expand in
coverage on Thursday behind the cold front for the Northeast as
the front moves off the East Coast. A wave of low pressure along
the front will also help to increase precipitation chances from
the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic, with rain Wednesday
transitioning to snow from west to east overnight into Thursday.
The cold air behind the front may bring snow chances as far south
as eastern portions of the Tennessee Valley. Forecast snow
accumulations are expected to remain relatively light, with the
greatest chance for a couple inches or more of snow across
northern Upstate New York and New England as well as the central
Appalachians.

Meanwhile, further south, rain and thunderstorms are likely ahead
of the front from the Ohio Valley southwestward through the lower
Mississippi Valley to southeastern Texas. There is a narrow
Marginal Risk of Excessive rainfall for Wednesday from
south-central Kentucky southwestward to Northeast Louisiana where
a couple inches of rain, with some locally higher amounts, is
expected. There is also a Marginal Risk of severe thunderstorms
issued by the Storm Prediction Center for the chance of isolated
gusty winds and small hail. The rain will continue ahead of the
front through the Southeast on Thursday, with totals around 1-2
inches possible.

In addition to precipitation chances along the front, a frigidly
cold airmass will move south and east across the Plains to the
Midwest in its wake with temperatures plunging from the above
normal highs seen Tuesday. Highs on Wednesday will range between
the single digits and teens for the Northern Plains and Upper
Midwest Wednesday, with some locations in in North Dakota and
Minnesota remaining below freezing. Temperatures in the 20s and
30s will spread southward from Chicago to Kansas City and Oklahoma
City. The cold front will continue further south and east on
Thursday, with highs in the 20s and 30s from the Northeast to the
Mid-South and into Texas and 40s for the western Gulf Coast. Gusty
winds behind the front as well as lows below zero Wednesday
morning have prompted Wind Chill Advisories from eastern Montana
to the Upper Missouri and Mississippi Valleys. Lows on Thursday
will dip even colder, with temperatures well below zero expanding
southward into the Mid Missouri and Mississippi Valleys.

A storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest will bring an
increasing chance for lower elevation rain and mountain snow
throughout the day Wednesday. The chance for snow will expand
further east across the Northern Rockies and High Plains on
Thursday. Snow accumulations should generally remain light, with
higher totals between 4-8 inches remaining confined to higher
elevations in the mountains.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 24 - 28 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. Mean troughing is forecast over
eastern Siberia while strong ridging looks to dominate downstream across mo=
st
of western North America. Daily model output indicates a very stable patter=
n
for the early parts of the 6-10 day period but some hints of change are
evident
by late in the period. In the late of the period, a trough is forecast to
progress eastward off the West Coast which may act to weaken the ridge over
western North America. However, strong ridging is forecast to remain over t=
he
North Atlantic, which would act to lock an amplified trough in place over
eastern North America. The official 500-hPa manual height blend, based
primarily on an even split among the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means, maintai=
ns
strong negative height anomalies across eastern North America and above nor=
mal
heights for most of Alaska and the western CONUS.

With strong troughing forecast across central and eastern North America,
probabilities of below normal temperatures are elevated across most of the

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 26 - FEB 01, 2022

An amplified 500-hPa pattern is predicted to persist across the forecast

for week-2, with near to below normal heights likely across central and
eastern
North America and above normal heights favored for Alaska and the northwest=
ern
CONUS. However, daily model output reveals a complex pattern across the
Pacific
Sector and some solutions weaken the ridge over the West Coast of North
America
and build a second ridge farther to the west near western Alaska during the
middle of week-2. However, ridging is generally forecast to hold strong ove=

and favor continued ridging upstream across the West. The mean 500-hPa blen=
d,
composed from the ensemble mean solutions form the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadia=
n
models, maintains troughing over eastern North America and ridging across
Alaska and the western CONUS.

With an amplified pattern generally expected to continue for Week-2, below
normal temperatures remain favored for the eastern half of the CONUS.
Probabilities of below normal temperatures exceed 60 percent for much of th=

elevated probabilities of above normal temperatures across parts of the

temperature probabilities are indicated for the northwestern CONUS, as
uncertainty is high as to if, and by how much, ridging over this area will
weaken during week-2. Below normal temperatures are favored for western Ala=

for northeastern Mainland Alaska, consistent with the consolidation forecas=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=

In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=

shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=

for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=

(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no

...Heavy Snow/Ice Threat for the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
into Friday/Saturday...

...Overview...

Arctic high pressure will push a cold front through the Deep South
and East later this week, leading to much below normal
temperatures. Moist air fed into the southern and eastern
periphery of the cold airmass is increasingly likely to fuel a
heavy snow/ice threat from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic into
Fri. Potential coastal storm development would enhance Mid-Atlanic
to Northeast heavy snow potential Sat. Meanwhile, upper ridging
builds off/along the West Coast as digging Intermoutain
West/Rockies shortwave energy spills snows southward in route to
producing a Southwest closed low by the weekend slated to eject
across the U.S. southern tier early next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Weather
Highlights/Threats...

Guidance remains in decent agreement with the large scale mean
flow over the lower 48 highlighted by an upper ridge off/along the
West Coast and upper troughing over the central and eastern U.S..
However, the models have recently been horrendous with run to run
continuity with embedded shortwaves that dig through the mean
upper trough position. In particular, forecast spread remains a
significant timing and amplitude issue with a main shortwave over
the east-central to eastern states Fri/Sat that produces major
placement differences with a potentially impactful coastal low
genesis in the western Atlantic. The 12z ECMWF is faster and more
northerly than last nights 00z run. This is consistent with its
current trend. The 12z GFS is considerably more progressive than
the 12z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC suite, but consistent with its 00z
predecessor with its solution placing the shortwave axis farther
north than the other deterministics.

There is potential for heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain
particularly from the southern Appalachians and
Carolinas/Mid-Atlantic into Fri, potentially into the Northeast by
Sat. The pattern will also be favorable for lake effect snow given
the arctic airmass in place. Into early next week, guidance agrees
to hold an amplified mean upper trough over the cooled
east-central U.S., ableit with variations with embedded shortwaves
set to dig and reinforced the feature underneath a deep low
centered just east of the Hudson Bay.

Meanwhile out West, models genrally agree to dig shortwave energy
southward across the Intermountain West Friday leading to a
Southwest U.S/northern Mexico closed low by the weekend. Lead flow
response in advance of expected system ejection out across the
U.S. southern tier early next week would support a modest swath of
overrunning precipitation within a cooled airmass from Texas
eastward across the Gulf Coast. The best chance for snow will
Fri/Sat down through the Rockies as the shortwave impulse moves
through. Other than that, conditions should remain mostly dry,
with slightly warmer than normal conditions for the West Coast
states underneath the ridge, and above normal temperatures are
then expected for the High Plains early next week.

An easterly moving storm system over the northern tier of the
country accompanied by a strong cold front will be the main
weather story for the short-term forecast period (Tuesday evening
through Thursday evening). A strong low pressure center currently
located over the western Great Lakes will move to the northeast
through southeastern Canada and eventually into the open Atlantic
by Thursday. An occluded front extended to the south with a cold
front continuing southwest across the Central Plains before
curving back northwestward through the Central and Northern
Rockies. Snow will continue through this evening across the Upper
Great Lakes with a few more inches expected. Snow will also
continue for the Northern Rockies and adjacent areas of the
Northern High Plains, with a few inches of snow expected for this
region as well, particularly across Montana. Areas ahead of the
cold front across the Central Plains will remain dry through the
night. This will change on Wednesday as moisture increases ahead
of the front as it progresses to the south and east. On the
northern end near the surface low, the snow will move into
northern New England and upstate New York while a wintry mix will
move across the Lower Great Lakes. The snow will expand in
coverage on Thursday behind the cold front for the Northeast as
the front moves off the East Coast. A wave of low pressure along
the front will also help to increase precipitation chances from
the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic, with rain Wednesday
transitioning to snow from west to east overnight into Thursday.
The cold air behind the front may bring snow chances as far south
as eastern portions of the Tennessee Valley. Forecast snow
accumulations are expected to remain relatively light, with the
greatest chance for a couple inches or more of snow across
northern Upstate New York and New England as well as the central
Appalachians.

Meanwhile, further south, rain and thunderstorms are likely ahead
of the front from the Ohio Valley southwestward through the Lower
Mississippi Valley to southeastern Texas. There is a narrow
Marginal Risk for Excessive rainfall for Wednesday from
south-central Kentucky southwestward to northeast Louisiana where
a couple inches of rain, with some locally higher amounts, is
forecast. There is also a Marginal Risk of severe thunderstorms
issued by the Storm Prediction Center for the chance of isolated
gusty winds and small hail. The rain will continue ahead of the
front through the Southeast on Thursday, with totals of around 1-2
inches possible.

In addition to the precipitation chances along the front, a
frigidly cold airmass will move south and east across the Plains
and Midwest in its wake, with temperatures plunging from the above
normal highs seen Tuesday. Highs on Wednesday will range between
the single digits and teens for the Northern Plains and Upper
Midwest, with some locations in North Dakota and Minnesota
remaining below zero. Temperatures in the 20s and 30s will spread
southward from Chicago to Kansas City and Oklahoma City. The cold
front will continue further south and east on Thursday, with highs
in the 20s and 30s from the Northeast to the Mid-South and into
Texas, and 40s for the western Gulf Coast. Gusty winds behind the
front as well as lows below zero Wednesday morning have prompted
Wind Chill Advisories from eastern Montana to the Upper Missouri
and Mississippi Valleys. Lows on Thursday will dip even colder,
with temperatures well below zero expanding southward into the
Mid-Missouri and Mississippi Valleys.

A storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest will bring an
increasing chance for lower elevation rain and mountain snow
throughout the day Wednesday. The chance for snow will expand
further east across the Northern Rockies and High Plains on
Thursday. Snow accumulations should generally remain light, with
higher totals between 4-8 inches remaining confined to higher
elevations in the mountains.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1231 AM CST Wed Jan 19 2022

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The fire weather potential will remain low for today as a cold front
continues to push south into the southern Plains. 15-20 mph north
winds (gusting to 30-35 mph) are expected for much of the central
and southern Plains behind the front, but cool temperatures will
maintain RH values generally above 30%. A few drier solutions hint
at RH reductions into the 20-30% range from north-central KS into
northwest TX, but the potential for elevated conditions appears
limited given increasing cloud cover and rapidly cooling
temperatures. Nonetheless, a low-end, wind-driven fire concern may
develop for northwest TX due to antecedent dry fuels.

Further south ahead of the front, pockets of elevated conditions are
possible across the Trans Pecos region of west TX. Westerly winds
between 15-20 mph may overlap with 20-30% RH to support a couple
hours of elevated fire weather conditions prior to the frontal
passage. However, the duration and coverage of this threat remains
uncertain and will be dependent on frontal progression.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance remains in good agreement with the mean flow over the
lower 48 highlighted by an amplified upper ridge off/along the
West Coast and an amplified and unsettling upper trough over the
central to eastern U.S. that coincides with several short and
medium range Arctic blasts with periods of much below normal
temperatures. The models have been less than stellar with the run
to run continuity of embedded shortwaves rotating through the mean
upper trough position and surface system reflection, but seem to
be slowly improving. Given lingering model variance issues
however, the earlier released WPC medium range product suite was
primarily derived from the 12 UTC GEFS mean and especially the
ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models. The 00 UTC models seem to be converging on better
clustered solutions that have overall trended favorably toward the
WPC composite solution, bolstering forecast confidence.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

00 UTC forecast guidance is better clustered with an important
shortwave trough exiting the Mid-Atlantic Saturday that offers
potential for coastal storm development. The 00 UTC models better
agree with development of an organized low off the Mid-Atlantic
and New England. The WPC Winter Weather Outlook holds a lingering
chance for coastal snows into Day 4/Saturday with the exiting low
given the threat of a few more robust ensemble members.

Upstream, models generally agree to carve out a Southwest
U.S/northern Mexico closed low by Saturday that offers terrain
enhanced snow potential from the Mogollon Rim to the southern
Rockies/High Plains. The system remains slated to be ejected
eastward across the U.S. southern tier early next week. Lead
moisutre return from the Gulf of Mexico will overrun a
trailing/wavy front to fuel a decent swath of precipitation within
a cooled airmass from Texas eastward across the Gulf Coast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0105 AM CST Wed Jan 19 2022

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low through the day Thursday for
most of the CONUS. Cool temperatures behind Wednesday's cold front
will overspread the central and southern Plains where fuels have
been dry. Latest guidance has trended towards sunnier, drier
conditions across central KS/OK and into northern TX with RH
reductions into the low 20s possible. However, winds are expected to
diminish through the day as a surface high builds over the region.
This will limit the temporal overlap of stronger winds in the
morning with drier conditions in the afternoon. Ensemble guidance
suggests the highest probability for a few hours of elevated
conditions resides across central TX, but this potential appears too
limited to warrant delineation at this time.

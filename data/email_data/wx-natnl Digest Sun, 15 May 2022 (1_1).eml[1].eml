Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1159 AM CDT Sat May 14 2022

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

The Elevated area over south-central CO was extended slightly
southward into parts of north-central NM. Here, surface observations
already show 10-15 percent RH, and clear skies/efficient diurnal
heating will aid in additional boundary-layer drying through the
afternoon. Despite sustained westerly surface winds of 10-15 mph,
ongoing fires over the area and critically dry fuels warrant the
Elevated delineation.

Across parts of Upper Michigan and northern Wisconsin, elevated
fire-weather conditions will be possible this afternoon, as deep
boundary-layer mixing results in 20-25 percent minimum RH and 20-30
mph gusts. Therefore, Elevated highlights were added for these
areas.

..Weinman.. 05/14/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1155 PM CDT Fri May 13 2022/

...Synopsis...
A very dry airmass is in place across the Southwest and southern
High Plains with dewpoints in the single digits above and below 0F.
Surface high pressure and a building ridge aloft should keep winds
mostly light across this region on Saturday which will keep fire
weather concerns minimal. Stronger flow will remain farther north
across the northern Rockies and northern Plains where fuels are less
favorable for fire spread. However, some of this stronger flow may
brush the central Rockies with some elevated conditions possible in
the higher terrain. Most fuels are not yet critically dry, but ERC
values are above the 95th percentile across much of the southern
Colorado mountains. Therefore, an elevated delineation has been
added for this region where winds are expected to be around 15 mph
with 10 to 15 percent relative humidity.

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

Only minor adjustments/expansions were made to the Elevated area
over the central/southern High Plains based on the latest
high-resolution guidance. For details, see the previous discussion
below.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1156 PM CDT Fri May 13 2022/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will amplify on Sunday with dry conditions across
the Southwest with mostly light winds. A surface cold front is
expected to move south across the central Plains on Sunday
afternoon. Strong winds are expected in the wake of this front. Some
of these strong northeasterly winds may overlap regions with low
relative humidity in the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles into southwest
Kansas and far southwest Colorado. Have added an elevated area where
these strong winds are most likely to overlap low relative humidity.
Some critical conditions are possible, but there are uncertainties
related to location and duration of the conditions which preclude a
critical delineation at this time.

Extended Forecast Discussion

...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. next week with anomalous heat expanding into the East..


...Overview...

Upper troughing should shift out of the East Tuesday-Wednesday
early in the medium range period, with broad ridging to zonal flow
behind. The pattern is expected to amplify later in the week as
upper troughing digs in the West, yielding cooler temperatures and
lowering snow levels in a round of precipitation spreading across
the Northwest. Stubborn ridging across the South will continue to
promote unseasonably hot weather, with the most persistent and
record-breaking heat centered in Texas and Louisiana. Warmer than
normal temperatures are forecast to spread eastward as the ridge
amplifies ahead of the trough in the West. The best focus for
showers and thunderstorms should be along a quasi-stationary
boundary from the central Plains into the Ohio Valley, while some
rounds of rain are also possible in the north-central U.S. and
shower/thunderstorm chances will increase in Florida late next
week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent model guidance remains in mostly good agreement with the
overall pattern at least through the middle of next week, though
uncertainty in the details lingers. Despite some small scale
shortwave differences within the eastern trough, guidance
continues to show it lifting out of the U.S. on Wednesday with
some separation from a deep closed low over the Hudson Bay that
looks to linger for several days next week. Models still vary with
the potential for another shortwave traversing near the
U.S./Canada border on Wednesday into Thursday, with the 00Z GFS
the strongest/deepest and the 00Z UKMET on the deeper side as
well. The 06Z and 12Z GFS runs backed off on this feature though.
Though these shortwaves are small scale, they impact positions of
the fronts and rainfall/convection. Despite the differences, it
seems the best approach was a middle ground so the WPC forecast
for days 3-4 was based on composite blend of the deterministic
models led by the 00Z ECMWF, which seemed most consistent across
the board.

By around day 5/Thursday, overall models agree that the upper low
spinning off the British Columbia coast through the short to early
medium range period should shift southeast into the Pacific
Northwest, or at least the energy from it will--models are quite
variable with the details of embedded upper lows within the trough
being created by this digging energy, which is impacted by
potential interaction with the Hudson Bay low as well. CMC runs
have shown a more shallow trough that is faster to move eastward
compared to GFS and ECMWF runs. The northern Plains is a
particularly uncertain region late week as far as a ridge or
trough in the upper flow. The WPC forecast for the latter part of
the period phased out the CMC in favor of the GEFS and EC means,
turning into about an even blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean/06Z
GFS/GEFS mean by day 7, which maintained good continuity from the
previous WPC forecast.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the southern Plains and then eventually
rising heights farther east over the Deep South will promote a
broad area of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the
period. The greatest and most lasting anomalies through the period
should be over Texas (persisting from the short range time frame)
where some locations could see highs up to 15-25F above normal,
with numerous daily record highs likely. Parts of the Southwest
into the central Great Basin and southern/central Rockies can
expect highs around 10F above average into midweek before a
cooling trend as the deeper troughing presses inland. However,
warm to hot temperatures could increase for the southeastern
quadrant of the U.S. later next week, with potential for daily
record highs, and warmer than average temperatures by 10-20F
should expand in coverage across the Ohio Valley to Eastern
Seaboard by the end of the week.

A warm front lifting through the Mid-Mississippi Valley and Ohio
Valley will provide a focus for multiple areas of showers and
storms/convective complexes during the middle to latter part of
next week. The ingredients are in place for heavy rainfall
somewhere, though the specifics of coverage and amounts are
uncertain, but at least a localized flood threat is likely
especially if heavy rain falls in areas that are sensitive to
additional rainfall. Rounds of likely lighter rainfall are
possible across the north-central U.S. through the latter half of
the week as well.

After a couple of initial fronts crossing the Northwest, the main
well-defined front ahead of the deepening trough will bring
unseasonably cool temperatures to the Northwest and expanding into
the northern Rockies and High Plains by late week. This will also
provide support for a notable round of precipitation, with
lowering snow levels in the Cascades to Northern Rockies as the
week progresses, with some chance of snow even into northern parts
of the High Plains, though with very low confidence at this point.

...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. next week with anomalous heat expanding into the East..


...Overview...

Upper troughing should shift out of the East Tuesday-Wednesday
early in the medium range period, with broad ridging to zonal flow
behind. The pattern is expected to amplify later in the week as
upper troughing digs in the West, yielding cooler temperatures and
lowering snow levels in a round of precipitation spreading across
the Northwest. Stubborn ridging across the South will continue to
promote unseasonably hot weather, with the most persistent and
record-breaking heat centered in Texas and Louisiana. Warmer than
normal temperatures are forecast to spread eastward as the ridge
amplifies ahead of the trough in the West. The best focus for
showers and thunderstorms should be along a quasi-stationary
boundary from the central Plains into the Ohio Valley, while some
rounds of rain are also possible in the north-central U.S. and
shower/thunderstorm chances will increase in Florida late next
week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent model guidance remains in mostly good agreement with the
overall pattern at least through the middle of next week, though
uncertainty in the details lingers. Despite some small scale
shortwave differences within the eastern trough, guidance
continues to show it lifting out of the U.S. on Wednesday with
some separation from a deep closed low over the Hudson Bay that
looks to linger for several days next week. Models still vary with
the potential for another shortwave traversing near the
U.S./Canada border on Wednesday into Thursday, with the 00Z GFS
the strongest/deepest and the 00Z UKMET on the deeper side as
well. The 06Z and 12Z GFS runs backed off on this feature though.
Though these shortwaves are small scale, they impact positions of
the fronts and rainfall/convection. Despite the differences, it
seems the best approach was a middle ground so the WPC forecast
for days 3-4 was based on composite blend of the deterministic
models led by the 00Z ECMWF, which seemed most consistent across
the board.

By around day 5/Thursday, overall models agree that the upper low
spinning off the British Columbia coast through the short to early
medium range period should shift southeast into the Pacific
Northwest, or at least the energy from it will--models are quite
variable with the details of embedded upper lows within the trough
being created by this digging energy, which is impacted by
potential interaction with the Hudson Bay low as well. CMC runs
have shown a more shallow trough that is faster to move eastward
compared to GFS and ECMWF runs. The northern Plains is a
particularly uncertain region late week as far as a ridge or
trough in the upper flow. The WPC forecast for the latter part of
the period phased out the CMC in favor of the GEFS and EC means,
turning into about an even blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean/06Z
GFS/GEFS mean by day 7, which maintained good continuity from the
previous WPC forecast.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the southern Plains and then eventually
rising heights farther east over the Deep South will promote a
broad area of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the
period. The greatest and most lasting anomalies through the period
should be over Texas (persisting from the short range time frame)
where some locations could see highs up to 15-25F above normal,
with numerous daily record highs likely. Parts of the Southwest
into the central Great Basin and southern/central Rockies can
expect highs around 10F above average into midweek before a
cooling trend as the deeper troughing presses inland. However,
warm to hot temperatures could increase for the southeastern
quadrant of the U.S. later next week, with potential for daily
record highs, and warmer than average temperatures by 10-20F
should expand in coverage across the Ohio Valley to Eastern
Seaboard by the end of the week.

A warm front lifting through the Mid-Mississippi Valley and Ohio
Valley will provide a focus for multiple areas of showers and
storms/convective complexes during the middle to latter part of
next week. The ingredients are in place for heavy rainfall
somewhere, though the specifics of coverage and amounts are
uncertain, but at least a localized flood threat is likely
especially if heavy rain falls in areas that are sensitive to
additional rainfall. Rounds of likely lighter rainfall are
possible across the north-central U.S. through the latter half of
the week as well. Additionally, tropical moisture increasing
across the Florida peninsula late next week could lead to a more
rainy pattern there.

After a couple of initial fronts crossing the Northwest, the main
well-defined front ahead of the deepening trough will bring
unseasonably cool temperatures to the Northwest and expanding into
the northern Rockies and High Plains by late week. This will also
provide support for a notable round of precipitation, with
lowering snow levels in the Cascades to Northern Rockies as the
week progresses, with some chance of snow even into northern parts
of the High Plains, though with very low confidence at this point.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat May 14 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

...Severe thunderstorms expected from parts of the
Mid-Missouri/Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley on Sunday...

...Persistent record-breaking heat forecast across the Southwest
and southern Plains through early next week...

...Scattered showers and thunderstorms could pose an isolated
severe and flash flood risk across parts of the East and Northwest
over the next few days...

The biggest weather story through the beginning of next week is
anticipated to be related to the severe weather potential on
Sunday. An approaching cold front is forecast to collide with a
warm and moist airmass situated over the Mid-South, leading to a
developing complex of thunderstorms near the Mid-Missouri Valley.
These storms are then expected to progress south and east through
the evening hours into the Ozarks, Mid-Mississippi and lower Ohio
valleys. Damaging wind gusts are the greatest threat in this area,
with large hail and tornadoes also possible. For this reason, SPC
has issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) for severe thunderstorms
across southern Missouri, southeast Kansas, northeast Oklahoma,
and northern Arkansas on Sunday. Thunderstorms will also be
capable of intense rainfall rates, which may lead to isolated
instances of flash flooding.

Record-breaking heat is set to continue from the Southwest to the
southern Plains underneath a stagnant upper-level ridge. Highs
into the triple digits will be widespread across the Desert
Southwest and central Texas on Sunday and Monday. Mid-to-upper 90s
will extend throughout the remainder of the southern Plains and
into the lower Mississippi Valley. Luckily, lows will dip into the
upper 60s and low 70s for most locations and offer a few hours of
relief. Early season heat can be particularly dangerous,
especially if proper heat safety is not followed.

Elsewhere, a warm and humid airmass over much of the eastern U.S.
will lead to scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms through
the end of the weekend before eventually a more organized area
thunderstorms approaches on Monday along a cold front. A few
storms may turn severe across the Northeast and northern
Mid-Atlantic on Monday, as well as containing the threat of
isolated flash flooding. For the Northwest, showers and
thunderstorms may also lead to areas of heavy rain and flash flood
concerns from the Blue Mountains of Oregon towards the Bitterroot
Valley of northwest Montana on Sunday.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level ridge will translate eastward across the Southwest
today. A very dry airmass is in place across the Southwest with
single digit dewpoints across most of the region. However, winds
will be light beneath this ridge which should subdue fire weather
concerns for most of the Southwest. A cold front will move southward
across the Plains Sunday afternoon with strong winds expected in the
wake of this front. Some of these strong northeasterly winds may
overlap regions with low relative humidity in the Texas/Oklahoma
Panhandles into southwest Kansas and far southwest Colorado. Some
critical conditions may occur across the northwest Texas Panhandle
and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. However, the area with the best
chance for 3 or more hours of these conditions will be very
isolated. Therefore, locally critical conditions are possible, but
more widespread critical conditions are not expected.

...Severe thunderstorms likely across Mississippi Valley and
Midwest today; East Coast on Monday...

...Potentially record breaking heat to persist across Southwest
and Southern Plains over next couple of days...

...Unsettled weather over Northwest and Great Plains...

Showers and thunderstorms will focus along a cold front slowly
tracking across the Midwest this afternoon/evening. Some
thunderstorms will be severe, particularly over parts of the
Middle Mississippi Valley and eastern Central/Southern Plains
where a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms is in effect. Damaging
wind gusts and large hail will be the primary threats, especially
within the Enhanced Risk area which encompasses parts of southern
Missouri, northern Arkansas, southeastern Kansas and northwestern
Oklahoma. Isolated areas of heavy rain leading to flash flooding
may occur over parts of southwestern Missouri into northwestern
Arkansas. Showers and thunderstorms will then move into the Ohio
Valley and East Coast on Monday. A Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms is in effect over parts of the interior Northeast
and Mid-Atlantic where locally damaging winds, some hail and a
tornado are possible.

Persistent upper-level ridging across the Southwest and Southern
Plains will be responsible potentially record breaking heat to
visit those areas over the next several days. Highs in the 90s and
100s will tie or break widespread high temperature records over
the Southwest, Texas, Oklahoma and western Louisiana/Arkansas.
Records are forecast to continue to be challenged across the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley heading into mid-week
as the Southwest moderates a bit on Monday. Highs over
north-central Texas are forecast to be 20-30 degrees above average
today and Tuesday. Relatively warm, dry and breezy conditions will
contribute to an elevated fire weather risk over parts of the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle today and eastern New Mexico on Monday.

Shortwave energy moving across the West will spawn showers and
thunderstorms across parts of the Northwest this
afternoon/evening. The associated low pressure system will
strengthen as it enters the foothills of the Rockies on Monday
afternoon, spreading more showers and thunderstorm activity into
the Front Range and Great Plains. Severe thunderstorms are
possible across portions of southeastern Nebraska, northern
Kansas, northwestern Missouri and southwestern Iowa.

0153 AM CDT Sun May 15 2022

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will start to weaken on Monday as a series of weak
shortwave troughs move through the central Rockies. As a result,
weak lee cyclogenesis is anticipated in eastern Colorado. This
strengthening pressure gradient, combined with some deeper mixing
bringing stronger mid-level flow to the surface, should lead to 15
to 25 mph winds across portions of the Southwest and
southern/central High Plains. Some critical conditions appear
likely, but a more confined region where 20+ mph winds are
anticipated is not clear at this time.

A dryline will be in place across eastern Colorado and eastern New
Mexico on Monday which will separate single digit relative humidity
to the west from 20 to 25 percent relative humidity to the east.
Thunderstorms are likely along this dryline Monday afternoon in an
airmass with PWAT values at or below 0.8 inches. Therefore, any
storms which form will likely be drier. In addition, fuels in this
region are exceptionally dry which will further exacerbate fire
weather concerns from any dry thunderstorms.

...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. through this week with anomalous heat expanding into the East
by next weekend...


...Overview...

Upper troughing should shift out of the Northeast as the period
begins on Wednesday, with broad ridging to zonal flow behind
across the rest of the lower 48. The pattern is expected to
amplify later in the week as upper troughing digs in the West,
yielding cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in a round
of precipitation spreading across the Northwest. Stubborn ridging
across the South will continue to promote unseasonably hot
weather, with the most persistent and record-breaking heat
centered in Texas and Louisiana. Warmer than normal temperatures
are forecast to spread eastward as the ridge amplifies ahead of
the trough in the West, and the heat should finally break by next
weekend across the South. The best focus for showers and
thunderstorms should be along a quasi-stationary boundary from the
central Plains into the Ohio Valley, while some rounds of rain are
also possible in the north-central U.S. and shower/thunderstorm
chances will increase in Florida late next week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent model guidance has come into better agreement early in the
period with ejecting trough energy in the Northeast and also a
weak shortwave through the northern tier Wednesday-Thursday. After
this, models agree the pattern should become more amplified late
period, but with varying degrees of seperation between another
stronger shortwave across the northern Plains and also energy
digging across the Intermountain West. Yesterdays 12z run of the
CMC was the greatest outlier showing a faster and more conhesive
trough through the West late week, while the ECMWF and GFS (and
UKMET before it phases out after day 5) exhibited better
seperation of streams. However, the 12z ECMWF was more bullish on
digging the southern stream energy farther south into the
Southwest, while subsequently buidling a stronger ridge across the
East. Todays 00z ECMWF (available after forecast generation time)
came in a little less amplified and more in line with the GFS and
CMC, but there is still so much uncertainty in the details. WPCs
forecast for tonight used a blend of the deterministic models
early on trending quickly towards the ensemble means late period
which resulted in a good middle ground approach. Some
deterministic ECMWF and GFS were maintained through day 7 though
just for some added system definition to the normally washed out
means.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the southern Plains and then eventually
rising heights farther east over the Deep South will promote a
broad area of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the
period. The greatest and most lasting anomalies through the period
should be over Texas (persisting from the short range time frame)
where some locations could see highs up to 15-25F above normal,
with numerous daily record highs likely. Parts of the Southwest
into the central Great Basin and southern/central Rockies can
expect highs around 10F above average on Wednesday before a
cooling trend as the deeper troughing presses inland. However,
warm to hot temperatures could increase for the southeastern
quadrant of the U.S. later next week, with potential for daily
record highs, and warmer than average temperatures by 10-20F
should expand in coverage across the Ohio Valley to Eastern
Seaboard by next week.

A warm front lifting through the Mid-Mississippi Valley and Ohio
Valley will provide a focus for multiple areas of showers and
storms/convective complexes during the middle to latter part of
next week. The ingredients are in place for heavy rainfall, though
the specifics of coverage and amounts are uncertain, but at least
a localized flood threat is likely especially if heavy rain falls
in areas that are sensitive to additional rainfall. Organized
rainfall, heavy at times, is likely along a frontal boundary
through the north-central U.S. later in the week with potential
for at least localized flood and flash flood threats given very
wet antecedent conditions across that region. Additionally,
tropical moisture increasing across the Florida peninsula late
next week could lead to a more rainy pattern for the Sunshine
state.

After a couple of initial fronts crossing the Northwest, the main
well-defined front ahead of the deepening trough will bring
unseasonably cool temperatures to the Northwest and expanding into
the northern Rockies and High Plains by late week. This will also
provide support for a notable round of precipitation, with
lowering snow levels in the Cascades to Northern Rockies as the
week progresses, with some chance of snow even into northern parts
of the High Plains, though with very low confidence at this point.

Valid 301700Z - 011200Z

No changes to the previous forecast. See the discussion below for

..Wendt.. 09/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Thu Sep 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Split mid-level low will persist across much of the CONUS as a weak
upper low moves across the southern Rockies/Southwest. Across the
center of the country, widespread shower and thunderstorm activity
will accompany the upper low at the start of a cooler and wetter
pattern. To the west, ridging and high pressure over the West Coast
and Great Basin will support warm and dry offshore winds across much
of central and southern California.

...Southern California...
Persistent north/northeasterly surface pressure gradients are
forecast to intensify early this morning as high pressure
strengthens across the southern Great Basin. At the same time, the
western edge of the weak upper low over the southern Rockies will
drive mid-level northerly flow across much of southern California.
Increasing gradient winds, and the additional upper-level support
should support weak to moderate offshore winds with stronger gusts
possible through the higher terrain. The dry source region and
downslope drying should favor very low surface RHs of 7-15%. Given
the presence of dry fuels, elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions are likely.

The greatest confidence in sustained elevated to near critical fire
weather conditions is expected to be above 1000 feet, away from the
moderating influence of the surface marine layer. The presence of
stronger wind gusts through terrain-favored gaps (30+ mph) also
suggest some potential for locally critical conditions to develop
this afternoon. More localized elevated fire weather conditions may
also occur through the higher terrain of the North Bay Hills.
However, weaker offshore flow, driven primarily by a thermally
induced surface pressure trough, is expected to limit greater fire
weather potential farther north across west-central California.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 30 2021

SYNOPSIS: A strong 500-hPa ridge with positive anomalies centered south of
Hudson Bay will drift northeastward and slowly weaken. Farther west, the
northern reaches of another ridge - with height anomalies centered over the
North Pacific - moves through eastern Alaska early in the period. Elsewhere=
,
there is significant model disagreement on three 500-hPa systems that could
impact the United States: In the Southeast, a mid-level low will likely cut
off
from the main circulation and bring a period of unsettled weather to the
region. Meanwhile, a positively-tilted trough moves into western North
America,
likely followed by another trough dropping into the western CONUS that may
bring strong winds to the Plains and heavy snow to the higher elevations in
the
northern Rockies, Cascades, and Sierra Nevada. In Alaska, one or more surfa=
ce
low pressure centers associated with an advancing mid-level storm system wi=
ll
bring above-normal precipitation to much of Alaska and potentially high win=
ds
to western parts of the state. But the models vary significantly regarding
details on the strength, timing, and position of all three systems; enough
uncertainty to preclude posting week-2 hazards at this time.



HAZARDS

No hazards posted.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY OCTOBER 03 - THURSDAY OCTOBER 07:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!ugAkJkKo_5Cg0vX-UCvUjuiWxVxW2AW-Z9nvPNiRs9oCyZivGzgcY2DMknQ2X=
-gNmL8EJLw8$

FOR FRIDAY OCTOBER 08 - THURSDAY OCTOBER 14: A transient 500-hPa ridge is
expected to be moving east away from Alaska as the period begins. Over the
ensuing couple of days, a strong low-pressure center is expected to move
northeastward through the Bering Sea into the Chukchi Sea October 9-10. Thi=
s
will bring above-normal precipitation and gusty winds to the Aleutians and
most
of western Alaska, but models are generally weaker with the surface low
pressure than yesterday, remaining above 970-hPa. Above-normal precipitatio=
n
and gusty winds will accompany the storm, but likely should remain below
hazards thresholds. Over the last half of the period, one or two weaker sto=
rm
systems traverse the North Pacific just south of Alaska. These are not like=
ly
to generate extreme weather over Alaska, but their evolution as they travel
toward western Canada and CONUS could have a marked effect on weather in
western sections of CONUS.



Ensemble means depict a slowly progressive and de-amplifying 500-hPa patter=
n
progressing eastward through North America during week-2. They show the str=
ong
anomalous ridge dominating eastern North America drifting northeastward and
slowly weakening while a positively-tilted trough with negative 500-hPa hei=
ght
anomalies moves into the West Coast, then similarly drifts eastward and
weakens. However, operational model runs and some individual ensemble membe=
rs
depict a substantially more active weather pattern. Following the initial
positively-tilted trough, the models bring one or two of the systems in the
North Pacific southeastward near or just off the CONUS West Coast, resultin=
g
in
a deep mid-level trough or a closed low pressure center across or near the
region. The details of this evolution vary significantly, even among the
models
that agree on this general scenario. Some develop a sharp, progressive
mid-level trough in western CONUS...some show interaction with the initial
positively-tilted trough, forming a closed low pressure center broadly acro=
ss
the western CONUS..and some drop the southward-moving systems into the east=
ern
North Pacific, either developing a cutoff 500-hPa low southwest of Californ=
ia,
or moving a few weaker 500-hPa systems through the western CONUS. Some
solutions would yield heavy higher-elevation snows in the northern Rockies,
Sierra Nevada, and southern Cascades while strong southerly winds east of t=
he
system across the southern Plains. But with models showing such a broad arr=
ay
of possible evolutions, confidence in heavy snow or strong winds in  any
particular location or time frame is too low to post either hazard.



Models are in better agreement than yesterday depicting a mid-level trough =
or
cutoff circulation forming in the Southeast, to the south of the strong rid=
ge
and associated surface high pressure center in eastern Canada and the
northeastern CONUS. But similar to the aforementioned system in western CON=
US,
models diverge significantly on the timing and strength of this system, wit=
h
some developing a slow-moving mid-level storm that brings heavy precipitati=
on
into parts of the southeastern quarter of CONUS. However, with models quite
diverse regarding the location and timing of heavy precipitation - and with
some keeping most or all heavy precipitation off the East Coast - there is =
not
enough confidence in any particular scenario to justify posting heavy
precipitation hazards at this time.



The storm systems potentially affecting Alaska, the western CONUS, and the
southeastern CONUS will continue to be scrutinized in the coming days for
increased model consensus that could justify posting week-2 hazards.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Thu Sep 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Weak ridging persistent over the West Coast through the last several
days will being to yield to weak troughing across the eastern
Pacific Friday, as the upper low over the Southwest and southern
Rockies moves northeastward into the Plains. At the surface,
lingering high pressure over the Great Basin will continue to
support weak offshore flow across warm and dry southern California.
Some local fire weather potential may remain across portions of the
southern California coastal ranges through Friday given surface RH
of 10-15%, gusty terrain winds, and very dry fuels. However,
weakening mid-level flow should greatly limit the stronger downslope
winds through the day, generating little confidence in widespread
fire weather concerns.

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 03 2021 - 12Z Thu Oct 07 2021

...Overview...

The medium range pattern will take on a more blocky appearance as
an upper low closes off over the east-central U.S. while an upper
ridge/high builds over the northern tier states and southern
Canada. A leading wavy front will spread rainfall of varying
intensity across the eastern third of the country. Meanwhile an
eastern Pacific upper trough should steadily amplify and become
more elongated through the period, pushing a cold front into the
Northwest and California. An upper low initially southwest of
California will eject northeastward ahead of the upper trough and
may produce some areas of rainfall over parts of the Interior
West/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Latest models and means generally agree on the general pattern
evolution but multi-day continuity suggests that details of the
east-central U.S. upper low are somewhat of a moving target. The
most common theme in the models/means is for a south or southeast
trend over the past couple days. However the full ensemble suite
shows the 00Z GFS may have been too far south, while the 00Z ECMWF
appears a bit east of consensus for the overall trough axis
especially around day 5 Tuesday. The 06Z GFS wobbled somewhat
north/west of the 00Z run, leaving a compromise of the 00Z
ECMWF/06Z GFS and their respective means (along with some 00Z
CMC/UKMET input early) as a reasonable starting point for the
forecast. Adjustments made by the new 12Z GFS/CMC/ECMWF provide
reasonable support for the preferred blend while the 12Z UKMET
strays increasingly northwest of consensus after early Tuesday.

The eastern Pacific upper trough nearing the West Coast has
reasonable continuity but there is some spread and variability for
how energy will be distributed within the feature. This leads to
some run-to-run adjustments for specifics of the leading cold
front and embedded waves. A model/mean blend looks good for this
part of the forecast. For the upper low initially southwest of
California and ejects northeastward ahead of the trough, the main
consideration was to eliminate the 00Z CMC from the forecast by
the latter half of the period since it became fast/weak versus
other models. The new 12Z run looks considerably better and other
models maintain continuity.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany the wavy frontal
system that pushes across the central and eastern U.S. during the
weekend/early next week and then possibly stalls near the
Southeast coast by midweek. Best focus for some areas of moderate
to heavy rainfall will extend from the Great Lakes into the
Tennessee/Mississippi Valleys as well as into the Northeast
Sunday-Monday. Then the upper low settling over the east-central
U.S. may keep areas of rainfall over parts of the East through at
least Thursday. Some locations could see significant totals,
whether from an episode of heavy rain and/or multi-day
accumulation due to persistence of the pattern. Guidance
variability and spread up to this point keep confidence in
specifics fairly low but one area to monitor will be the Southern
Appalachians where terrain enhancement may be a factor. Expect the
upper low ejecting northeastward into the West to generate a
period of rainfall over parts of the Southwest, eastern Great
Basin, and parts of the Rockies mainly around Tuesday-Wednesday.
The front pushing into the Pacific Northwest and northern
California will spread areas of rain gradually southeastward with
time. Most activity should be in the light-moderate range but a
few pockets of heavier rain could be possible.

The upper ridge traversing the north-central U.S. will support
warmer than average temperatures across the Northern Plains and
vicinity through the period. Plus 10-20F anomalies, and possibly
slightly higher near the Canadian border Tuesday-Wednesday, would
equate to highs in the upper 70s and 80s. A mild to warm Sunday
over portions of the East will give way to highs trending toward
normal thereafter with the passage of a wavy cold front.
Persistence of clouds and areas of rain should maintain decent
coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies for morning lows
though. The West Coast will see moderately below normal daytime
highs beginning around midweek as the upper trough approaches and
the cold front makes its way through the region.

...Heavy rain and scattered flash flooding possible across the New
Mexico into southern Plains into Lower Mississippi Valley over the
next few days...

...Severe weather with large hail and locally damaging wind gusts
are possible across parts of West Texas today...

...Well above average temperatures continue across the Midwest and
Upper Great Lakes as cooler air surges into the central/southern
Rockies...

Overall the flow across the lower 48 remains generally weak with
exception of fast moving storms/cold fronts clipping the Pacific
northwest that today will produce 2-3 inches of rainfall across
the Olympic Peninsula, while the next storm will approach the same
area by the end of the short range forecast period on Saturday
evening.

Otherwise, the bigger weather producer is associated with
upper-level closed low crossing the Central to Southern Rockies
into the Southern Plains through the end of the week.  An
advancing cold front across the Central Plains will slowly advance
today but begin to stall out and only slowly drift eastward across
the Central and southern Plains by this weekend.  Behind the
front, anomalously cold air will keep day time highs running about
10-20 degrees below normal peaking across Colorado and northern
New Mexico on Friday before staying cooler but more modified on
Saturday.  Ahead of the front will be slightly warmer, but the key
element will be return above normal moisture crossing Texas into
the southern/central Plains.  Today, stronger thunderstorms will
be in proximity to the dry line acorss West Texas with the threat
of large hail and damaging wind with the Storm Prediction Center
placing a Slight Risk (level 2/5) across this area.   However,
given slow cell motions and ample moisture, larger Slight Risk
(level 2/4) for Excessive Rainfall has been issued by the Weather
Prediction Center (WPC), with possible flash flooding across a
broader area of much of Western to northwestern Texas; as well as
a secondary area of threats over north-central New Mexico.   A
Marginal risk (level 1/4), expands further north into eastern
Central Plains and portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley where
flash flooding potential is possible but likely to be more widely
scattered than in Texas/New Mexico.  This threat for heavy
rainfall, slowly advances east to Central Texas with a Slight Risk
(level 2/4) and possible flash flooding on Friday becomes more
isolated on Saturday across Missouri to East Texas (per Marginal
Risk by WPC)

North of the heavy rainfall threat, weak flow aloft will keep the
Rockies front stalled across the eastern Northern Plains through
the forecast period.  Continued southerly flow will keep heat
packed in with highs remaining 10-20 degrees above normal across
the Upper Midwest toward the Great Lakes through Saturday.

Another broader deeper cold closed low will continue to be stalled
over far southeast Canada and continue to usher in colder Canadian
air across the Northeast for the next two day.  High temperatures
in the 50s and 60s are above 7-15 degrees below average for much
of New England while 70s across the eastern Mid-Atlantic keeping
slightly below average but very fresh and pleasant before heat
comes back for the weekend.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Thu Sep 30 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR OCTOBER 2021

The update to the October monthly temperature and precipitation outlook
released in mid-September primarily considered and utilized the latest
ensemble
model guidance at multiple time scales. Modifications to the precipitation
outlook are more substantial than that for temperature in the update.



The MJO is less coherent now than observed in late August and early Septemb=
er.
Anomalous tropical convection appears to be taking on a more interannual,
somewhat more stationary flavor in recent weeks with enhanced convection
primarily remaining across the eastern Indian Ocean and Maritime continent
region with suppressed convection preferred over the western Hemisphere. Th=
is
suggests the equatorial Pacific atmospheric and oceanic state is slowly
transitioning to La Nina conditions. The MJO did not play a substantial rol=
e
in
the outlook. Current anomalous soil moisture conditions also did not play a
substantial role due to the time of the year.



One factor that is likely to have some impact in the eventual October longw=
ave
pattern and so the monthly mean temperature and total precipitation amounts=
 is
the degree to which recurving tropical cyclones currently in the western
Pacific will be entrained and affect the mid-latitude flow over the Pacific
Ocean and North America. Tropical cyclone activity is likely to remain
enhanced
in the western Pacific and October is a peak month for recurving typhoons i=
nto
the mean westerly flow. These conditions consequently considerably increase
uncertainty in the updated October outlook.



Dynamical model guidance across time scales supports elevated odds of
above-normal monthly mean temperature for most of the CONUS with the greate=
st
odds in the northern Plains, upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes. Warm=
er
than normal temperatures are favored from medium-, extended- and
subseasonal-range model guidance in this region. Changes from the previous
mid-September outlook include the addition of favored above-normal
temperatures
for parts of the Southeast and Gulf coast where Equal-Chances (EC) was
previously indicated. More troughing and cooler temperatures in the most
recent
model guidance supports the addition of a small area of favored below-norma=
l
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest and a reduction in forecast coverage =
of
favored above-normal temperatures in the Southwest. Elevated odds for
below-normal temperatures are increased in coverage for areas in Alaska as
troughing in the mean remains most likely.



For precipitation, the updated October outlook remains similar to the
mid-September release for the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For the remaind=
er
of the CONUS, however, the forecast indicates considerable differences in s=
ome
areas from that released earlier in the month. Model guidance favors trough=
ing
at times entering the CONUS and impacting portions of the western and centr=
al
U.S.. This pattern and evolution should create a favorable environment in
these
regions during periods of the first half of October for elevated odds for
above-normal monthly total precipitation amounts from eastern areas of the
Southwest northward and eastward to include much of the High and Great Plai=
ns
as well as much of the Mississippi Valley. Confident predictions from
extended-
and subseasonal-range ensemble model guidance for below-normal precipitatio=
n
supports elevated odds for below-normal precipitation for the Northeast and
parts of the mid-Atlantic. There remains, however, concerns for potential
tropical development in the northwest Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico and
north-northeast movement in October during the second peak of the Atlantic
hurricane season. This conflicts with some ensemble model support for a dry
start to October for parts of the far eastern Southeast, lower Atlantic
seaboard and the eastern Gulf coast, thus EC is forecast for the region in
place of the favored above-normal precipitation depicted in the original
mid-September outlook.



***************************************************************************=
**

****               Previous mid-month discussion below                  ***=
**

***************************************************************************=
**




The October 2021 outlook is prepared with a backdrop of most likely develop=
ing
La Nina conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean both in the ocean and
atmosphere. The MJO, although not as coherent and well defined as during th=
e
months of July and August remains a factor in the outlook as does anteceden=
t
soil moisture conditions and coastal sea surface temperature anomalies.
Statistical, hybrid and dynamical model based forecast guidance contribute
significantly to the October outlook.



For temperature, the outlook depicts favored above-normal monthly mean Octo=
ber
temperatures for much of the contiguous U.S. with the region stretching fro=
m
the Southwest eastward to cover the Great Plains and extending across the O=
hio
Valley, Great Lakes, mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The greatest odds are
generally in the center of this highlighted region for a variety of factors
such as antecedent surface moisture departures from normal, prospects for
potential developing La Nina impacts as well as dynamical model forecast
information. Although the eventual evolution of the MJO and so its impacts =
on
the U.S. are uncertain given its current state, the MJO would favor
above-normal temperatures for much of the central and eastern contiguous U.=
S.
during the first two weeks of October.



Favored unsettled conditions and associated enhanced cloudiness and rainfal=
l
increase uncertainty near the Gulf Coast and so Equal-Chances (EC) is depic=
ted
in this region as well as in the Pacific Northwest where conflicting signal=
s
in
climate forecast tools and information are present.



Favored troughing to the north of Alaska and anomalous north to south
meridional flow supports elevated odds for below-normal temperatures for
portions of interior and southeast Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. This is
supported by much of the available dynamical model guidance as well as
potential impacts from developing La Nina conditions over the next six week=
s.
Above-normal sea surface temperatures in nearby coastal waters for the
Aleutians and southwest Alaska as well as some dynamical model guidance
support
modest odds for above-normal temperatures for southwest Alaska and the
Aleutians.



The October precipitation outlook is influenced by potential background La
Nina
and MJO impacts in some areas as well as both statistical forecast tools an=
d
dynamical model guidance. Elevated odds for below-normal October total
precipitation amounts is depicted for a region from California eastward to
include the Southwest, the central Rockies and the central and southern Gre=
at
Plains -- based on potential La Nina impacts and support from much of the
dynamical model guidance.



The most consistent signal in the forecast tools is for elevated probabilit=
ies
for above-normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest as depicted by mod=
el
guidance and consistent with La Nina impacts for this time of the year. Thi=
s
signal extends northward to include the Alaska Panhandle. Anticipated
anomalous
north to south meridional flow supports and is the basis for a small,
generally
weak tilt in the odds for below-normal precipitation for the south-central
portion of the state.



Across the eastern CONUS, a region of elevated odds for above-normal
precipitation is depicted from the Gulf coast, eastern seaboard and for par=
ts
of the Great Lakes and Northeast. The southern areas of this highlighted ar=
ea
are primarily based on potential tropical cyclone related impacts linked to
the
climatological secondary peak in tropical cyclone activity in October for
areas
in the northwest Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. In addition, a potential
factor later in the month could be the MJO influence of above-normal
precipitation in this region linked to MJO RMM phase 8 through 2. The forec=
ast
in this area is at odds for much of the dynamical model guidance where near=
-
to
below-normal monthly precipitation amounts are forecast, thus there is
considerable uncertainty in the forecast in this area.



The forecast for above-normal precipitation further north in the mid-Atlant=
ic,
much of the Great Lakes and Northeast is primarily related to long term
positive precipitation trends and supplemented by signals from some of the
dynamical model forecast output.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 06 - 10 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement on =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. An enhanced Pacific jet is noted n=
ear
the Aleutians in between a trough forecast over eastern Siberia and a ridge
predicted south of the Alaska Peninsula. Farther to the south, a trough off
the
West Coast of the CONUS is expected to slowly progress onshore by the end o=
f
the period. Strong ridging is forecast farther to the east across much of
north-central North America at the beginning of the period. This ridge is
forecast to progress to eastern Canada and the northeastern CONUS as time
progresses. A trough or closed upper low is forecast to undercut this ridge
over parts of the Southeast and Gulf Coast region throughout much of the
period. The manual 500-hPa height blend, based primarily on the ensemble me=
ans
from the GEFS and ECMWF, depicts above normal heights across the north-cent=
ral
and northeastern CONUS, the Southwest, and southern Alaska. Conversely, bel=
ow
normal heights are favored for most of the West and Gulf coasts of the CONU=
S,
parts of the Southeast, and parts of the western Aleutians.

With strong ridging forecast over north-central and northeastern North
America,
above normal temperatures are favored for the northern CONUS from the
Continental Divide eastward. Above normal temperatures are also likely for =
the
Southwest ahead of a trough predicted near the West Coast. As this trough
progresses inland, probabilities of below normal temperatures are increased
along much of the West Coast extending northward to southeastern Alaska. Ab=
ove
normal temperature probabilities are also reduced for much of the Gulf Coas=
t
region due to a persistent trough or closed mid-level low. A warming trend =
is
favored for western Alaska due to increased ridging predicted near the Alas=
ka
Peninsula leading to enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures
across
western Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians.

An active pattern is likely for Alaska as an enhanced Pacific jet is foreca=
st
to set up near the Aleutians. Therefore, probabilities of above normal
precipitation are elevated across most of the state. Above normal
precipitation
is also favored across much of the West Coast northeastward to the Northern
High Plains as a trough is forecast to push inland over the western CONUS.
Conversely, below normal precipitation is likely for the northeastern CONUS=
 as
well as parts of the central and southern High Plains due to a combination =
of
predicted above normal 500-hPa heights and mean surface high pressure. Abov=
e
normal precipitation is the most likely outcome for the Southeast due to a
predicted weakness in the subtropical ridge across the region and forecast
mean
onshore flow from the Atlantic.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 08 - 14 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa flow pattern is generally forecast to
become less amplified and less stable with time. An enhanced Pacific jet is
forecast to persist across southwestern Alaska into week-2. As time
progresses,
increased troughing is noted across the state towards the end of the period=
.
The pattern is forecast to become increasingly active across the western CO=
NUS
as cyclonic flow is forecast to take hold from the West Coast to the Plains
for
much of the period.  Strong downstream ridging predicted over northeastern
North America is forecast to deamplify and progress eastward by the end of
week-2. An undercutting trough across the Gulf Coast region is forecast to
persist into week-2 and then slowly dissipate toward the middle and end of =
the
period. The week-2 500-hPa manual height blend, based mostly on the GEFS an=
d
ECMWF ensemble means, features above normal heights across the northeastern
CONUS as well as for parts of southwestern Alaska with below normal heights
more likely over much of the western CONUS.

With mean troughing expected to push eastward across the western CONUS, bel=
ow
normal temperatures are favored west of the Rockies and northward to
southeastern Alaska. Above normal temperatures are likely for most areas to
the
east of the Rockies ahead of the forecast trough.  Milder than normal
conditions are also favored for much of western Alaska, associated with mea=
n
ridging forecast south of the Alaska Peninsula.

An active pattern is likely to persist for much of Alaska as enhanced Pacif=
ic
flow is forecast to continue into week-2. Probabilities of above normal
precipitation are enhanced across most of the state with the exception of t=
he
Panhandle. Farther to the south, as cyclonic flow expands eastward across t=
he
western CONUS, above normal precipitation is favored from the West Coast to
the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. A drier than normal pattern is likely
farther to the east across the northeastern CONUS, associated with predicte=
d
mean surface high pressure. Mean onshore flow to the south of this surface
high
leads to elevated probabilities of above normal precipitation across the
Southeast. Conversely, below normal precipitation is slightly favored for
parts
of the southern High Plains supported by dynamical model guidance and the
majority of analogs constructed from the various model solutions.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered=
 on
Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 15=
%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
fairly
good agreement among the ensemble mean solutions, offset by discrepancies
among
precipitation guidance and among the individual deterministic model runs fr=
om
the GFS.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
449 PM EDT Thu Sep 30 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 03 2021 - 12Z Thu Oct 07 2021

...Overview...

The medium range pattern will take on a more blocky appearance as
an upper low closes off over the east-central U.S. while an upper
ridge/high builds over the northern tier states and southern
Canada. A leading wavy front will spread rainfall of varying
intensity across the eastern third of the country. Meanwhile an
eastern Pacific upper trough should steadily amplify and become
more elongated through the period, pushing a cold front into the
Northwest and California. An upper low initially southwest of
California will eject northeastward ahead of the upper trough and
may produce some areas of rainfall over parts of the Interior
West/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Latest models and means generally agree on the general pattern
evolution but multi-day continuity suggests that details of the
east-central U.S. upper low are somewhat of a moving target. The
most common theme in the models/means is for a south or southeast
trend over the past couple days. However the full ensemble suite
shows the 00Z GFS may have been too far south, while the 00Z ECMWF
appears a bit east of consensus for the overall trough axis
especially around day 5 Tuesday. The 06Z GFS wobbled somewhat
north/west of the 00Z run, leaving a compromise of the 00Z
ECMWF/06Z GFS and their respective means (along with some 00Z
CMC/UKMET input early) as a reasonable starting point for the
forecast. Adjustments made by the new 12Z GFS/CMC/ECMWF provide
reasonable support for the preferred blend while the 12Z UKMET
strays increasingly northwest of consensus after early Tuesday.

The eastern Pacific upper trough nearing the West Coast has
reasonable continuity but there is some spread and variability for
how energy will be distributed within the feature. This leads to
some run-to-run adjustments for specifics of the leading cold
front and embedded waves. A model/mean blend looks good for this
part of the forecast. For the upper low initially southwest of
California and ejects northeastward ahead of the trough, the main
consideration was to eliminate the 00Z CMC from the forecast by
the latter half of the period since it became fast/weak versus
other models. The new 12Z run looks considerably better and other
models maintain continuity.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany the wavy frontal
system that pushes across the central and eastern U.S. during the
weekend/early next week and then possibly stalls near the
Southeast coast by midweek. Best focus for some areas of moderate
to heavy rainfall will extend from the Great Lakes into the
Tennessee/Mississippi Valleys as well as into the Northeast
Sunday-Monday. Then the upper low settling over the east-central
U.S. may keep areas of rainfall over parts of the East through at
least Thursday. Some locations could see significant totals,
whether from an episode of heavy rain and/or multi-day
accumulation due to persistence of the pattern. Guidance
variability and spread up to this point keep confidence in
specifics fairly low but one area to monitor will be the Southern
Appalachians where terrain enhancement may be a factor. Expect the
upper low ejecting northeastward into the West to generate a
period of rainfall over parts of the Southwest, eastern Great
Basin, and parts of the Rockies mainly around Tuesday-Wednesday.
The front pushing into the Pacific Northwest and northern
California will spread areas of rain gradually southeastward with
time. Most activity should be in the light-moderate range but a
few pockets of heavier rain could be possible.

The upper ridge traversing the north-central U.S. will support
warmer than average temperatures across the Northern Plains and
vicinity through the period. Plus 10-20F anomalies, and possibly
slightly higher near the Canadian border Tuesday-Wednesday, would
equate to highs in the upper 70s and 80s. A mild to warm Sunday
over portions of the East will give way to highs trending toward
normal thereafter with the passage of a wavy cold front.
Persistence of clouds and areas of rain should maintain decent
coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies for morning lows
though. The West Coast will see moderately below normal daytime
highs beginning around midweek as the upper trough approaches and
the cold front makes its way through the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1200 AM CDT Fri Oct 01 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level trough is forecast to move from the Four Corners
region this morning into the central/southern Plains through
tonight. Meanwhile, weak mid-level ridging across the western CONUS
is forecast to move eastward into the Great Basin and northern
Rockies in the wake of the Four Corners trough. As this occurs,
another weak trough will move quickly across the Northwest. At the
surface, a persistent area of weak surface high pressure over the
Great Basin will continue to promote dry offshore flow across
portions of southern California.

...Southern California...
Locally elevated fire weather conditions are possible (especially in
terrain favored areas) this morning into the early afternoon as the
aforementioned weak offshore downslope flow overlaps critical RH
values of 5-15% and at least modestly receptive fuels. Fire weather
conditions should improve during the afternoon with sustained/gusty
winds decreasing as the surface pressure gradient relaxes.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1201 AM CDT Fri Oct 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Weak troughing is forecast to move from the northern Great Basin
into the central/northern Rockies Day 2/Saturday as weak ridging
returns to the western CONUS. Large scale fire weather concerns are
forecast to remain low across much of the CONUS due to poor overlap
of low RH, stronger surface winds, and receptive fuels. The one
exception may be across southern California, where lingering weak
offshore flow is expected due to a persistent area of surface high
pressure over the Great Basin. However, weaker surface pressure
gradients are forecast than prior days, which suggests any fire
weather conditions should remain rather localized/brief.

245 AM EDT Fri Oct 01 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Oct 04 2021 - 12Z Fri Oct 08 2021

...Overview...

Guidance continues to highlight an amplification of the medium
range weather pattern next week. The flow will take on a more
blocky appearance as an upper low closes off over the east-central
U.S. while an upper ridge/high builds over the northern tier
states and southern Canada. A leading wavy front and closed upper
trough/low support will spread rainfall of varying intensity and
duration across the eastern third of the country. Meanwhile an
eastern Pacific upper trough should steadily amplify and become
more elongated through the period, pushing a cold front into the
Northwest and California. An upper low initially offshore of
California will eject northeastward ahead of the upper trough and
may produce some areas of rainfall over parts of the Interior
West/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Latest models and ensembles means generally agree on the general
pattern evolution, but show marginal run to run continuity that
details of the east-central U.S. upper low. Meanwhile, the
amplifying eastern Pacific upper trough nearing the West Coast and
lead closed low ejection from offshore CA offer reasonable
continuity, but there is some spread and variability for how
energy will be distributed. This leads to some continuity
adjustments for specifics of a leading cold front and embedded
waves. Overall, a model and ensemble mean composite blend along
with the National Blend of Models was used as a reasonable basis
for the WPC product suite. This maintains reasonably good WPC
continuity.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany the wavy frontal
system that works across the central and eastern U.S. early next
week and then possibly stalls near the Southeast coast by midweek.
Best focus for some areas of locally moderate to heavy rainfall
will linger over the Northeast Monday, but meanwhile increasingly
focus over the Southeast. Then the upper low settling over the
east-central U.S. may keep areas of rainfall over parts of the
Southeast/East all next week with an uncertain/gradual focus
translation from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic. Some locations
could see significant totals, whether from an episode of heavy
rain and/or multi-day accumulation due to persistence of the
pattern. Guidance variability and spread up to this point keep
confidence in specifics fairly low, but one area to monitor will
be the Southern Appalachians where terrain enhancement may be a
factor.

Expect the upper low ejecting northeastward into the West to
generate a period of rainfall over parts of the Southwest, Great
Basin, and parts of the Rockies mainly around Tuesday-Wednesday.
The front pushing into the Pacific Northwest and northern
California will spread areas of rain gradually southeastward with
time mid-later next week. Most activity should be in the
light-moderate range, but a few pockets of heavier rain could be
possible. A few high elevations may see some snow. The West Coast
will see moderately below normal daytime highs beginning around
midweek as the upper trough approaches and the cold front makes
its way through the region. Downstream upper ridging traversing
the north-central U.S. will support warmer than average
temperatures across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week
with some plus 10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper
70s and 80s. Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the
emerging closed upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the
Southeast/East should moderate daytime temperatures,  but should
maintain decent coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies for
morning lows.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southern Plains through Saturday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern High Plains and the Upper/Middle Mississippi
Valley, including the Great Lakes...

A quasi-stationary front will be over the Upper Midwest to the
Southern Plains through Sunday.  Additionally, an upper-level low
positioned over the Southwest will slowly move northeastward to
the Middle Mississippi Valley while weakening by Sunday.  The
circulation around the upper-level low will aid in streaming
moisture over the Plains and Mississippi Valley and as far north
as the Great Lakes.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along
and near the boundary, with some storms producing heavy rain over
the Southern Plains.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms for much of
central/eastern Texas and southern Oklahoma.  The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through
Saturday morning.  The threat of excessive rainfall will lessen
slightly to a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Middle Mississippi Valley to parts of the Southern
Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley on Saturday into Sunday morning.
The axis of showers and thunderstorms will move into the Great
Lakes, extending southward across parts of the Ohio and
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valleys by Sunday.

Meanwhile, upper-level ridging ahead of this system will allow the
temperatures to be 10 to 20 degrees above average over parts of
the Northern High Plains, the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley and
the Great Lakes.  In contrast, the temperatures over the Southern
Rockies and Southern High Plains will be slightly below average.
Elsewhere, Air Quality Alerts are up over parts of the San Joaquin
Valley through Sunday.

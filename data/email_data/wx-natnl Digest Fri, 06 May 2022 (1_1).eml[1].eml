Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1013 AM CDT Thu May 05 2022

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

The Elevated risk area is expanded southward to encompass portions
of the Sacramento, Guadelupe, and Davis mountain ranges in southern
NM/southwest TX. Latest surface observations already show RH values
near 15% with further reduction likely by late afternoon amid deep
boundary-layer mixing. Relatively benign winds at the moment will
increase through the day as stronger mid-level flow at around 20-25
mph mixes down to the surface within, and in the lee of, the higher
terrain. Persistent elevated conditions appear likely, and
brief/localized critical conditions are possible. The forecast
regarding central NM and portions of southern NV remain on track.
See the previous discussion below for details.

..Moore.. 05/05/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1226 AM CDT Thu May 05 2022/

...Synopsis...
The central/southern Plains mid-level trough will continue its slow
progression eastward today. Across the West Coast, broadly cyclonic
flow will exist with a strong upper-level jet across the northern
Sierra. At the surface, fire weather concerns will be driven by weak
surface trough development in the Great Basin and in eastern New
Mexico.

...Central New Mexico...
Mid-level winds will be decreasing during the day. However, they
will be sufficient to induce a weak lee trough in the eastern
plains. Winds of 15-20 mph with perhaps some higher speeds in
terrain-favored areas. Dry air will once again be present with
afternoon RH falling to 10-15%.

...Southern Nevada...
Temperatures in the upper 80s to low 90s F will support afternoon RH
of 10-20% across much of Nevada. A weak surface trough in the Great
Basin will promote 15-20 mph winds. Elevated fire weather concerns
will exist where fuels have sufficiently dried.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
145 PM EDT Thu May 5 2022

Valid 12Z Sun May 8 2022 - 12Z Thu May 12 2022

...Heavy snow threat over a cold north-central Great Basin/Rockies
to contrast north-central U.S. convection and south-central U.S to
Midwest record heat as part of Omega-style block development over
the lower 48 and adjoining oceans this weekend into next week...

18Z Update: The 12Z model guidance suite is in very good synoptic
scale agreement for Sunday and into early Tuesday as an omega
block pattern develops over the central U.S., so a
multi-deterministic blend sufficed as a starting point in the
forecast process for that time period.  Noticeable differences
emerge with the 12Z CMC across the eastern Pacific and
southwestern U.S. by Wednesday, and it is weaker with the
shortwave trough ejecting eastward across the Rockies compared to
the consensus.  The past two runs of the CMC have trended with the
GFS and ECMWF regarding a retrograding low over the western
Atlantic and towards the Southeast Coast by the end of the week,
with the ECMWF taking this low farthest west.  Model preferences
for the latter half of the period maintained some of the GFS/ECMWF
whilst gradually increasing use of the ensemble means and some
previous WPC continuity.  In terms of sensible weather, the main
story will likely be the early season heat wave that is forecast
to encompass much of the south-central U.S. and into the Midwest,
with afternoon high temperatures running up to 20 degrees above
normal, and the potential for multiple daily record highs to be
set.  The previous forecast discussion follows below. /Hamrick
-------------------------

...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A composite of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS along with the 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian, ECMWF ensemble mean and 01 UTC National
Blend of Models seems to present a reasonable forecast basis while
tending to mitigate embedded system variance consistent with a
pattern with near normal predictability Sunday into Monday. The
GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means remain best clustered and
in line with WPC continuity and the NBM Tuesday-next Thursday.
Despite better similarities, recent run-run guidance continuity
issues still suggests some caution with embedded feature details,
especially days 5-7. Most of the newer 00 UTC guidance maintain
similar trends from earlier guidance, with the Canadian remaining
the most out of phase with other guidance with the timing/emphasis
on systems digging into the western U.S.upper trough.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system will track off the Mid-Atlantic Sunday. The low stalls and
retrogrades over the western Atlantic back toward the Southeast
coast mid-later next week with wrapping rains within a developing
Omega-style block.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramatic change over much of the West later this weekend into next
week as an amplified mean upper trough and wavy frontal systems
become established over the region. This will support significant
cooling to include spotty record values along with a widespread
precipitation focus from the Northwest/Sierra through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies. This will include a substantial
and lingering threat for widespread heavy snows as further
enhanced in favored terrain. Expect temperatures to range as much
as 10-20 degrees below normal.

Upper system ejections channeled between amplified eastern Pacific
upper ridging/upper troughing over the West and amplified
east-central U.S. upper ridging as part of the aforementioned
Omega-style block over the lower 48 and adjoining oceans will trap
a slow moving and wavy frontal zone over the north-central U.S. to
support an emerging but uncertain convection/rainfall pattern.
This offers a runoff threat given moist ambient Northern Plains
soil conditions. The Storm Prediction Center also highlights a
concern for severe weather into the eastern Central Plains for at
least Sunday and Monday. The pattern meanwhile favors record high
temperatures over the south-central U.S., with pre-frontal warmth
gradually building northeastward next week through the MS/TN
Valleys/Midwest under the upper ridge, in stark contrast to the
wintry conditions over the West and moderated/cooled high pressure
dammed airmass to linger over the East on the backside of a
difficult to dislodge western Atlantic circulation.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 05 2022

SYNOPSIS: An unusually strong area of mid-level high pressure for May is
likely
to result in a prolonged early season heatwave across the south-central U.S=
.
Mid-level low pressure is forecast over the western U.S. through the early
part
of week-2 which could result in thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall
across the northern and central Great Plains. Also, this pattern supports a=
n
increased risk of high winds throughout the entire Great Plains and parts o=
f
the Southwest. A low pressure system is expected to linger near the East Co=
ast
through next week. Springtime flooding remains a concern along the Red Rive=
r
of
the North and across central and eastern Mainland Alaska.



HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for the lower Mississippi Valley and western
Gulf
Coast, Fri-Thu, May 13-19.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the central and northern Great Plain=
s,
Fri-Sun, May 13-15.

Slight risk of high winds for the Great Plains and parts of the Southwest,
Fri-Sun, May 13-15.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast,
Fri-Sat, May 13-14.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the coastal Mid-Atlantic and Southea=
st,
Fri-Sat, May 13-14.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the western U.S.=
,
Fri-Sat, May 13-14.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible for central and eastern Mainland Alaska.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MAY 08 - THURSDAY MAY 12:

FOR FRIDAY MAY 13 - THURSDAY MAY 19: According to the National Blend of
Models,
numerous daily record highs (well into the 90s) are forecast across Texas a=
nd
the lower Mississippi Valley, beginning this weekend and continuing through
next week. The week-2 ensemble means remain in good agreement that 500-hPa
heights are at or above 582 dm over the south-central U.S. which is more
typical of a summertime ridge. Since the ensemble means maintain the streng=
th
of this ridging aloft for a longer duration compared to previous days, the
slight risk of excessive heat continues through the end of week-2. A slight
risk of excessive heat is posted for the lower Mississippi Valley and weste=
rn
Gulf Coast due to the prolonged early season heatwave and maximum heat inde=
x
values near or above 100F. Although heat index values may not meet heat
advisory criteria throughout the week-2 period, an excessive heat hazard is
necessary due to the likelihood of record-setting temperatures and the unus=
ual
heat for this time of year. Anomalous warmth is also likely farther to the
north across the Corn Belt and Great Lakes, but maximum temperatures into t=
he
80s are not considered hazardous.



Drier-than-normal conditions are expected to accompany the heat during the
next
two weeks which raises concerns for rapid onset of drought for northern and
eastern Texas. Since there could be heavy rainfall during the next 24 hours=
, a
rapid onset drought hazard is not posted but will be reevaluated in subsequ=
ent
outlooks.



A 500-hPa trough is forecast to progress eastward from the western to the
north-central U.S. from May 13 to 15. Due to the expansive and anomalous
500-hPa ridging downstream, the resultant storm track is likely to be shift=
ed
north from its climatological position for mid-May. Therefore, the most lik=
ely
area for thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall is expected to be focuse=
d
across the northern and central Great Plains. The 500-hPa trough and predic=
ted
surface low development supports a slight risk of high winds across parts o=
f
the Southwest and Great Plains. Any period of gusty winds could result in
blowing dust and will likely lead to an elevated wildfire risk from New Mex=
ico
eastward to the central and southern Great Plains due to the ongoing drough=
t.



Anomalous cold may linger into the beginning of week-2 across the West due =
to
the trough aloft and below normal 500-hPa heights. Based on the GEFS
reforecast
tool, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures (May 13-14) is posted
for
parts of the West where there is a 20 percent chance of minimum temperature=
s
falling into the lowest 15th percentile of the climatological distribution =
and
below 40 degrees F. As the 500-hPa trough progresses eastward and heights
rise,
a fast moderation in temperatures is likely by day 10, May 15.



Model solutions remain in good agreement and consistent that a mid-level
trough
separates from the westerlies and becomes a cut-off low near the East Coast
next week. Colder temperatures aloft, associated with this cut-off low, may
promote diurnal convection with locally heavy rain across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. In addition, upslope flow may enhance rainfall
amounts across the Central to Southern Appalachians. Therefore, a slight ri=
sk
of heavy precipitation (May 13-14) is added to the week-2 hazards map for
parts
of the eastern U.S. A slight risk of high winds is posted for the coastal
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast due to persistent, onshore flow continuing throu=
gh
early week-2. The multi-day enhanced onshore winds increase the chances of
large swells, beach erosion, and coastal flooding for the coastal Carolinas=
.



Flooding may persist throughout week-2 in the Red River Valley of the North=
,
and extend into part of the James River basin, due to recent snowmelt and
heavy
precipitation. Although cooler-than-normal temperatures may slow snowmelt, =
the
flooding possible hazard is maintained for Alaska. The latest model runs ar=
e
favoring a late-season snowfall, potentially heavy, for the Alaska and Broo=
ks
mountain ranges.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0118 PM CDT Thu May 05 2022

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

Elevated risk areas are introduced for portions of southern NV into
northwest AZ and southern UT as well as across northeast MT.
Widespread dry conditions remain likely across the Southwest
tomorrow, and latest ensemble guidance has trended towards higher
probability of 15-20 mph winds across portions of NV/AZ/UT where
fuels continue to dry. Patchy elevated conditions remain likely
across NM into CO, but weak winds aloft and poor ensemble consensus
limit confidence in the spatial extent and magnitude of the threat.
See the previous discussion for additional details for these
regions.

A passing mid-level wave across the northern Rockies will support
breezy conditions across northern MT during the afternoon hours.
Although diurnal RH reductions will likely only fall into the 20-30%
range, 15-20 mph winds gusting to 30 mph, coupled with dry fuels
(ERCs generally above the 80th percentile), will support at least
low-end fire weather concerns.

..Moore.. 05/05/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1227 AM CDT Thu May 05 2022/

...Synopsis...
Low-amplitude ridging will develop over the Southwest on Friday. The
broad western trough will shift east with time, increasing flow
across the Divide. At the surface, the pressure pattern will
generally remain weak over areas of dry fuels.

...New Mexico...
Locally elevated conditions are possible. Dry air will remain in
place and RH will fall to 5-15% during the afternoon. Surface winds
are expected to be weaker than on Thursday as are mid-level winds.
15-20 mph winds would be most likely around wind-prone terrain
features.

...Colorado...
The surface pressure pattern in addition to the mid-level winds
across the Divide may be enough to bring gusty winds to parts of the
Front Range. Most guidance shows 10-20% RH during the afternoon, but
varies on the wind speeds. Even with 15-20 mph possible in places,
some recent rainfall has reduced some fuel receptiveness enough to
preclude highlights. Localized concerns are possible, however.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu May 05 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 11 - 15 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs dynamical model solutions remain in good =
agreement in predicting an
amplified 500-hPa height pattern across North America at the start of the 6=
-10
day period, with deep troughing (ridging) and associated negative (positive=
)
height anomalies predicted over the western (eastern) CONUS. These features
are
forecast to weaken considerably by the end of the period, although the ECMW=
F,
GEFS, and Canadian ensembles continue to depict weak troughing (ridging)
across
the Rockies and High Plains (Northeast) on day-10. The high amplitude ridge=
 in
the East is forecast to result in a cut-off mid-level low retrograding off =
the
mid-Atlantic and Southeast coasts early in the period, favoring near normal
heights over those areas for the period as a whole. As the troughing in the
West shifts further inland later in the period, weak ridging initially favo=
red
over the East Pacific is forecast to move closer to the West Coast. Across
Alaska, models are in good agreement in maintaining mean troughing over mos=
t
of
the Mainland, ahead of a strong ridge forecast over the Aleutians. Generall=
y,
above normal mid-level heights are forecast over southwestern Alaska and th=
e
Aleutians, with near to below normal heights favored across northern and
eastern portions of the Mainland and the Panhandle.

Summer-like temperatures are forecast for much of the central and eastern
CONUS
as anomalous ridging expands over the region, with many areas likely to hav=
e
daytime high temperatures at least 10 deg F above normal during the period.
Increased probabilities of above normal temperatures are indicated across m=
uch
of the CONUS east of the Rockies, with the highest probabilities (>90 perce=
nt)
across parts of the Mississippi Valley. The National Blend of Models indica=
tes
the potential for record high temperatures (above 90 deg F) across portions=
 of
the Central and Southern Plains and Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley.
Anomalous onshore flow along with the potential for increased cloud cover a=
nd
precipitation, associated with a retrograding cut-off low, favor increased
chances for near to below normal temperatures along the mid-Atlantic and
Southeast coasts, including the Florida Peninsula. Increased probabilities =
of
below normal temperatures are forecast across most of the western CONUS due=
 to
predicted initial troughing over the region, with some moderation likely la=
ter
in the period as this troughing lifts out. Below normal temperature
probabilities are enhanced for much of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, d=
ue
to troughing forecast across most of the state.

Troughing forecast over the western CONUS at the outset of the period favor=
s
increased precipitation chances across much of the northwest quadrant of th=
e
CONUS, extending into the Northern and Central Plains and Upper Mississippi
Valley where enhanced frontal activity is possible. Near to below normal
precipitation probabilities are increased over parts of California and the
Four
Corners Region due to the forecast weakening and northeastward progression =
of
the trough by the middle of the period. Deep ridging over eastern North
America
favors elevated chances of below normal precipitation for parts of the
interior
eastern CONUS, and the Southern Plains. However, the potential for enhanced
onshore flow results in increased probabilities for above normal precipitat=
ion
for the parts of the mid-Atlantic and Southeast, with a notable northward
expansion of precipitation into the mid-Atlantic in the ensemble guidance
relative to yesterday. Near to above normal precipitation is favored for
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle due to mean troughing. Conversely, below
normal precipitation is most likely for much of the Aleutians and Alaska
Peninsula due to predicted ridging upstream.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on an amplified pattern persisting through much of the
period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 13 - 19 2022

An amplified 500-hPa height pattern is forecast over North America during t=
he
early part of week-2, with a transition to a less amplified pattern later i=
n
the period. Troughing over the western CONUS is favored to weaken by the
middle
of the period, with the GEFS being slightly quicker with the eastward
progression of this trough compared to the ECMWF ensemble. Although the
Canadian ensemble maintains a more amplified pattern across the CONUS
throughout week-2, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict less amplificat=
ion
later in the period. For the week-2 period as a whole, near to above normal
500-hPa heights are favored for much of the CONUS, with the largest positiv=
e
height anomalies over the Northeast. This generally aligns with the forecas=
t
positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation. Cut-off mid-level low pressure is
forecast to move across the coastal Southeast and the Florida Peninsula ear=
ly
in the period, which favors closer to normal heights for those areas. Mean
troughing is likely to persist over Mainland Alaska throughout the period
favoring near to below normal heights for much of the Mainland and the
Panhandle. Positive height anomalies are predicted across the Aleutians as
above normal heights are forecast in association with mean ridging upstream=
.

Below normal temperatures are favored for much of the northwestern CONUS du=
e
to
residual troughing forecast early in the period. Probabilities of above nor=
mal
temperatures are elevated for most of the CONUS east of the Rockies, with t=
he
highest probabilities across parts of the Northeast (>70 percent) and the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley (>60 percent). The magnitude o=
f
the warm and cold temperature anomalies is forecast to moderate by the midd=
le
of the period as the mid-level height pattern becomes less amplified, with =
the
initial trough over the West forecast to shift northeastward and weaken.
Cut-off mid-level low pressure may result in near to slightly below normal
temperatures across the coastal Southeast and Florida Peninsula at the outs=
et
of the period, but this feature is forecast to quickly weaken, allowing the
above normal temperatures forecast upstream to expand into the region.
Persistent troughing leads to elevated chances of near to below normal
temperatures across Alaska.

Chances of above normal precipitation are elevated from the Northwest to th=
e
Upper Mississippi Valley, ahead of the trough forecast over the western CON=
US
and associated lingering frontal activity possible early in the period. As
this
trough progresses northeastward and weakens, a drier pattern is forecast,
particularly across California, the Four Corners Region, and the Central an=
d
Southern Plains, where near to below normal precipitation probabilities are
elevated. Below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Northeast =
and
Ohio Valley, in association with anomalous ridging predicted over the East,
and
supported by the statistical analog guidance. Conversely, there is a slight
tilt toward above normal precipitation for parts of the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic due to the aforementioned cut-off mid-level low forecast acros=
s
the region, and consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Above
normal precipitation is also favored for most of Alaska, as troughing is
forecast to persist ahead of mean ridging forecast over the Aleutians.
Conversely, below normal precipitation is most likely for much of the
Aleutians
and Alaska Peninsula due to predicted ridging upstream.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a
fairly amplified pattern predicted early in the period offset by a transiti=
on
to a lower amplitude pattern by the end of week-2.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

...Severe thunderstorm and flash flood threat shifts eastward this
evening from the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley and Southern
Plains toward the Southeast, Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic on
Friday...

...Unsettled weather continues across the Northwest and northern
Great Basin through Saturday...

...Building heat wave to impact the Southern Plains beginning on
Friday...

A strong spring storm system currently churning over the central
U.S. will continue to spawn severe thunderstorms and instances of
flash flooding overnight throughout the Lower/Middle Mississippi
Valley, while gradually pushing eastward into the Southeast and
Ohio Valley by Friday morning. Specifically, the severe weather
threat on Friday along and ahead of an approaching cold front will
span from southern West Virginia/eastern Kentucky to the central
Gulf Coast, including much of the southern Mid-Atlantic. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe
thunderstorms across this region, with a smaller Enhanced Risk
(level 3/5) across parts of southern Alabama and western Georgia.
These storms will have the potential for damaging wind gusts,
large hail, and tornadoes. Farther north, heavy rain will have the
potential to linger just north of a slow-moving warm front
throughout the Ohio Valley and into the northern Mid-Atlantic.
Rainfall totals up to 3 inches are possible and could create
scattered flooding concerns. To highlight the potential, a Slight
Risk (level 2/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued for Friday
from far eastern Ohio to northern Maryland and south-central
Pennsylvania. By Saturday, as a closed upper-level low moves over
the Mid-Atlantic, a secondary area of low pressure is forecast to
develop near the southern tip of the Delmarva Peninsula. This will
lead to a very dreary start to the weekend across parts of the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Gusty northeasterly winds, moderate to
locally heavy rain, and high temperatures only into the 50s are
expected. Minor coastal flooding is also possible as gusty onshore
flow persists along the New Jersey and Delmarva coastline.

Elsewhere, a deepening upper-level trough and embedded shortwaves
entering the Northwest will continue will continue to produce
unsettled weather over the region and into the northern Great
Basin/northern Rockies. Heavy snow is possible across the Cascades
and mountainous terrain of Idaho and southwest Montana, where over
6 inches of snow is likely. Moderate to locally heavy rainfall is
possible along coastal sections of the Northwest. High winds may
also lead to dangerous travel for high profile vehicles over the
northern High Plains on Friday as the aforementioned system ejects
out of the northern Rockies. High Wind Watches have been issued
across north-central Montana. Gusty winds may also be experienced
across parts of the central Great Basin and central/northern
Sierra Nevada through Saturday morning.

As the previously mentioned upper-level trough deepens over the
West Coast, a downstream ridge will build over the central U.S.
and lead to summer-like warmth over parts of the Southern Plains
on Friday and Saturday. On Saturday in particular, highs will soar
into the upper 90s and triple digits throughout the southern High
Plains and much of Texas. Heat indices will approach 110 degrees
across South Texas. This early-season heat will potentially break
several daily high temperature records and could be dangerous for
residents if proper heat safety is not followed. Overnight
temperatures will offer some relief as lows dip into the 70s.

...Heavy snow threat over a cold north-central Great Basin/Rockies
to contrast north-central U.S. convection and south-central U.S to
Midwest record heat as part of Omega-style block development over
the lower 48 and adjoining oceans this weekend into next week...

18Z Update: The 12Z model guidance suite is in very good synoptic
scale agreement for Sunday and into early Tuesday as an omega
block pattern develops over the central U.S., so a
multi-deterministic blend sufficed as a starting point in the
forecast process for that time period.  Noticeable differences
emerge with the 12Z CMC across the eastern Pacific and
southwestern U.S. by Wednesday, and it is weaker with the
shortwave trough ejecting eastward across the Rockies compared to
the consensus.  The past two runs of the CMC have trended with the
GFS and ECMWF regarding a retrograding low over the western
Atlantic and towards the Southeast Coast by the end of the week,
with the ECMWF taking this low farthest west.  Model preferences
for the latter half of the period maintained some of the GFS/ECMWF
whilst gradually increasing use of the ensemble means and some
previous WPC continuity.  In terms of sensible weather, the main
story will likely be the early season heat wave that is forecast
to encompass much of the south-central U.S. and into the Midwest,
with afternoon high temperatures running up to 20 degrees above
normal, and the potential for multiple daily record highs to be
set.  The previous forecast discussion follows below. /Hamrick
-------------------------

...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A composite of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS along with the 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian, ECMWF ensemble mean and 01 UTC National
Blend of Models seems to present a reasonable forecast basis while
tending to mitigate embedded system variance consistent with a
pattern with near normal predictability Sunday into Monday. The
GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means remain best clustered and
in line with WPC continuity and the NBM Tuesday-next Thursday.
Despite better similarities, recent run-run guidance continuity
issues still suggests some caution with embedded feature details,
especially days 5-7. Most of the newer 00 UTC guidance maintain
similar trends from earlier guidance, with the Canadian remaining
the most out of phase with other guidance with the timing/emphasis
on systems digging into the western U.S.upper trough.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system will track off the Mid-Atlantic Sunday. The low stalls and
retrogrades over the western Atlantic back toward the Southeast
coast mid-later next week with wrapping rains within a developing
Omega-style block.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramatic change over much of the West later this weekend into next
week as an amplified mean upper trough and wavy frontal systems
become established over the region. This will support significant
cooling to include spotty record values along with a widespread
precipitation focus from the Northwest/Sierra through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies. This will include a substantial
and lingering threat for widespread heavy snows as further
enhanced in favored terrain. Expect temperatures to range as much
as 10-20 degrees below normal.

Upper system ejections channeled between amplified eastern Pacific
upper ridging/upper troughing over the West and amplified
east-central U.S. upper ridging as part of the aforementioned
Omega-style block over the lower 48 and adjoining oceans will trap
a slow moving and wavy frontal zone over the north-central U.S. to
support an emerging but uncertain convection/rainfall pattern.
This offers a runoff threat given moist ambient Northern Plains
soil conditions. The Storm Prediction Center also highlights a
concern for severe weather into the eastern Central Plains for at
least Sunday and Monday. The pattern meanwhile favors record high
temperatures over the south-central U.S., with pre-frontal warmth
gradually building northeastward next week through the MS/TN
Valleys/Midwest under the upper ridge, in stark contrast to the
wintry conditions over the West and moderated/cooled high pressure
dammed airmass to linger over the East on the backside of a
difficult to dislodge western Atlantic circulation.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0142 AM CDT Fri May 06 2022

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
Stronger mid-level flow will gradually overspread the Rockies today
as a mid-level trough amplifies across the Interior West. Gradient
winds from a surface lee trough across the northern Rockies, along
with downslope flow across the Southwest, will promote dry and
breezy conditions supporting modest potential for wildfire spread.

...Northern Rockies...
Gradient surface flow will increase through the afternoon,
particularly across northern Montana, where a well-mixed boundary
layer will support RH at or just below 25 percent amid 20-30 mph
sustained westerly surface winds. Some of the latest forecast fuel
guidance suggests that regional ERCs may approach the 90th
percentile in spots. The dry and windy conditions atop fuels
receptive to fire spread warrant the introduction of Elevated
highlights this outlook. While precipitation is expected later in
the evening, an isolated thunderstorm could develop during the
afternoon. Any lightning strikes that occur away from storm cores,
in windy conditions, and within a drier fuel bed may easily support
wildfire ignitions.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Downslope flow amid a well-mixed boundary layer will encourage
patches of 15 mph sustained west-northwesterly surface winds across
portions of the Southwest. While the overall surface wind field is
expected to marginally support wildfire spread, RH is expected to
drop into the single digits on a near widespread basis, and where
fuels are critically dry. As such, an Elevated area was introduced
where surface winds will most likely exceed 15 mph on a more
frequent basis.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will further amplify while traversing the
southern Rockies tomorrow/Saturday, with stronger mid-level flow
overspreading a dry boundary layer across the Southwest into the
southern High Plains. The surface mass response will be cyclone
development across the central High Plains, leading to widespread
20+ mph sustained west-southwesterly winds across much of Arizona
into New Mexico, eastern Colorado, and western Texas, delineated by
Elevated highlights. Critical highlights have also been introduced
where confidence is highest in stronger winds coinciding with
single-digit RH for several hours atop critically dry fuels.
Expansion of Critical highlights may be needed in later outlooks
across Texas and southeast Colorado if stronger surface winds become
evident in future guidance.

...Blocky pattern next week to support record heat over the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest along
with episodes of north-central U.S. convection and northern Great
Basin/Rockies snow...

...Overview...

The first part of the week will feature a pattern close to an
Omega-style block, with an amplified western mean trough, a strong
ridge extending from Mexico into southeastern Canada, and an upper
low just off the East Coast.  With time the central/southern part
of the ridge should weaken while the northern part may ultimately
connect with a retrograding Atlantic ridge that should push the
upper low toward the Southeast coast.  Within the western trough,
a leading shortwave will eject from the northern High Plains and
then upstream energy should sharpen into midweek before ejecting
northeastward (possibly leading to strong low pressure).  Another
system may reach the Northwest late in the week.  This pattern
will lead to very warm to hot weather over the
central/east-central U.S., chilly and unsettled weather over the
West, and periods of rain/thunderstorms between these two regimes.
 The retrograding upper low may also bring some moisture into the
East late in the week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The updated forecast started with a composite of 12Z/18Z
operational models for about the first half of the period and then
transitioned to increasing weight of 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means,
reaching 60 percent total by day 7 with remaining input from the
12Z ECMWF and somewhat less of the 18Z GFS.  The most significant
forecast uncertainty during the period will involve details of the
western U.S. mean trough aloft, specifically how energy that
sharpens into midweek ejects out of the West in response to an
upstream northeastern Pacific system that may contain a fairly
deep closed low.  The 12Z CMC strayed most from consensus in that
it held its northeastern Pacific upper low farther southwest,
leading to flatter flow coming into the West and in turn a
flatter/faster shortwave ejecting from the West mid-late week.
The new 00Z CMC has adjusted closer to remaining guidance but
still appears to have additional trending to do.  Remaining
guidance from recent days along with latest ensemble members
suggest a fair degree of uncertainty with specifics of each
feature.  18Z/00Z GFS runs lean to the amplified/southern side of
the spread for upper low reaching the West by next Friday and
could be a tad fast with the ejecting shortwave ahead of it, while
either the 12Z ECMWF or 18Z/00Z GFS handling of the incoming
feature could support slightly faster ejection than the 12Z ECMWF.
 The late-period model/mean preference provides a reasonable
intermediate solution for the ejecting system and trended to the
conservative side in depicting the incoming energy by day 7
Friday.  However the new 00Z ECMWF has trended somewhat slower
with each feature, widening the spread somewhat and highlighting
the uncertainty with this overall evolution.  The late-period
model/mean preference provides a reasonable intermediate solution
for the ejecting system and trended to the conservative side in
depicting the incoming energy by day 7 Friday.  Meanwhile an
average of latest GFS/ECMWF runs and their means offers the most
stable solution for the upper low near the East Coast.  Other
models differ at times due to differences in handling embedded
impulses.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Strong upper ridging will lead to persistent much above normal
temperatures over the central-southern Plains and most of the
Mississippi Valley through the week, with some of this warmth
gradually expanding through the Great Lakes and Northeast as well.
 Expect a broad area of highs/morning lows 10-20F above normal
with some localized areas reaching higher than that.  Numerous
daily records are likely through the week over the southern Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley, and may also extend into the central
Plains/Midwest around Tuesday/Wednesday.  Highest heat index
values will be over southern Texas early in the week but the
combination of heat and humidity may still produce maximum heat
index values over 100F at some southern locations into late week.

In contrast, the West will see unseasonably cool and unsettled
conditions next week.  Coldest anomalies should be early in the
week when highs will likely be 10-20F or so below normal.  Best
potential for some daily records for cold highs will be on Monday.
 Temperatures may approach normal over southern areas by next
Friday but locations farther north should remain at least
moderately below normal.  Periods of rain and higher elevation
snow will tend to be light to moderate, but there could be a
period of enhanced activity along and inland from the West Coast
late in the week depending on details of an arriving northeastern
Pacific system.

Between these two regimes, the central U.S. will see periods of
rain and thunderstorms as ejecting western shortwaves produce
multiple lows, along with a Rockies to Upper Midwest front that
ultimately stalls and then lifts northward ahead of another system
that brings a cold front into the Plains late in the week.
Deceleration of the leading front and then the late week system
may produce areas of significant rainfall that would be a runoff
threat over northern tier areas that already have very wet soil.
The Storm Prediction Center highlights a concern for severe
weather over parts of the northeastern Plains/Upper Midwest early
in the week, while the late-week system could merit watching for
strong convection as well.

Most rainfall with the system off the East Coast should just
offshore early in the week, but is likely to expand back to the
west late in the week as the vertically stacked low retrogrades
back toward the Southeast coast.

Extended Forecast Discussion

300 AM EDT Fri May 06 2022

Valid 12Z Mon May 09 2022 - 12Z Fri May 13 2022

...Blocky pattern next week to support record heat over the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Midwest along
with episodes of north-central U.S. convection and northern Great
Basin/Rockies snow...

...Overview...

The first part of the week will feature a pattern close to an
Omega-style block, with an amplified western mean trough, a strong
ridge extending from Mexico into southeastern Canada, and an upper
low just off the East Coast.  With time the central/southern part
of the ridge should weaken while the northern part may ultimately
connect with a retrograding Atlantic ridge that should push the
upper low toward the Southeast coast.  Within the western trough,
a leading shortwave will eject from the northern High Plains and
then upstream energy should sharpen into midweek before ejecting
northeastward (possibly leading to strong low pressure).  Another
system may reach the Northwest late in the week.  This pattern
will lead to very warm to hot weather over the
central/east-central U.S., chilly and unsettled weather over the
West, and periods of rain/thunderstorms between these two regimes.
 The retrograding upper low may also bring some moisture into the
East late in the week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The updated forecast started with a composite of 12Z/18Z
operational models for about the first half of the period and then
transitioned to increasing weight of 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means,
reaching 60 percent total by day 7 with remaining input from the
12Z ECMWF and somewhat less of the 18Z GFS.  The most significant
forecast uncertainty during the period will involve details of the
western U.S. mean trough aloft, specifically how energy that
sharpens into midweek ejects out of the West in response to an
upstream northeastern Pacific system that may contain a fairly
deep closed low.  The 12Z CMC strayed most from consensus in that
it held its northeastern Pacific upper low farther southwest,
leading to flatter flow coming into the West and in turn a
flatter/faster shortwave ejecting from the West mid-late week.
The new 00Z CMC has adjusted closer to remaining guidance but
still appears to have additional trending to do.  Remaining
guidance from recent days along with latest ensemble members
suggest a fair degree of uncertainty with specifics of each
feature.  18Z/00Z GFS runs lean to the amplified/southern side of
the spread for upper low reaching the West by next Friday and
could be a tad fast with the ejecting shortwave ahead of it, while
either the 12Z ECMWF or 18Z/00Z GFS handling of the incoming
feature could support slightly faster ejection than the 12Z ECMWF.
 The late-period model/mean preference provides a reasonable
intermediate solution for the ejecting system and trended to the
conservative side in depicting the incoming energy by day 7
Friday.  However the new 00Z ECMWF has trended somewhat slower
with each feature, widening the spread somewhat and highlighting
the uncertainty with this overall evolution.  The late-period
model/mean preference provides a reasonable intermediate solution
for the ejecting system and trended to the conservative side in
depicting the incoming energy by day 7 Friday.  Meanwhile an
average of latest GFS/ECMWF runs and their means offers the most
stable solution for the upper low near the East Coast.  Other
models differ at times due to differences in handling embedded
impulses.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Strong upper ridging will lead to persistent much above normal
temperatures over the central-southern Plains and most of the
Mississippi Valley through the week, with some of this warmth
gradually expanding through the Great Lakes and Northeast as well.
 Expect a broad area of highs/morning lows 10-20F above normal
with some localized areas reaching higher than that.  Numerous
daily records are likely through the week over the southern Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley, and may also extend into the central
Plains/Midwest around Tuesday/Wednesday.  Highest heat index
values will be over southern Texas early in the week but the
combination of heat and humidity may still produce maximum heat
index values over 100F at some southern locations into late week.

In contrast, the West will see unseasonably cool and unsettled
conditions next week.  Coldest anomalies should be early in the
week when highs will likely be 10-20F or so below normal.  Best
potential for some daily records for cold highs will be on Monday.
 Temperatures may approach normal over southern areas by next
Friday but locations farther north should remain at least
moderately below normal.  Periods of rain and higher elevation
snow will tend to be light to moderate, but there could be a
period of enhanced activity along and inland from the West Coast
late in the week depending on details of an arriving northeastern
Pacific system.

Between these two regimes, the central U.S. will see periods of
rain and thunderstorms as ejecting western shortwaves produce
multiple lows, along with a Rockies to Upper Midwest front that
ultimately stalls and then lifts northward ahead of another system
that brings a cold front into the Plains late in the week.
Deceleration of the leading front and then the late week system
may produce areas of significant rainfall that would be a runoff
threat over northern tier areas that already have very wet soil.
The Storm Prediction Center highlights a concern for severe
weather over parts of the northeastern Plains/Upper Midwest early
in the week, while the late-week system could merit watching for
strong convection as well.

Most rainfall with the system off the East Coast should just
offshore early in the week, but is likely to expand back to the
west late in the week as the vertically stacked low retrogrades
back toward the Southeast coast.

...A low pressure system will bring a threat of severe
thunderstorms into the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic today while
heavy rain and flash flood threat overspreads the central
Appalachians and northern Mid-Atlantic into tonight...

...Colder and unsettled weather across the Northwest and northern
Great Basin...

...A heat wave is forecast to develop and intensify over the
southern Plains into the weekend...

A low pressure system currently located across the central U.S.
will continue to spread inclement weather eastward through the
eastern U.S. for the next couple of days.  Clusters of strong to
severe thunderstorms early this morning across the Deep South are
expected to redevelop over the interior Southeast and the
Mid-Atlantic later today ahead of an approaching cold front.
Farther north, heavy rain will have the potential to develop and
linger just north of a slow-moving warm front from across the
central Appalachians and into the northern Mid-Atlantic into
tonight as the center of the low pressure system passes to the
south.  Rainfall totals up to 3 inches are possible and could
create scattered flooding concerns in these areas.  By Saturday,
the low pressure system will begin to slide off the Mid-Atlantic
coast as the weather pattern across the U.S. is forecast to slow
down.  This will lead to a very dreary weather pattern to develop
and linger across parts of the Northeast and down into the
Mid-Atlantic through the weekend.  Although the rain is forecast
to gradually taper off across the interior sections, much of the
Eastern Seaboard will be under the influence of overcast skies,
gusty northeasterly winds, and occasional  rain with high
temperatures only reaching into the 50s.  Minor coastal flooding
is also possible as gusty onshore flow strengthens along the New
Jersey and Delmarva coastline later in the weekend.

Elsewhere, a deepening upper-level trough and embedded shortwaves
entering the Northwest will bring colder air and unsettled weather
into the northern Great Basin/northern Rockies.  Heavy snow is
possible across the Cascades and mountainous terrain of Idaho and
southwest Montana, where over 6 inches of snow is likely.
Moderate to locally heavy rainfall is possible along coastal
sections of the Northwest.  High winds may also lead to dangerous
travel for high profile vehicles over the northern High Plains on
Friday as the aforementioned system ejects out of the northern
Rockies.  High Wind Watches have been issued across north-central
Montana. Gusty winds may also be experienced across parts of the
central Great Basin and central/northern Sierra Nevada through
Saturday morning.

As the previously mentioned upper-level trough deepens over the
West Coast, a downstream ridge will build over the central U.S.
and lead to summer-like heat over parts of the southern Plains
beginning today and then intensifies over the weekend.  On
Saturday in particular, highs will soar into the upper 90s and
triple digits throughout the southern High Plains and much of
Texas.  Heat indices will approach 110 degrees across South Texas.
 This early-season heat will potentially break several daily high
temperature records and could be dangerous for residents if proper
heat safety is not followed.  Overnight temperatures will offer
some relief as lows dip into the 70s.

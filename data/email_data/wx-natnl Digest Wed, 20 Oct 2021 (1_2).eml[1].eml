Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1111 AM CDT Tue Oct 19 2021

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

Only minor changes are needed based on morning observations and
recent hi-res guidance. Surface obs from across the eastern CO
plains show the gradual deepening of a surface low along with RH
values falling into the 25-30% range under a weak downslope flow
regime. Confidence remains high that this dry air mass with spread
eastward through the day as winds increase in response to diurnal
mixing and the continued, but modest, deepening of the low. Elevated
conditions remain expected, and brief/localized critical conditions
are possible across eastern CO. See the discussion below for
additional details.

..Moore.. 10/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1150 PM CDT Mon Oct 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough now over Utah will continue eastward today.
Strong mid-level winds will be present along the southern flank of
this trough. At the surface, a cyclone will develop through the day
in the central High Plains. As the cyclone moves eastward toward the
central Plains by the end of the afternoon, a cold front will pass
through the central High Plains and into the southern/central
Plains.

...Parts of the southern/central High Plains...
Gusty winds are possible early in the day across the region. The
surface low may undergo slow intensification during the day and
early afternoon, which would lead to some favorable overlap of
strong winds along with minimal RH. Winds of 15-20 mph are quite
likely. With the mid level jet aloft, some areas, particularly
within the terrain passes, could see winds of 20-35 mph at least
briefly. Downslope warming and drying will bring RH to near 10%
locally with 15-20% more common. Elevated to locally critical fire
weather is expected as the area with the driest fuels will likely
see critical conditions briefly due to progression of the cold
front.

SYNOPSIS: There is good multi-model agreement regarding mid-level low press=
ure
extending from Alaska to offshore of the West Coast of the contiguous U.S.
continuing from the end of week-1 through week-2, with this feature expecte=
d
to
gradually weaken during the outlook period This mid-level low pressure is
anticipated to promote enhanced onshore flow and increase the potential for
heavy precipitation and elevated wind speeds across parts of the Pacific
Northwest and northern California during the beginning of week-2. A front m=
ay
traverse the central and eastern contiguous U.S. at the beginning of week-2=
,
which could bring unsettled weather to the region. A series of surface lows
are
predicted to form over the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, but are not
anticipated to result in widespread hazards at this time.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Pacific Northwest and
Northern California, Wed-Fri, Oct 27-29.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Wed-Fri, Oct
27-29.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Northern and Central Plains,
Wed-Thu, Oct 27-28.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the western
third
of the CONUS, Wed-Sun, Oct 27-31.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valle=

the axis extending from Alaska to offshore of the West Coast of the CONUS.
This
pattern is anticipated to continue from the end of week-1 through week-2,
gradually weakening throughout the period. This longwave trough favors an
increased chance of atmospheric river activity and heavy precipitation
affecting California and the Pacific Northwest. The GEFS and ECMWF Integrat=
ed
Vapor Transport (IVT) analysis indicates the greatest likelihood for enhanc=
ed
values (>250 kg/ms) across the West Coast from the beginning of week-2 (Oct=
 27
to 29). A slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for primarily the
Pacific Northwest and Northern California, Oct 27 to 29, where the model IV=
T
values are most enhanced and where the reforecast tools indicate at least a
20%
chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one
inch. The reforecast tools indicate the possibility of localized areas
receiving 3-day totals exceeding 2 inches, although there is noticeably les=
s
spatial coverage of totals exceeding this threshold compared to previous da=
ys.
Additionally, the GEFS reforecast tool no longer shows areas exceeding 40% =
of
precipitation reaching hazards criteria. Therefore, the moderate risk of he=
avy
precipitation is removed  in today's outlook. Heavy rainfall may trigger
flooding and debris flows, especially over burn scarred areas of the West.
However, the early season precipitation would be beneficial to drought-
stricken
areas of the West. No heavy snow hazards are posted due to the expectation
that
significant snow accumulations are forecast to be limited to the highest
elevations of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada Mountains.



The amplified mid-level trough and increased chance of atmospheric rivers
across the West also support a slight risk of high winds for parts of the
Pacific Northwest. Both the reforecast tools indicate the greatest high win=
d
potential at the beginning of the period for this area. Therefore, a slight
risk of high winds is posted across parts of the Pacific Northwest, Oct 27 =
to
29, based on the anticipated synoptic flow as well as guidance from the
deterministic model guidance and reforecast tools.



Some models indicate possible surface low formation over the Northern Plain=
s
and surface high building across the Great Basin at the beginning of the
period. This pattern could support a tight pressure gradient in the lee of =
the
Rockies across the Northern and Central Rockies, resulting in enhanced wind
speeds. A slight risk of high winds is posted for parts of the Northern and
Central Plains, Oct 27 to 28, where the reforecast tools indicate at least =
a
20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph.



Multiple model ensemble means show surface pressure forming across the west=
ern
CONUS as mid-level ridging builds downstream of the mid-level trough over t=
he
Northeast Pacific. This surface high may usher in cooler air from Canada,
resulting in anomalously cool temperatures for parts of the West. Similar t=
o
recent days, the ECMWF reforecast tool has a greater spatial expanse of
minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and freezing, compared t=
o
the GEFS. The GEFS reforecast tool, however, indicates an  increased spatia=
l
coverage of temperatures reaching these thresholds, and for a longer durati=
on
(although not consecutive days) compared to previous guidance .). Thus, a
broadened area and period is highlighted for a slight risk of much below
normal
temperatures, primarily across the higher elevation areas of the western th=
ird
of the CONUS, Oct 27 to 31.



The mid-level pattern is anticipated to be fairly progressive, with the
potential for a series of mid-level shortwave troughs propagating across
central and eastern North America during week-2. An initial shortwave at th=
e
beginning of the period is predicted to support surface low formation acros=
s
central Canada, with a front extending southward into the CONUS. Frontal
activity combined with return flow from the Gulf of Mexico and potential mi=
d
to
upper level enhanced moisture from a tropical disturbance in the East Pacif=
ic,
may increase chances for enhanced precipitation to parts of the southeaster=
n
CONUS. There is good run to run model consistency and agreement among the
reforecast tools to support a slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts =
of
the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast, Oct 27 to 29=
.
The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall total=
s
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch in the highlighted risk area.



Mid-level troughing and associated surface low formation over the Gulf of
Alaska is forecast for Alaska throughout week-2. However, reforecast tools =
are
unsupportive of precipitation amounts reaching hazard thresholds, as the
orientation of the associated surface low over Gulf of Alaska favors the
majority of the strong onshore flow further south, primarily to the West Co=
ast
of the CONUS. This pattern generally supports below normal temperatures and
precipitation for much of the state during week-2.

...Multi-day heavy rainfall and mountain snow threat inland from
the Pacific Northwest and especially California...

...Overview...

A highly active and increasingly wet multi-day weather pattern
will develop and shift southward along the West Coast late week
into early next week as a series of strong eastern Pacific storm
systems pivot around a rather pronounced trough over the northeast
Pacific. This will result in a couple of cold frontal passages
that will progress inland across the Intermountain West/Rockies
with local heavy precipitation and gusty winds, eventually working
into the Plains. Meanwhile across the eastern U.S., a cold front
and upper level trough will be exiting the East Coast by Friday
afternoon with a Canadian surface high settling southward across
the Plains and Midwest. An upstream warm front extending across
the Midwest by early next week will likely provide a focus for
showers and storms that could produce some localized heavy
convection/downpours.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model and ensemble solutions overall seem well clustered days 3/4
(Fri-Sat), bolstering forecast confidence in a composite
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian model solution that is well supported by
ensembles and the National Blend of Models. The larger scale flow
evolution is also decently depicted by most guidance into the day
5-7 time frame and there is a well defined trend toward
amplification that seems reasonable considering active upstream
flow. However, there is growing forecast spread in this period,
especially with the transfer of energy and eastern Pacific storm
genesis. Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite focuses
by then increasingly on the still compatible GEFS/ECMWF ensemble
means. For a particular storm system that may reach the West Coast
on Sunday, the 00 UTC CMC and UKMET were considerably stronger
with the surface low compared to the GFS and ECMWF, and there was
actually a decent supporting cluster of GEFS/ECMWF ensemble
solutions, but the 12 UTC UKMET/Canadian have backed off. WPC
product continuity is well maintained with this strategy and a
composite of latest 12 UTC guidance remains in line for threat
messaging.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of enhanced rains
are expected from Washington through especially California that
will likely be heavy at times with moist onshore flow ahead of
multiple Pacific storm systems. This will especially hold true for
Sunday and into Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume
shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest across California as
part of an atmospheric river event. Some locations may get on the
order of 4 to 8+ inches of rain over the entire forecast period,
particularly across favored windward terrain which may result in
some instances of runoff issues. Heavy snows are likely for higher
elevations of the Cascades and Sierra. Snow levels are expected to
be lower by late Sunday and into Monday with pattern progression.
Strong winds are also possible. Some of this moisture is expected
to reach the Intermountain West and the central/northern Rockies
with significant snowfall for some of these areas, with a focusing
front working into the Plains by Tuesday.  Across the eastern
U.S., a lead warm front lifting northward across portions of the
Midwest this weekend and into Monday is expected to produce
scattered to numerous showers with an uncertain thunderstorm focus.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region, with highs
running up to 15 degrees above normal. Cooler than normal
temperatures are forecast for the West Coast, influenced by the
upper trough and mainly overcast skies with highs decreasing to
10-20 degrees below normal.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 25 - 29 2021

The 6z GEFS, 0z ECMWF, and 0z Canadian ensembles continue to depict highly
amplified mid-level troughing stretching from Alaska into the Northeast
Pacific
and western CONUS during the 6-10 day period. Intermittent shortwave trough=
s
are forecast to traverse the CONUS throughout the period, signaling a trend
toward a more progressive pattern. Ridging is indicated over the eastern
CONUS,
with substantial positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending into Canada.
Troughing is initially forecast over the Northeastern CONUS, but the
progressive pattern favors ridging to become more dominant by the end of th=
e
period. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa height blend depic=
ts negative height
anomalies
across Alaska and much of the northwestern quadrant of the CONUS, and posit=
ive
height anomalies over the eastern half of the CONUS and extending back to t=
he
Southwest.

Troughing and associated negative height anomalies forecast over the wester=
n
CONUS favor increased probabilities for below normal temperatures west of t=
he
Rockies. Due to the enhanced ridging predicted downstream, probabilities fo=
r
above normal temperatures are elevated for much of the CONUS east of the
Rockies, with the highest probabilities (greater than 70%) indicated over t=
he
Great Plains and Mississippi Valley. Below normal temperatures are initiall=
y
favored on days 6 and 7 across the Northeast associated with initial trough=
ing
over the region, but a quick warming trend is forecast by the end of the
period
as the upstream ridging shifts further to the east. Near to above normal
temperatures are slightly favored for the period as a whole across portions=
 of
New England and the Northeast. Probabilities are not as high as depicted in
the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools given the cooler uncalibrated guidance,
particularly from the GEFS and Canadian ensembles. Increased chances of nea=
r
to
below normal temperatures are indicated for most of Alaska due to the
amplified
troughing forecast across the state. The exception is over the northeastern
Mainland, where increased probabilities for above normal temperatures are
depicted as a result of the increased easterly flow forecast, resulting in
enhanced positive temperature advection of the relatively warmer temperatur=
es
forecast downstream over Canada. This is supported by both the GEFS and ECM=
WF
reforecast tools.

Troughing off the West Coast of the CONUS favors high probabilities of abov=
e
normal precipitation across the western CONUS. Atmospheric river guidance f=
rom
both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict enhanced integrated vapor transpor=
t
from the Pacific throughout the period. These enhanced probabilities are
forecast to spread farther inland as shortwave troughing moves across the
CONUS. Enhanced frontal activity and potential surface low pressure develop=
ing
ahead of this trough favors increased chances for above normal precipitatio=
n
extending through parts of the north-central and eastern CONUS. Surface hig=
h
pressure forecast across parts of the Southwest and Southern High Plains
favors
enhanced probabilities for below normal precipitation over these regions.
Increased below normal precipitation probabilities are also forecast across
the
Northeast, given the anomalous northwestery mid-level flow predicted
throughout
most of the period, as the troughing early in the period shifts further to =
the
east and ridging builds into the region. Enhanced odds of near to below nor=
mal
precipitation are favored across Alaska as high amplitude troughing is
forecast
to suppress the mean storm track to the south of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, giv=
en
overall good model agreement, offset slightly by a more progressive mid-lev=
el
low pattern forecast over the CONUS and the resultant impacts on the
temperature and precipitation forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 27 - NOV 02, 2021

The mid-level 500-hPa flow pattern during week-2 is forecast to deamplify
across the CONUS. As a result, a more zonal flow is forecast over the CONUS
compared to the 6-10 day period, though troughing remains indicated over th=
e
Northeast Pacific and Alaska. The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models all depi=
ct
a
weakening of this trough along with retrogression over the Pacific toward t=
he
end of week-2, which may allow ridging to develop across the western CONUS.
This is most pronounced in the 0z Canadian ensemble, but also apparent in t=
he
0z ECMWF ensemble as well. For the week-2 period as a whole, today=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 500-hPa
manual height blend depicts negative height anomalies across the northweste=
rn
CONUS and most of Alaska. Near normal heights are indicated for much of the
remainder of the CONUS, with slightly above normal heights forecast across
parts of the Southwest and Northeast.

The troughing in the Northeast Pacific is forecast to continue to result in
enhanced probabilities of near to below normal temperatures over most of th=
e
western third of the CONUS. Increased ridging early in the period favors
elevated chances for above normal temperatures east of the Rockies, with th=
e
highest probabilities (greater than 60%) depicted across parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and eastern New England. The reasoning for
the
temperature forecast across Alaska remains the same as in the 6-10 day
outlook,
with generally increased probabilities for near to below normal temperature=
s
favored across most of the state due to the troughing overhead, with portio=
ns
of the northeastern Mainland maintaining a slight tilt toward enhanced abov=
e
normal temperature probabilities due to continuing warm temperature advecti=
on.

The week-2 precipitation forecast is very similar to that of the 6-10 day
period. Enhanced Pacific flow favors intermittent shortwave disturbances to
track across the CONUS leading to increased chances of near to above normal
precipitation in most areas. The exception is over parts of the Southwest a=
nd
Central and Southern Plains, which are forecast to be further displaced fro=
m
the mean storm track and situated underneath slightly positive mid-level
height
anomalies, favoring increased probabilities of below normal precipitation.
Enhanced probabilities for near to below normal precipitation are indicated
for
Alaska due to a continued suppressed storm track. The precipitation forecas=
t
across the CONUS and Alaska is generally consistent with both the ECMWF and
GEFS reforecast tools, although the ECMWF reforecast tool is considerably
drier
than its GEFS counterpart over the Southwest, Four Corners Region, and Cent=
ral
Plains, likely attributed to the building ridge over these areas later in
week-2 in the ECMWF ensemble guidance.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 15% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement, offset by some uncertainty related to a low amplitude
pattern emerging over the CONUS.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track with no changes needed. Latest
ensemble guidance continues to show low probability for sustained
and/or widespread elevated conditions across the Southern Great
Basin or southern High Plains where fuels are only marginally dry.

..Moore.. 10/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1151 PM CDT Mon Oct 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
The shortwave trough within the central Plains will move east into
parts of the upper Midwest on Wednesday. Low-amplitude ridging aloft
will develop across the West with the exception of a deamplifying
shortwave trough moving through the Northwest. At the surface, a
cold front will continue moving south and east. Cooler temperatures
behind the front will elevate RH across most the Plains. Drier
conditions are possible in the central Great Basin and the
Southwest, but weak winds and poorly receptive fuels will keep fire
weather concerns very low.

...Winter weather for parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern
Plains...

...Rain is moving into Northern California...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Central/Southern High Plains...

A wave of low pressure over the Central Plains moves eastward to
the Great Lakes by Thursday while trailing a front from the Great
Lakes to the Southern High Plains.  The system will produce snow
and lower elevation rain over parts of the Northern Rockies into
the Northern High Plains on Tuesday evening. Overnight Tuesday,
the snow will move onto the Northern Plains before ending on
Wednesday morning.   Therefore, Winter Storm Warning and Winter
Weather Advisories are posted over parts of the region.

Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms will develop over parts of
the Central Plains on Tuesday evening. Showers and thunderstorms
will move into the Northern Plains and parts of the Upper/Middle
Mississippi Valley by Wednesday morning, moving into the Great
Lakes/Ohio Valley by Thursday morning.  By Thursday evening,
showers and thunderstorms will move into the Lower Great
Lakes/Central Appalachians.

In the meantime, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will flow
northward over the Central Gulf Coast on Wednesday, producing
showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Central Gulf Coast.
Showers and thunderstorms will expand into parts of the Tennessee
Valley overnight Wednesday into Thursday morning. The area of
showers and thunderstorms will merge with the showers and
thunderstorms over the Central Appalachians by later Thursday
morning into Thursday evening.

Moreover, gusty winds and low humidity over the Central/Southern
High Plains lead to an Elevated Risk of fire weather over the
region through Wednesday morning.  Therefore, Red Flag Warnings
are over parts of the Central High Plains.

Along the West Coast, a front moves onshore by Wednesday morning
and then dissipates by Wednesday evening.  Rain will move onshore
over parts of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest
overnight Tuesday. The rain extends into parts of the Northern
Intermountain Region by Wednesday evening.  Rain tapers off over
the Pacific Northwest Thursday morning before returning to parts
of the Northwest Coast by Thursday evening.

Lastly, an area of low pressure will produce scattered rain
showers over the Northeast through Wednesday evening before moving
away from the area.

...Multi-day heavy rainfall and mountain snow threat inland from
the Pacific Northwest and especially California...

...Overview...

A highly active and increasingly wet multi-day weather pattern
will develop and shift southward along the West Coast late week
into early next week as a series of strong eastern Pacific storm
systems pivot around a rather pronounced trough over the northeast
Pacific. This will result in a couple of cold frontal passages
that will progress inland across the Intermountain West/Rockies
with local heavy precipitation and gusty winds, eventually working
into the Plains. Meanwhile across the eastern U.S., a cold front
and upper level trough will be exiting the East Coast by Friday
afternoon with a Canadian surface high settling southward across
the Plains and Midwest. An upstream warm front extending across
the Midwest by early next week will likely provide a focus for
showers and storms that could produce some localized heavy
convection/downpours.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model and ensemble solutions overall seem well clustered days 3/4
(Fri-Sat), bolstering forecast confidence in a composite
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian model solution that is well supported by
ensembles and the National Blend of Models. The larger scale flow
evolution is also decently depicted by most guidance into the day
5-7 time frame and there is a well defined trend toward
amplification that seems reasonable considering active upstream
flow. However, there is growing forecast spread in this period,
especially with the transfer of energy and eastern Pacific storm
genesis. Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite focuses
by then increasingly on the still compatible GEFS/ECMWF ensemble
means. For a particular storm system that may reach the West Coast
on Sunday, the 00 UTC CMC and UKMET were considerably stronger
with the surface low compared to the GFS and ECMWF, and there was
actually a decent supporting cluster of GEFS/ECMWF ensemble
solutions, but the 12 UTC UKMET/Canadian have backed off. WPC
product continuity is well maintained with this strategy and a
composite of latest 12 UTC guidance remains in line for threat
messaging.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of enhanced rains
are expected from Washington through especially California that
will likely be heavy at times with moist onshore flow ahead of
multiple Pacific storm systems. This will especially hold true for
Sunday and into Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume
shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest across California as
part of an atmospheric river event. Some locations may get on the
order of 4 to 8+ inches of rain over the entire forecast period,
particularly across favored windward terrain which may result in
some instances of runoff issues. Heavy snows are likely for higher
elevations of the Cascades and Sierra. Snow levels are expected to
be lower by late Sunday and into Monday with pattern progression.
Strong winds are also possible. Some of this moisture is expected
to reach the Intermountain West and the central/northern Rockies
with significant snowfall for some of these areas, with a focusing
front working into the Plains by Tuesday.  Across the eastern
U.S., a lead warm front lifting northward across portions of the
Midwest this weekend and into Monday is expected to produce
scattered to numerous showers with an uncertain thunderstorm focus.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region, with highs
running up to 15 degrees above normal. Cooler than normal
temperatures are forecast for the West Coast, influenced by the
upper trough and mainly overcast skies with highs decreasing to
10-20 degrees below normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 PM CDT Tue Oct 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move from the Mid-Missouri Valley into the
Upper Midwest today. In the West, low-amplitude ridging will build.
At the surface, a cold front will progress to near the Ohio Valley,
arcing southwestward into the southern Plains. Warm and dry
conditions are likely in parts of the Great Basin and Southwest.
Fire weather concerns across the CONUS appear minimal through the

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
For Thursday, upper-level ridging across the West is forecast to
amplify while broad cyclonic flow aloft will develop across the
eastern third of the U.S. At the surface, a similar, but weaker,
pressure pattern to Wednesday is expected. Cooler air will exist
across much of the Plains and into the East. Warm and dry conditions
are still expected in parts of the Great Basin and Southwest.
However, light winds and otherwise poorly receptive fuels will keep
fire weather concerns very low.

...Multi-day heavy rainfall and mountain snow threat inland from
the Pacific Northwest and especially California...

...Overview...

An active storm track over the eastern Pacific in association with
an anomalous upper level trough will result in multiple rounds of
impactful weather for the West Coast and extending well inland
across the Intermountain West.  Shortwave impulses are expected to
to eject eastward across the Plains and then the Midwest states,
with the main upper level trough reaching the Plains by the middle
of next week.  Across the eastern U.S., a surface high should be
in place after the cold front exits the coast on Friday, followed
by an upper ridge axis developing ahead of the central-western
U.S. trough by the end of the forecast period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The models and ensembles are in decent synoptic scale agreement on
Saturday with the deep trough over the West Coast region and the
closed low over southeast Canada.  Changes become apparent by
Sunday with a lead shortwave ejecting eastward from the broader
scale trough to the west.  The 12Z CMC was an outlier solution and
out of phase with both the timing and especially the magnitude of
the system crossing the Plains and Midwest by Monday, so none of
the 12Z CMC was used for this forecast period.  The new 00Z CMC
was not as extreme with this feature, although still on the strong
side of the guidance across the eastern U.S. by Tuesday.  For the
systems reaching the West Coast, there remains some model
disagreement regarding timing and placement of the surface low
centers, with the GFS indicating a more southern track towards
northern California.  By next Wednesday, the 12Z ECMWF is faster
with the timing of the main trough axis across the Plains, and the
CMC/GFS favoring a slower solution with potential closed upper low
development.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily
derived from a GFS/ECMWF/UKMET blend through this weekend, and
then GFS/ECMWF and their respective ensemble means for Monday
through Wednesday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of enhanced rains
are expected from Washington through especially California that
will likely be heavy at times with moist onshore flow ahead of
multiple Pacific storm systems.  This will especially hold true
for Sunday and into Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume
shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest across California as
part of an atmospheric river event.  Some locations may get on the
order of 4 to 8+ inches of rain over the entire forecast period,
particularly across favored windward terrain which may result in
some instances of runoff issues and/or flooding.  Heavy snows are
likely for the higher elevations of the Cascades and Sierra, with
over a foot of accumulation possible above pass level. Snow levels
are expected to be lower by late Sunday and into Monday as the
core of the upper trough moves inland.  Strong winds are also
possible for the coast and along the mountain ridges.

Some of this moisture is expected to reach the Intermountain West
and the central/northern Rockies with significant snowfall for
some of these areas, with a cold front reaching the Plains by
Tuesday.  Across the eastern U.S., a lead warm front lifting
northward across portions of the Midwest this weekend and into
Monday is expected to produce scattered to numerous showers with
the potential for a few mesoscale convective complexes.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region, with highs
running up to 15 degrees above normal ahead of the cold front.
Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for the West Coast,
influenced by the upper trough and mainly overcast skies with
highs decreasing to 10-20 degrees below normal.

...Pair of Pacific storms to bring heavy rain and mountain snow to
Northern California and the Pacific Northwest...

...Periods of rain and severe storms possible from the Midwest to
the northern Mid-Atlantic; severe storms also possible in the
Southern Plains on Thursday...

...Abnormally warm temperatures return in the East, cooler in the
Midwest and along the West Coast...

The first in a parade of Pacific storm systems to slam the West
Coast over the next 5-7 days is striking the Pacific Northwest
this morning. Rain will be the dominant precipitation type in the
valleys and coastal areas, while snow falls in the highest
elevations of the Cascades and Shastas. Precipitation should
diminish as the frontal system weakens late Wednesday into early
Thursday morning, but a second and more intense Pacific low
pressure system approaches on Thursday. The storm will direct a
moisture-rich atmospheric river at northern California and the
Pacific Northwest Thursday, pumping ample amounts of precipitation
at these regions. This is a welcome sight to much of the
drought-stricken and wildfire-riddled Northwest, particularly in
southwest Oregon and Northern California where the heaviest
amounts are expected. However, rainfall rates could reach
excessive levels at times, making flash flooding, rapid run off,
and debris flows a concern in burn scar areas. As a result, a
Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall is in place for portions of
Northern California and far southwest Oregon for Thursday and into
Friday. Only the highest elevations can expect measurable snowfall
due to high snow levels aloft.

In the Heartland, a strengthening area of low pressure tracking
into the Midwest today is sill causing snow to fall in parts of
South Dakotas. Snow should taper off in these areas as the storm
tracks east this morning. This area of low pressure is set to
produce periods of rain in the Upper Mississippi Valley.
Thunderstorms are also in the forecast with some storms
potentially becoming severe as far east as the Great Lakes and as
far south as the mid-Mississippi Valley. A Marginal Risk for
severe weather has been issued today for northern Iowa and
southern Minnesota. As the wave of low pressure pushes east into
the Great Lakes Thursday morning, so will its swath of showers and
thunderstorms. Thursday's most at risk area for severe weather is
in the eastern Great Lakes and western Pennsylvania, but
thunderstorms could even develop in the northern Mid-Atlantic.
Severe weather is also possible along a warm front emanating out
of a new wave of low pressure in the Southern Plains. Another
Marginal Risk is in place for southern Oklahoma where severe
storms may develop Thursday evening.

The East will witness the return of seasonally warmer temperatures
after experiencing more autumn-like conditions the last few days.
Widespread 70s are anticipated from the Mississippi Valley to the
Mid-Atlantic coast while the South Central U.S. sees highs soar
into the 80s. By Thursday, even parts of the Mid-Atlantic can
expect highs that approach 80 degrees but considerably warmer
conditions will be common up and down the East Coast and along the
Gulf Coast. In contrast, the persistent influence of onshore flow
from the onslaught of Pacific storm systems will generally keep
the West Coast on the cooler than normal side. In the Northern
Plains, a cold front is ushering in another shot of cooler
temperatures across the region today. This cold front makes its
way east into the Midwest and Great Lakes on Thursday, leading to
a similar cooling trend there. The cold front eventually reaches
the East Coast by Friday, allowing for a cool, crisp air-mass to
return across the Northeast for the upcoming weekend.

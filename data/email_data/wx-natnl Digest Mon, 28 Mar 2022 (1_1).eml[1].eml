Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1155 AM CDT Sun Mar 27 2022

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments
were made with this update.

Elevated fire-weather conditions are ongoing across portions of the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic and the central/southern Florida Peninsula
this morning, and these conditions will continue through the early
evening hours. Any critical conditions are expected to be too
spotty/brief for Critical delineations.

Across parts of TX, surface observations show mostly elevated
conditions, though locally critical conditions are occurring over
portions of Northwest TX. Current indications are that these
conditions will be localized and brief, precluding the introduction
of a Critical area.

For additional details, see the previous discussion below.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Sun Mar 27 2022/

...Synopsis...
...Carolinas and eastern Georgia...
Offshore flow will persist across the Carolinas and Southeast today.
Some surface pressure gradient will exist across the region, but
winds are mostly expected to strengthen during the afternoon amid
deep mixing below moderate mid-level flow. Surface winds are
expected to peak around 15 to 20 mph. The deeply mixed boundary
layer will also be very dry with relative humidity in the teens.
Some rain fell across portions of this region earlier last week, but
fuels are quickly drying amid the dry and breezy airmass. Therefore,
despite slightly weaker winds than Saturday, fire weather concerns
may be somewhat larger today due to the additional drying.

...Florida...
Northwesterly flow down the Florida Peninsula will keep a mostly
continental airmass in place with relative humidity potentially
dropping below 20 percent during the afternoon today. Sustained
winds are expected to peak around 10 to 12 mph. These conditions are
dry and breezy enough to support an elevated fire weather threat.

...Central and Southern Texas...
Southerly return flow will strengthen through the day Sunday.
However, trajectories off the Gulf of Mexico will keep the greater
low-level moisture across eastern Texas until after sunset when
winds back and it starts to advect farther west. Winds of 15 to 20
mph are expected with relative humidity of 10 to 20 percent.

...A rapidly deepening low pressure system presents a mid-late
next week heavy rain/severe weather threat focus across the South
while heavy snow/ice and high wind threat focus across the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes...


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance this morning continues to indicate the likelihood
of a rapidly deepening cyclone to track from the central Plains
through the Great Lakes Wednesday-Thursday.  Model consensus
appears to trend toward a faster progression of the cyclone center
through the Great Lakes in better agreement with earlier GFS runs.
 In addition, there has been a gradual eastward shift in the
rainfall maximum across the Deep South with a slightly faster
eastward motion of the southern stream low.  This eastward shift
might have ceased in the most recent couple of model cycles.  The
faster southern stream low also resulted in a faster progression
of the cold front through the eastern U.S. Thursday-Friday.

Meanwhile, the next upper trough from the Pacific will come into
play by midweek as it reaches the Pacific Northwest.  Models have
been showing difficulties in handling and resolving the timing and
evolution of this system as it heads downstream.  It appears that
the consensus is for the system to generally glide southeastward
across the western U.S. late this week as the ECMWF and CMC have
adopted a less amplified solution compared with earlier runs.
This would favor frontal wave development by the weekend over the
central Plains as supported by the ECMWF.  The timing of the
progression of the upper trough downstream is subject to large
uncertainty however.  At present, the consensus supports a frontal
wave to move across the Southeast late this weekend after a
potential resurgence of Gulf moisture late next week across the
central and eastern Gulf Coast states north of a stationary
boundary.

A composite blend of 40% 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 40% 06Z GFS/GEFS and
20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used to compose the Days 3-5
forecasts, transitioning to mostly a consensus of the ensemble
means by Day 7.  The results compare well with WPC continuity.
The timing of the upper trough/frontal wave across the mid-section
of the country is the most uncertain part of the forecasts.


...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

As a main surface low pressure system over the Plains strengthens
and tracks northeast, increasingly widespread rain with heavy
downpours and a threat for severe weather are forecast across the
South into Wednesday before spreading over the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic Thursday. A "slight" risk area remains
depicted on the WPC experimental medium range excessive rainfall
outlook (ERO) for Wednesday given favorable system ingredients and
antecedent conditions. Meanwhile, rain and thunderstorms are also
expected farther north from the central Plains through the East
with wavy frontal progression across the region.

On the northern side of the precipitation shield, expect a swath
of heavy wintry mix and accumulating snows from the Upper Midwest
to the Great Lakes into Wednesday-Thursday given continued
excellent model consensus on developing a rather intense cyclone.
In addition, high winds appear likely near and well to the west of
the low track given the impressive rate of cyclogenesis.  Some
wintry precipitation is also forecast for northern New England
ahead of and on the back side of this system.

Late week, additional upper trough energies forecast to dig with
some uncertainty southeastward from the Pacific Northwest through
the West could provide another opportunity for an enhanced round
of wintry weather, mainly for the northern to central
Intermountain West/Rockies to the High Plains.  Potential system
amplitude and progression into next weekend would favor return
moisture flow into an increasingly wavy/lifting front.  This may
support renewed heavy rainfall potential across the
central/eastern Gulf Coast states and Southeast next weekend.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun March 27 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19960319 - 20090406 - 19530325 - 19930307 - 19520403


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)

...Much below average temperatures expected from the Great Lakes
into the Northeast, with records possible...

...Lake effect snows to remain active off the eastern Lakes,
beginning to diminish on Monday...

...An Elevated to Critical Fire Weather Threat for the Southern
Plains, the Southeast and portions of Florida...

...Much needed precipitation to move into California Sunday night,
the Southwest, Great Basin and Rockies on Tuesday...

Broad cyclonic flow across southeast Canada into the northeastern
U.S. will keep temperatures well below average over the next two
days from the Great Lakes into the Northeast.  Many locations will
see both morning low and afternoon high temperatures 15 to 25
degrees colder than average.  There is the potential for record
low maximum temperatures on Monday across the Mid-Atlantic into
the Northeast, including the major metropolitan regions from DC to
Boston.  Temperatures should begin to moderate across these areas
by mid week, with a return to much above average temperatures
Thursday and Friday.

The much below average temperatures across the northeastern
quarter of the nation have been supporting active early spring
lake effect snows downwind of all of the Great Lakes.  Heavy snows
have been observed over the past 24 hours, especially to the east
and southeast of Lake Erie.  Snow totals of 6-12" have been
reported over portions of western New York State, southwest
Pennsylvania, western Maryland and central West Virginia, with 4
to 6" reported over northeast Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania.
The active lake effect snows will continue Sunday night, but begin
to diminish during the day on Monday.

Dry weather is expected over the next two days across large
portions of the central and eastern U.S.   These dry conditions,
combined with low relative humidities and windy conditions will
increase the threat of fire weather conditions across the Southern
Plains, the Southeast and portions of Florida.

The recent dry weather across much of California will be coming to
at least a temporary end tonight as an approaching storm system
pushes rain inland.  Heavy precipitation likely tonight into
Monday across large sections of California, with heavy snows in
the 12-24 inch range possible through the Sierra.  California
remains in severe to extreme drought with the precipiation over
the next 24 hours likely followed by dry conditions for the
remainder of the week.   The storm system affecting California
over the next 24 hours will push inland into the Southwest, Great
Basin and Rockies on Tuesday, supporting widespread moderate
precipitation amounts across these regions.  Similar to
California, much of this region is also in severe to extreme
drought conditions.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Sun Mar 27 2022

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE OKLAHOMA/TEXAS
PANHANDLES INTO NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO...

The Critical area in the southern High Plains was expanded slightly
southwestward toward the Sacramento Mountains in eastern NM. Here,
deep boundary-layer mixing combined with downslope warming/drying
will result in single digit RH amid 20 mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds.

Farther north, locally critical conditions will be possible across
portions of eastern WY into southwestern SD and northwestern NE.
However, the localized and potentially brief nature of these
conditions precludes the introduction of a Critical area at this
time.

Elsewhere, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0207 AM CDT Sun Mar 27 2022/

...Synopsis...
...Southern High Plains...
An upper-level low will be off the California coast at the start of
the period, but will move eastward through the day toward the
southern Great Basin. Ahead of this upper low, a strong mid-level
jet will move across the Southwest and into the southern High
Plains. Meanwhile, lee cyclogenesis will occur across the Plains
which will tighten the pressure gradient. The combination of the
tightening pressure gradient, a strengthening low-level jet, and
strong mid-level flow in an environment featuring deep mixing will
result in dry and breezy conditions across much of the southern High
Plains. The worst conditions are expected from northeast New Mexico
into the TX/OK Panhandles where winds of 20 to 25 mph are expected
with widespread single digit relative humidity. The critical
delineation has been drawn to best reflect the area with the
greatest threat for critical fire weather conditions.

...Southern Virginia and northern North Carolina...
Another day of dry and breezy offshore flow is expected across
southern Virginia and northern North Carolina on Monday as another
trough pivots through the northwesterly flow and strengthens
mid-level wind speeds. Surface winds of 15 to 20 mph are expected
where this stronger flow overspreads a well-mixed boundary layer,
from southern Virginia into northern North Carolina.

...Eastern Wyoming into southwest South Dakota and portions of the
Nebraska Panhandle...
Dry and breezy conditions are expected across much of Wyoming as the
surface low strengthens in the Plains. However, most fuels are still
snow-covered or moist at higher terrain. Therefore, the threat for
any fire weather concern will mostly be in low-elevation fine fuels
across eastern Wyoming and into portions of southwest South Dakota
and the Nebraska Panhandle. Winds are expected around 15 to 20 mph
with single-digit relative humidities.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO INTO WESTERN
PORTIONS OF THE OK/TX PANHANDLES....

...Synopsis...
...Northern South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia...
A strong mid-level jet streak will move from the Great Lakes to the
western Atlantic today. This strong mid-level flow is expected to
overspread a region of deep mixing east of the Appalachians. In this
region, relative humidity in the mid teens to low 20s is expected.
In addition, sustained wind speeds of 15 mph (localized 20) are
expected from northern South Carolina into the Mid-Atlantic.
However, temperatures will be too cool across northern Virginia and
northward to support a fire weather threat.

...Eastern Wyoming into southwest South Dakota and the Nebraska
Panhandle...
Lee troughing will amplify during the day today which will tighten
the pressure gradient across the Plains and High Plains. This may
lead to some elevated to locally critical wind speeds across eastern
Wyoming and into southwest South Dakota and the Nebraska Panhandle
where relative humidity is also expected to be 8 to 13 percent.

...Southern High Plains...
The surface pressure gradient will tighten through the day Monday as
lee troughing amplifies in the central Plains. However, the stronger
sustained wind speeds (greater than 20 mph) are not expected until
later in the afternoon when strong mid-level flow overspreads a very
dry airmass across the Southwest and southern High Plains (5-10
percent RH). A broad region of elevated conditions is expected with
critical conditions across northeast New Mexico and adjacent areas
of the OK/TX Panhandles.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS INTO SOUTHWEST KANSAS...

...Synopsis...
A significant fire weather episode is anticipated across portions of
the southern High Plains into Southwest Kansas Tuesday afternoon.

A cyclone with a surface pressure at or below 990mb will develop
somewhere in the central Plains on Tuesday. This will tighten the
pressure gradient across the Plains. However, in addition, a 75 kt
mid-level jet streak will nose into the region Tuesday afternoon.
This will provide additional support for strengthening wind speeds
Tuesday afternoon, especially across the Texas Panhandle. Sustained
winds of 30 to 35 mph are likely from eastern New Mexico into the
TX/OK Panhandles and into southwest Kansas. Some wind gusts in
excess of 60 mph are likely. Despite a synoptic setup and wind
speeds which could support an extremely critical delineation,
low-level moisture will likely preclude the need for an extremely
critical. Most guidance forecasts dewpoints in the 20s to low 30s
which yields relative humidity in the 18 to 25 percent range. This
is dry enough to support a critical delineation, but is too high to
support an extremely critical area. Poor overnight recoveries on
Monday night from northeast New Mexico into the TX/OK Panhandles
should further prime the fuels for Tuesday in this region.

However, despite not having sufficient meteorological evidence to
support an extremely critical delineation, the pattern still remains
very favorable for large-fire spread on Tuesday. An expansive region
of very strong winds where fuels remain dormant in a region
experiencing D2-D4 drought is a recipe for numerous starts and the
potential for fires to quickly spread. Additionally, if guidance
trends drier, an extremely critical delineation may still be
necessary.

...A deep and windy storm to bring a late week threat of Upper
Great Lakes heavy snow and heavy rain/severe weather to the East...


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS and 12
UTC ECMWF/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models
days 3/4 (Thursday-Friday) in a stormy pattern with above normal
predictability. This blend is also well supported by ensembles and
00 UTC model guidance.

Embedded smaller scale system differences in the main two flow
streams and run to run continuity variance becomes more
problematic from the weekend onward despite reasonably similar
larger scale pattern evolutions. A blend of more compatible
guidance from the 18 UTC GEFS mean and 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean
tends to mitigate the less predictable forecast components while
inclusion of the most compatible model, the 12 UTC ECMWF, provides
a bit more detail consistent with a pattern with near average
predictability. Overall, WPC product continuity is well maintained
with this strategy and the forecast seems in line with a composite
of 00 UTC guidance.


...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A deep and windy storm set to lift from the Great Lakes to eastern
Canada Thursday into Friday offers a threat for wrapping heavy
snows north of the low track. Heavy rainfall will sweep across the
Eastern Seaboard with frontal system progression Thursday along
with a severe weather threat focus over the Mid-Atlantic as per
SPC.

A protracted series of more modest upstream upper trough energies
and frontal systems forecast to dig with some uncertainty through
the West later week into next week could each provide an
opportunity for enhanced rounds of wintry weather, mainly for the
north-central Intermountain West/Rockies. Potential system
amplitude and progression into next weekend/early next week would
favor return moisture into a wavy frontal pattern. This may
support a heavy rainfall focus from the Gulf Coast states to the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic. By early next week there is also a
guidance signal to bring more energetic Pacific flow toward the
West Coast in two streams to be monitored.

...Much below-average temperatures are expected from the Great
Lakes into the Northeast, with records possible...

...Lake effect snow to remain active off the Lower Great Lakes,
beginning to diminish overnight Monday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern High Plains...

...Rain and snow return to the West...

A deep upper-level trough over the Great Lakes to the Northeast
will allow temperatures to be 15 to 30 degrees below average over
the region. As a result, the temperatures will be a record or tied
for a record cold high temperatures over parts of the Northeast
Coast, which will start to moderate on Tuesday. In addition, the
associated upper-level energy will aid in producing lake effect
snow over the Great Lakes and upslope snow for Northern New
England through late Monday night when the snow will end, from
west to east.

Meanwhile, a deep upper-level low will begin to move onshore over
California, moving inland to the Plains by Wednesday. Therefore,
light rain will develop over most of the West Coast, with moderate
snow over the Sierra Nevada Mountains on Monday. Furthermore, a
stream of moisture will flow into Southern California, producing a
Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall on Monday. Overnight Monday
into Tuesday, the rain and higher elevation snow will move the
Northern/Central Rockies and Great Basin/Southwest, ending mainly
by Wednesday.

As the storm moves out of the Rockies on Tuesday, moisture will
start to flow northward over the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
The moisture will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms over
parts of the Central/Southern Plains and adjacent parts of the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley. Some of the thunderstorms will
become severe. Therefore, from Tuesday into Wednesday morning, the
SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central/Southern Plains and adjacent parts of the Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Moreover, the WPC has issued a
Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over
the area on Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

Furthermore, rain and snow will develop over parts of the Northern
Plains. An area of light rain/freezing rain will develop over a
wide area from the Upper Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes and
parts of the Central Appalachians overnight Tuesday into Wednesday.

In addition, the SPC has issued a Critical Risk of fire weather
over parts of the Southern High Plains Monday into Tuesday morning
due to gusty winds, low relative humidity, and dry fuels. The
threat of a Critical Risk of fire weather expands on Tuesday into
Wednesday morning over most of the parts of the Southern High
Plains.

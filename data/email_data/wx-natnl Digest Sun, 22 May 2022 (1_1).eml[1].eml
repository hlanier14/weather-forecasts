Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CDT Sat May 21 2022

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

Expanded the elevated area northwest into eastern Arizona where
winds of 15 to 20 mph and relative humidity around 15 percent is
expected. Otherwise, the ongoing forecast is on track and no
additional changes are needed.

..Bentley.. 05/21/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1247 AM CDT Sat May 21 2022/

...Synopsis...
Early-morning surface observations reveal a cold front continuing to
push southward across the southern Plains. Behind this front,
pressure rises denote a building surface high across the central
High Plains, which is forecast to migrate into the southern Plains
over the next 24 hours. Consequently, weaker winds and cooler
temperatures will limit fire weather concerns compared to previous
days for most of the southern High Plains. Regional fire weather
concerns are expected for parts of the Southwest where warm/dry
conditions will persist.

...Central to southern New Mexico...
Poor overnight RH recovery is noted across central to southern NM
with RH values generally between 10-20%. These dry conditions will
linger into the afternoon as the cold front stalls to the east due
to terrain blocking. Despite persistent zonal flow aloft, the
building surface high will limit any lee troughing to northern NM
where a weak low is noted in morning observations. This low will
likely undergo slight thermally-induced deepening through the day.
As a result, the tightening regional pressure gradient over
central/southern NM and parts of far eastern AZ should support
sustained winds between 15-20 mph. Diurnal RH reductions to well
below 15% are likely, and will support elevated fire weather
conditions. Localized critical conditions are possible, but are most
likely to occur through the lower desert terrain (roughly along the
I-25 corridor) where fuel loading is minimal. Additionally, poor
upper-level wind support will mitigate the potential for
sufficiently widespread/persistent critical conditions.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA AND WESTERN NEW
MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
Added a Critical area across eastern Arizona and western New Mexico
where sustained winds of 20 to 25 mph are expected amid 10 to 15
percent relative humidity. Additionally, expanded the Elevated
delineation into eastern Utah. Despite cooler temperatures today,
relative humidity remains dry across the region and fuels remain
critical. Winds of 15 to 25 mph are expected Sunday with 7 to 12
percent relative humidity.

...Multi-Day Heavy Rainfall and Strong Thunderstorm Threat from
the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the
Ohio Valley and Great Lakes early-mid next week to work across the
East later week...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A stormy weather pattern is expected to develop across the
continental U.S. going into the middle of next week, as multiple
waves of low pressure develop along a frontal boundary situated
over the Plains and extending to the Great Lakes. This will be in
response to a building upper level trough over the High Plains
that will slowly move eastward through the week with the front
reaching the East Coast by Friday. A second system is slated to
dig through the Northwest to the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies and northern Plains Thursday-Saturday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue to offer below normal forecast
spread/uncertainty days 3-7, bolstering forecast confidence to
above normal values. While local convective rainfall focus remains
less settled, guidance offers consistent regional areas of threat.
The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS and 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian,
WPC continuity and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models (NBM) days
3-5 (Tuesday-Thursday) before enough uncertainty with flow
progression and convective interactions compounds to favor blend
introduction of the 06 UTC GEFS mean and 00 UTC ECMWF ensemble
mean to smooth the rough edges consistent with predictability.
This composite solution now also seems overall in line with latest
12 UTC models and ensembles.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

The next system developing over the south-central U.S. into
early-mid next week is expected to become the main weather
headline of this forecast period. There will likely be widespread
convection and heavy rainfall from Texas to the Great Lakes with
moist return flow into another slow moving and wavy frontal
system. There is an increasing potential for some flash flooding
with the slower moving storms within a very moist and unstable
atmosphere. The latest WPC experimental Excessive Rainfall Outlook
indicates a Slight Risk area for Tuesday into Thursday from the
ArkLaTex region into the lower Mississippi/Ohio valleys. and the
potential exists for 3 to 6+ inch rainfall totals over that 48
hour time period. Some severe storms are certainly within the
realm of possibility for these same general areas where parameters
of shear and instability are greatest, although model differences
remain on the placement of MCS activity. Widespread convection
will also spread across the eastern states later week with less
certainty/details but local threat potential.

The west-central U.S. trough should initially keep temperatures
below normal across Rockies and extending across the central
Plains through about Wednesday before much warmer weather returns
by the end of the week. Some late season snow showers will also be
possible across the higher terrain of central Colorado on Tuesday.
Much of the southwestern U.S. should remain dry through the end of
next week as upper ridging builds over the region and warmer
temperatures expand across the region. Building heat across
interior portions of California and the Desert Southwest could
result in highs running 10-20 degrees above normal for some areas,
with widespread 100+ degree high temperatures for the lower
elevations. There will likely be some showers across the Pacific
Northwest by Friday and then reaching the northern Rockies/Plains
with some thunderstorms by Saturday as the next front enters this
region.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat May 21 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19670504 - 19590519 - 20050501 - 19810508 - 19670513

On Saturday night, a front extending from the Northeast to the
Southern Plains will move eastward off the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic Coast by Monday. Showers and thunderstorms will
develop along and ahead of the boundary through Monday.

The front and moisture pooling along the boundary will aid in
destabilizing the atmosphere. Therefore, the SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Northeast to
the Southern Plains through Sunday morning. The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

In addition, heavy rain develops along the boundary from the Ohio
Valley to the Southern Plains. Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms from
the Ohio Valley to the Lower Mississippi Valley through Sunday
morning. The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized
areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small
streams the most vulnerable.

As the front moves eastward, the threat of severe thunderstorms
also moves. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Northeast and a Marginal Risk
extending from the Mid-Atlantic to the Southeast/Central Gulf
Coast on Sunday into Monday morning. The hazards associated with
these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. In addition, there is a
Marginal Risk for excessive rainfall associated with most of the
front from the Northeast to the Southeast on Sunday into Monday
morning. However, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall over portions of the Central Gulf Coast from Sunday into
Monday morning. The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams the most vulnerable.

The front lingers over the southern Mid-Atlantic on Monday,
roughly westward to the Southern Plains and Southern Rockies.
Showers and thunderstorms will continue over the Mid-Atlantic to
the Southeast/Central Gulf Coast. There will also be a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall over the area. Furthermore, moisture
will surge northward over the Southern Plains into the Central
Plains. Upper-level impulses will move across the region on Monday
to trigger showers and thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms over south-central Texas and a second area over
central Kansas into Oklahoma and parts of the Texas Panhandle on
Monday. The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized
areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small
streams the most vulnerable.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy will aid in developing rain with
embedded thunderstorms and higher elevation snow over parts of the
Pacific Northwest and the Northern Intermountain Region, mainly as
a diurnal event. Additionally, rain will develop over parts of the
Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley through late Saturday
night. However, snow will develop over parts of the Central
Rockies and continue through Sunday morning. On Sunday, higher
elevation snow and lower elevation rain will develop over parts of
the Northern/Central Rockies through Monday morning. As moisture
moves over the Plains, rain and thunderstorms will develop over
parts of the Upper Midwest through Monday evening.

Elsewhere, fire weather concerns are expected to continue for
portions of New Mexico, where dry and windy conditions may
continue to promote conditions favorable for rapid-fire growth.
However, on Sunday, the SPC issued a Critical Risk of fire weather
over parts of Arizona and New Mexico.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1249 AM CDT Sun May 22 2022

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA TO WESTERN NEW
MEXICO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN UTAH...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected today across portions of the
Southwest and Four Corners region. Early-morning water-vapor imagery
reveals a weak upper-level disturbance approaching Baja California.
This feature will meander east through the day, resulting in modest
surface pressure falls across the greater Four Corner region. The
tightening pressure gradient at the surface will result in
strengthening winds over a region with low relative humidity and dry
fuels.

...Eastern Arizona to New Mexico...
Latest guidance continues to show reasonably high probability of
sustained 20-25 mph winds across parts of eastern AZ into western NM
this afternoon. This region has seen slight drying over the past 24
hours with dewpoints largely in the low to mid 20s. Little to no
moisture recovery into the region will support another day of
widespread sub-15% RH. Recent fuel analyses as well as fire activity
over the past 24 hours indicate fuels are very receptive.
Consequently, elevated to critical fire weather conditions are
expected across much of eastern AZ and western NM. Within the
Critical risk area, brief and localized high-end critical conditions
are possible as RH falls into the single digits with occasional wind
gusts between 25-30 mph.

...Southern Nevada to eastern Utah...
Southern NV will largely be on the periphery of the stronger
low-level mass response; however, ensemble guidance has shown
reasonably good agreement in sustained 15-20 mph winds this
afternoon with RH values falling to 10-15%. Ensemble guidance also
hints at an increasing probability for sustained 20 mph winds across
southern to southeastern UT. Fuels through this region are receptive
based on latest ERC analyses, warranting the introduction of a small
Critical risk area where confidence in the overlap of dry fuels, 20+
mph winds and sub-15% RH is highest.

...Southern to central High Plains...
A dry return flow regime is expected across the OK/TX Panhandles
into eastern CO/western KS this afternoon. The recent frontal
intrusion will limit any moisture return into the region this
afternoon as surface winds increase to 15-20 mph. However, cooler
temperatures will generally limit RH reductions with only a few
warmer/drier solutions hinting at critical RH. Additionally, recent
precipitation across eastern CO will limit the spatial extent of the
concern. While localized elevated conditions are possible, these
factors preclude highlights at this time.

...Sacramento Valley...
Northerly down-valley flow is expected this afternoon, which will
help adiabatically dry and warm conditions through the Sacramento
Valley with RH values falling to near 15% by mid afternoon. However,
winds are expected to generally be weak with ensemble consensus
suggesting 10-15 mph winds are likely. A few locations may observe
periodic elevated conditions, but the overall threat remains too
limited for highlights.

...Heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding for the Lower
Mississippi Valley today...

...One last day of record heat for the Northeast; record cold in
the Rockies and central Plains...

A strong cold front will continue its eastward and southeastward
motion into the Northeast today, with very warm temperatures
preceding it. Readings will again reach well into the 80s and low
to mid 90s from the Mid-Atlantic into New England. This could
approach or exceed some daily records over Southern New England.
As the front nears this afternoon, showers and thunderstorms will
increase in coverage through the I-81 corridor then toward the
coast around and after sunset. Some thunderstorms may be severe,
with strong winds and hail possible. To the south, the tail-end of
the front will slowly move toward the northwestern Gulf coast
where increased moisture from the south will fuel showers and
thunderstorms this afternoon. Rainfall could be heavy over
portions of southeastern Louisiana into central/southern
Mississippi and Alabama with flash flooding possible. Into the
Rockies, record cold temperatures this morning will rebound into
the 50s across many lower elevations, but this will still be well
below normal for late May. Fire weather concerns will continue
over the Southwest, but shift into southern Utah and eastern
Arizona to the south and west of a lingering frontal boundary.

On Monday, the frontal boundary will have pushed into the
Atlantic, ushering in much cooler weather for the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic. Temperatures will be about 20 degrees cooler than
Sunday as high pressure moves through the Great Lakes and southern
Canada. The stalled frontal boundary over the Southeast and Lower
Mississippi Valley will again be a focus for showers and storms,
with the continued threat for flash flooding. Additionally,
rainfall will increase in coverage and intensity of parts of Texas
and Kansas/Oklahoma as moisture surges into the Plains ahead of a
mid-level system in the Rockies. North of this area, across the
central Plains, temperatures will be well below normal by about
20-25 degrees. Farther west, the central California valley will
trend much warmer (into the mid 90s) as a weak front moves into
the Pacific Northwest will mainly light mountain rain and snow.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CDT Sun May 22 2022

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
The surface low that is forecast to develop over the Four Corners
region on Sunday will shift into the southern/central High Plains by
Monday afternoon. This will strengthen westerly winds across the
Southwest, resulting in another day of fire weather concerns for a
region with receptive fuels. A few dry thunderstorms are possible
across southeast Colorado/eastern New Mexico Monday afternoon, but
overall confidence in the propensity for dry lightning strikes is
low.

...Southwest...
Fire activity in recent days verifies the critically dry fuels
depicted in fuel guidance across eastern AZ into NM. Dry conditions
already in place across this region will linger given little to no
moisture recovery over the next 48 hours. As the pressure gradient
tightens through the day Monday, sustained winds should increase to
15-20 mph, as suggested by ensemble guidance. While elevated
conditions appear likely, a few solutions hint that winds up to
20-25 mph (with gusts up to 35 mph) are possible across portions of
southwest to central NM. However, such conditions will most likely
occur in mainly desert terrain where fuel loading is low, and this
scenario is depicted by mainly warmer/drier members. Trends in
guidance and observations will be monitored, and a Critical risk
area may be needed for portions of southern NM if confidence in
widespread critical conditions increases.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Thunderstorm initiation is likely late Monday afternoon along the
southern Rockies from southeast CO into eastern NM within an upslope
flow regime. Forecast soundings suggest that early convective
activity may occur on the fringe of deeper boundary-layer moisture
where precipitable-water values are forecast to be near 0.5 to 0.75
inches. This suggests that initial thunderstorms may pose a threat
for a few dry lightning strikes. However, storm motions to the east
at around 30 knots should promote quick intensification within the
richer moisture, yielding increasing rainfall rates. This may limit
the duration and coverage of the dry-lightning threat, and precludes
any dry-lightning highlights at this time.

...Heavy rainfall and strong thunderstorms for the south-central
U.S. for the middle of the week with the potential for some
flooding issues from eastern Texas to Tennessee...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A large scale upper trough will be exiting the Rockies and
emerging over the Plains by Wednesday, and this will sustain a
surface cold front with multiple waves of low pressure that will
slowly track eastward and should reach the East Coast by early
Friday.  Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall and strong
thunderstorms are likely across the south-central U.S. ahead of
the cold frontal passage.  Another trough enters the northwestern
U.S. by the end of the week with an upper ridge building in ahead
of it across the Intermountain West, and this trough will likely
spur surface cyclogenesis across the western High Plains by next
weekend.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite continues to indicate decent overall
synoptic scale agreement across the continental U.S. for the
majority of the forecast period, with the normal levels of
differences in mesoscale features.  Model differences have
improved for the second system reaching the western U.S., and the
GFS and ECMWF are close to their respective ensemble means for the
major trough across the east-central U.S., with the 00Z CMC
slightly more amplified with the trough as it crosses the
Mississippi River Valley.  The WPC forecast initially started with
a multi-deterministic model blend through Friday, and then more of
the ensemble means while still maintaining some of the operational
GFS and ECMWF with a little less of the CMC.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Periods of heavy rainfall will continue to make weather headlines
going into Wednesday across the south-central U.S., particularly
around the ArkLaTex region and extending eastward to Mississippi,
where 2 to 3+ inches of additional rainfall is expected.  Portions
of this region are forecast to get heavy rainfall early in the
week as well, thus the ground will likely be saturated and
increases the potential for flooding.  Multiple MCS clusters are
likely and these may also produce episodes of severe weather.
Therefore, a Slight Risk area of excessive rainfall remains for
Wednesday into early Thursday from northeast Texas to western
Tennessee.  Beyond this time, the magnitude of the heavy rainfall
threat abates some as the front becomes more progressive across
the Appalachians and then the East Coast region, although some
instances of repeating convection may also lead to some flooding
concerns on a more localized level.  By next weekend, the front
moving inland across the northwestern U.S. and eventually the
central/northern Plains is expected to bring some showers and a
few storms from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern Rockies and
then Dakotas.

In terms of temperatures, pleasantly cool conditions can be
expected across much of the Plains and Midwest in the wake of the
cold front for the middle of the week, followed by a warm-up to
close out the week with above normal highs returning by the
weekend with 90s likely as far north as southern Nebraska, and
even some low 100s for portions of western Texas.  Hot weather is
also expected for the interior valleys of California and the lower
elevations of the Desert Southwest for Wednesday through Friday as
an upper level ridge is expected to be in place, and then
returning closer normal for next weekend.  Elsewhere, expect highs
to generally be within 5 degrees of climatological averages across
most of the eastern U.S., although overnight lows could end up
being milder than usual owing to more cloud cover and humidity.

Extended Forecast Discussion

256 AM EDT Sun May 22 2022

...Heavy rainfall and strong thunderstorms for the south-central
U.S. for the middle of the week with the potential for some
flooding issues from eastern Texas to Tennessee...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A large scale upper trough will be exiting the Rockies and
emerging over the Plains by Wednesday, and this will sustain a
surface cold front with multiple waves of low pressure that will
slowly track eastward and should reach the East Coast by early
Friday.  Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall and strong
thunderstorms are likely across the south-central U.S. ahead of
the cold frontal passage.  Another trough enters the northwestern
U.S. by the end of the week with an upper ridge building in ahead
of it across the Intermountain West, and this trough will likely
spur surface cyclogenesis across the western High Plains by next
weekend.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite continues to indicate decent overall
synoptic scale agreement across the continental U.S. for the
majority of the forecast period, with the normal levels of
differences in mesoscale features.  Model differences have
improved for the second system reaching the western U.S., and the
GFS and ECMWF are close to their respective ensemble means for the
major trough across the east-central U.S., with the 00Z CMC
slightly more amplified with the trough as it crosses the
Mississippi River Valley.  The WPC forecast initially started with
a multi-deterministic model blend through Friday, and then more of
the ensemble means while still maintaining some of the operational
GFS and ECMWF with a little less of the CMC.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Periods of heavy rainfall will continue to make weather headlines
going into Wednesday across the south-central U.S., particularly
around the ArkLaTex region and extending eastward to Mississippi,
where 2 to 3+ inches of additional rainfall is expected.  Portions
of this region are forecast to get heavy rainfall early in the
week as well, thus the ground will likely be saturated and
increases the potential for flooding.  Multiple MCS clusters are
likely and these may also produce episodes of severe weather.
Therefore, a Slight Risk area of excessive rainfall remains for
Wednesday into early Thursday from northeast Texas to western
Tennessee.  Beyond this time, the magnitude of the heavy rainfall
threat abates some as the front becomes more progressive across
the Appalachians and then the East Coast region, although some
instances of repeating convection may also lead to some flooding
concerns on a more localized level.  By next weekend, the front
moving inland across the northwestern U.S. and eventually the
central/northern Plains is expected to bring some showers and a
few storms from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern Rockies and
then Dakotas.

In terms of temperatures, pleasantly cool conditions can be
expected across much of the Plains and Midwest in the wake of the
cold front for the middle of the week, followed by a warm-up to
close out the week with above normal highs returning by the
weekend with 90s likely as far north as southern Nebraska, and
even some low 100s for portions of western Texas.  Hot weather is
also expected for the interior valleys of California and the lower
elevations of the Desert Southwest for Wednesday through Friday as
an upper level ridge is expected to be in place, and then
returning closer normal for next weekend.  Elsewhere, expect highs
to generally be within 5 degrees of climatological averages across
most of the eastern U.S., although overnight lows could end up
being milder than usual owing to more cloud cover and humidity.

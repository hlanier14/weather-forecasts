Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1025 AM CDT Fri Oct 15 2021

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed
based on morning surface observations. The LAX-DAG pressure gradient
has fallen to around -5 mb as of 15Z, which is perhaps slightly
stronger than the forecast ensemble mean, but still well within the
anticipated forecast range. Correspondingly, surface observations
show winds gusting into the 20-30 mph range for several locations.
Regional VWP observations continue to show weak mid and upper-level
wind support with 20-30 mph winds confined the lowest 1-1.5 km. RH
values have begun to fall into the teens due to downslope effects
and the early onset of diurnal warming, and should continue to fall
into the low teens/single digits. Given these observed trends,
elevated conditions remain most likely along the coast with pockets
of critical conditions in terrain-favored locations where wind gusts
may approach 40-50 mph. See the discussion below for additional
details.

..Moore.. 10/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1229 AM CDT Fri Oct 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will continue eastward from the Plains into
parts of the Midwest today. Across the West, an upper-level ridge
will build. At the surface, a high pressure system will strengthen
within the Great Basin and persist into Saturday.

...Southern California...
Winds have already begun to turn offshore this evening across
southern California. Winds should continue to increase through the
overnight into Friday morning. Winds will peak sometime between
early morning and early afternoon. Poor overnight RH recovery is
expected which means elevated conditions are likely for much of the
period. Winds of 15-20 mph are expected broadly with
terrain-enhanced areas potentially seeing 25-30 mph during the peak
of the event. The most likely areas for critical conditions will be
the higher terrain of Los Angeles/Ventura Counties. However, the
general lack of mid-level wind support, combined with a marginally
critical surface pressure gradient, suggest critical conditions will
be localized.

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure with associated onshore flow is forecast t=
o
affect parts of the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. with periods of
precipitation, potentially heavy, and enhanced winds during late October.
Surface low pressure associated with the mid-level low pressure is anticipa=

to be centered over the Gulf of Alaska. However, the orientation of the flo=
w
pattern is anticipated to keep the heaviest precipitation south of Alaska.
Therefore, hazardous weather is not expected across Alaska at this time.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of heavy precipitation for parts of Oregon and northern
California, Sat-Mon, Oct 23-25.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the western U.S., Sat-Fri, =
Oct
23-29.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the western U.S., Sat-Mon, Oct 23-25=

FOR SATURDAY OCTOBER 23 - FRIDAY OCTOBER 29: Ensemble means from multiple
models continue to depict an amplified, persistent 500-hPa negatively tilte=

ort
(IVT) indicates the greatest likelihood for enhanced values (>250 kg/ms)
across
the West Coast from the beginning to middle of week-2. Heavy rainfall may
trigger flooding and debris flows, especially over burn scarred areas of th=
e
West. However, the early season precipitation would be beneficial to
drought-stricken areas of the West. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor
valid
on Oct 12, more than a third of California is designated with severe (D2) t=
o
exceptional (D4) drought. No heavy snow hazards are posted due to the
expectation that significant snow accumulations are forecast to be limited =
to
the highest elevations of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada Mountains. The
amplified trough and increased chance of atmospheric rivers also support a
slight risk of high winds for much of the West. Both the reforecast tools
indicate the greatest high wind potential at the beginning of the period.
Therefore, a slight risk of high winds is posted across parts of the wester=
n
U.S. based on the anticipated synoptic flow as well as guidance from the
deterministic model guidance and reforecast tools.



There is good multi-model agreement indicating the potential for a mid-leve=
l
shortwave trough forming over the Central CONUS by the middle of week-2,
increasing chances for frontal activity in that region. This feature combin=
ed
with possible strong onshore flow associated with surface high pressure ove=
r
the southeastern CONUS may increase the likelihood for enhanced rainfall
across
parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and eastern Texas. The reforecast too=
ls
indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th
percentile and one inch across the aforementioned regions Oct 25 to 27.
However, recent uncalibrated and deterministic model guidance indicate that
disturbances would be relatively progressive and do not support the additio=
n
of
a related heavy precipitation hazard. The synoptic pattern may also increas=
e
chances for high winds across parts of south-central CONUS. The reforecast
tools indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th
percentile across the southern and central Plains Oct 25 to 27, but the too=
ls
do not indicate wind speeds exceeding 25 mph. Additionally, recent
deterministic GFS model runs do not favor wind speeds exceeding 25 mph,
precluding a high wind hazard from being posted at this time.



Model guidance continues to indicate a potential amplifying mid-level troug=
h
across the eastern third of the CONUS from the end of week-1 into the
beginning
of week-2, which could support increased chances of the first frost of the
season throughout the Corn Belt at the beginning of the period, which would=
 be
slightly late for much of that region. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts a
greater spatial coverage of at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures
falling below the 15th percentile and freezing, across many parts of the
northeastern quadrant of the CONUS Oct 23 to 25, before shifting more to th=
e
Northeast and Appalachians Oct 26. The GEFS reforecast tool, however, limit=
s
the greater than 20% chance of exceeding these thresholds to the Corn Belt =
on
Oct 23 to 24. Due to significant model differences indicating the potential
for
much below normal temperatures, in addition to uncalibrated model guidance =
and
week-2 guidance tools not supporting significantly cold temperatures, and
negative anomalies being low in magnitude, a related risk is not designated=
 at
this time.



Downstream of a 500-hPa trough, above normal precipitation is only slightly
favored across parts of southeastern Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Howev=
er,
reforecast tools are unsupportive of precipitation amounts reaching hazard
thresholds, as the orientation of the associated surface low over Gulf of
Alaska favors the majority of the strong onshore flow further south, primar=

to the West Coast of the CONUS.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CDT Fri Oct 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed. Both deterministic and ensemble guidance continue to show
the potential for elevated to locally critical conditions Saturday
morning before the pressure gradient weakens through the afternoon.
See the discussion below for further details.

..Moore.. 10/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0103 AM CDT Fri Oct 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
For Saturday, upper-level ridging will continue to expand across the
West and into the Plains. At the surface, a large anticyclone will
be situated within the Great Basin and much of the Plains.

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient is expected to be slightly weaker
than on Friday morning. However, it appears that elevated fire
weather will persist into Saturday morning as the surface pressure
gradient diurnally maximizes once again. Winds of 15-20 mph will be
most common along with continued areas of low RH. As on Friday,
terrain-favored locations will experience slightly stronger winds.
Winds in all areas should weaken by the afternoon.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Fri Oct 15 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Oct 18 2021 - 12Z Fri Oct 22 2021

...Overview...

The main weather feature across the U.S. next week will be an
upper low pushing a surface frontal system ahead of it and
spreading precipitation west to east across mainly northern and
central parts of the country. Ahead of this system, a surface high
will lead cooler and dry weather across the East for the early
part of the week. Meanwhile across the western U.S., a large scale
trough over the northeast Pacific could increase the potential for
rounds of unsettled weather in the West Coast, likely around
midweek onward.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance for the 00/06Z cycle is in good agreement with the
overall pattern through about Wednesday-Thursday. A few model
cycles in a row now have shown good consensus with the track and
timing of the main upper-level feature influencing the forecast:
shortwave energy dropping into the West early in the week and
moving east through the Intermountain West, northern/central parts
of the Plains, and into the Midwest by Thursday, while pushing
upper ridging eastward and flattening it. A minor change with this
model cycle was to show that the upper low may become closed a bit
earlier, around Monday. Thus for the early part of the period, a
blend of the deterministic 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, UKMET, and CMC
was used. Then by Wednesday into Thursday, model differences and
thus uncertainty start to increase with the pattern across the
eastern half of Canada, with orientation of energy in broad
cyclonic flow and the possibility of a northern stream closed low
forming. This influences the track of the low and how/when it
joins back up with the northern stream by Thursday into Friday.
Given no clear trend or particularly preferred solution at this
point, today's model blend transitioned quickly to a GEFS and EC
ensemble mean-heavy approach during the latter part of the period
to minimize individual model differences.

While mean troughing in the eastern Pacific is likely, rounds of
energy moving through it and periods of the low potentially
closing off vary somewhat among guidance, especially by Friday.
The trend for this cycle has been for a slightly slower approach
of the trough eastward toward the West Coast Friday, which would
imply a slower front and less precipitation expected to reach the
Pacific Northwest and California. The model blend approach
described above also worked for this aspect of the forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Precipitation associated with the closed upper low and cold front
is forecast to track east through the period. Snow accumulating to
several inches is possible over higher elevations of the northern
Rockies (mainly Idaho, Montana, and southwest Montana) Monday into
Tuesday, with some chance of light snow for the northern/central
High Plains. Lower elevation rain to perhaps an inch spreads
across the northern and central Plains around midweek, before
tracking into the Midwest and Great Lakes region and eventually
the Northeast later in the week. Some rain showers are also
possible farther south along the cold front from Texas into the
Ohio Valley and Appalachians. In the West, cold fronts approaching
the coast ahead of troughing in the Pacific could lead to
increased precipitation especially for coastal areas from northern
California toward the Olympic Peninsula, though there is
uncertainty with how much precipitation will reach the coast.
Additionally, a wetter pattern is likely to return to southern
Florida for the latter half of the week.

Cool temperatures are forecast behind the cold front in the West
on Monday and Tuesday, with highs 10-20F below normal in portions
of California and Nevada and 10-15F below normal into the
Intermountain West. Temperatures should moderate closer to normal
as the front weakens, though should spread some cooler conditions
to the northern/central High Plains. Meanwhile ahead of the front,
a modest warm-up is expected, with the most anomalous highs of
10F+ above average for the Midwest on Monday and Tuesday. At this
point, temperatures look to ease closer to normal for the latter
part of the week over most of the country, with perhaps some
greater warm anomalies over portions of Montana and Idaho.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri October 15 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 21 - 25 2021

Today's model solutions are in fairly good agreement on a predicted high
amplitude 500-hPa circulation pattern across North America and surrounding
regions during the 6-10 day period. A trough with below normal 500-hPa heig=
hts
is forecast over most of Alaska, extending southward into the northeastern
Pacific and off the west coast of the CONUS. Downstream, strong mean ridgin=
g
and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over much of the interi=
or
western CONUS and the Great Plains, though models disagree somewhat on the
strength of this ridge. The GEFS predicts the weakest ridge while the ECMWF
Ensemble Mean predicts the strongest ridge. In the eastern U.S., today's
models
predict troughing developing, but are in disagreement on the strength of th=
e
trough. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa blend is a combina=
tion of the GEFS and ECMWF
Ensemble Mean, depicting positive height anomalies over parts of northeaste=
rn
Mainland Alaska, south into the west-central CONUS, and negative height
anomalies over most of the remainder of Alaska, and the western and eastern
CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are favored over most of central and southern
California under predicted mean troughing and forecast anomalous cloud-cove=
r
and precipitation. Above normal temperatures are favored elsewhere in the
western half of the CONUS, associated with ridging and positive height
anomalies. A weak trough forecast to develop in the Eastern U.S. increases
odds
of near normal temperatures over much of the East, except along the coast
where
warm southerly flow ahead of the predicted trough enhances chances of above
normal temperatures early in the 6-10 day period. Probabilities of above
normal
temperatures are enhanced over much of Alaska as predicting ridging builds
over
eastern portions of the state. Persistent negative height anomalies favor
below
normal temperatures for the Aleutians.

Predicted troughing over the northeastern Pacific increases the chances of
above normal precipitation across the West Coast of the CONUS. Ridging and
near
to above normal 500-hPa heights increase chances of near to below normal
precipitation for much of the north central CONUS and the Mississippi Valle=
y
region. Near normal precipitation is favored for most of the East Coast und=
er
the influence of predicted surface high pressure and some uncertainty among=
st
the precipitation tools. A trough is forecast to persist near the Florida
Peninsula for most of the period, favoring above normal precipitation there=
.
Forecast frontal activity over parts of the Southern Plains, a
climatologically
dry region, favors above normal precipitation there.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 70% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
fairly
good agreement among today's model solutions over most of the domain, offse=
t
by
some disagreement over the eastern U.S.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 23 - 29 2021

During week-2, the 500-hPa flow pattern is still relatively amplified, thou=
gh
anomalies are lower due to increased uncertainty. Negative height anomalies
are
forecast to spread further into the western CONUS, relative to the 6-10 day
period, as the predicted North Pacific develops a strongly negative tilt fo=
r
part of the period. The ridge is forecast to move eastward, resulting in ne=
ar
to above normal heights developing over the eastern U.S.

A mean ridge predicted to sweep across most of the country during the week =
2
period favors above normal temperatures for almost the entire CONUS. The
exception is the West Coast, where forecast persistent troughing and
precipitation leads to increased chances of near to below normal temperatur=
es.
The forecast over Alaska features a reduction of above normal temperature
probabilities relative to  the 6-10 day period across much of the state.

Anomalous troughing predicted to persist over the North Pacific strongly
favors
above normal precipitation for the western third of the CONUS. Predicted we=
ak
trough activity favors above normal precipitation for parts of the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley. Predicted ridging developing over the
eastern half of the country leads to increased chances of near to below nor=
mal
precipitation for the Great Lakes region and most areas east of the
Mississippi
Valley. The forecast over Alaska is very similar to the 6-10 day period.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 99% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 1% of Today's operational 0z GFS
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
fairly
good agreement among the models on the much of the large-scale circulation
pattern, offset by some differences in the large-scale pattern over parts o=
f
the eastern U.S.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...Severe weather and Excessive Rainfall on tap from the Mid-South
to the Great Lakes today; severe storms possible in the Northeast
on Saturday...

...Fresh injection of cooler than normal temperatures overtaking
the Rockies and Heartland arrives in the Tennessee and Ohio
Valleys on Saturday; abnormally warm along the East Coast...

...Elevated fire weather conditions in Southern California; wet
pattern returns to the Pacific Northwest

The primary weather maker to close out the week is an elongated
frontal boundary stretching from Southeast Canada to the Southwest
with embedded waves of low pressure along the front. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms are beginning to spring up along the
front, with increasing storm coverage expected through today. The
Storm Prediction Center continues to monitor severe potential with
these developing thunderstorms, particularly within the Slight
Risk (level 2/4) area from northern Arkansas and through the Ohio
Valley into the eastern Great Lakes today. Isolated severe wind
gusts, hail, and isolated tornadoes are possible, and a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch remains in effect until tonight across parts of
the Mid-South. There is also a Marginal Risk for Excessive
Rainfall (level 1/4) over much of the same area, where isolated
flash flooding is possible given the moist pre-frontal airmass in
place. As an upper trough tracking through the Midwest amplifies
Friday night, one particular area of low pressure will rapidly
deepen as it tracks from the eastern Great Lakes Friday evening
into southeast Canada on Saturday. The storm system's cold front
will swing through the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic and focus
showers and thunderstorms on approach. Some storms could be severe
in the Northeast, which has led SPC to issue a Marginal Risk for
parts of the region. The front races into the northwest Atlantic
Saturday night and a dome of high pressure builds in behind it,
leading to the arrival of a drier and seasonally cooler
temperatures on Sunday.

Farther west, a chilly and dry air-mass lies in wake of this
elongated cold front tracking through the eastern half of the
Lower 48. Today, much below normal temperatures are engulfing the
Intermountain West and the Heartland. Chilly, sub-freezing
overnight temperatures are possible over portions of the Plains
states which may impact sensitive vegetation and crops in this
region. Accordingly, Freeze Warnings, Freeze Watches, and Frost
Advisories extend from the Dakota/Minnesota International Border
all the way to the Southern Plains. Fortunately, a warm up arrives
after tonight over much of the Central U.S. as warm downslope flow
beginning on Saturday moderates the cool airmass in place to yield
slightly above average temperatures. In contrast to the cool
weather in the Plains, the airmass east of the front remains
unseasonably warm; numerous daily record warm minimum temperatures
are likely to be challenged tomorrow morning over the Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast. The passage of the front on Sunday will put an end
to any record warmth chances in the East.

Elsewhere, a strengthening upper level ridge allows for drier and
milder temperatures to set up shop over the western third of the
CONUS. Santa Ana winds in Southern California combined with low
relative humidity levels have led to the issuance of Red Flag
warnings and an Elevated Risk for fire weather conditions. Ridging
over the Intermountain West will keep Santa Ana winds in the
forecast into Saturday, prolonging the favorable fire weather
conditions in place there. Farther north, the coastal areas of the
Pacific Northwest begin to feel the affects of a deepening upper
trough in the Northeast Pacific as it siphons a ribbon of
subtropical moisture into western Washington. The Olympics and
northern Cascades are likely to contend with periods of rain just
before an approaching frontal system brings additional rainfall to
western Washington and Oregon on Sunday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
459 PM EDT Fri Oct 15 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Oct 18 2021 - 12Z Fri Oct 22 2021

...Overview...

The main weather feature across the U.S. next week will be an
upper low pushing a surface frontal system ahead of it and
spreading precipitation west to east across mainly northern and
central parts of the country. Ahead of this system, a surface high
will lead cooler and dry weather across the East for the early
part of the week. Meanwhile across the western U.S., a large scale
trough over the northeast Pacific could increase the potential for
rounds of unsettled weather in the West Coast, likely around
midweek onward.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance for the 00/06Z cycle is in good agreement with the
overall pattern through about Wednesday-Thursday. A few model
cycles in a row now have shown good consensus with the track and
timing of the main upper-level feature influencing the forecast:
shortwave energy dropping into the West early in the week and
moving east through the Intermountain West, northern/central parts
of the Plains, and into the Midwest by Thursday, while pushing
upper ridging eastward and flattening it. A minor change with this
model cycle was to show that the upper low may become closed a bit
earlier, around Monday. Thus for the early part of the period, a
blend of the deterministic 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, UKMET, and CMC
was used. Then by Wednesday into Thursday, model differences and
thus uncertainty start to increase with the pattern across the
eastern half of Canada, with orientation of energy in broad
cyclonic flow and the possibility of a northern stream closed low
forming. This influences the track of the low and how/when it
joins back up with the northern stream by Thursday into Friday.
Given no clear trend or particularly preferred solution at this
point, today's model blend transitioned quickly to a GEFS and EC
ensemble mean-heavy approach during the latter part of the period
to minimize individual model differences.

While mean troughing in the eastern Pacific is likely, rounds of
energy moving through it and periods of the low potentially
closing off vary somewhat among guidance, especially by Friday.
The trend for this cycle has been for a slightly slower approach
of the trough eastward toward the West Coast Friday, which would
imply a slower front and less precipitation expected to reach the
Pacific Northwest and California. The model blend approach
described above also worked for this aspect of the forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Precipitation associated with the closed upper low and cold front
is forecast to track east through the period. Snow accumulating to
several inches is possible over higher elevations of the northern
Rockies (mainly Idaho, Montana, and southwest Montana) Monday into
Tuesday, with some chance of light snow for the northern/central
High Plains. Lower elevation rain to perhaps an inch spreads
across the northern and central Plains around midweek, before
tracking into the Midwest and Great Lakes region and eventually
the Northeast later in the week. Some rain showers are also
possible farther south along the cold front from Texas into the
Ohio Valley and Appalachians. In the West, cold fronts approaching
the coast ahead of troughing in the Pacific could lead to
increased precipitation especially for coastal areas from northern
California toward the Olympic Peninsula, though there is
uncertainty with how much precipitation will reach the coast.
Additionally, a wetter pattern is likely to return to southern
Florida for the latter half of the week.

Cool temperatures are forecast behind the cold front in the West
on Monday and Tuesday, with highs 10-20F below normal in portions
of California and Nevada and 10-15F below normal into the
Intermountain West. Temperatures should moderate closer to normal
as the front weakens, though should spread some cooler conditions
to the northern/central High Plains. Meanwhile ahead of the front,
a modest warm-up is expected, with the most anomalous highs of
10F+ above average for the Midwest on Monday and Tuesday. At this
point, temperatures look to ease closer to normal for the latter
part of the week over most of the country, with perhaps some
greater warm anomalies over portions of Montana and Idaho.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1245 AM CDT Sat Oct 16 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will continue to move eastward through the West
and into the Plains today. By the end of the period, cyclonic flow
aloft will return to the West Coast. At the surface, a broad
anticyclone will be situated within the Great Basin into the
southern Plains. The strength of the surface high will peak early in
the period.

...Southern California...
Elevated to briefly critical fire weather conditions are again
expected across much of the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges. A
similar offshore gradient, though most likely weaker, to Friday
morning can be expected this morning. The pressure gradient will
relax by the afternoon. Current surface observations in the region
continue to show widespread RH below 20% and most locations will not
significantly recover by morning. Winds of 15-20 mph will be most
prevalent with the typical wind-prone locations seeing higher
speeds. Those terrain-favored areas are also where critical
conditions may occur briefly during the early to mid morning.

...North-Central Montana...
Locally elevated conditions may occur in the lee of the Lewis Range
as a weak surface trough develops along with modest flow enhancement
aloft. Confidence in winds reaching 15-20 mph is relatively high,
but RH may remain above critical thresholds. A small area of
remaining dry fuels exists and could support fire growth should RH
fall to 20-25%.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1246 AM CDT Sat Oct 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge will shift into the central U.S. on Sunday. An
upper-level trough will move into the Pacific Northwest and northern
California by the end of the period. At the surface, flow across the
southern Plains will return to southerly along the western flank of
surface high. A cyclone will develop within the lee of the Canadian
Rockies and increase winds ahead of it and its attendant cold front
extending into the western Great Basin.

Dry and windy conditions are probable within western/central Nevada
and perhaps into southeastern Oregon. Fuels are not currently
critically dry across those areas. Some potential for locally
elevated conditions will again exist in north-central Montana. RH is
expected to be lower than on Saturday, but the surface pressure
gradient will also be weaker. Finally, dry southerly winds from a
continental airmass may support a marginal increase in fire danger
in parts of the southern High Plains. With confidence in winds above
15 mph remaining low as well as much of the area receiving recent
rainfall, highlights will be withheld here also.

218 AM EDT Sat Oct 16 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Oct 19 2021 - 12Z Sat Oct 23 2021

...Overview...

A typical late October weather pattern is expected to be in place
across the majority of the nation for next week.  The main weather
system of interest will be a closed upper low initially over the
Rockies that will eject eastward over the northern Plains and
Upper Midwest by the middle of the week, and this will sustain a
cold front that should reach the East Coast by the end of the
week.  A rather active pattern will be in place across the eastern
Pacific with a persistent upper level trough off the West Coast
that will support several shortwaves rotating around it along with
a couple of cold frontal passages and rounds of precipitation,
with an upper level ridge over the Intermountain West that will
tend to limit the eastward progression of these weather systems.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance for the 00Z cycle is in good agreement with the
overall synoptic scale pattern through Wednesday, and the
operational guidance has locked into the slower solution for the
closed low tracking from the Rockies to the Plains.  However,
northern stream flow over central Canada is more complicated and
questions remain as to whether the central U.S. low may try to
phase with northern stream energy, or remain separate.  Model
differences are rather significant across the Hudson Bay region
with the 12Z ECMWF appearing to be an outlier by drifting a strong
closed low westward across Manitoba, and the GFS is much more
progressive.  This leads to lower forecast confidence downstream
across the Northeast U.S. by later in the forecast period.  Out
West, the models remain in decent agreement on the overall large
scale trough, with the typical differences in shortwave timing and
magnitude.  The 00Z CMC is indicating less in terms of amplitude
by late Friday compared to the ECMWF/GFS.  The WPC fronts and
pressures were primarily derived from a CMC/GFS/ECMWF blend along
with some previous WPC continuity, and increasing contributions
from the ensemble means by Friday and Saturday owing to increasing
model spread.  Less of the 12Z ECMWF was used near the Canadian
border over the northern Plains given the differences noted
earlier.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The developing storm system over the Plains and Midwest will fuel
the development of scattered showers and storms from Texas to the
Ohio Valley for the middle of the week, and a chilly rain north of
the surface low across the Dakotas and Minnesota.  It will be cold
enough for accumulating snow for the higher terrain of Wyoming and
the Black Hills of South Dakota on Tuesday as the upper low and
moisture slowly depart the region.  Across the West Coast region,
multiple rounds of showers are expected from northern California
to western Washington, and some of these will likely be moderate
to heavy at times with moisture rich onshore slow ahead of
multiple Pacific storm systems.  Some locations may get on the
order of 2 to 4 inches of rain over the entire forecast period,
particularly across windward terrain.

In the temperature department, it will likely feel more like
early-mid November across much of the Intermountain West and the
central/northern Rockies in the wake of the departing storm system
on Tuesday, with high temperatures running about 5 to 15 degrees
below average.  There should be a gradual moderation in
temperatures going through the middle to end of the week as an
upper level ridge begins to build in, and then readings up to 10
degrees above average for some of these same areas by next
Saturday.  Ahead of the cold front, it will likely feel more like
late September across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley with highs
on the order of 5-15 degrees above average for the middle of the
week, although not to the levels observed over this past week and
not as humid.

Valid 12Z Sat Oct 16 2021 - 12Z Mon Oct 18 2021

...Severe weather and locally heavy rainfall in the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic today...

...Seasonally cooler temperatures to overtake the East late
Saturday into Sunday; chilly in the Heartland this morning but
warming up by Sunday...

...Elevated fire weather conditions in Southern California; wet
pattern returns to the Pacific Northwest...

An active day is on tap for both the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic as
a cold front associated with a wave of low pressure races towards
the East Coast. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will track
through these regions with some thunderstorms potentially becoming
severe. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk area
for severe weather from eastern Pennsylvania to Upstate New York.
A soaking rain is also anticipated for much of New York and
northern New England today. Drier conditions work their way
towards the East Coast as high pressure builds in for the second
half of the weekend, although lake effect showers keep some wet
conditions around across the eastern Great Lakes and interior
Northeast Sunday. The cold front extends as far south as The
Sunshine State where refreshing humidity levels return to northern
Florida on Sunday and eventually reaching South Florida on Monday.

Temperature-wise, a cooler and more autumn-like air-mass starts
out the weekend in the Heartland where a large portion of the
Plains and Midwest are under either Freeze Warnings or Front
Advisories this morning. After one more abnormally warm day along
the East Coast, the aforementioned cold front ushers in this
cooler temperature regime late Saturday and into Sunday. The
Northern Plains and Midwest warm back up quickly by Sunday as a
warm front lifts north of these regions. Farther west, after a
seasonally mild day along the West Coast today, an approaching
upper trough will inject cool Pacific air into the western third
of the Lower 48 by Sunday and persist into the start of the
upcoming week.

The West Coast will also see a few weather hazards of note. Santa
Ana winds look to stick around for one more day in Southern
California prompting the issuance of Red Flag Warnings and an
Elevated Risk for favorable fire weather conditions from the Storm
Prediction Center. Farther up the coast, an upper trough will
direct Pacific moisture at the Pacific Northwest. Far western
Washington can expect periods of rain today but as a frontal
system advances south down the coast, western Oregon and northern
California will get in on the action by Sunday. The higher
elevations of southwest Oregon, northern California, and the
northern Nevada may also witness periods of snow late Sunday into
Monday morning.

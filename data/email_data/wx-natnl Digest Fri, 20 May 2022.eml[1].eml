...Record breaking heat is expected to intensify and expand up the
East Coast over the next couple of days as heat becomes less
intense over the southern Plains...

...Drastically colder air will surge across the western U.S.,
culminating in a late-season wintry weather event over the central
Rockies/High Plains late tonight into Saturday...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorm threats will focus near a
stalled front from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes today
and Saturday...

...Critical fire danger continues from the Southwest into the
central/southern High Plains before the arrival of cold air this
weekend...

An increasingly active weather pattern is expected to transpire as
a significant surge of cold air moving through the western U.S.
will collide with a large dome of heat that is forecast to shift
from the South to the East Coast. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms are expected to move across the Great Lakes and
Northeast today. Isolated severe thunderstorms may form over parts
of the Southern Plains and Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley this
evening due to diurnal heating and instability along a cold front
pushing through the region.

The surge of cold air associated with a digging upper trough will
overspread much of the western U.S. with unseasonably cold
temperatures together with a round of heavy mountain snows, first
from the northern Rockies and then down to the Colorado Rockies
today. 6-10 inches of snow with locally higher amounts are
possible for the aforementioned areas by Saturday morning. Strong
and gusty winds are also expected in these areas into the High
Plains as the low pressure system intensifies. The surge of cold
air will bring a dramatic drop of temperatures from the 90s down
to freezing across the central High Plains where a late-season
winter weather event is forecast to develop.  Potential exists for
more than a foot of snow across the higher elevations of the
Colorado Rockies while accumulating snowfall can be expected down
into the central High Plains.

Meanwhile, a heat wave is forecast to intensify and expand up the
East Coast this weekend under a strengthening upper-level ridge.
Increasingly warm southwesterly wind flow around the Bermuda high
will send afternoon temperatures to record levels. Much of the
Mid-Atlantic, Carolinas and Ohio/Tennessee Valley will experience
highs well into the 90s today, and reaching into interior New
England by Saturday. High temperatures are forecast to be between
20-30 degrees above average for much of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast on Saturday. Across the southern Plains, the heat is
expected to become less intense as the cold air approaches from
the north.  However, highs are still into the 90s across much of
the South on Saturday. Farther west, a Critical Fire risk remains
in effect for much of New Mexico, Colorado, southern Utah and
northern Arizona today as windy/dry conditions fuel the fire
threat. Red Flag warnings are in effect for these areas before the
surge of cold air arrives over the northern portions of these
areas this weekend.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA TO WESTERN
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
Critical fire weather conditions remain likely this afternoon across
a large swath of the Southwest. A broad upper-level trough is noted
in early-morning water vapor imagery over the northwestern CONUS. An
elongated cold front, currently pushing southward through the
inter-mountain West and the central Plains, will help deepen the
trough over the next 12-24 hours. This will have the effect of
increasing mid-level winds over the Southwest as well as bolstering
surface pressure falls along/ahead of the cold front across the
southern High Plains by late afternoon. Consequently, strengthening
pressure-gradient winds from the lower CO River valley into the
southern High Plains will promote widespread fire weather concerns.

...Southwest to the Southern High Plains...
Latest fuel guidance and drought indices continues to show
widespread dry conditions with receptive fuels across much of the
Southwest and southern High Plains. Early-morning surface
observations across AZ, NM, and western TX show poor overnight RH
recovery with single-digit to low teen RH values noted. While modest
RH recovery is probable across parts of southwest AZ (via weak
moisture advection from Baja California), most locations will see
5-15% RH values by early afternoon. Widespread sustained winds
between 15-25 mph are possible as early as 18 UTC, and will likely
peak during the late afternoon hours. Wind gusts between 30-40 mph
are probable across the Critical risk area, and may support periods
of extremely critical conditions across the southern High Plains
where 30-35 mph gusts may coincide with 5-10% RH. While forecast
confidence remains high for most of the region, the southward
progression of the cold front through the afternoon remains somewhat
uncertain and may limit the northeastern extent of fire weather
concerns across northeast NM and west TX.

...Southern Nevada...
A cold front is noted in early-morning surface observations pushing
southward across NV. Despite cooler post-frontal air, mostly clear
skies this afternoon will support sufficient diurnal warming/drying
for RH values to fall into the low teens. Gusty 15-20 mph winds
behind the front will support elevated fire weather concerns this
afternoon.

...Sacramento Valley...
Northerly post-frontal winds are already being observed through the
Sacramento Valley. This downslope flow regime will persist through
the day and support RH reductions down to near 15% by late
afternoon. Fuels through most of the valley have begun to cure
(especially through the foothills per latest ERC analyses), which
will support the fire weather threat this afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0148 AM CDT Fri May 20 2022

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure will become established over the
central/southern Plains through the day Saturday in the wake of the
surface cold front. Aloft, the departure of an embedded shortwave
disturbance will ease mid and upper-level wind speeds over the
southwestern CONUS. These factors will yield diminished fire weather
concerns compared to previous days for the Southwest and southern
High Plains where fuels are critically dry. Despite this, regional
fire weather concerns are expected for parts of central to southern
NM where pressure-gradient winds and dry conditions will maintain
fire weather concerns.

...Central to southern NM...
Modest moisture advection from Baja CA into AZ and cooler
post-frontal conditions across eastern NM will result in a pocket of
dry conditions across central/southern NM. RH values within this
region are forecast to fall into the 10-15% range by late afternoon
amid mostly clear skies. Despite the surface high over the southern
Plains, continued zonal flow over the central Rockies will support
modest lee troughing in the immediate lee of the terrain - mainly
over north-central NM based on hi-res and ensemble guidance. The
resulting pressure gradient over central to southern NM should
support sustained winds near 15 mph and at least elevated fire
weather conditions. Localized critical conditions are possible, but
mainly across the lower desert terrain where fuel loading is poor.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
251 AM EDT Fri May 20 2022

Valid 12Z Mon May 23 2022 - 12Z Fri May 27 2022

...Heavy rain and strong storms from Texas to the Ohio Valley and
Great Lakes early-mid next week...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A cold front is forecast to exit the East Coast by early Monday
after a hot weekend for much of the eastern U.S., with a cooler
and more comfortable airmass settling in behind it for early in
the week.  Meanwhile, a rather active weather pattern is expected
to develop across the continental U.S. going into next week, as
multiple waves of low pressure develop along a frontal boundary
situated over the Plains and extending to the Great Lakes.  This
will be in response to a building upper level trough over the
western High Plains that will slowly move eastward through the
week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in decent synoptic scale agreement
for the beginning of next week, with differences becoming more
apparent by Wednesday as the trough amplifies over the Plains.
The past few runs of the GFS have been slower and stronger with
the trough over the south-central U.S. and developing a closed
upper low, whereas the CMC/ECMWF and many of the ensemble members
were more progressive and had the trough axis reaching the East
Coast by the end of the week.  It is interesting to note that the
00Z CMC trended more towards the GFS for this trough, with overall
forecast confidence for the Thursday-Friday time period limited
and thus subject to potential noteworthy changes in future
forecasts.  There is also a good model signal for an amplifying
trough in the general vicinity of the Pacific Northwest by next
Friday.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily derived from a
multi-deterministic model consensus through Tuesday, and then
incorporated more of the 12Z CMC/ECMWF and increased use of the
ensemble means for the Wednesday-Friday time period.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Temperatures behind the cold front exiting the East Coast next
week should return to near seasonal levels after a potentially
record setting early season heatwave. Low pressure forming along
the trailing front as it meanders near the Southeast Coast may
continue a moderate to heavy rainfall threat into Monday as well
for parts of the Carolinas and the southern Appalachians.

The next system developing over the south-central U.S. into
early-mid next week is expected to become the main weather
headline of this forecast period.  There will likely be widespread
convection and heavy rainfall from Texas to the Ohio Valley with
moist return flow into another slow moving and wavy frontal
system. There is the potential for some flash flooding with the
slower moving storms within a very moist and unstable atmosphere.
The latest WPC experimental Excessive Rainfall Outlook indicates a
Slight Risk area for Monday into Tuesday morning across portions
of central Texas, and this could be expanded in later forecasts,
and the potential exists for additional heavy rain going into
Tuesday and Wednesday across the Mississippi River Valley, albeit
with greater uncertainty in placement of MCS activity.  Some
severe storms are certainly within the realm of possibility for
these same general areas.

The western-central U.S. trough should keep temperatures below
normal across Rockies and Plains through at least Tuesday.  Much
of the Western U.S. should remain mainly dry through the middle of
next week as upper ridging builds over the region and warmer
temperatures expand across the region, with the exception of some
showers entering the Pacific Northwest by Friday.  This may lead
to an excessive heat episode over interior California and the
Desert Southwest for the end of the week.

...Heavy rain and strong storms from Texas to the Ohio Valley and
Great Lakes early-mid next week...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A cold front is forecast to exit the East Coast by early Monday
after a hot weekend for much of the eastern U.S., with a cooler
and more comfortable airmass settling in behind it for early in
the week.  Meanwhile, a rather active weather pattern is expected
to develop across the continental U.S. going into next week, as
multiple waves of low pressure develop along a frontal boundary
situated over the Plains and extending to the Great Lakes.  This
will be in response to a building upper level trough over the
western High Plains that will slowly move eastward through the
week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in decent synoptic scale agreement
for the beginning of next week, with differences becoming more
apparent by Wednesday as the trough amplifies over the Plains.
The past few runs of the GFS have been slower and stronger with
the trough over the south-central U.S. and developing a closed
upper low, whereas the CMC/ECMWF and many of the ensemble members
were more progressive and had the trough axis reaching the East
Coast by the end of the week.  It is interesting to note that the
00Z CMC trended more towards the GFS for this trough, with overall
forecast confidence for the Thursday-Friday time period limited
and thus subject to potential noteworthy changes in future
forecasts.  There is also a good model signal for an amplifying
trough in the general vicinity of the Pacific Northwest by next
Friday.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily derived from a
multi-deterministic model consensus through Tuesday, and then
incorporated more of the 12Z CMC/ECMWF and increased use of the
ensemble means for the Wednesday-Friday time period.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Temperatures behind the cold front exiting the East Coast next
week should return to near seasonal levels after a potentially
record setting early season heatwave. Low pressure forming along
the trailing front as it meanders near the Southeast Coast may
continue a moderate to heavy rainfall threat into Monday as well
for parts of the Carolinas and the southern Appalachians.

The next system developing over the south-central U.S. into
early-mid next week is expected to become the main weather
headline of this forecast period.  There will likely be widespread
convection and heavy rainfall from Texas to the Ohio Valley with
moist return flow into another slow moving and wavy frontal
system. There is the potential for some flash flooding with the
slower moving storms within a very moist and unstable atmosphere.
The latest WPC experimental Excessive Rainfall Outlook indicates a
Slight Risk area for Monday into Tuesday morning across portions
of central Texas, and this could be expanded in later forecasts,
and the potential exists for additional heavy rain going into
Tuesday and Wednesday across the Mississippi River Valley, albeit
with greater uncertainty in placement of MCS activity.  Some
severe storms are certainly within the realm of possibility for
these same general areas.

The western-central U.S. trough should keep temperatures below
normal across Rockies and Plains through at least Tuesday.  Much
of the Western U.S. should remain mainly dry through the middle of
next week as upper ridging builds over the region and warmer
temperatures expand across the region, with the exception of some
showers entering the Pacific Northwest by Friday.  This may lead
to an excessive heat episode over interior California and the
Desert Southwest for the end of the week.

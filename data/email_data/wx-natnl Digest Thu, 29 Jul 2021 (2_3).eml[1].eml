...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern over the
West...
...Heavy Convection/Rainfall Threat for The South and The
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A closed upper high slid over the south-central U.S. will
gradually weaken this weekend as ridging builds over the Rockies,
Intermountain West and western Canada into next week. Ridge
amplitude will support periodic reinforcement of an unseasonably
deep and persistent eastern Canada/U.S. upper trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting around the ridge and on the eastern
periphery of eastern Pacific upper troughing will present
widespread monsoonal rainfall with local runoff issues. Best
chances are from the Southwest/CA to the central Great
Basin/Rockies where there will also be increasing coverage of
daytime highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand, record warm
minimum temperature records will be possible west of the Rockies
over a warmed Northwest and elsewhere with monsoonal clouds and
moisture.

Meanwhile, uncertain shortwaves rounding the upper ridge will dig
downstream into an eastern U.S. mean upper trough. Favorable
support aloft may help to produce strong convection and locally
heavy downpours/runoff issues as moisture/instability pool near
wavy fronts slowing on the southern trough periphery, especially
with training/repeat cells. Enhanced waves will lift on the
eastern periphery of the upper trough over the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic to favor additional heavy rainfall. The
pattern favors modestly below normal post-frontal temperatures
farther northward over the central and eastern U.S. while The
South/Southeast will in contrast be quite steamy with widespread
record warm low temperatures possible along/south of the main
front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability into
early next week before introduction of closer to normal forecast
spread and uncertainty. The WPC medium range product suite was
derived from a blend of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian Days 3/4 (Sunday/Monday) along with the 01
UTC National Blend of Models. Transitioned WPC blend weights
Tuesday-next Thursday from the models to the ensemble means.
Placed highest weighting for this latter period on the 12 UTC
ECMWF and ECMWF ensemble mean that maintain pattern amplitude on
the higher end of the full envelope of solutions. This seems
reasonable considering the generally blocky nature of the flow and
WPC product continuity. The 00 UTC GFS/UKMET/Canadian have now
trended in this direction.

OBSERVATIONS OF TSUNAMI ACTIVITY
--------------------------------
 * No tsunami observations are available to report.


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
-------------------
Actions to protect human life and property will
vary within tsunami warning areas and within tsunami
advisory areas.

If you are in a tsunami warning area;

 * Evacuate inland or to higher ground above and beyond
   designated tsunami hazard zones or move to an upper floor
   of a multi-story building depending on your situation.

If you are in a tsunami warning or advisory area;

 * Move out of the water, off the beach, and away from
   harbors, marinas, breakwaters, bays and inlets.

 * Be alert to and follow instructions from your local
   emergency officials because they may have more detailed or
   specific information for your location.

 * If you feel a strong earthquake or extended ground rolling
   take immediate protective actions such as moving inland
   and/or uphill preferably by foot.

 * Boat operators,
     * Where time and conditions permit, move your boat out to
       sea to a depth of at least 180 feet.

     * If at sea avoid entering shallow water, harbors,
       marinas, bays, and inlets to avoid floating and
       submerged debris and strong currents.

 * Do not go to the shore to observe the tsunami.

 * Do not return to the coast until local emergency officials
   indicate it is safe to do so.


IMPACTS
-------
Impacts will vary at different locations in the warning and
in the advisory areas.

If you are in a tsunami warning area;

 * A tsunami with damaging waves and powerful currents is
   possible.

 * Repeated coastal flooding is possible as waves arrive
   onshore, move inland, and drain back into the ocean.

 * Strong and unusual waves, currents and inland flooding
   can drown or injure people and weaken or destroy structures
   on land and in water.

 * Water filled with floating or submerged debris that can
   injure or kill people and weaken or destroy buildings and
   bridges is possible.

 * Strong and unusual currents and waves in harbors,
   marinas, bays, and inlets may be especially
   destructive.

If you are in a tsunami advisory area;

 * A tsunami with strong waves and currents is possible.

 * Waves and currents can drown or injure people who are
   in the water.

 * Currents at beaches and in harbors, marinas,
   bays, and inlets may be especially dangerous.

If you are in a tsunami warning or advisory area;

 * Some impacts may continue for many hours to days after
   arrival of the first wave.

 * The first wave may not be the largest so later waves may
   be larger.

 * Each wave may last 5 to 45 minutes as a wave encroaches
   and recedes.

 * Coasts facing all directions are threatened because the
   waves can wrap around islands and headlands and into bays.

 * Strong shaking or rolling of the ground indicates an
   earthquake has occurred and a tsunami may be imminent.

 * A rapidly receding or receded shoreline, unusual waves and
   sounds, and strong currents are signs of a tsunami.

 * The tsunami may appear as water moving rapidly out to sea,
   a gentle rising tide like flood with no breaking wave,
   as a series of breaking waves, or a frothy wall of water.

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
-------------------
Actions to protect human life and property will
vary within tsunami warning areas and within tsunami
advisory areas.

If you are in a tsunami warning area;

 * Evacuate inland or to higher ground above and beyond
   designated tsunami hazard zones or move to an upper floor
   of a multi-story building depending on your situation.

If you are in a tsunami warning or advisory area;

 * Move out of the water, off the beach, and away from
   harbors, marinas, breakwaters, bays and inlets.

 * Be alert to and follow instructions from your local
   emergency officials because they may have more detailed or
   specific information for your location.

 * If you feel a strong earthquake or extended ground rolling
   take immediate protective actions such as moving inland
   and/or uphill preferably by foot.

 * Boat operators,
     * Where time and conditions permit, move your boat out to
       sea to a depth of at least 180 feet.

     * If at sea avoid entering shallow water, harbors,
       marinas, bays, and inlets to avoid floating and
       submerged debris and strong currents.

 * Do not go to the shore to observe the tsunami.

 * Do not return to the coast until local emergency officials
   indicate it is safe to do so.


IMPACTS
-------
Impacts will vary at different locations in the warning and
in the advisory areas.

If you are in a tsunami warning area;

 * A tsunami with damaging waves and powerful currents is
   possible.

 * Repeated coastal flooding is possible as waves arrive
   onshore, move inland, and drain back into the ocean.

 * Strong and unusual waves, currents and inland flooding
   can drown or injure people and weaken or destroy structures
   on land and in water.

 * Water filled with floating or submerged debris that can
   injure or kill people and weaken or destroy buildings and
   bridges is possible.

 * Strong and unusual currents and waves in harbors,
   marinas, bays, and inlets may be especially
   destructive.

If you are in a tsunami advisory area;

 * A tsunami with strong waves and currents is possible.

 * Waves and currents can drown or injure people who are
   in the water.

 * Currents at beaches and in harbors, marinas,
   bays, and inlets may be especially dangerous.

If you are in a tsunami warning or advisory area;

 * Some impacts may continue for many hours to days after
   arrival of the first wave.

 * The first wave may not be the largest so later waves may
   be larger.

 * Each wave may last 5 to 45 minutes as a wave encroaches
   and recedes.

 * Coasts facing all directions are threatened because the
   waves can wrap around islands and headlands and into bays.

 * Strong shaking or rolling of the ground indicates an
   earthquake has occurred and a tsunami may be imminent.

 * A rapidly receding or receded shoreline, unusual waves and
   sounds, and strong currents are signs of a tsunami.

 * The tsunami may appear as water moving rapidly out to sea,
   a gentle rising tide like flood with no breaking wave,
   as a series of breaking waves, or a frothy wall of water.

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Mid-Atlantic through Friday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southwest, Great Basin, and the Central Rockies through Friday
morning and again on Friday into Saturday morning...

...Heat Advisory over parts of the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley
and adjacent Plains as well as the Pacific Northwest; Excessive
Heat Warning over parts of the same areas...

A front extending from the Mid-Atlantic westward to the Northern
Rockies will settle southward to the Southeast northwestward to
the Central Plains and Central Rockies by Saturday. Moisture
pooling along the boundary and strong dynamics will aid in
producing showers and thunderstorms across the region.  Therefore,
the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Mid-Atlantic and a Slight Risk from the Mid-Atlantic
to the Middle Mississippi Valley through Friday morning.  The
hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes. The severe thunderstorm threat will reduce slightly on
Friday into Saturday over the southern Mid-Atlantic and the Middle
Mississippi Valley.  In addition, there is a threat of heavy rain
with these thunderstorms through Saturday, too. Additionally,
tropical moisture over the Gulf Coast into parts of the Southeast
will produce daily showers and thunderstorms through Saturday.

Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms will continue over the
Southwest, Central/Southern Rockies, and Great Basin through
Saturday.
The monsoonal moisture streams back into the Southwest as strong
upper-level energy and other impulses passes over the region on
Thursday into Saturday.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall over the Southwest and parts of the
Central Rockies on Thursday into Friday morning.  The associated
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable
through Friday morning.  On Friday into Saturday, the excessive
rainfall threat increases with a Slight Risk threat moving into
more of the Great Basin and Central Rockies.

Two areas across the lower forty-eight will have heat problems;
there is an Excessive Heat Warning over parts of Oregon and the
Middle Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys and adjacent regions, where
temperatures will be above average. Furthermore, Heat Advisories
are currently in effect for portions of the Pacific
Northwest/Northern California and over Middle/Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys and adjacent Plains.  Moreover,
several regions have Air Quality Alerts due to wildfires over the
Northwest into the Northern Rockies and Upper Midwest.

* Depth  20 miles
* Location  75 miles SE of Chignik, Alaska
  500 miles SW of Anchorage, Alaska


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
-------------------
Actions to protect human life and property will
vary within tsunami warning areas and within tsunami
advisory areas.

If you are in a tsunami warning area;

* Evacuate inland or to higher ground above and beyond
  designated tsunami hazard zones or move to an upper floor
  of a multi-story building depending on your situation.

If you are in a tsunami warning or advisory area;

* Move out of the water, off the beach, and away from
  harbors, marinas, breakwaters, bays and inlets.

* Be alert to and follow instructions from your local
  emergency officials because they may have more detailed or
  specific information for your location.

* If you feel a strong earthquake or extended ground rolling
  take immediate protective actions such as moving inland
  and/or uphill preferably by foot.

* Boat operators,
    * Where time and conditions permit, move your boat out to
      sea to a depth of at least 180 feet.

    * If at sea avoid entering shallow water, harbors,
      marinas, bays, and inlets to avoid floating and
      submerged debris and strong currents.

* Do not go to the shore to observe the tsunami.

* Do not return to the coast until local emergency officials
  indicate it is safe to do so.


IMPACTS
-------
Impacts will vary at different locations in the warning and
in the advisory areas.

If you are in a tsunami warning area;

* A tsunami with damaging waves and powerful currents is
  possible.

* Repeated coastal flooding is possible as waves arrive
  onshore, move inland, and drain back into the ocean.

* Strong and unusual waves, currents and inland flooding
  can drown or injure people and weaken or destroy structures
  on land and in water.

* Water filled with floating or submerged debris that can
  injure or kill people and weaken or destroy buildings and
  bridges is possible.

* Strong and unusual currents and waves in harbors,
  marinas, bays, and inlets may be especially
  destructive.

If you are in a tsunami advisory area;

* A tsunami with strong waves and currents is possible.

* Waves and currents can drown or injure people who are
  in the water.

* Currents at beaches and in harbors, marinas,
  bays, and inlets may be especially dangerous.

If you are in a tsunami warning or advisory area;

* Some impacts may continue for many hours to days after
  arrival of the first wave.

* The first wave may not be the largest so later waves may
  be larger.

* Each wave may last 5 to 45 minutes as a wave encroaches
  and recedes.

* Coasts facing all directions are threatened because the
  waves can wrap around islands and headlands and into bays.

* Strong shaking or rolling of the ground indicates an
  earthquake has occurred and a tsunami may be imminent.

* A rapidly receding or receded shoreline, unusual waves and
  sounds, and strong currents are signs of a tsunami.

* The tsunami may appear as water moving rapidly out to sea,
  a gentle rising tide like flood with no breaking wave,
  as a series of breaking waves, or a frothy wall of water.

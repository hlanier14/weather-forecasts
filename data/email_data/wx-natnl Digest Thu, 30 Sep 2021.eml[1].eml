Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1026 AM CDT Wed Sep 29 2021

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (below) remains on track. Surface observations
show a dry air mass in place over the Great Basin and California,
but the probability for elevated conditions remains low outside of
terrain due to weak winds. Elevated conditions may also develop in
the lee of terrain features across eastern New Mexico this
afternoon, but should remain too limited spatially to warrant
highlights.

..Moore.. 09/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CDT Wed Sep 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
Troughing over the Rocky Mountains and central CONUS should continue
today as a mid-level ridge builds across the West Coast. As the
mid-level trough shifts to the east, northerly flow is expected to
increase across California and western Nevada. At the surface, high
pressure should settle across the Great Basin in response to
increasing heights aloft. The combination of the increasing
northerly flow aloft and strengthening low-level pressure gradients
should bolster easterly downslope winds across the Sierra, and
offshore flow across southern California. The dry gusty winds, and
warm surface conditions may support locally elevated fire weather
conditions across portions of the Sacramento Valley and southern
California coastal ranges through the day and into the overnight
hours. Given the lack of stronger upper-level support and only
modest surface pressure gradients, widespread winds greater than 15
mph are not expected outside of the higher terrain. As such, fire
weather concerns will remain primarily local in nature despite the
widespread warm and drying conditions.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 29 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure with associated onshore flow is forecast t=
o
affect the western U.S. and Alaska during early October while a strong area=
 of
mid-level high pressure is forecast to drift eastward and weaken slightly o=
ver
the higher latitudes of eastern and central North America, resulting in a
continuation of the mild temperature pattern across the CONUS. After major
Hurricane Sam moves into the northern North Atlantic transitioning to an
extratropical cyclone, Tropical Depression 20 should strengthen off the wes=
t
coast of Africa, but then track into the central North Atlantic posing no
threat to the lower 48.

HAZARDS

No hazards posted.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY OCTOBER 02 - WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 06:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!s9iWkPVo_OkiAsH43R3ap6G6vD64H96zqETh_77U-EkxyHs8OX2bbeFrBTd3E=
1QX-8ss2HsG$

FOR THURSDAY OCTOBER 07 - WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 13: A transient 500-hPa ridge i=
s
expected to be moving east away from Alaska as the period begins. Over the
ensuing couple of days, a strong low-pressure center is expected to move
northward through the Bering Sea into the Chukchi Sea October 9-10. The 6Z =
GFS
and yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 0Z ECMWF forecast the surface pre=
ssure to drop to 960-965
hPa
as it moves northward west of Alaska. This will bring above-normal
precipitation and gusty winds to the Aleutians and most of western Alaska.
Models generally agree that precipitation totals will not be extreme, so no
heavy precipitation hazard is posted. Strong wind hazards are more plausibl=
e,
but many ensemble members aren=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDt in concert with =
such a deep surface low
pressure center, and both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools show low
probabilities that winds will exceed 40 mph for any length of time, resulti=
ng
in no wind hazards being posted at this time. Farther east, a couple of wea=
ker
storm systems should track south of Alaska, bringing heavy precipitation to
south-central Alaska, with near normal amounts farther east in the Panhandl=
e.
But given the  lack of good model agreement, and the wet climatology of the
region during this period, this also precludes heavy precipitation hazards
from
being posted.



Ensemble means depict a slowly progressive and de-amplifying 500-hPa patter=
n
progressing eastward through North America during week-2. The strong anomal=
ous
ridge dominating eastern North America is expected to drift eastward and
slowly
weaken while a sharp trough with negative 500-hPa height anomalies moves in=
to
the West Coast, then similarly drifts eastward and weakens. The initially
sharp
mid-level trough and onshore surface flow in the West will bring above-norm=
al
precipitation to the region. The 8-14 day model consolidated outlook shows
precipitation totals 30 to 60 percent above normal for the 7-day period, bu=
t
climatology here is dry in early October, and no extreme precipitation amou=
nts
are anticipated by any of the models. The system could bring heavy snow to
some
areas, but only in the higher elevations of the Rockies, Sierra Nevada, and
Cascades, where significant October snowfall is not unusual. Thus no heavy
snowfall hazard is posted. There is an elevated chance of unusually high wi=
nds
from the western U.S. to the Plains between the anticipated 500-hPa troughi=
ng
and the strong ridge farther east, but large uncertainty on the timing and
track of individual features preclude designation of any wind hazards at th=
is
time.



Some models show an interaction between a mid-level trough in the southern
CONUS and a possible tropical low pressure system off the East Coast that
could
bring heavy precipitation into part of the middle Atlantic or Southeastern
states during the week-2 period. However, models present a broad range of
possible solutions to this potentially-complex interaction, keeping the
heaviest precipitation amounts offshore . No hazards are posted at this tim=
e,
but the area will continue to be scrutinized in the days to come.



Major Hurricane Sam is forecast to track north into the central and norther=
n
Atlantic during the next 3 to 5 days, remaining out to sea away from the No=
rth
American East Coast and Bermuda. Meanwhile, Tropical Depression 20 has form=
ed
a
few hundred miles west of Africa, but models are in good agreement that thi=
s
system will track northeastward into the central North Atlantic, posing no
threat to land areas.

...Heavy rain and the threat of isolated flash flooding found
across parts of the Central Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley
today before the bulk of the activity shifts into the Southern
Plains on Thursday...

...Well above average temperatures continue across the Midwest as
cooler air surges through the western half of the country and
lingers in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic...

The Northeast will be dominated by a compact cold upper-low for
the next few days; the cold front has already dropped south into
the eastern Carolinas and so below average temperatures will
remain entrenched through the short-term forecast period with Wed,
Thursday and Friday highs in the 50s and 60s (about 5-15 degrees
below normal) for much of New England while upper 60s and 70s
return to the Mid-Atlantic.

A well defined Pacific cold front continues to track across the
Rockies ushering in well below average cold air behind it centered
on the central Rockies today and shifting into southern Rockies
and southern High Plains Thursday into Friday, respectively.
Temperatures will be 10-20 degrees below average for day-time
highs, though more moderate/average for lows.  In fact, the cold
has lead to a few locations with Freeze Warnings across Northern
California, Southern Oregon, the western Snake River Plain of
Idaho, and portions of the desert of southwest Nevada (northwest
of Las Vegas).

Along and east of the frontal zone will exist the majority of
active and potentially dangerous weather.  Strong return flow in
response to the approaching upper-level trof and cold front will
allow a surge of moisture and well above normal temperatures
across the Plains.  This is particularly noticeable with near
record heat across the Upper Midwest toward the Great Lakes where
today's temps of the upper 80s will be 20-25 degrees above normal
across eastern Dakotas, Minnesota, and portions of Iowa.  While
not as anomalous as further north, temps into the low 90s across
the Mid-Mississippi River Valley are still 10-20 degrees above
normal.  Thursday and Friday, the front will be still very slow
moving toward the east and temperatures will remain above normal
but reducing slightly with highs in the 70s and low 80s Thursday
and Friday.

Further south, stronger return moisture off the western Gulf,
along with mid-level dry air coming out of the Mexican Plateau
will support daily rounds of stronger, organized convection
along/ahead of the cold front and dry line.  Today, convection
will remain more focused across the Central Plains where a
Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of excessive rainfall suggests heavy
rainfall with the potential of isolated flash flooding conditions.
 A flash flood watch has been issued for a few counties in
northwest Kansas based on this risk.  By Thursday, the strength of
the return flow, moisture increases have resulted in more focused
and generally slower moving thunderstorms increasing the heavy
rainfall and flash flooding risk to a Slight Risk (level 2/4)
across the Edwards Plateau of West Texas into the Hill country of
central Texas; though the Marginal extends as far north as Omaha,
Neb and southwest Iowa, with similar domains of the Southern
Plains under the Marginal and Central Texas at greater level 2
(Slight Risk) for Friday.

Another strong storm will impact the Northwest by early Thursday
will keep temperatures recharging the cooler temperatures with low
to mid-60s expected for the Northwest Thursday into Friday.  This
storm will also produce several inches of rain across the Olympic
Peninsula and northern Cascades, a clear and welcome indicator of
the change in season given summer dryness.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Wed Sep 29 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Oct 02 2021 - 12Z Wed Oct 06 2021

...Overview...

The slow-moving front extending across the Great Plains should
begin to move eastward as the medium range period begins on
Saturday, spreading scattered showers/thunderstorms and possibly
embedded heavy rain eastward across the Ohio Valley on Sunday and
Monday, and into the East Coast Tuesday and Wednesday.  Over the
Pacific Northwest, the next moisture plume is forecast to slowly
edge into the region by early next week.  Meanwhile, some
monsoonal moisture appears to make a return across the
Four-Corners region by early next week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance are coming into better agreement with respect to
shifting the slow-moving frontal boundary across the Plains
progressively eastward beginning on Saturday.  Both of the ECMWF
and GFS have reached relatively good agreement on this eastward
shift, with a more typical slightly faster GFS verses the slightly
slower ECMWF.  The slower ECMWF favors a weaker low pressure wave
moving across the central Plains behind a main low pressure center
forecast to drift southeastward across the Great Lakes by both
models.  By next Tuesday, the 00Z ECMWF develops this system over
New England ahead of an amplifying upper low over the Great
Lakes--a scenario that is not yet supported by its ensemble mean.
Therefore, a consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean with the 06Z
GFS/GEFS was adopted to handle this system, with more weights
given to the EC mean for Days 5-7 relative to its deterministic
component. This blend should provide a proper handle to the next
system of interest moving into the Pacific Northwest.  The 00Z CMC
has not been included in the blend due to significant deviation in
the general synoptic pattern across the U.S. through much of the
medium-range period.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Scattered showers and thunderstorms can be expected to spread
gradually eastward across the Ohio Valley on Sunday and Monday
ahead of a frontal system, with some embedded heavy rain possible.
 Steady rain is now forecast for New England Sunday and Monday
north of a stationary front.  The rain could linger into Tuesday
as a low pressure center drifts across the Great Lakes along the
stationary front toward the northern Mid-Atlantic region.   The
scattered showers and storms should then affect much of the
eastern U.S. Monday and Tuesday and possibly into Wednesday as the
front slowly moves across and could reach the East Coast on
Wednesday.  Meanwhile, some monsoonal moisture appears to make a
return across the Four-Corners region by early next week as an
upper low off the southern California coast is forecast to move
onshore.  Over the Pacific Northwest, the next moisture plume
ahead of a positively-tilted trough is forecast to slowly edge
into the region by early next week.

Warmer than average temperatures are forecast for the Midwest and
Ohio Valley especially in terms of lows, but even highs should be
around 10 degrees above normal on Saturday, though are likely to
moderate to near normal by Monday. The Northern Rockies/Northern
Plains can expect highs around 10 to 15 degrees above average for
the first half of next week underneath the upper high forming.
Meanwhile, temperatures a few degrees below normal are forecast
for the Four Corners states and into southern/central parts of the
Plains through the period.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed September 29 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 05 - 09 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a ridge with
above-normal mid-level heights over Alaska, while a trough is forecast over
the
Northern Pacific, near the West Coast of the CONUS, with below-normal mid-
level
heights. A ridge is predicted over parts of the central CONUS and Canada, w=
ith
the largest above-normal 500-hPa height anomalies predicted over the Hudson
Bay. A short wave trough is forecast over the southeastern CONUS with sligh=
tly
below normal mid-level heights forecast there.

Above-normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over Alaska, favoring near to
above-normal temperatures for parts of western Mainland Alaska. However,
below-normal temperature probabilities are elevated across parts of
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, extending to the
Northwest Coast, associated with above-normal cloudiness. Above-normal
temperatures are favored for much of the western and central CONUS due to
predicted above-normal med-level heights. A predicted eastward progression =
of
a
short wave trough over the central CONUS results in enhanced probabilities =
of
near to above-normal temperatures over the eastern CONUS ahead of the
trouging.


Above-normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over central and west=
ern
Mainland Alaska due to forecast storm system development. Below-normal
precipitation probabilities are favored over eastern Mainland Alaska and th=
e
Alaska Panhandle associated with above-normal mid-level heights. Beneath th=
e
predicted mean trough, above-normal precipitation chances are increased ove=
r
the western CONUS. Below-normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced ov=
er
the Great Plains, Great Lakes and New England due to forecast ridging with
above-normal mid-level heights. The short wave trough forecast to progress
towards the eastern CONUS supports an increased likelihood of near to
above-normal precipitation for most of the eastern CONUS.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=

Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=
set
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 07 - 13 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is similar to the
6-10 day period, but generally forecast to shift eastward and deamplify. Th=
e
Northern Pacific troughing is forecast to shift eastward over the western
CONUS
and a flattening ridge is forecast over the central and eastern CONUS.

Above-normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over Alaska, favoring near to
above-normal temperatures for Alaska, except for the Alaska Panhandle where
below-normal temperatures are favored. With the eastward progression of mea=
n
troughing and potential cloudiness, probabilities of near to below-normal
temperatures are favored over the western CONUS. Above-normal temperatures =
are
favored across the remainder of the CONUS, consistent with the consolidatio=
n
tool. The highest above-normal temperature probabilities are forecast over =
the
Upper Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes during the week-2 period.

Predicted troughing over the Bering Sea increases the chances of above-norm=
al
precipitation over most of Alaska. Below-normal precipitation is favored ov=
er
the Alaska Panhandle, related to forecast above-normal mid-level heights.
Beneath a mean trough, enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitation
are
favored across the West, and eastward to parts of the Northern and Central
Plains. A short wave frontal boundary and potential tropical moisture lead =
to
above-normal precipitation over parts of the eastern CONUS. Below-normal
precipitation is favored across the Great Lakes, Mississippi Valley, Southe=
rn
Plains and Northeast, consistent with the operational auto-blend tool.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=

European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=

precipitation forecast tools.


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Wed Sep 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed
based on recent guidance. Afternoon surface observations across the
West show surface high pressure building across the Great Basin,
which is in line with expectations and lends confidence to the
forecast. Peak winds are still expected during the morning hours and
may support localized critical conditions within the higher terrain.
See the previous discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 09/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Wed Sep 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, split flow is forecast to develop as high
pressure continues to build over the West Coast, and broad troughing
lingers over the Rockies and central US. High pressure across the
Great Basin is forecast to strengthen somewhat while weak low
pressure develops across western Mexico. Gusty east/northeasterly
flow will continue across much of southern California bringing dry
and warm conditions to the region.

..Central and southern California...
In response to the increasingly high pressure across the Great
Basin, low-level pressure gradients will begin to increase early
Thursday across the Sacramento Valley and the southern coastal
ranges. Northerly mid-level flow along the backside of the weak
trough should aid in strengthening the increasing low-level winds
through vertical mixing much of the day and into the overnight. With
dry downslope trajectories, widespread surface RH below 15% is
expected through much of southern California and portions of the
Sacramento Valley. Surface winds of 15-20 mph and the very dry
airmass should support isolated areas of elevated fire weather
conditions through the afternoon and overnight period, with locally
critical conditions possible through the wind-prone areas of the
higher terrain. The highest forecast confidence currently exists
over the southern coastal ranges where stronger surface pressure
gradients are expected. However, the inland intrusion of a surface
marine layer may confine stronger fire weather conditions to the
higher terrain away from more moderating surface RH. Given the
current dry fuels and expected meteorological conditions, elevated
probabilities have been introduced for portions of southern
California.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
342 PM EDT Wed Sep 29 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Oct 02 2021 - 12Z Wed Oct 06 2021

...Overview...

The slow-moving front extending across the Great Plains should
begin to move eastward as the medium range period begins on
Saturday, spreading scattered showers/thunderstorms and possibly
embedded heavy rain eastward across the Ohio Valley on Sunday and
Monday, and into the East Coast Tuesday and Wednesday.  Over the
Pacific Northwest, the next moisture plume is forecast to slowly
edge into the region by early next week.  Meanwhile, some
monsoonal moisture appears to make a return across the
Four-Corners region by early next week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance are coming into better agreement with respect to
shifting the slow-moving frontal boundary across the Plains
progressively eastward beginning on Saturday.  Both of the ECMWF
and GFS have reached relatively good agreement on this eastward
shift, with a more typical slightly faster GFS verses the slightly
slower ECMWF.  The slower ECMWF favors a weaker low pressure wave
moving across the central Plains behind a main low pressure center
forecast to drift southeastward across the Great Lakes by both
models.  By next Tuesday, the 00Z ECMWF develops this system over
New England ahead of an amplifying upper low over the Great
Lakes--a scenario that is not yet supported by its ensemble mean.
Therefore, a consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean with the 06Z
GFS/GEFS was adopted to handle this system, with more weights
given to the EC mean for Days 5-7 relative to its deterministic
component. This blend should also provide a proper handle to the
next system of interest moving into the Pacific Northwest.  The
00Z CMC has not been included in the blend due to significant
deviation from the GFS-ECMWF consensus in the general synoptic
pattern across the U.S. through much of the medium-range period.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Scattered showers and thunderstorms can be expected to spread
gradually eastward across the Ohio and Tenessee Valleys on Sunday
and Monday ahead of a frontal system, with some embedded heavy
rain possible.  Some showers and storms are expected to move
through the Deep South as well.  Steady rain is now forecast for
New England Sunday and Monday north of a stationary front.  The
rain could linger into Tuesday as a low pressure center drifts
across the Great Lakes along the stationary front toward the
northern Mid-Atlantic region.   The scattered showers and storms
should then affect much of the eastern U.S. Monday and Tuesday and
possibly into Wednesday as a cold front slowly moves across and
could reach the East Coast on Wednesday.  Meanwhile, some
monsoonal moisture appears to make a return over the Four-Corners
region by early next week as an upper low off the southern
California coast is forecast to move onshore.  Over the Pacific
Northwest, the next moisture plume ahead of a positively-tilted
trough is forecast to slowly edge into the region by early next
week.

Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for much of the
southern tier states due to clouds and precipitation followed by a
cold frontal passage across the Deep South.  Meanwhile, warmer
than average temperatures are forecast for the Midwest, Ohio
Valley and the East Coast this weekend near/ahead of a low
pressure system moving through the Great Lakes, though they are
likely to moderate to near normal by Monday.  A more significant
warm-up is now forecast for the northern Plains towards the middle
of next week as afterrnoon temperatures are expected to peak well
into the 80s.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
254 AM EDT Thu Sep 30 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 03 2021 - 12Z Thu Oct 07 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will feature the potential for an upper
low to close off in the east-central U.S. to the south of an upper
ridge/high, while at the surface a cold front moves slowly
eastward and spreads showers to eastern third of the country.
Farther west, troughing should amplify through the period along
the West Coast and push a cold front through the Northwest and
California.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance is reasonably agreeable with the overall pattern
described above. Though with slightly different evolutions, models
show multiple shortwaves joining over the Midwest around Monday to
form a closed low as the week progresses, as upper ridging
building over portions of the central U.S. could spread into
south-central and southeastern Canada around midweek and separate
the low from the northern stream flow. The 12/18Z GFS and 12Z
ECMWF show this type of solution, and both center an upper low
over the Mid-South on Wednesday/Thursday. However, the placement
of the closed low has varied from run to run in each model, along
with the upper ridge/high location and track. The newer 00Z GFS
has an upper low closing off and diving even farther southwest
toward the central Gulf Coast by midweek, with an upper high over
the Midwest. The 00Z ECMWF shows a bit of a southern trend as
well, with the center of the low over the Deep South. The
differences in the placement reduce confidence for the exact
positioning of the features, but at least the general idea for the
pattern has been persistent.

Saw fairly good model agreement regarding the western U.S., as an
initial relatively weak southern stream low tracks from the
eastern Pacific into southern California around Tuesday and then
lifts northeastward and potentially gets absorbed midweek. This
feature is in addition to/ahead of the positively tilted
amplifying trough along the West Coast, which also shows good
consistency among model guidance.

Overall, the WPC forecast was based on a multi-model deterministic
blend of the 12/18Z GFS runs and the 12Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC for the
first half of the period, before reducing CMC weighting due to
some inconsistencies with the pattern in the East and a weaker
initial western shortwave, and adding components of the GEFS and
EC ensemble means by the latter part of the forecast period. The
main change to the previous forecast was a faster entry of the
trough and cold front into the Northwest per model trends.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

As the frontal system tracks across the central and eastern U.S.,
showers and thunderstorms are likely in its vicinity, shifting
across the Mississippi Valley toward the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys early in the week, and spreading to the Eastern Seaboard
as the workweek begins. Showers should then linger in the East
underneath and on the eastern side of the upper low through at
least Thursday. Some embedded heavy rain is possible, and while it
is still uncertain where higher totals will occur, terrain
enhancement of the rainfall in the Southern Appalachians could
lead to locally heavier amounts. Meanwhile, monsoonal moisture may
make its return to the Four Corners states next week supported by
the leading shortwave. Tuesday currently looks to have the best
chances for rainfall there. Then as the troughing and cold front
come into the West Coast, showers are possible for the Pacific
Northwest into northern California.

Warmer than average temperatures are forecast for the
north-central U.S. through the period underneath upper ridging
traversing the area. Highs in the upper 70s and 80s in the
Northern Plains will be 10-20F above normal for this time of year.
A mild to warm Sunday is expected for portions of the East early
in the week before temperatures moderate closer to normal with the
cold frontal passage. The West Coast will see cool temperatures
beginning around midweek as the trough approaches and the cold
front makes its way through the region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
254 AM EDT Thu Sep 30 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 03 2021 - 12Z Thu Oct 07 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will feature the potential for an upper
low to close off in the east-central U.S. to the south of an upper
ridge/high, while at the surface a cold front moves slowly
eastward and spreads showers to eastern third of the country.
Farther west, troughing should amplify through the period along
the West Coast and push a cold front through the Northwest and
California.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance is reasonably agreeable with the overall pattern
described above. Though with slightly different evolutions, models
show multiple shortwaves joining over the Midwest around Monday to
form a closed low as the week progresses, as upper ridging
building over portions of the central U.S. could spread into
south-central and southeastern Canada around midweek and separate
the low from the northern stream flow. The 12/18Z GFS and 12Z
ECMWF show this type of solution, and both center an upper low
over the Mid-South on Wednesday/Thursday. However, the placement
of the closed low has varied from run to run in each model, along
with the upper ridge/high location and track. The newer 00Z GFS
has an upper low closing off and diving even farther southwest
toward the central Gulf Coast by midweek, with an upper high over
the Midwest. The 00Z ECMWF shows a bit of a southern trend as
well, with the center of the low over the Deep South. The
differences in the placement reduce confidence for the exact
positioning of the features, but at least the general idea for the
pattern has been persistent.

Saw fairly good model agreement regarding the western U.S., as an
initial relatively weak southern stream low tracks from the
eastern Pacific into southern California around Tuesday and then
lifts northeastward and potentially gets absorbed midweek. This
feature is in addition to/ahead of the positively tilted
amplifying trough along the West Coast, which also shows good
consistency among model guidance.

Overall, the WPC forecast was based on a multi-model deterministic
blend of the 12/18Z GFS runs and the 12Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC for the
first half of the period, before reducing CMC weighting due to
some inconsistencies with the pattern in the East and a weaker
initial western shortwave, and adding components of the GEFS and
EC ensemble means by the latter part of the forecast period. The
main change to the previous forecast was a faster entry of the
trough and cold front into the Northwest per model trends.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

As the frontal system tracks across the central and eastern U.S.,
showers and thunderstorms are likely in its vicinity, shifting
across the Mississippi Valley toward the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys early in the week, and spreading to the Eastern Seaboard
as the workweek begins. Showers should then linger in the East
underneath and on the eastern side of the upper low through at
least Thursday. Some embedded heavy rain is possible, and while it
is still uncertain where higher totals will occur, terrain
enhancement of the rainfall in the Southern Appalachians could
lead to locally heavier amounts. Meanwhile, monsoonal moisture may
make its return to the Four Corners states next week supported by
the leading shortwave. Tuesday currently looks to have the best
chances for rainfall there. Then as the troughing and cold front
come into the West Coast, showers are possible for the Pacific
Northwest into northern California.

Warmer than average temperatures are forecast for the
north-central U.S. through the period underneath upper ridging
traversing the area. Highs in the upper 70s and 80s in the
Northern Plains will be 10-20F above normal for this time of year.
A mild to warm Sunday is expected for portions of the East early
in the week before temperatures moderate closer to normal with the
cold frontal passage. The West Coast will see cool temperatures
beginning around midweek as the trough approaches and the cold
front makes its way through the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Thu Sep 30 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
Split mid-level low will persist across much of the CONUS as a weak
upper low moves across the southern Rockies/Southwest. Across the
center of the country, widespread shower and thunderstorm activity
will accompany the upper low at the start of a cooler and wetter
pattern. To the west, ridging and high pressure over the West Coast
and Great Basin will support warm and dry offshore winds across much
of central and southern California.

...Southern California...
Persistent north/northeasterly surface pressure gradients are
forecast to intensify early this morning as high pressure
strengthens across the southern Great Basin. At the same time, the
western edge of the weak upper low over the southern Rockies will
drive mid-level northerly flow across much of southern California.
Increasing gradient winds, and the additional upper-level support
should support weak to moderate offshore winds with stronger gusts
possible through the higher terrain. The dry source region and
downslope drying should favor very low surface RHs of 7-15%. Given
the presence of dry fuels, elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions are likely.

The greatest confidence in sustained elevated to near critical fire
weather conditions is expected to be above 1000 feet, away from the
moderating influence of the surface marine layer. The presence of
stronger wind gusts through terrain-favored gaps (30+ mph) also
suggest some potential for locally critical conditions to develop
this afternoon. More localized elevated fire weather conditions may
also occur through the higher terrain of the North Bay Hills.
However, weaker offshore flow, driven primarily by a thermally
induced surface pressure trough, is expected to limit greater fire
weather potential farther north across west-central California.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 AM CDT Thu Sep 30 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Weak ridging persistent over the West Coast through the last several
days will being to yield to weak troughing across the eastern
Pacific Friday, as the upper low over the Southwest and southern
Rockies moves northeastward into the Plains. At the surface,
lingering high pressure over the Great Basin will continue to
support weak offshore flow across warm and dry southern California.
Some local fire weather potential may remain across portions of the
southern California coastal ranges through Friday given surface RH
of 10-15%, gusty terrain winds, and very dry fuels. However,
weakening mid-level flow should greatly limit the stronger downslope
winds through the day, generating little confidence in widespread
fire weather concerns.

...Heavy rain and scattered flash flooding possible across the
Southern Plains over the next few days...

...Severe weather with large hail and locally damaging wind gusts
are possible across parts of West Texas today...

...Well above average temperatures continue across the Midwest and
Upper Great Lakes as cooler air surges into the central/southern
Rockies...

The biggest weather story over the next few days across the Lower
48 will be found throughout the central and south-central United
States. An advancing cold front that currently extends from the
Northern Plains to the Southern Rockies is expected to rush into
the Southern Plains today before stalling and lingering throughout
the Great Plains into the early part of the weekend. Ahead of the
cold front, ample moisture flowing out of the western Gulf of
Mexico will allow for numerous rounds of robust thunderstorms to
develop across the central and southern Plains today and Friday.
The greatest chance for thunderstorms to turn severe will be
located across West Texas today, with damaging wind gusts and
large hail the primary concern. Otherwise, the more widespread
hazard is likely to be the threat of flash flooding. The
slow-moving nature of the frontal boundary combined with multiple
clusters of thunderstorms could lead to instances of very heavy
rainfall throughout the Lone Star State. A Slight Risk (level 2/4)
of excessive rainfall has been issued for much of central and West
Texas today, shifting slightly east on Friday into
central/south-central Texas. Given the tropical airmass in pace,
isolated instances of flash flooding will also remain possible
across the Lower Mississippi Valley as well as the Central Plains
over the next few days.

At the top of an anomalous upper-level ridge, the Midwest and
Upper Great Lakes will end the month of September with
temperatures well above average. Highs into the upper 70s and 80s
are forecast, which is around 15 to 20 degrees above normal for
this time of year. Slightly milder weather is expected by Friday.
On the other end of the spectrum, much cooler and below average
high temperatures will be found across the central/southern
Rockies, Intermountain West, and central High Plains behind a
potent cold front. In fact, Freeze Warnings are in effect this
morning across eastern portions of the Snake River Valley in
Idaho, as well as parts of southwest Nevada. Crisp, fall-like
temperatures are also forecast across the Northeast as an
upper-level low pressure system gently swings across the region.
This will also aid in the development of a few showers across New
England this afternoon.

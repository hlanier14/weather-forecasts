Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1152 AM CDT Sat Mar 26 2022

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

The previous forecast generally remains on track, and only minor
additions and adjustments were made with this update.

1. The ongoing Elevated area over portions of the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic was expanded northward and westward based on the latest
observations and high-resolution guidance. Widespread elevated
conditions are still expected this afternoon, and locally critical
conditions will also be possible -- especially across portions of
western NC and western SC. Here, mostly clear skies and deep
westerly downslope flow will result in areas of critically low RH
(middle teens to lower 20s) amid breezy/gusty westerly surface
winds. However, recent rainfall across the area casts uncertainty on
the overall fire-weather threat, precluding the introduction of a
Critical area.

2. Elevated conditions will be possible across portions of central
and southwest Florida, where a dry, post-frontal airmass and clear
skies will support minimum afternoon RH near 25 percent coincident
with breezy west-northwesterly surface winds of 10-15 mph. However,
the localized nature of the threat and recent measurable rainfall
precludes the introduction of an Elevated area. Elevated
meteorological conditions will also be possible across northern
Florida, though fuels do not appear as receptive to wildfire-spread
owing to substantial recent rainfall.

3. The Elevated area over portions of central and southern TX was
expanded eastward, where current surface observations show 20-25
percent RH and veered south-southwesterly surface winds of 10-15
mph. Fuels remain at least modestly receptive to wildfire-spread
across this area.

4. An Elevated area was introduced for portions of central and
southern Colorado along the I-25 corridor for this afternoon. Mostly
clear skies combined with downslope warming/drying will result in
10-15 percent RH amid breezy west-northwesterly surface winds near
15-20 mph (locally higher over terrain-favored areas). While locally
critical conditions will be possible where the critically low RH
overlaps the breezy surface winds, a Critical area was not
introduced owing to the localized nature of the threat.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0100 AM CDT Sat Mar 26 2022/

...Synopsis...
...Carolinas into the Southeast...
A mid-level trough will move from the Ohio Valley to the western
Atlantic today. This will spread moderate to strong mid-level flow
across the Southeast into the mid-Atlantic. In addition, the surface
pressure gradient will tighten through the day as a surface low
deepens along the Northeast coast. This will result in breezy
conditions from the Carolinas into Georgia with sustained winds
around 20 mph and gusts to 35 mph. In addition, this post-frontal
airmass will be quite dry with relative humidity from the teens to
low 20s. Therefore, despite some recent rainfall across portions of
this area, an elevated fire weather threat remains.

...Portions of Central and Southern Texas...
Southerly return flow will strengthen across Texas today as weak lee
cyclogenesis occurs in the central High Plains. This will lead to
some strengthening low-level flow across portions of central and
southern Texas. Across eastern Texas, trajectories off the Gulf of
Mexico will lead to higher dewpoints, but farther west, a
continental airmass will be in place with relative humidity in the 8
to 13 percent range.

...A deepening low pressure system presents a mid-late next week
heavy rain/severe weather threat across the South while heavy
snow/ice and high wind threat focus across the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes...

...Overview...

A rapidly intensifying cyclone is forecast to track across the
central/southern Plains through the Great Lakes mid-late next
week.  The unsettled and wet pattern initially over the Southwest
will be followed by an outbreak of heavy rain and severe weather
to sweep across the southern tier states through Thursday.
Meanwhile, heavy snow and ice are forecast for the upper
Midwest/upper Great Lakes region where high winds are also
expected.  The high winds could also extend well to the west of
the low track across much of the northern and central Plains.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance this morning has come into general agreement for a
rapidly intensifying cyclone to track across the central/southern
Plains through the Great Lakes mid-late next week under an
upper-level pattern that favors phasing of the cold northern
stream flow with a resurgence of moist southern stream flow from
the Gulf of Mexico.  A composite blend of 40% 00Z ECMWF/EC mean,
40% 06Z GFS/GEFS and 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean was used to
compose the Days 3-6 forecasts.  Toward the end of next week,
models begin to diverge regarding the amplitude of next upper
trough forecast to dive across the western U.S.  The CMC was most
enthusiastic with the trough amplification while the GFS/GEFS
indicated a much flatter evolution.  The ECMWF/EC mean was in
between these extremes.  An intermediate solution was adopted for
Day 7 by incorporating a higher weighting from the ensemble means.
 The solutions maintained very good continuity with the previous
WPC forecast package.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

An upper low ejecting across southern CA/Southwest will support a
spread of enhanced rain and higher elevation snow through the
south-central Intermountain West/Rockies and the Southwest
Tuesday.  As a surface low pressure system strengthens in the
Plains and tracks northeast, increasingly widespread rain and
threat for severe weather with heavy downpours are forecast to
develop over the southern Plains late Tuesday and then move across
the South by Wednesday before reaching the Southeast on Thursday.
The heaviest rains are forecast to break out Tuesday night over
eastern portion of the southern Plains and then sweep through the
Mid-South/Gulf Coast states through Thursday where areas of flash
flooding are possible.  An emerging "slight" risk area is depicted
on the new experimental WPC day 5 ERO given favorable system
ingredients and antecedent conditions.  Meanwhile, light rain and
some thunderstorms are also expected farther north from the
central Plains through the Mid-Atlantic.  On the northern side of
the precipitation shield, the potential for a swath of heavy
wintry mix and accumulating deep low wrapping snows have continued
to increase across the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes later
Tuesday into Wednesday-Thursday given much model consensus on
developing a rather intense cyclone.  High winds appear to likely
impact near and well to the west of the low track during this time
frame as well given the impressive rate of cyclogenesis.  Some
wintry precipitation is also forecast for interior New England
late Thursday/early Friday ahead of a warm front, while pockets of
heavy rain are possible down the East Coast ahead of a cold front.
 Over the central Rockies to the nearby High Plains, a period of
heavy snow is possible from the central Rockies to the central
High Plains on Tuesday behind a reinforcing cold front.  By late
next week, another upper trough is forecast to dig southeastward
from the Pacific Northwest through the western U.S. and could
provide another opportunity for an enhanced round of wintry mix
from the northern to central Rockies to the nearby High Plains.
Some heavy rainfall could linger across the eastern Gulf Coast by
next weekend as a front becomes nearly stationary offshore.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat March 26 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19530324 - 19600404 - 19710403 - 19930306 - 20050403


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 7 day periods centered on the following dates:
19530325 - 20050402 - 19930306 - 19600403 - 19680325

...A highly amplified Mid to Upper Level flow pattern across the
nation to bring big temperature contrasts and numerous record
highs and lows...

...Locally Heavy Lake Effect Snows possible Sunday and Monday
downwind of the Great Lakes...

...A Fire Weather Threat for much of the Southeast, central Texas
and portions of Colorado and Florida...

...Much needed precipitation to move into California Sunday night
and Monday...


The mid to upper level flow across the lower 48 is expected to
remain highly amplified over the next few days, characterized by
an amplified upper trof over the east and an upper ridge over the
western to central U.S.  This will result in big temperature
contrast from the Western U.S., where temperatures are expected to
be much above average, to the northeastern U.S. where temperatures
are expected to be much below average.  Inside both of the much
above and much below average temperatures areas, there is the
potential for record highs and lows.  Record high temperatures are
possible Sunday and Monday from the Southwest into the Rockies and
portions of Texas.  Record low maximum temperatures are possible
Sunday and Monday from the Great Lakes into the Northeast.

The much below average temperatures across the Great Lakes and
into the Northeast will also be supporting active lake effect
snows downwind of the Great Lakes.  This will produce locally
heavy early spring snows in the lee of all of Great Lakes and into
the upslope regions of the Central Appalachians and portions of
northern New England.

The upcoming weather pattern will be dry across large sections of
the nation.  This dry weather, along with low relative humidities
and windy conditions will be conducive to an elevated fire weather
threat over the next two days across much of the Southeast,
portions of south central Florida, much of central Texas and
portions of east central Colorado.

A developing storm system off the California coast will spread
much needed precipitation in large portions of California Sunday
night, continuing through the day on Monday. Much of California is
mired in severe to extreme drought conditions with precipitation
much below average over the past several months.   This system,
however, does not appear to be a harbinger of a change in the
recent dry weather pattern with conditions looking dry in the wake
of this system for the remainder of the week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Sat Mar 26 2022

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

The primary change with this update was to add an Elevated area for
parts of central and southern Florida for Day 2/Sunday. A very dry,
continental airmass and efficient diurnal heating under limited
cloud coverage will allow minimum RH to fall into the lower/middle
20s during the late morning into early evening hours. These
critically-low RH values, combined with sustained northwesterly
surface winds near 10 mph (with locally higher gusts) will result in
a few hours of elevated conditions. In addition, fuels are becoming
increasingly receptive to wildfire-spread owing to the ongoing dry
conditions today/Saturday.

Farther west, locally elevated conditions will be possible across
portions of the northern and central Plains on Sunday afternoon,
where breezy/gusty surface winds will overlap near-critical RH.
However, the localized nature of these conditions casts uncertainty
on the fire-weather threat, precluding highlights at this time.

Elsewhere, the previous forecast reasoning (see below) remains on
track.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0102 AM CDT Sat Mar 26 2022/

...Synopsis...
...Carolinas into the Southeast...
On Sunday, moderate to strong mid-level flow will remain across the
Carolinas and Southeast, but the surface pressure gradient will be
more relaxed than Saturday. Therefore, some strong winds (sustained
around 15 mph) are expected, but they are not expected to be as
strong as Saturday. However, the low-level airmass will be drier
with relative humidity in the 12 to 18 percent range across most of
the area. In addition, the dry and breezy conditions on Saturday
will dry fuels across the region and likely make the influence from
recent rainfall even more muted. Therefore, an elevated fire weather
threat is expected again on Saturday.

...Portions of central and southern Texas...
Southerly return flow will strengthen again on Sunday in response to
the tightening pressure gradient. Sustained winds of 15 to 20 mph
are expected with relative humidity in the 8 to 15 percent range. By
late in the day, low-level flow will back and trajectories will
start to come more off the Gulf of Mexico. This should mostly occur
after peak heating, but it could lead to a shorter period of
elevated conditions in eastern portions of the highlighted elevated
delineation.

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 30 2022 - 12Z Sun Apr 03 2022

...A deepening low pressure system presents a mid-late next week
heavy rain/severe weather threat focus across the South while
heavy snow/ice and high wind threat focus across the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes...


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

A composite of reasonably well clustered guidance from the 18 UTC
GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC NBM
seems to offer a run to run consistent forecast Wednesday- into
Friday that enjoys good GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble support. The 12
UTC ECMWF ensemble mean seems best in line best in line with WPC
continuity heading into next weekend, so have adjusted NBM
guidance toward this guidance. Lingering guidance difference in
this time frame concerns upper trough amplification back over the
West and subsequent downstream frontal wave weather impact with
ejection downstream back over the South. Overall, the
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF/Canadian ensemble means still
develop a more amplified eastern Pacific upper ridge than the
GFS/GEFS mean. This allows for deeper trough digging back into the
West late next week.

...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

As a main surface low pressure system over the Plains strengthens
and tracks northeast, increasingly widespread rain with heavy
downpours and a threat for severe weather are forecast across the
South into Wednesday before spreading over the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic Thursday. A "slight" risk area remains
depicted on the WPC experimental medium range excessive rainfall
outlook (ERO) for Wednesday given favorable system ingredients and
antecedent conditions. Meanwhile, rain and thunderstorms are also
expected farther north from the central Plains through the East
with wavy frontal progression across the region.

On the northern side of the precipitation shield, expect a swath
of heavy wintry mix and accumulating snows from the Upper Midwest
to the Great Lakes into Wednesday-Thursday given model consensus
on developing a rather intense cyclone. In addition, high winds
appear to likely impact near and well to the west of the low track
given the impressive rate of cyclogenesis. Some wintry
precipitation is also forecast for northern New England in this
flow.

Late week, additional upper trough energies forecast to dig with
some uncertainty southeastward from the Pacific Northwest through
the West could provide another opportunity for an enhanced round
of wintry weather, mainly for the northern to central
Intermountain West/Rockies to the High Plains. Potential system
amplitude and progression into next weekend would favor return
moisture flow into an increasingly wavy/lifting front. This may
support renewed heavy rainfall potential across the
central/eastern Gulf Coast states and Southeast next weekend.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
305 AM EDT Sun Mar 27 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 30 2022 - 12Z Sun Apr 03 2022

...A deepening low pressure system presents a mid-late next week
heavy rain/severe weather threat focus across the South while
heavy snow/ice and high wind threat focus across the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes...


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

A composite of reasonably well clustered guidance from the 18 UTC
GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC NBM
seems to offer a run to run consistent forecast Wednesday- into
Friday that enjoys good GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble support. The 12
UTC ECMWF ensemble mean seems best in line best in line with WPC
continuity heading into next weekend, so have adjusted NBM
guidance toward this guidance. Lingering guidance difference in
this time frame concerns upper trough amplification back over the
West and subsequent frontal wave weather impact with ejection
downstream back over the South. Overall, the ECMWF/Canadian and
ECMWF/Canadian ensemble means offer a more amplified eastern
Pacific upper ridge than the GFS/GEFS mean. This allows deeper
trough digging into the West and more wavy frontal/QPF response
over the South.

...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

As a main surface low pressure system over the Plains strengthens
and tracks northeast, increasingly widespread rain with heavy
downpours and a threat for severe weather are forecast across the
South into Wednesday before spreading over the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic Thursday. A "slight" risk area remains
depicted on the WPC experimental medium range excessive rainfall
outlook (ERO) for Wednesday given favorable system ingredients and
antecedent conditions. Meanwhile, rain and thunderstorms are also
expected farther north from the central Plains through the East
with wavy frontal progression across the region.

On the northern side of the precipitation shield, expect a swath
of heavy wintry mix and accumulating snows from the Upper Midwest
to the Great Lakes into Wednesday-Thursday given model consensus
on developing a rather intense cyclone. In addition, high winds
appear to likely impact near and well to the west of the low track
given the impressive rate of cyclogenesis. Some wintry
precipitation is also forecast for northern New England in this
flow.

Late week, additional upper trough energies forecast to dig with
some uncertainty southeastward from the Pacific Northwest through
the West could provide another opportunity for an enhanced round
of wintry weather, mainly for the northern to central
Intermountain West/Rockies to the High Plains. Potential system
amplitude and progression into next weekend would favor return
moisture flow into an increasingly wavy/lifting front. This may
support renewed heavy rainfall potential across the
central/eastern Gulf Coast states and Southeast next weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CDT Sun Mar 27 2022

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
...Carolinas and eastern Georgia...
Offshore flow will persist across the Carolinas and Southeast today.
Some surface pressure gradient will exist across the region, but
winds are mostly expected to strengthen during the afternoon amid
deep mixing below moderate mid-level flow. Surface winds are
expected to peak around 15 to 20 mph. The deeply mixed boundary
layer will also be very dry with relative humidity in the teens.
Some rain fell across portions of this region earlier last week, but
fuels are quickly drying amid the dry and breezy airmass. Therefore,
despite slightly weaker winds than Saturday, fire weather concerns
may be somewhat larger today due to the additional drying.

...Florida...
Northwesterly flow down the Florida Peninsula will keep a mostly
continental airmass in place with relative humidity potentially
dropping below 20 percent during the afternoon today. Sustained
winds are expected to peak around 10 to 12 mph. These conditions are
dry and breezy enough to support an elevated fire weather threat.

...Central and Southern Texas...
Southerly return flow will strengthen through the day Sunday.
However, trajectories off the Gulf of Mexico will keep the greater
low-level moisture across eastern Texas until after sunset when
winds back and it starts to advect farther west. Winds of 15 to 20
mph are expected with relative humidity of 10 to 20 percent.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE OK/TX PANHANDLES
INTO NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
...Southern High Plains...
An upper-level low will be off the California coast at the start of
the period, but will move eastward through the day toward the
southern Great Basin. Ahead of this upper low, a strong mid-level
jet will move across the Southwest and into the southern High
Plains. Meanwhile, lee cyclogenesis will occur across the Plains
which will tighten the pressure gradient. The combination of the
tightening pressure gradient, a strengthening low-level jet, and
strong mid-level flow in an environment featuring deep mixing will
result in dry and breezy conditions across much of the southern High
Plains. The worst conditions are expected from northeast New Mexico
into the TX/OK Panhandles where winds of 20 to 25 mph are expected
with widespread single digit relative humidity. The critical
delineation has been drawn to best reflect the area with the
greatest threat for critical fire weather conditions.

...Southern Virginia and northern North Carolina...
Another day of dry and breezy offshore flow is expected across
southern Virginia and northern North Carolina on Monday as another
trough pivots through the northwesterly flow and strengthens
mid-level wind speeds. Surface winds of 15 to 20 mph are expected
where this stronger flow overspreads a well-mixed boundary layer,
from southern Virginia into northern North Carolina.

...Eastern Wyoming into southwest South Dakota and portions of the
Nebraska Panhandle...
Dry and breezy conditions are expected across much of Wyoming as the
surface low strengthens in the Plains. However, most fuels are still
snow-covered or moist at higher terrain. Therefore, the threat for
any fire weather concern will mostly be in low-elevation fine fuels
across eastern Wyoming and into portions of southwest South Dakota
and the Nebraska Panhandle. Winds are expected around 15 to 20 mph
with single-digit relative humidities.

...Lake effect snow over parts of the Great Lakes and upslope flow
snow into the Central Appalachians/Northern New England...

...Well-above average to record-breaking temperatures across the
Western U.S. and Southern Plains; below-average temperatures from
the Plains to the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern High Plains...

...Rain and snow return to the West...

Upper-level energy will flow over the Great Lakes into the
Northeast through Monday morning, creating a deep upper-level
trough over the region. The energy will aid in producing lake
effect snow over the Great Lakes and upslope snow for the Central
Appalachians/Northern New England through Monday morning when the
snow starts to wane. The highest snowfall accumulations will be
along the southeast coast of Lake Erie and the east coast of Lake
Ontario. Likewise, the highest snowfall amounts will be in the
upslope regions of the Central Appalachians/Northern New England.
The lake effect snow will taper off late Monday into Tuesday.

A deep upper-level trough associated with the upper-level energy,
bringing temperatures 15 to 25 degrees below average to the Upper
Midwest into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic through Tuesday. In
contrast, temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above average from
parts of the Great Basin/Southwest to the Southern Plains. In
addition, an upper-level ridge over the Rockies will allow
temperatures to reach record or tied for record high temperature
over the southwestern portion of the country through Sunday.

Furthermore, an approaching deep upper-level low will begin to
move onshore over California Sunday night into Tuesday. Therefore,
overnight Sunday, light rain will develop over the West Coast,
with higher elevation snow over the Sierra Nevada Mountains by
Monday. Overnight Monday into Tuesday, the rain and higher
elevation snow will move the Northern/Central Rockies and Great
Basin/Southwest.

In addition, the SPC has issued a Critical Risk of fire weather
over parts of the Southern High Plains Monday into Tuesday morning
due to gusty winds, low relative humidity, and dry fuels. The
threat of an Elevated Risk of fire weather continues on Sunday
into Monday morning over parts of the southern Mid-Atlantic
Southeast and parts of Central- Southern Texas.

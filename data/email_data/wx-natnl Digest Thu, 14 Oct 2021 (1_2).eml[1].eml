No changes. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 10/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0101 AM CDT Wed Oct 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow aloft will persist over the central and southern Rockies
as long-wave troughing lingers over the western/central CONUS. Weak
lee troughing across the High Plains coupled with downslope flow
will result in dry westerly winds across the southern High Plains
that will likely support some fire weather potential. Further west,
northwesterly flow through much of California will result in
localized fire weather concerns.

...Southern High Plains...
Westerly post-frontal winds are expected to gradually increase
through the day across much of eastern New Mexico and the Texas
Panhandle as a weak lee trough deepens. Sustained winds between 15
to 20 mph are probable, with afternoon gusts up to 25 mph possible.
Despite cooler temperatures, dry air advecting into the region
coupled with mostly clear skies and downslope warming/drying will
result in afternoon RH reductions into the teens for many locations.
Elevated conditions will be possible across a large swath of eastern
NM and the TX Panhandle, however, rainfall over the past 12 hours
has likely mitigated fuel readiness. The current risk area
highlights where favorable overlap of receptive fuels and dry/windy
conditions is most likely.

...Southern California...
Early morning VWP observations across CA show north to northwesterly
winds above the nocturnal inversion. These winds are forecast to
persist and will likely mix to the surface through the day amid a
deepening boundary layer. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph are
possible within the higher terrain, and combined with antecedent dry
conditions, may support localized elevated conditions. Winds are
forecast to increase through the northern Sacramento Valley later
tonight, but diurnal RH improvements will likely result in a only
low-end fire weather concern.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 13 2021

SYNOPSIS: An area of strong mid-level low pressure forecast over western No=
rth
America is likely to promote onshore flow and above-normal precipitation fo=
r
much of the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. Model guidance continues to
favor
elevated chances for heavy, and possibly record-breaking precipitation amou=
nts
for this time of year over portions of the central West Coast during week-2=
.
Downstream, mid-level high pressure forecast is likely to lead to warmer th=
an
normal temperatures and drier than normal conditions across much of the
central
and eastern CONUS. In Alaska, below normal temperatures remain favored over
much of the Mainland, however minimum temperatures are not expected to reac=
h
hazard thresholds.

HAZARDS

High risk of heavy precipitation for northern California, Thu-Mon, Oct 21-2=
5.

Moderate risk of heavy precipitation for parts of California and the Pacifi=
c
Northwest, Thu-Mon, Oct 21-25.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, and parts of
California, Northern Intermountain, and the Central Great Basin, Thu-Wed, O=
ct
21-27.

Slight risk of high winds for much of the western U.S., Thu-Wed, Oct 21-27.

to the 0z ECMWF, resulting in a drier mean solution relative to previous
guidance across portions of the West Coast. Additionally, while the Canadia=
n
ensemble was more of an outlier yesterday, it has since fallen more in line
with the ECMWF, favoring stronger mid-level troughing and heavier mean
precipitation amounts over the West Coast in the latest 0z run.



Despite these trends in the latest guidance, there is continued agreement i=
n
the latest reforecast guidance indicating at least a 20% chance of 3-day
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch from the Pacific
Northwest through central California for the entire period. Although chance=
s
for 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding 2 inches remain sparse in the
reforecast tools over the Pacific Northwest, there is continued support in =
the
raw ensemble guidance for meeting this total threshold, and a slight risk o=
f
heavy precipitation remains issued for week-2. Higher probabilities (>40%)
exist in both reforecast tools, however the GEFS keeps much of the signal i=
n
northern California whereas the ECMWF shows a much larger coverage extendin=
g
throughout the Pacific Northwest. Given this discrepancy, the moderate risk
area for heavy precipitation is maintained from yesterday, extending from
southern Oregon to the southern Central California Valley through the middl=
e
of
the period. The high risk area is also maintained over northern California
through the middle of the period where both reforecast tools indicate the
highest chances for heavy precipitation, and the ECMWF still shows at least=
 a
40% chance for 3-day accumulations exceeding the 98th percentile, suggestiv=
e
of
possible record breaking precipitation for late October.



The elevated risk for heavy precipitation may trigger localized flooding ov=
er
the highlighted regions, particularly over burn scarred areas of the West.
However, the increase in moisture is anticipated to quell ongoing wildfire
activity, help improve drought conditions, currently ranging from D0 to D4
across Oregon and California, and replenish water resources throughout the
West
Coast. High elevation heavy snow is possible in the Sierra Nevadas and
Cascades
during the period, though temperatures are not expected to be markedly cold=
er
than normal, precluding the addition of any snow related hazards across the
West. Additionally, reforecast tools also depict increased chances for
sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile tied to the continued
atmospheric
river potential. Thus, a slight risk of high winds remains posted for the
entirety of week-2 west of the Rockies.



Downstream, there is good agreement among the models featuring amplified
ridging centered over Hudson Bay, with positive height departures
overspreading
much of the north-central CONUS favoring predominantly mild and unseasonabl=
y
warm weather east of the Rockies during week-2. Early in the period, a cold
front is forecast to traverse the eastern CONUS and bring a drop in minimum
temperatures across portions of the Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Great
Lakes. However, it is unlikely nighttime lows will fall below hazard criter=
ia.
Farther south, there are continued signals in the GEFS reforecast tool for
increased precipitation tied to possible surface low development in the
Southern Plains, though totals are not anticipated to reach hazard threshol=
ds.
Across the tropics, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) continues to monito=
r a
tropical wave in the western Atlantic with a low chance of formation over t=

next five days and is not expected to bring any impacts to the CONUS. Beyon=

this, tropical activity looks to be quiet across the Atlantic during the ne=
xt
two weeks. However, there may be an uptick in activity later in October and
early November should the enhanced phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation
(MJO)
propagate eastward and maintain an organized structure across the Pacific.



Over Alaska, the aforementioned mid-level troughing is expected to bring
below-normal temperatures across the southwestern Mainland and the Aleutian=

with above-normal precipitation favored across the Southeast and Panhandle.
However, reforecast tools are unsupportive of temperatures and precipitatio=

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 PM EDT Wed Oct 13 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Oct 16 2021 - 12Z Wed Oct 20 2021

...Overview...

Most guidance advertises a fairly progressive upper pattern over
the lower 48 ahead of a mean trough that amplifies over the
eastern Pacific next week. For the weekend, expect warm
temperatures and rain in the East before upper troughing pushes a
cold front across the region, while ridging leads to dry
conditions over much of the rest of the country. Then, there is
increasing uncertainty for weather details in the West to the
Plains for the first part of the workweek, depending on what
becomes of a shortwave trough forecast to approach the West Coast
by early Sunday. The leading part of the Pacific trough should
reach far enough eastward to have some influence on the West Coast
by next Tuesday or Wednesday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance shows reasonably good agreement with the
large-scale upper-level pattern Saturday, and despite some minor
timing and position differences with a surface front pushing
through the East and an associated wave of low pressure, a
multi-model deterministic blend was sufficient for the early part
of the medium range period. Then for the early part of the week,
bigger differences begin to arise as shortwave energy and
troughing push into the West Coast, which has been a forecast
challenge for at least the last couple of days. The trend in some
of the deterministic models and some ensemble members has been to
support deeper and slower troughing in the West stemming from the
shortwave, pushing the ridge eastward. This trend is by no means
universal among guidance, as the 00Z UKMET and 00Z GFS show a
faster northern stream shortwave moving across the north-central
U.S., with the 00Z GFS forming a small closed low over the Midwest
by Tuesday, much like its previous runs. But, the 00Z and previous
12Z ECMWF have a deeper shortwave trough, the 06Z GFS broke with
its continuity to show a similar solution, and the CMC has had
deeper troughing all along, though likely is too aggressive and
slow with it. There is also a considerable proportion of ensemble
members particularly from the EC that show the latter type of
solution. Once again the 00Z deterministic CMC had one of the
deepest troughs, while the 00Z CMC ensemble members tend to have a
stronger ridge, another reason for lower confidence. In terms of
the newer 12Z runs, the 12Z GFS is pretty similar to its 06Z run
but with a bit faster track, while the 12Z ECMWF is faster than
the 00Z. Perhaps guidance is attempting to reach some sort of
middle ground consensus, but will continue to monitor.

Though confidence is somewhat low, today's updated forecast
attempted to lean toward a solution with more troughing across the
West, but not as aggressively as some of the deterministic
guidance. This was accomplished using a fairly even blend of the
06Z GFS, 06Z GEFS mean, 00Z ECMWF, and 00Z EC ensemble mean for
the latter half of the medium range period. Thus the main changes
to the previous forecast were to slow down the cold front passing
through the northwestern to north-central U.S. Monday through
Wednesday given the slower trough movement, and to add some light
precipitation to the north-central Rockies eastward, which would
be supported if the shortwave does track as such. The
aforementioned blend also worked for additional height falls in
the Pacific coming near to the West Coast by Wednesday, which does
show some timing differences among guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Portions of the Northeast will likely see moderate to heavy
rainfall on Saturday as strengthening eastern Canada low pressure
pushes a front across the region. Expect rain to be much lighter
to the south. Some lingering rain may fall to the lee of the
eastern Great Lakes and over favored windward terrain during
Sunday. Otherwise much of the East will see a drier trend aside
from the Florida Peninsula where developing easterly low level
flow may gradually increase rainfall toward midweek. Precipitation
over the Pacific Northwest will extend into the weekend as an
upper trough and developing surface system approach, with heaviest
totals likely to be over the Olympics and far northern Cascades.
Uncertainty with the ultimate evolution of upper trough energy
lowers confidence in the precise southward extent of precipitation
along the West Coast as well as where and how much may fall over
inland portions of the West and into the Plains. Recent trends
with that upper trough have led to less rain developing toward
midweek over the southern High Plains, but with low confidence.
Finally, the West Coast should see another increase of moisture by
Tuesday-Wednesday ahead of a more amplified East Pacific upper
trough.

Areas near the East Coast will start Saturday with lows 10-25F
above normal but the cold front crossing the region will quickly
bring a cooling trend, with Saturday highs only 10-15F above
normal. Moderately below normal highs to the west of the
Appalachians on Saturday will continue eastward Sunday and then
modify toward normal. There may also be a few colder pockets in
the Rockies on Saturday while warm flow ahead of a frontal system
crossing the northern tier may produce some warmer readings of
10-15F above average over parts of Montana on Sunday and perhaps
into the Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes by Monday-Tuesday.
Elsewhere most temperature anomalies should be in the single
digits on either side of normal.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 19 - 23 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. A trough with below normal 500-hPa heights is forecast ove=
r
Alaska extending southward into the northeastern Pacific off the west coast=
 of
the CONUS. Strong mean ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over the southwestern Aleutians and much of the west-central CONU=
S,
while a weak trough is forecast over the eastern CONUS in the 6-10 day peri=
od.

Below normal temperatures are favored over most of central and southern
California under predicted mean troughing and near to below normal 500-hPa
heights. Near to above normal temperatures are favored over the remainder o=
f
the CONUS associated with ridging and near to above normal 500-hPa heights.
Near to below normal temperature probabilities are elevated over Alaska und=
er
predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights.

Predicted troughing over the northeastern Pacific increases the chances of
above normal precipitation across much of the West Coast of the CONUS. Ridg=
ing
and near to above normal 500-hPa heights increase chances of near to below
normal precipitation for much of the remainder of the CONUS, except for par=
ts
of the Southern Plains and southern Florida Peninsula, where above normal
precipitation is favored due to forecast frontal activity. Troughing and
associated surface low pressure increase the odds of above normal
precipitation
over parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Near t=
o
below normal precipitation is favored for the remainder of Alaska, consiste=
nt

...Heavy rain and the potential for considerable flash flooding
possible through early Thursday morning between south-central
Texas and southeast Oklahoma...

...Light snow and gusty winds to gradually diminish overnight
across the Northern High Plains...

...Well above average temperatures forecast across the eastern
third of the United States as cooler temperatures remain over the
Northern/Central Plains, Rockies, and Intermountain West...

Much of the active weather occurring across the Lower 48 through
the end of the week is associated with an amplified upper-level
pattern, with a deep trough located over the western half of the
country. At the surface, a strong area of low pressure is
currently located over the Northern Plains and an attached cold
front extends southward into the Southern Plains. This frontal
boundary is forecast to stall and linger between the Middle
Mississippi Valley and Southern Plains over the next few days.
Meanwhile, ample tropical moisture surging into the south-central
U.S. tonight can be traced back to the remnants of Pamela as it
traverses northern Mexico. The combination of a slow moving
frontal boundary and sufficient atmospheric moisture will create
an environment ripe for thunderstorms capable of producing intense
downpours. Several inches of rain are possible between
south-central Texas and southeast Oklahoma tonight. A Moderate
Risk (level 3/4) of Excessive Rainfall has been issued for this
area to highlight the concern. Numerous flash flood events are
likely, with significant events possible in low-lying and urban
locations. Flash Flood Watches are in effect and extend from far
southwest Missouri to south-central Texas. The heavy rain threat
may also extend into parts of western Arkansas and the Middle
Mississippi Valley tonight as well. By Thursday, the heavy rain
threat is forecast to slightly diminish and stretch between
eastern Texas and the Midwest.

Farther north and on the cold side of the system, light snow and
gusty winds are forecast to gradually wane throughout the Northern
High Plains this evening. Additionally, a few lingering snow
showers are likely over the Northern and Central Rockies through
Friday morning. In total, over a foot of snow was reported to have
fallen from this first winter storm of the season across parts of
the Northern Rockies, as well as the Black Hills of South Dakota.
As the aforementioned area of low pressure exits into
south-central Canada on Thursday, cold temperatures will be left
in its wake. Frost Advisories and Freeze Warnings have been issued
across much of Nebraska, northeast Colorado, and northwest Kansas.

Speaking of temperatures, the rest of the Northern/Central High
Plains, Rockies, and Intermountain West can expect below average
temperatures to persist through Friday. Widespread below freezing
nighttime temperatures are forecast across the mountainous
terrain. Meanwhile, the eastern third of the country will
experience the opposite with widespread above average temperatures
found from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes and Northeast.
Highs 10 to 20 degrees above average will equate to temperatures
into the 70s and 80s. Low temperatures will also remain quite mild
and only drop into the 60s at night.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Wed Oct 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow is forecast to increase through the day Thursday as the
axis of an upper-level trough shifts over the Rockies. This will
maintain dry westerly downslope winds over the southern High Plains
and support another day of elevated fire weather concerns. To the
west across California, high pressure over the Pacific Northwest
will support northerly flow through the Sacramento Valley that
should result in fire weather concerns.

...Southern High Plains...
Strengthening mid and upper-level flow over the southern Rockies
will support a deepening surface low over the central High Plains as
well as increasing westerly winds within the boundary layer.
Westerly downslope winds around 15-20 mph on the southern periphery
of the low will support RH reductions into the teens and low 20s.
Deepening boundary layers through the day may foster wind gusts
upwards of 25-30 mph by late afternoon. Elevated conditions appear
most likely across southeast NM/southwest TX where fine-fuel
moisture is near or below 5% and sustained 15+ mph winds are most
likely, but elevated conditions may extend as far north as
east-central NM and the western TX Panhandle.

...Northern California...
Surface high pressure building over the southern Pacific Northwest
will induce northerly down-valley flow through the Sacramento Valley
Thursday afternoon. Most guidance suggests winds will most likely be
sustained around 15 mph with locally stronger gusts possible. With
antecedent dry conditions already in place (above-average ERCs and
fine-fuel moisture values between 3-4% are noted in recent analyses)
and RH values in the teens expected, elevated fire weather
conditions appear probable.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
420 PM EDT Wed Oct 13 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Oct 16 2021 - 12Z Wed Oct 20 2021

...Overview...

Most guidance advertises a fairly progressive upper pattern over
the lower 48 ahead of a mean trough that amplifies over the
eastern Pacific next week. For the weekend, expect warm
temperatures and rain in the East before upper troughing pushes a
cold front across the region, while ridging leads to dry
conditions over much of the rest of the country. Then, there is
increasing uncertainty for weather details in the West to the
Plains for the first part of the workweek, depending on what
becomes of a shortwave trough forecast to approach the West Coast
by early Sunday. The leading part of the Pacific trough should
reach far enough eastward to have some influence on the West Coast
by next Tuesday or Wednesday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance shows reasonably good agreement with the
large-scale upper-level pattern Saturday, and despite some minor
timing and position differences with a surface front pushing
through the East and an associated wave of low pressure, a
multi-model deterministic blend was sufficient for the early part
of the medium range period. Then for the early part of the week,
bigger differences begin to arise as shortwave energy and
troughing push into the West Coast, which has been a forecast
challenge for at least the last couple of days. The trend in some
of the deterministic models and some ensemble members has been to
support deeper and slower troughing in the West stemming from the
shortwave, pushing the ridge eastward. This trend is by no means
universal among guidance, as the 00Z UKMET and 00Z GFS show a
faster northern stream shortwave moving across the north-central
U.S., with the 00Z GFS forming a small closed low over the Midwest
by Tuesday, much like its previous runs. But, the 00Z and previous
12Z ECMWF have a deeper shortwave trough, the 06Z GFS broke with
its continuity to show a similar solution, and the CMC has had
deeper troughing all along, though likely is too aggressive and
slow with it. There is also a considerable proportion of ensemble
members particularly from the EC that show the latter type of
solution. Once again the 00Z deterministic CMC had one of the
deepest troughs, while the 00Z CMC ensemble members tend to have a
stronger ridge, another reason for lower confidence. In terms of
the newer 12Z runs, the 12Z GFS is pretty similar to its 06Z run
but with a bit faster track, while the 12Z ECMWF is faster than
the 00Z. Perhaps guidance is attempting to reach some sort of
middle ground consensus, but will continue to monitor.

Though confidence is somewhat low, today's updated forecast
attempted to lean toward a solution with more troughing across the
West, but not as aggressively as some of the deterministic
guidance. This was accomplished using a fairly even blend of the
06Z GFS, 06Z GEFS mean, 00Z ECMWF, and 00Z EC ensemble mean for
the latter half of the medium range period. Thus the main changes
to the previous forecast were to slow down the cold front passing
through the northwestern to north-central U.S. Monday through
Wednesday given the slower trough movement, and to add some light
precipitation to the north-central Rockies eastward, which would
be supported if the shortwave does track as such. The
aforementioned blend also worked for additional height falls in
the Pacific coming near to the West Coast by Wednesday, which does
show some timing differences among guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Portions of the Northeast will likely see moderate to heavy
rainfall on Saturday as strengthening eastern Canada low pressure
pushes a front across the region. Expect rain to be much lighter
to the south. Some lingering rain may fall to the lee of the
eastern Great Lakes and over favored windward terrain during
Sunday. Otherwise much of the East will see a drier trend aside
from the Florida Peninsula where developing easterly low level
flow may gradually increase rainfall toward midweek. Precipitation
over the Pacific Northwest will extend into the weekend as an
upper trough and developing surface system approach, with heaviest
totals likely to be over the Olympics and far northern Cascades.
Uncertainty with the ultimate evolution of upper trough energy
lowers confidence in the precise southward extent of precipitation
along the West Coast as well as where and how much may fall over
inland portions of the West and into the Plains. Recent trends
with that upper trough have led to less rain developing toward
midweek over the southern High Plains, but with low confidence.
Finally, the West Coast should see another increase of moisture by
Tuesday-Wednesday ahead of a more amplified East Pacific upper
trough.

Areas near the East Coast will start Saturday with lows 10-25F
above normal but the cold front crossing the region will quickly
bring a cooling trend, with Saturday highs only 10-15F above
normal. Moderately below normal highs to the west of the
Appalachians on Saturday will continue eastward Sunday and then
modify toward normal. There may also be a few colder pockets in
the Rockies on Saturday while warm flow ahead of a frontal system
crossing the northern tier may produce some warmer readings of
10-15F above average over parts of Montana on Sunday and perhaps
into the Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes by Monday-Tuesday.
Elsewhere most temperature anomalies should be in the single
digits on either side of normal.

solution. Once again the 00Z deterministic CMC had one of the
deepest troughs, while the 00Z CMC ensemble members tend to have a
stronger ridge, another reason for lower confidence. In terms of
the newer 12Z runs, the 12Z GFS is pretty similar to its 06Z run
but with a bit faster track, while the 12Z ECMWF is faster than
the 00Z. Perhaps guidance is attempting to reach some sort of
middle ground consensus, but will continue to monitor.

Though confidence is somewhat low, today's updated forecast
attempted to lean toward a solution with more troughing across the
West, but not as aggressively as some of the deterministic
guidance. This was accomplished using a fairly even blend of the
06Z GFS, 06Z GEFS mean, 00Z ECMWF, and 00Z EC ensemble mean for
the latter half of the medium range period. Thus the main changes
to the previous forecast were to slow down the cold front passing
through the northwestern to north-central U.S. Monday through
Wednesday given the slower trough movement, and to add some light
precipitation to the north-central Rockies eastward, which would
be supported if the shortwave does track as such. The
aforementioned blend also worked for additional height falls in
the Pacific coming near to the West Coast by Wednesday, which does
show some timing differences among guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Portions of the Northeast will likely see moderate to heavy
rainfall on Saturday as strengthening eastern Canada low pressure
pushes a front across the region. Expect rain to be much lighter
to the south. Some lingering rain may fall to the lee of the
eastern Great Lakes and over favored windward terrain during
Sunday. Otherwise much of the East will see a drier trend aside
from the Florida Peninsula where developing easterly low level
flow may gradually increase rainfall toward midweek. Precipitation
over the Pacific Northwest will extend into the weekend as an
upper trough and developing surface system approach, with heaviest
totals likely to be over the Olympics and far northern Cascades.
Uncertainty with the ultimate evolution of upper trough energy
lowers confidence in the precise southward extent of precipitation
along the West Coast as well as where and how much may fall over
inland portions of the West and into the Plains. Recent trends
with that upper trough have led to less rain developing toward
midweek over the southern High Plains, but with low confidence.
Finally, the West Coast should see another increase of moisture by
Tuesday-Wednesday ahead of a more amplified East Pacific upper
trough.

Areas near the East Coast will start Saturday with lows 10-25F
above normal but the cold front crossing the region will quickly
bring a cooling trend, with Saturday highs only 10-15F above
normal. Moderately below normal highs to the west of the
Appalachians on Saturday will continue eastward Sunday and then
modify toward normal. There may also be a few colder pockets in
the Rockies on Saturday while warm flow ahead of a frontal system
crossing the northern tier may produce some warmer readings of
10-15F above average over parts of Montana on Sunday and perhaps
into the Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes by Monday-Tuesday.
Elsewhere most temperature anomalies should be in the single
digits on either side of normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0103 AM CDT Thu Oct 14 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery shows the gradual eastward
progression and slight deepening of an upper-level wave over the
Four Corners. This feature will traverse the southern Rockies
through the day, strengthening westerly downslope winds in the
process. To the west, building surface high pressure over the
southern Pacific Northwest/northern Great Basin will induce
northerly flow through parts of the Sacramento Valley. With dry
conditions already in place, elevated fire weather conditions are
possible.

...Southern High Plains...
In addition to the synoptic wave, water-vapor imagery also reveals
an embedded speed maxima upstream from the southern Rockies that
should overspread the southern High Plains this afternoon.
Strengthening mid-level flow associated with this feature will help
augment downslope warming/drying. As a result, relative humidity
values are forecast to fall into the low teens and perhaps single
digits. Diurnal boundary-layer mixing will allow downward transfer
of the stronger low to mid-level winds, manifesting as gusts between
25-30 mph by late afternoon. ERC values are only slightly above
seasonal values for most locations, but fine-fuel moisture values
between 3-6% suggest at least a low-end fire weather concern is
likely.

...Northern California...
Surface observations across southern OR and far northern CA have
shown steady surface pressure rises over the past 6-12 hours. This
trend is expected to continue as a surface high builds amid
upper-level height rises. The resulting pressure gradient will
induce northerly down-valley winds through the Sacramento Valley
today. Sustained winds around 15 mph are expected and may gust
upwards of 20-25 mph by late afternoon. Dewpoint values at Readding,
CA are currently near the 10th percentile for this time of year,
suggesting an anomalously dry air mass is in place. This supports
recent guidance that shows reasonably high probability of RH
reductions into the low 20s and upper teens later this afternoon.
With dry fuels already in place per recent fuel reports, elevated
conditions are likely.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CDT Thu Oct 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
Building surface high pressure over the Great Basin on Friday will
support an offshore wind regime across coastal southern California.
Increasing Santa Ana winds coupled with dry conditions will support
elevated fire weather concerns within the coastal mountains and
foothills for most of the day. Elsewhere, fire weather concerns will
generally be localized and confined to the Southwest where pressure
gradient winds may support pockets of elevated conditions amid
seasonally low relative humidity and marginal fuels.

...Southern California Coast...
East to northeasterly Santa Ana winds are forecast to increase early
Friday morning, perhaps as early as the 09-12Z time period, before
peaking during the late morning/early afternoon hours. Latest
guidance suggests an LAX-DAG pressure gradient between -3 to -5 mb
is likely, which typically supports elevated to locally critical
conditions based on past analogs. Hi-res ensembles support this idea
and show high probability for elevated conditions along the southern
CA coastal terrain as RH falls through the day via downslope effects
and diurnal warming. Spread in the magnitude of the pressure
gradient, along with weak upper-level wind support, yield low
confidence in sufficient coverage of critical conditions to warrant
a higher risk category. However, locally critical conditions appear
likely for areas that typically see terrain-augmented winds.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 AM EDT Thu Oct 14 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 17 2021 - 12Z Thu Oct 21 2021

...Overview...

The majority of guidance shows a progressive pattern across most
of the lower 48 Sunday-Monday, with an eastern Pacific shortwave
moving into the West while a ridge crosses the central U.S. and an
eastern U.S. trough becomes more shallow. Then consensus shows an
evolution toward a slower and more amplified regime, as an
amplified mean trough settling over the eastern Pacific
(consisting of leading energy that ejects north-northeast around
Wednesday as upstream energy drops in) supports mean ridging over
the western U.S./Canada and in turn troughing over east-central
North America. Embedded within this pattern transition, the
shortwave energy entering the West late Sunday continues to
provide a significant forecast challenge for models and
ensembles--keeping confidence moderate to low for the distribution
and intensity of precipitation that may progress across the
western two-thirds of the country during the period. There is
somewhat better confidence in two periods of precipitation along
the West Coast, one with the Sunday shortwave and the next from
flow on the eastern side of the larger scale Pacific upper trough.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

With each cycle there is a gradually increasing signal that
incoming western shortwave energy will separate to form a closed
low in some fashion. Recent ECMWF runs had joined the CMC which
was the first model to suggest such an evolution (albeit in an
extremely slow/deep form). More recently GFS runs adopted the
closed low scenario, and finally in the new 00Z cycle the UKMET
has switched from its prior open/progressive trough (which had
been consensus a couple days ago) to a closed low. The basic
evolution appears closer to being resolved but meaningful
differences for track and timing of the upper low remain. Not
surprisingly individual ensemble members from the various model
systems vary considerably to yield an open trough. CMC runs have
tended to be on the slow side--still a question mark given the
large scale pattern favoring a building western ridge. Given the
spread that existed through the 12Z/18Z cycles, the preference for
the updated forecast was to keep adjustments fairly modest by way
of starting with a blend of the 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF on day 3
Sunday and then some gradual incorporation of 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF
means with those models. The result was to maintain a conservative
depiction of some flow separation while keeping progression fairly
close to the means.

Over eastern North America there has been a notable trend over the
past day or so toward a more persistent upper low over extreme
northern New England and the Canadian Maritimes through the first
half of next week, due to stronger ridging over and southwest of
Greenland. The increased blockiness seems to provide some forecast
complications over southern Canada later in the period as well
while western Canada shortwave energy approaches. By day 7
Thursday the 12Z GFS and new 00Z CMC end up with an upper low well
west of trough axis in all of the ensemble means. 12Z GFS weight
in the aforementioned blend was kept low enough not to have an
adverse impact on the forecast.

In general there is better agreement and continuity with the
amplified mean trough aloft that develops over the eastern
Pacific. With typical timing differences for six days out in time,
consensus shows north-northeastward ejection of leading energy
near the West Coast around Wednesday as upstream energy digs in to
reinforce the mean trough.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system affecting the Northwest through the weekend will bring
mostly moderate precipitation to western Washington/Oregon and
northern California on Sunday. It looks increasingly likely that
there will be an axis of rain and higher elevation snow across
portions north-central portions of the West as an upper low closes
off and progresses eastward. However there is still considerable
uncertainty over the strength, track, and timing of this upper low
so confidence in the details remains lower than desired. Some of
this moisture should continue across similar latitudes of the
central U.S. while some rain could develop along the leading cold
front. Flow on the eastern side of the Pacific upper trough should
bring one or more periods of rain to central/northern parts of the
West Coast Tuesday onward. On Sunday there will be some lingering
rain to the lee of the eastern Great Lakes and over favored
windward terrain in New England. The Florida Peninsula may see an
increase of rainfall toward midweek as low level easterly flow
develops.

Coverage of temperature anomalies 10F or more from normal should
be relatively low through the period, pending resolution of some
forecast details. Warm flow ahead of a front crossing the northern
tier may bring area of plus 10F or higher anomalies to locations
from Montana into the Great Lakes Sunday-Tuesday. Similar
anomalies for lows may continue into the Northeast thereafter.
Meanwhile central/north-central parts of the West may see some
highs 10-15F below normal early next week with the upper low
closing off and tracking over the region. Otherwise moderately
cool temperatures over the South and East on Sunday will quickly
moderate heading into next week, yielding near to slightly above
average highs by midweek. Clouds/moisture will keep highs modestly
below normal near the West Coast on some days.

...Tropical moisture from former hurricane Pamela continues to
bring heavy rain and flash flooding today from south-central Texas
to southeastern Oklahoma...

...Threat of severe weather increases later on Friday for the Ohio
Valley ahead of a developing low pressure system...

...The cold in the West and the warmth in the East will shift
eastward heading toward the weekend...

The weather pattern across the mainland U.S. is forecast to
undergo a noticeable change during the next couple of days.  This
pattern change will shift the prevailing cold pattern in the West
and the persistent warmth in the East eastward as we head toward
the weekend.  First off all, the intense low pressure system that
has brought heavy snow and high winds across the northern/central
Rockies into the High Plains is getting ready to depart into
southern Canada.  The remaining snow and rain over the northern
Plains should come to an end by this afternoon although the winds
will remain rather strong and gusty.  This intense storm plays a
key initial role in eroding the persistent warm ridge that has
been anchoring in the eastern U.S.  Meanwhile, another low
pressure system is brewing over the southern High Plains ahead of
an upper trough sliding across the western U.S.  This low pressure
system is forecast to intensify while tracking toward the lower
Great Lakes along a frontal boundary during the next couple of
days.  Showers and thunderstorms are expected to form ahead of the
system with the best chance for the thunderstorms to become severe
later on Friday across the Ohio Valley.  By Saturday morning, the
showers/storms will likely reach western new England as the
intensifying storm moves into Ontario, Canada.  In the wake of
this low pressure system, the cold air in the West will be ushered
into and through the Plains states.  The warmth in the East will
shrink in size as it spreads further north toward New England.

In the shorter term, ample tropical moisture surging into the
south-central U.S. tonight associated with former hurricane Pamela
will create an environment ripe for thunderstorms capable of
producing intense downpours.  Several inches of rain are possible
between south-central Texas and southeast Oklahoma where a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall is expected for this morning.
The heavy rain threat may also extend into parts of western
Arkansas and the Middle Mississippi Valley as well.  By later
today, the heavy rain threat is forecast to diminish quite a bit
as the main energy is forecast to be focused over the southern
High Plains where a new low pressure system is forming.
Meanwhile, moisture associated with upper trough moving across the
West is expected to spread high-elevation snows across the
Intermountain region and into the central Rockies during the next
couple of days.

into tonight.  By Friday, a strengthening high pressure system
will bring drier and colder than normal conditions across the vast
majority of the West.  The exception will be near the Pacific
Northwest coast where a stream of Pacific moisture will bring
persistent rain into the region.

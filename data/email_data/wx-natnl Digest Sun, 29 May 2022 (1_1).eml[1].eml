Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CDT Sat May 28 2022

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast. RH values are already near 10%
in central New Mexico. Portions of central and eastern New Mexico
are still the most probable areas for locally extremely critical
conditions this afternoon. See the previous discussion for greater
details.

..Wendt.. 05/28/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Sat May 28 2022/

...Synopsis...
Moderate southwesterly flow aloft over much of the western US is
forecast to intensify ahead of a deepening mid-level trough and jet
streak across the West Coast. A pair of surface cyclones will
intensify west and east of the Rockies, supporting strong surface
winds through much of the day. Warm temperatures and low humidity
will continue to keep fuels dry and receptive to fire spread. The
favorable overlap of a warm, dry and windy conditions will support
widespread critical fire weather concerns across the Southwest and
southern High plains Saturday.

...Southwest and Southern High Plains.
Low-level winds are forecast to gradually increase through the
morning in response to strong surface heating/mixing and deepening
low pressure over the southern Great Basin. By midday, flow aloft is
forecast to strengthen as the main western US trough approaches,
bolstering southwesterly low-level flow to 20-30 mph across much of
the Four Corners and Southwest. The deep mixing/warm temperatures
will also support dry conditions with widespread surface RH of
10-15%. The overlap of strong and gusty surface winds should easily
support widespread critical fire weather concerns across much of the
southern Great Basin, Four Corners and Southwest Saturday.

Farther to the east across the southern High Plains, strong
downslope winds are expected to increase south of the strengthening
lee low. Widespread winds of 20-25 mph appear possible along with
warm temperatures and afternoon humidity of 8-15%. Widespread
critical conditions are expected within drying fuels. Localized
high-end critical and extremely critical conditions may also develop
for a few hours across portions of northeastern NM, where surface
gusts aided by local terrain and a subtle mid-level jet may reach
30+ mph.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

A belt of strong surface flow and low RH is expected along/near the
cold front in the southern Great Basin. Elevated highlights have
been extended into southern Nevada where conditions could become
briefly Critical tomorrow afternoon. Elsewhere the forecast remains
on track.

..Wendt.. 05/28/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Sat May 28 2022/

...Synopsis...
Western US troughing will continue to amplify across the Southwest
as a significant shortwave feature within this broader southwesterly
flow ejects eastward. Forecast to reach the Rockies late Sunday,
lift from the trough will deepen a lee cyclone across the High
Plains as a cold front stalls across central Great Basin. Widespread
strong surface winds are expected ahead of the trough from the
southern Great Basin to the High Plains. The strong winds will
overlap with a warm and very dry airmass supporting widespread
critical fire weather conditions Sunday.

...Southern Great Basin and Southeast...
40-50 kt mid-level flow and a deepening lee cyclone will once again
promote a significant diurnal increase in southwesterly low-level
flow across much of the Southwest. 20-25 mph surface winds,
strongest along and south of a stalled front across the southern
Great Basin, will overlap with a very dry and warm surface airmass
characterized by 10-15% RH. Widespread critical fire weather
conditions are again expected within very dry and drought-stressed
fuels. Localized extremely critical conditions may also develop
across portions of northwestern NM immediately ahead of the
mid-level southwesterly jet. Aided by downward momentum transfer and
terrain influences, hi-res ensemble guidance shows some potential
for surface winds greater than 30 mph overlapping with sub 10%
surface humidity. While limited in spatial and temporal overlap,
strong winds and volatile fuel states suggest higher-end fire
weather concerns are possible.

...Southern High Plains...
With ascent from the aforementioned mid-level wave moving over the
Rockies, a strengthening lee low and surface dryline will promote
strong southwesterly surface winds across much of the southern and
central High Plains. Downslope winds and warm surface temperatures
should easily support widespread elevated and critical fire weather
conditions from eastern NM, through the Panhandles and into
southeastern CO where fuels remain quite dry. Stronger gusts aided
by terrain may also support localized extremely critical conditions,
though coverage is uncertain.

Farther north, surface winds of 15-20 mph and RH of 15-20% should
support elevated fire weather conditions across northern and central
CO. Moisture return moving west toward the higher terrain may also
support a few high-based thunderstorms later in the afternoon. While
not expected to reach coverage requirements for Isolated Dry Thunder
Area, a few lightning strikes will be possible within dry fuels near
the cold front.

...Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall/convection focus across
south-central Plains near a stationary front next week...

...Overview...

The medium range period will likely begin with an amplified trough
and a low pressure system exiting the northern Plains into
south-central Canada next Tuesday.  The associated trailing cold
front will gradually push east and southeast across the northern
tier states and further into the Plains against a warm ridge over
the eastern U.S. forecast to be gradually eroded by the front
through the end of next week.  Mountain snows initially over the
northern Rockies and gusty winds/convection over the northern
Plains will give way to rounds of thunderstorms over
central/southern Plains where the front is forecast to become
nearly stationary.  Meanwhile, thunderstorms should progress
through the mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, the Great Lakes, and
then into the Northeast as the week progresses.  Farther south,
tropical moisture can be expected to increase across southern
Florida through the medium-range period as a subtropical jet is
forecast to interact with moisture coming up from tropical cyclone
Agatha currently located in the eastern Pacific.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The abrupt model trend in the past couple days toward a more
amplified upper trough over the northern Plains for early next
week has stabilized, although the most recent model runs still
tend toward a more closed off system, with the associated lead
front pushing faster toward the east across the upper Midwest.
The GFS and GEFS show their typically faster solutions with
subsequent eastward progression of the front across the Northeast
by next Thursday.  By late next week, deterministic model
solutions begin to diverge regarding the timing and amplitude of a
frontal wave near New England coast.  Meanwhile, models indicate
reasonably agreeable timing of the arrival of the next wave of
Pacific moisture into the Northwest later next week despite there
is quite a bit of model spread with the latitude of the associated
offshore upper low.  Over Florida, models are now more consistent
with bringing tropical moisture northeastward from the eastern
Pacific where tropical cyclone Agatha is currently located.  The
GFS again favors faster solutions with this tropical moisture feed
whereas the ECMWF and CMC indicate a slower and more consolidated
cyclonic gyre moving across Central America.

Thus the WPC medium range forecast was based on a multi-model and
ensemble blend of 40% from the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 40% from the 00Z
ECMWF/EC mean, and 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, transitioning to
mostly the ensemble means by Day 7.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

The surface low pressure system lifting into central Canada
beginning Tuesday will send a cold front across the north-central
U.S. and across the northeastern quadrant through the latter part
of the workweek. Rain is possible first across North Dakota and
the Upper Midwest to Great Lakes along this front Tuesday and then
shifting eastward across the Ohio Valley and into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic by Thursday, after some initial showers in
parts of the Northeast Tuesday-Wednesday near a backdoor front.
However, the back end of the main front is forecast to move more
slowly through central and southern parts of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley, and will provide a focus for rain and
thunderstorms for multiple days around Tuesday-Thursday. Flash
flooding is possible especially where storms repeat over the same
area, which at this point appears most likely to occur around
Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, but with uncertainty in the
details beyond that.

Elsewhere, Florida could see a showery pattern next week as weak
upper-level energy passes through, with diurnally favored
convection. This may increase by late next week as there is
potential for moisture and energy associated with what is
currently Tropical Depression One-E in the eastern Pacific to lift
into the Gulf of Mexico. There is ample uncertainty with the
potential for any redevelopment of the feature and its track and
timing, but regardless it could enhance moisture and rainfall
potential over Florida. The Northwest can expect increasing
precipitation (most likely rain) chances later in the week as a
front pushes through the region.

The eastern U.S./Mississippi Valley upper ridge will promote above
average temperatures by 10-20F over the Midwest/Ohio Valley and
parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Tuesday-Wednesday, with some
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures possible. The
backdoor front reaching New England and possibly as far south as
the northern Mid-Atlantic would bring a cooler trend to these
areas though. Meanwhile upper troughing will bring very cool
temperatures to areas from the Intermountain West through
northern/central Plains through midweek with highs forecast to be
10-20F or below normal. The flattening pattern aloft will push the
initial Plains cold front eastward while leading to a moderating
trend for below normal temperatures over the central U.S., with
mostly single-digit negative anomalies by Thursday-Friday, though
around 10F below normal in rain-cooled Kansas and Oklahoma. The
East should see shrinking coverage of warm temperatures on
Thursday and especially Friday-Saturday. The West Coast and into
the Great Basin could flip back to warmer than normal temperatures
by around 5-15F Wednesday and beyond, followed by a modest cooler
trend on Friday-Saturday along the immediate West Coast with the
arrival of a Pacific front.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat May 28 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

...Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall/convection focus across
south-central Plains near a stationary front next week...

...Overview...

The medium range period will likely begin with an amplified trough
and a low pressure system exiting the northern Plains into
south-central Canada next Tuesday.  The associated trailing cold
front will gradually push east and southeast across the northern
tier states and further into the Plains against a warm ridge over
the eastern U.S. forecast to be gradually eroded by the front
through the end of next week.  Mountain snows initially over the
northern Rockies and gusty winds/convection over the northern
Plains will give way to rounds of thunderstorms over
central/southern Plains where the front is forecast to become
nearly stationary.  Meanwhile, thunderstorms should progress
through the mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, the Great Lakes, and
then into the Northeast as the week progresses.  Farther south,
tropical moisture can be expected to increase across southern
Florida through the medium-range period as a subtropical jet is
forecast to interact with moisture coming up from tropical cyclone
Agatha currently located in the eastern Pacific.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The abrupt model trend in the past couple days toward a more
amplified upper trough over the northern Plains for early next
week has stabilized, although the most recent model runs still
tend toward a more closed off system, with the associated lead
front pushing faster toward the east across the upper Midwest.
The GFS and GEFS show their typically faster solutions with
subsequent eastward progression of the front across the Northeast
by next Thursday.  By late next week, deterministic model
solutions begin to diverge regarding the timing and amplitude of a
frontal wave near New England coast.  Meanwhile, models indicate
reasonably agreeable timing of the arrival of the next wave of
Pacific moisture into the Northwest later next week despite quite
a bit of model spread with the latitude of the associated offshore
upper low.  Over Florida, models are now more consistent with
bringing tropical moisture northeastward from the eastern Pacific
where tropical cyclone Agatha is currently located.  The GFS again
favors faster solutions with this tropical moisture feed whereas
the ECMWF and CMC indicate a slower and more consolidated cyclonic
gyre moving across Central America.

Thus the WPC medium range forecast was based on a multi-model and
ensemble blend of 40% from the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 40% from the 00Z
ECMWF/EC mean, and 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, transitioning to
mostly the ensemble means by Day 7.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

The surface low pressure system lifting into central Canada
beginning Tuesday will send a cold front across the north-central
U.S. and across the northeastern quadrant through the latter part
of the workweek. Rain is possible first across North Dakota and
the Upper Midwest to Great Lakes along this front Tuesday and then
shifting eastward across the Ohio Valley and into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic by Thursday, after some initial showers in
parts of the Northeast Tuesday-Wednesday near a backdoor front.
However, the back end of the main front is forecast to move more
slowly through central and southern parts of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley, and will provide a focus for rain and
thunderstorms for multiple days around Tuesday-Thursday. Flash
flooding is possible especially where storms repeat over the same
area, which at this point appears most likely to occur around
Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, but with uncertainty in the
details beyond that.

Elsewhere, there is increasing forecast agreement for tropical
cyclone Agatha over the eastern Pacific to turn northeastward and
move across Central America over the next few days.  Scattered
showers and thunderstorms are expected to become more frequent and
widespread across southern Florida later next week although the
specifics are not clear at this time.  Factors that influence the
timing and amounts of rainfall will include (a) the interaction of
a subtropical jet with tropical moisture coming from Agatha, and
the cyclone's subsequent track and intensity after crossing
Central America, (b) the proximity of an upper low forecast to
gradually gain tropical characteristics near and northeast of the
Bahamas midweek, and (c) possible interaction with a tropical wave
moving into the western Caribbean Sea.

The eastern U.S./Mississippi Valley upper ridge will promote above
average temperatures by 10-20F over the Midwest/Ohio Valley and
parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Tuesday-Wednesday, with some
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures possible. The
backdoor front reaching New England and possibly as far south as
the northern Mid-Atlantic would bring a cooler trend to these
areas though. Meanwhile upper troughing will bring very cool
temperatures to areas from the Intermountain West through
northern/central Plains through midweek with highs forecast to be
10-20F or below normal. The flattening pattern aloft will push the
initial Plains cold front eastward while leading to a moderating
trend for below normal temperatures over the central U.S., with
mostly single-digit negative anomalies by Thursday-Friday, though
around 10F below normal in rain-cooled Kansas and Oklahoma. The
East should see shrinking coverage of warm temperatures on
Thursday and especially Friday-Saturday. The West Coast and into
the Great Basin could flip back to warmer than normal temperatures
by around 5-15F Wednesday and beyond, followed by a modest cooling
trend on Friday-Saturday along the immediate West Coast with the
arrival of a Pacific front.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Northeast through Sunday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe storms over parts of the
Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley Saturday evening through
Monday morning...

...There is a threat of heavy snowfall for the highest elevations
of the Northern Rockies...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southwest/Southern Rockies and Southern High Plains...

A deep upper-level trough will develop over the northwestern
portion of the country from Saturday night through Sunday. The
associated front will produce showers and thunderstorms will
develop along and ahead of the boundary over the Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley Saturday evening through Monday morning.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Northern/Central Plains and a
second area over parts of the Southern High Plains through Sunday
morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
minimal threat of tornadoes. However, there will be an increased
threat of severe wind gusts over 65 knots over both regions.

The severe thunderstorm threat increases and moves to the Upper
Mississippi Valley and the Northern/Central Plains on Sunday.
Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Northern/Central Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley from Sunday into Monday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. In addition,
there will be an increased threat of severe wind gusts over 65
knots and two-inch diameter hail. Furthermore, there will be a
threat of excessive rainfall over the Upper Midwest. Therefore,
the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Northern/Central Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley
from Sunday through Monday morning. The associated heavy rain will
create localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that
experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.

The front will move eastward slightly on Monday, as does the
threat of severe thunderstorms. Therefore, on Monday, the SPC has
issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Northern/Central Plains and Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley. The
hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes. Moreover, there will be an increased threat of
excessive rainfall as more moisture surges into the region.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
over parts of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley on
Monday. The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized
areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small
streams the most vulnerable.

Meanwhile, overnight Saturday, a front over the Northeast Coast
moves offshore by Sunday morning. As a result, there will be
showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Northeast associated
with the front, ending by late Saturday night. Some of the
thunderstorms will produce heavy rain. Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Northeast. The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized
areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small
streams the most vulnerable. Further, onshore flow off the
Atlantic will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms over
parts of Florida through Monday.

Moreover, as the upper-level trough builds over the Northwest,
rain will develop over parts of the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California and extend eastward to the Northern Rockies. As a
result, there will be light wet snow over some of the highest
elevations of Cascades to the Northern Rockies from Saturday
evening into Sunday. As the upper-level trough deepens, the snow
levels will lower. Therefore, heavy wet snow will develop over the
higher elevations of the Northern Intermountain Region and the
Northern Rockies from Sunday evening into Monday.

Finally, there is a Critical Risk of fire weather over the
Southwest/Southern Rockies and Southern High Plains from Saturday
evening into Monday morning. The threat is due to strong gusty
winds, dry fuels, and low humidity.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to increase ahead of a
strengthening mid-level trough diving across the Southwest and
Great Basin. At the surface, a cold front will stall across the
southern Great Basin, while a lee low deepens in response to lift
from the approaching trough. Widespread strong surface winds are
expected ahead of the trough from the southern Great Basin to the
High Plains. The strong winds will overlap with a warm and very dry
airmass supporting widespread critical fire weather concerns within
dry fuels.

...Southwest and southern Great Basin...
Strong flow aloft associated with the fast moving upper trough/jet
streak is forecast to overspread much of NM and the southern Four
Corners early today. At the same time, a lee low across southeastern
CO should intensify, bolstering low-level southwesterly winds to
25-35 mph. In addition to the strong boundary-layer flow, area
soundings show very warm temperatures and low to very low relative
humidity. The favorable overlap of strong surface winds, low
humidity and dry fuels will support widespread critical fire weather
concerns. A few hours of localized extremely critical conditions
also appear possible mainly across portions of eastern and central
NM where the greatest potential for 30+ mph winds and sub-10%
humidity may briefly coexist. Confidence in prolonged extremely
critical conditions remains low owing to limited spatial and
temporal coverage and slightly moderated fuels due to recent
precipitation.

Across the southern Great Basin, model guidance shows a few hours of
stronger surface winds of 15-20 mph overlapping with humidity of
10-15% south of the stalled cold front. While coverage and duration
of the stronger winds and lower surface humidity is expected to be
limited, a few hours of elevated to near critical fire weather
conditions will likely develop within areas of dry fuels.

...Southern High Plains...
As the lee low begins to move eastward into the central Plains, a
trailing dryline and associated surface trough should aid in the
strengthening southwesterly low-level winds across much of the
southern High Plains. While widespread critical meteorological
conditions are expected, recent precipitation has moderated some
fuels. This will limit the potential for more vigorous fire weather
activity, particularly across portions of the southern and eastern
TX Panhandle. A Critical Area will be maintained where the best
overlap in 20-25 mph surface winds, surface RH below 15% and the
most supportive fuels exists.

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A prominent shortwave trough embedded within the strong
southwesterly flow will move from the Great Basin onto the Plains
early Monday. Flow aloft will weaken through the day as the
shortwave lifts to the north and east. As the trough moves away, a
cold front will slide south into portions of the Four Corners and
NM. The lingering flow aloft should support gusty surface winds
within a dry airmass across much of the southern/central High Plains
Monday.

...New Mexico into the southern/central High Plains...
Strong mid-level flow will remain in place across much of the
Southwest and High Plains through early Monday as the main shortwave
is forecast to eject to the northeast. Aided by momentum transfer
and mixing from the stronger flow aloft and a weak lee low/surface
pressure trough to the east, gusty downslope winds of 20-25 mph will
likely develop by midday, especially in the lee of the higher
terrain. Warm temperatures and the downslope drying will favor low
RH below 15%. Widespread critical fire weather conditions appear
likely across much of the western High Plains. Fire weather concerns
should quickly abate later in the evening as a cold front approaches
from the northwest and the stronger flow aloft begins to slacken.
While some elevated conditions may linger at higher altitudes into
the evening, overall fire weather concerns should quickly diminish
after the frontal passage.

...Northern Sacramento Valley Foothills...
As the aforementioned western US trough shifts to the east,
northerly flow is forecast to move over the Sacramento Valley and
the surrounding foothills. Downvalley winds should increase along
with warm and dry surface conditions. Fuels across the foothills are
receptive to fire spread, suggesting elevated fire weather concerns
are possible.

...Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall/convection will focus across
the south-central Plains near a front Tuesday-Thursday...

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Wednesday with a relatively
deep upper low for early June atop south-central Canada, and
troughing associated with this feature will gradually push a
frontal system across the northeast quadrant of the country along
with some showers and storms. The back end of this frontal system
is forecast to slow, stall, and lift back north through the week,
and will provide a focus for rounds of rain and thunderstorms that
could cause flash flooding across the central/southern Plains.
Farther south, tropical moisture can be expected to increase
across southern Florida through the medium-range period as a
subtropical jet is forecast to interact with moisture coming up
from tropical cyclone Agatha currently located in the eastern
Pacific. Elsewhere, upper-level ridging is forecast to build
across the interior West while an East Pacific upper low produces
troughing along the West Coast.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent model guidance shows somewhat reasonable agreement that an
upper low will be consolidating across south-central Canada this
week, though with some notable differences in the 12/18Z cycle
even as the period begins day 3/Wednesday. The 12Z UKMET in
particular seemed unlike consensus where it showed separate energy
to the east of the upper low over the Upper Great Lakes and not
yet consolidated, which displaced the surface low to the
southeast. The 12Z and new 00Z ECMWF are particularly strong with
an upstream shortwave located near the central Rockies compared to
other guidance, but still seemed acceptable to use in a forecast
blend. Then by Thursday-Friday, the 12Z CMC drifts more
southeastward with its centroid of the upper low than other
models, producing more troughing in the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
compared to consensus and basically every ensemble member. The 00Z
CMC looks to be in better alignment. The GFS runs and the ECMWF
seemed to be aligned the best with each other and ensemble
guidance, so favored those especially during the early part of the
forecast. However, by the weekend, there are some considerable
differences with the upper low--the 18Z GFS in particular starts
to diverge as it merges the aforementioned upper low and another
upper low that other GFS runs and other models show over far
northeastern Canada/the western Atlantic. Ensemble means may also
be merging two upper lows. But had to favor the ensemble means by
over half by the end of the period regardless given the model
differences, but maintaining a bit of 12Z GFS influence and more
of the 12Z ECMWF, which seemed to be the best deterministic model
proxy to consensus.

Models stay more agreeable with troughing over the West Coast
through the weekend despite lingering latitudinal differences with
the East Pacific upper low, while ridging develops in the interior
West possibly into the southern High Plains. Guidance varies much
more considerably with the pattern over the Gulf of Mexico and
Florida through the week with at least tropical moisture emerging
from Agatha but also possibly energy. Many models and ensemble
members produce possibly tropical surface lows crossing the Gulf
and the Florida Peninsula, but with timing differences on the
order of days, and some linger energy and low pressure near the
Yucatan/Bay of Campeche/western Caribbean. The WPC forecast at
this point is on the slow and weak side of guidance, but with some
ejection northeastward into the Gulf by the weekend. This is most
like the ECMWF in terms of the deterministic guidance.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

A surface low well into central Canada by Wednesday will send its
trailing cold front across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley
Wednesday and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Thursday-Friday. Rain
and thunderstorms can be expected along this front, after some
initial showers in parts of the Northeast Wednesday near a
backdoor front. However, the back end of the main front is
forecast to move more slowly through central and southern parts of
the Plains and Mississippi Valley, and will provide a focus for
rain and thunderstorms for multiple days around Tuesday-Thursday.
Flash flooding is possible especially where storms repeat over the
same area, which at this point appears most likely to occur around
Kansas, Oklahoma, and possibly Missouri. Uncertainty remains with
the axis of the convection each day/night, but a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall in WPC's experimental day 4 outlook seemed
warranted given moisture and instability will be abundant along
with a focus for lift with the front in place, and considering
antecedent conditions could be quite wet with Tuesday's rain.

There is increasing forecast agreement for tropical cyclone Agatha
over the eastern Pacific to turn northeastward and move across
Mexico over the next few days. Scattered showers and thunderstorms
are expected to become more frequent and widespread across
southern Florida later next week although the specifics are not
clear at this time. Factors that influence the timing and amounts
of rainfall will include (a) the interaction of a subtropical jet
with tropical moisture coming from Agatha, and the cyclone's
subsequent track and intensity after crossing Central America, (b)
the proximity of an upper low forecast to gradually gain tropical
characteristics near and northeast of the Bahamas midweek, and (c)
possible interaction with a tropical wave moving into the western
Caribbean Sea.

Additionally, rain chances are expected to increase in the
Northwest during the latter half of the week given the trough axis
near the West Coast and a couple of frontal systems. The Southwest
should remain dry and hot though. Rounds of rain are possible in
the central U.S. next weekend, but with considerable uncertainty
in the details at this point.

Upper ridging ahead of the central U.S./Canada trough/low will
promote above average temperatures by 10-20F over the Midwest/Ohio
Valley and parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Wednesday, with the
exception of parts of New England due to the backdoor front.
Meanwhile upper troughing will bring continued cool temperatures
across the Rockies and central High Plains through midweek with
highs forecast to be 10-20F or below normal. The flattening
pattern aloft will push the cold front eastward, leading to a
moderating trend for below normal temperatures over the central
U.S., with mostly single-digit negative anomalies by
Thursday-Friday, though around 10F below normal in rain-cooled
Kansas and Oklahoma. The East should see shrinking coverage of
warm temperatures on Thursday and especially Friday into the
weekend. The West Coast and into the Great Basin can expect warmer
than normal temperatures by around 5-15F Wednesday and beyond,
followed by a modest cooling trend on Friday-Sunday along the
immediate West Coast with the arrival of a Pacific front.

...Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall/convection will focus across
the south-central Plains near a front Tuesday-Thursday...

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Wednesday with a relatively
deep upper low for early June atop south-central Canada, and
troughing associated with this feature will gradually push a
frontal system across the northeast quadrant of the country along
with some showers and storms. The back end of this frontal system
is forecast to slow, stall, and lift back north through the week,
and will provide a focus for rounds of rain and thunderstorms that
could cause flash flooding across the central/southern Plains.
Farther south, tropical moisture can be expected to increase
across southern Florida through the medium-range period as a
subtropical jet is forecast to interact with moisture coming up
from tropical cyclone Agatha currently located in the eastern
Pacific. Elsewhere, upper-level ridging is forecast to build
across the interior West while an East Pacific upper low produces
troughing along the West Coast.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent model guidance shows somewhat reasonable agreement that an
upper low will be consolidating across south-central Canada this
week, though with some notable differences in the 12/18Z cycle
even as the period begins day 3/Wednesday. The 12Z UKMET in
particular seemed unlike consensus where it showed separate energy
to the east of the upper low over the Upper Great Lakes and not
yet consolidated, which displaced the surface low to the
southeast. The 12Z and new 00Z ECMWF are particularly strong with
an upstream shortwave located near the central Rockies compared to
other guidance, but still seemed acceptable to use in a forecast
blend. Then by Thursday-Friday, the 12Z CMC drifts more
southeastward with its centroid of the upper low than other
models, producing more troughing in the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
compared to consensus and basically every ensemble member. The 00Z
CMC looks to be in better alignment. The GFS runs and the ECMWF
seemed to be aligned the best with each other and ensemble
guidance, so favored those especially during the early part of the
forecast. However, by the weekend, there are some considerable
differences with the upper low--the 18Z GFS in particular starts
to diverge as it merges the aforementioned upper low and another
upper low that other GFS runs and other models show over far
northeastern Canada/the western Atlantic. Ensemble means may also
be merging two upper lows. But had to favor the ensemble means by
over half by the end of the period regardless given the model
differences, but maintaining a bit of 12Z GFS influence and more
of the 12Z ECMWF, which seemed to be the best deterministic model
proxy to consensus.

Models stay more agreeable with troughing over the West Coast
through the weekend despite lingering latitudinal differences with
the East Pacific upper low, while ridging develops in the interior
West possibly into the southern High Plains. Guidance varies much
more considerably with the pattern over the Gulf of Mexico and
Florida through the week with at least tropical moisture emerging
from Agatha but also possibly energy from Agatha, which could
combine with western Caribbean energy. Many models and ensemble
members produce possibly tropical surface lows crossing the Gulf
and the Florida Peninsula, but with timing differences on the
order of days, and some linger energy and low pressure near the
Yucatan/Bay of Campeche/western Caribbean. The WPC forecast at
this point is on the slow and weak side of guidance, but with some
ejection of low pressure northeastward into the Gulf by the
weekend. This is most like the ECMWF in terms of the deterministic
guidance.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

A surface low well into central Canada by Wednesday will send its
trailing cold front across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley
Wednesday and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Thursday-Friday. Rain
and thunderstorms can be expected along this front, after some
initial showers in parts of the Northeast Wednesday near a
backdoor front. However, the back end of the main front is
forecast to move more slowly through central and southern parts of
the Plains and Mississippi Valley, and will provide a focus for
rain and thunderstorms for multiple days around Tuesday-Thursday.
Flash flooding is possible especially where storms repeat over the
same area, which at this point appears most likely to occur around
Kansas, Oklahoma, and possibly Missouri. Uncertainty remains with
the axis of the convection each day/night, but a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall in WPC's experimental day 4 outlook seemed
warranted given moisture and instability will be abundant along
with a focus for lift with the front in place, and considering
antecedent conditions could be quite wet with Tuesday's rain.

There is increasing forecast agreement for tropical cyclone Agatha
over the eastern Pacific to turn northeastward and move across
Mexico over the next few days. Scattered showers and thunderstorms
are expected to become more frequent and widespread across
southern Florida later next week although the specifics are not
clear at this time. Factors that influence the timing and amounts
of rainfall will include (a) the interaction of a subtropical jet
with tropical moisture coming from Agatha, and the cyclone's
subsequent track and intensity after crossing Central America, (b)
the proximity of an upper low forecast to gradually gain tropical
characteristics near and northeast of the Bahamas midweek, and (c)
possible interaction with a tropical wave moving into the western
Caribbean Sea.

Additionally, rain chances are expected to increase in the
Northwest during the latter half of the week given the trough axis
near the West Coast and a couple of frontal systems. The Southwest
should remain dry and hot though. Rounds of rain are possible in
the central U.S. next weekend, but with considerable uncertainty
in the details at this point.

Upper ridging ahead of the central U.S./Canada trough/low will
promote above average temperatures by 10-20F over the Midwest/Ohio
Valley and parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Wednesday, with the
exception of parts of New England due to the backdoor front.
Meanwhile upper troughing will bring continued cool temperatures
across the Rockies and central High Plains through midweek with
highs forecast to be 10-20F or below normal. The flattening
pattern aloft will push the cold front eastward, leading to a
moderating trend for below normal temperatures over the central
U.S., with mostly single-digit negative anomalies by
Thursday-Friday, though around 10F below normal in rain-cooled
Kansas and Oklahoma. The East should see shrinking coverage of
warm temperatures on Thursday and especially Friday into the
weekend. The West Coast and into the Great Basin can expect warmer
than normal temperatures by around 5-15F Wednesday and beyond,
followed by a modest cooling trend on Friday-Sunday along the
immediate West Coast with the arrival of a Pacific front.

...Drier and pleasant weather expected for much of the East to
round out the Memorial Day weekend...

...Colder temperatures, areas of heavy rain, and heavy higher
elevation snowfall will be expected through Monday across northern
areas of the Intermountain West...

...Severe weather will be a concern across portions of the Central
and Northern Plains, and the Upper Midwest through early next
week...

...Critical fire weather concerns will remain in place across the
Southwest, Southern Rockies, and the Southern High Plains...

Dry and generally tranquil weather will be the story for the
remainder of the Memorial Day weekend for much of the East as high
pressure along the East Coast begins to edge offshore and allows
for southerly flow from the Gulf of Mexico to return. This will
lead to an increase in heat and humidity with time, and by
Memorial Day, temperatures will be above normal across much of the
eastern half of the nation with many areas seeing temperatures
reaching the upper 80s to the lower 90s. One exception will be
northern New England given proximity of a cold front slowly
sinking south from southeast Canada and this will keep
temperatures here a bit cooler. Scattered areas of showers and
thunderstorms are expected across the Florida Peninsula and there
may be some locally heavy rainfall across this region going
through the remainder of the weekend.

The weather across the Intermountain West will be considerably
more unsettled by comparison to the East as multiple cold fronts
and waves of low pressure advance off to the east in response to a
gradually deepening upper trough. This will bring much colder
temperatures and locally heavy precipitation today for the Pacific
Northwest, the northern Great Basin, and the northern Rockies.
Widespread shower activity and locally heavy rainfall is expected,
but as the upper-level trough deepens over the West today through
Monday, the snow levels will be dropping and this will set the
stage for rain changing over to areas of heavy snow for especially
the higher terrain of the northern Rockies. In fact, some of the
higher terrain of the Sawtooth, Absoroka, and Big Horn mountains
will see some significant snowfall. The heaviest amounts will
likely be over the Absoroka and Big Horn mountains where as much
as 1 to 3 feet of snow appears likely going through Monday night.
Temperatures across areas of the northern Great Basin and the
northern Rockies will be as much as 15 to 25 degrees below normal
going through Memorial Day.

All of this energy associated with aforementioned upper trough
crossing the Intermountain West will be ejecting east out across
the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest going through the
remainder of the Memorial Day weekend holiday, and this will yield
a concern for areas of severe weather. Multiple rounds of heavy
showers and thunderstorms are expected across the region, and the
Storm Prediction Center has highlighted an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms across parts of the central and northern Plains, and
the Upper Mississippi Valley today and Monday. Some thunderstorms
are expected to produce large hail, damaging winds, and a few
tornadoes.

Temperatures across the central and southern Plains will be quite
hot ahead of these cold fronts crossing the West with high
temperatures today reaching well into the 90s and locally
exceeding 100 degrees. The heat will begin to break down a bit for
Memorial Day as the fronts begin crossing the Plains. However, the
very warm to hot conditions more broadly across the southern High
Plains, southern Rockies and Southwest for today and Monday will
also maintain elevated to critical fire weather concerns. This
will be driven largely by low relative humidities and gusty winds.
Some improvement is expected though by Tuesday as cooler
temperatures arrive from the north behind a cold frontal passage.

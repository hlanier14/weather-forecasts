Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1154 AM CDT Fri Jun 25 2021

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

An isolated dry thunderstorm area was added to portions of the
eastern Great Basin/Four Corners area for this afternoon into early
evening. The latest guidance consensus shows a slightly higher
concentration of thunderstorms, warranting the addition of an
isolated dry thunderstorm delineation when considering the
critically dry fuels. While storms may be wet (given 0.75 inch
precipitable water values) and move slowly, the highly receptive
fuels may overcompensate to support efficient ignitions. Otherwise,
the forecast remains on track across central into eastern New
Mexico, with locally Elevated/Critical surface winds/RH still
expected during the afternoon hours.

..Squitieri.. 06/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Fri Jun 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
An amplified upper ridge will build along the West Coast today,
bringing extremely warm conditions to much of the West. To the east,
a weak trough will transit the Rockies and central High Plains.
Lingering moisture will support shower and thunderstorm activity
across the Great Basin, while locally elevated fire weather
conditions develop across New Mexico.

...Eastern New Mexico...
A belt of stronger mid-level westerlies near the base of the central
Rockies trough will overspread New Mexico and far west Texas through
the day. Momentum transfer to the surface from deep vertical mixing
will bolster surface winds to 15-20 mph. Warm temperatures in the
90s F will support widespread surface relative humidity values below
15%. Fuels across the area are not overly dry, suggesting only
locally elevated/critical fire weather conditions may develop across
portions of eastern New Mexico.

...Great Basin...
Similar to the last several days, diurnal thunderstorm activity is
expected across much of the Southwest and Great Basin. PWAT values
near 0.75 inches and slow storm speeds will favor wet storms with
limited potential for dry strikes. However, fuels in the region
remain volatile, and any lightning may result in ignitions. As such,
a few dry strikes appear possible. However, the coverage of dry
thunder will likely be below the threshold needed for an isolated
dry thunder delineation.

Valid 12Z Mon Jun 28 2021 - 12Z Fri Jul 02 2021

...Historic and Dangerous Heat Wave with monthly/all-time record
temperatures probable over the Northwest/West...
...Anomalous heat for New England Monday into Wednesday...
...Persistent Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern
Rockies/Plains to Ohio Valley and eventually the Northeast...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Models and ensemble continue to advertise a highly anomalous upper
ridge to reach peak intensity over the Pacific Northwest early
next week while a compact upper low in the Pacific is forecast to
move toward the northern coast of California before opening up.
All models agree that the upper ridge will then gradually
weaken/flop over across southern Canada toward the latter half of
next week as the compact upper low lifts northward and edges into
the Pacific Northwest as an open wave.

An amplifying positively-tilted trough with an embedded closed
center moves little across the Midwest, Plains, into the Great
Lakes during this period due to the orientation of the upstream
ridge -- thought the 00z ECMWF was too far east with this feature
and that the 06z GFS/weaker form of the 00z Canadian was a better
way to go, model wise.  A broad and persistent southerly flow will
direct tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward through
the Deep South and interact with a slow-moving frontal boundary
across the mid-section of the country.

Downstream, this leads to an anomalously north and strong
subtropical ridge off the East coast, which leads to anomalous
heat in Maine/New England and the possibility of a tropical
wave/low to move westward from south of Bermuda to reach the
southeast U.S. coast during the early part of next week.  The
pressures, 500 hPa heights, and winds were comprised of a blend of

increasing ensemble mean inclusion mid to late next week.  The
remainder of the grids showed a more even blend of deterministic
and ensemble mean guidance through the period, as always.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
A highly anomalous upper ridge is forecast to reach peak intensity
over the Northwest early next week before showing signs of
weakening later next week.  Temperatures will soar to 20-30
degrees above normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great
Basin/Rockies.  Numerous daily and monthly high temperature
records -- including for the states of WA, OR, and ID -- are
likely to be tied or broken from the Pacific Northwest and
interior California to the north/central Great Basin and northern
Rockies, where temperatures peaking between 100F and the upper
110sF are forecast for the lower elevations.  All-time record
highs are probable across portions of OR and WA.  Little rainfall
is expected to ease this excessive heat in a pattern with growing
drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough will dig and settle
into the north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and
slow moving front to stretch from the southern Plains to the
northeastern U.S. through the medium-range period.  This will
invite deep moisture to continue streaming in from the Gulf of
Mexico.  Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the
front with an elongated and focused zone from the southern
Rockies/Plains northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio
Valley and the Northeast -- drought conditions across the Upper
Midwest and Great Lakes in particular should ease if not be
outright eliminated over the next week.  Episodes of cell training
and flooding are likely across some of these areas with overall
progression slowed by the blocky synoptic pattern sandwiched
between the heat wave out West and a strong western Atlantic ridge
to the east.

Under the northward displaced Bermuda High, a heat wave appears to
develop and persist from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic where
afternoon temperatures are forecast to peak well into the 90s away
from the immediate coasts during next week.  The hottest days/most
anomalous readings will be across New England from days 3-5/Monday
through Wednesday next week before a front slips southward and
rain increases in coverage and intensity.  Last but not least,
tropical moisture/disturbances should move from the Atlantic into
FL/the Southeast underneath the displaced Bermuda High to fuel
convection next week.

...Historic and Dangerous Heat Wave with monthly/all-time record
temperatures probable over the Northwest/West...
...Anomalous heat for New England Monday into Wednesday...
...Persistent Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern
Rockies/Plains to Ohio Valley and eventually the Northeast...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Models and ensemble continue to advertise a highly anomalous upper
ridge to reach peak intensity over the Pacific Northwest early
next week while a compact upper low in the Pacific is forecast to
move toward the northern coast of California before opening up.
All models agree that the upper ridge will then gradually
weaken/flop over across southern Canada toward the latter half of
next week as the compact upper low lifts northward and edges into
the Pacific Northwest as an open wave.

An amplifying positively-tilted trough with an embedded closed
center moves little across the Midwest, Plains, into the Great
Lakes during this period due to the orientation of the upstream
ridge -- thought the 00z ECMWF was too far east with this feature
and that the 06z GFS/weaker form of the 00z Canadian was a better
way to go, model wise.  A broad and persistent southerly flow will
direct tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward through
the Deep South and interact with a slow-moving frontal boundary
across the mid-section of the country.

Downstream, this leads to an anomalously north and strong
subtropical ridge off the East coast, which leads to anomalous
heat in Maine/New England and the possibility of a tropical
wave/low to move westward from south of Bermuda to reach the
southeast U.S. coast during the early part of next week.  The
pressures, 500 hPa heights, and winds were comprised of a blend of
the 06z GFS/00z Canadian/00z UKMET/00z ECMWF early on before
increasing ensemble mean inclusion mid to late next week.  The
remainder of the grids showed a more even blend of deterministic
and ensemble mean guidance through the period, as always.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 25 2021

SYNOPSIS: Excessive heat is likely to be ongoing across much of the western
contiguous U.S. associated with anomalous mid-level high pressure over the
region. This feature is forecast to weaken by the middle of the period,
possibly bringing some respite to heat concerns, although there are
indications
that the highest positive temperature anomalies may become positioned acros=
s
the north-central U.S. by the end of week-2. A cold front may stall across =
the
Lower Mississippi Valley region early in the period, becoming a focal point
for
heavy rain across parts of the Southern Plains extending through the Tennes=
see
and Ohio Valleys. Mid-level low pressure over the Bering Sea is forecast to
lead to elevated chances for below normal temperatures across Alaska due in
part due to increased cloud cover and rainfall, especially along the southe=
rn
Mainland coast.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Great Basin, North=
ern
Rockies, and Northern High Plains, Sat-Mon, July 3-5.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Pacific Northwest,
Northern
California, Great Basin, Northern and Central Rockies, Northern Plains, and
Upper Mississippi Valley, Sat-Wed, July 3-7.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the West and portions of the
Northern
and Central Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley, Sat-Fri, July 3-9.

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Southern Plains, Middle and
Lower
Mississippi Valley, and the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Sat-Wed, July 3-7.

Flooding possible across southwestern Arizona and southern New Mexico.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY JUNE 28 - FRIDAY JULY 02:

-Vt-n7GIEk9$

FOR SATURDAY JULY 03 - FRIDAY JULY 09: The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensembles consistently show 500-hPa height anomalies of +120-180 meters ove=
r
the northwestern CONUS at the beginning of week-2, in line with ongoing
excessive heat. A high risk of excessive heat is continued for parts of the
Northern Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Northern High Plains on July 3r=
d
through the 5th. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least=
 a
60% chance of daily high temperatures exceeding the 85th climatological
percentile on the 3rd and 4th. By the 5th, temperature anomalies appear to
decrease somewhat, but above normal temperatures remain likely over the
region.
Given the prolonged nature of the heat wave, and continued lingering health
impacts that remain likely even after the most extreme heat passes, the hig=
h
risk is extended another day through the 5th. The high risk region also ali=
gns
well with the National Blend of Models forecast anticipating daily highs
approaching or surpassing record temperatures. Across lower elevations with=
in
the high risk area, daytime highs are likely to be in the triple digits, wh=
ile
higher elevations could still experience temperatures reaching the mid 90s.



By the middle of week-2, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict a lowerin=
g
of
the 500-hPa heights across the western CONUS, with increasing positive heig=
ht
anomalies becoming more favored across the Northern Plains by the end of th=
e
period. A moderate risk of excessive heat is highlighted for areas east of =
the
Pacific Intercoastal range from the Olympic Peninsula southward through
northern California, and extends eastward through parts of the Northern and
Central Rockies, Northern Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley on July 3-7.
The
moderate risk area coincides with where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
show at least a 40% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
climatological percentile over parts of the highlighted region. Uncalibrate=
d
guidance from the GEFS depicts increased potential for triple digit heat ov=
er
the Northern Plains by the middle of week-2, with the ongoing exceptional
drought conditions over the area likely playing a role in exacerbating the
heat.



The reforecast tools maintain at least a 20% chance that maximum temperatur=
es
exceed the 85th climatological percentile across much of the West and
north-central CONUS for all of week-2, justifying the continued slight risk
for
excessive heat. There are indications that this heat may persist into week-=
3
as
well, and for more information, please refer to the latest CPC week 3-4
outlook. Heat-driven impacts are expected to include: persistence and
worsening
of ongoing drought over the West, continued emergence of flash drought over
the
north-central CONUS, locally elevated fire weather conditions amidst the ho=
t
and dry air mass for much of the West, and direct health risks for people,
pets
and livestock across the highlighted regions. Heat remains the top
weather-related killer in the U.S., so consider reviewing the National Weat=
her
Service's heat safety page to help beat the heat:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat__;!!DZ3fjg!=
qoacDHg9xQoM8XbWTnBDz7yOZ4lbYhvKlrzHwmdxY36pU7UensP8tBKIiUDfB-Vt-jpub_E4$ .



Mid-level heights show a weakness across the southern tier of the CONUS,
potentially opening up the south-central and eastern portions of the Lower-=
48
to heavy rain concerns. The Weather Prediction Center surface analysis on
day-7
(July 2) shows a cold front extending from the Ohio Valley though the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southern Plains. Model guidance shows the potential =
for
this cold front to stall and interact with Gulf moisture through the middle
part of week-2. As a result, a slight risk for heavy rain is posted across
parts of the Southern Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, and the
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys on July 3-7. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
both indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the
85th
climatological percentile across much of the highlighted region, and over 1
inch in the uncalibrated ECMWF guidance. Soil moisture observations for thi=
s
region are generally in the 70th through 90th historical percentile, so
localized flooding could occur but is not anticipated to be widespread enou=
gh
to include a possible flood risk.



Tropical cyclone activity over the East Pacific has been conditioning the
monsoonal region for what is hopefully a robust southwest monsoon year to h=
elp
with the ongoing drought. Tropical storm Dolores brought some moisture to t=
he
region last week, while model guidance suggests a possible moisture surge u=
p
the Gulf of California during week-2 associated with Tropical Storm Enrique
off
the southern Coast of Mexico. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
indicate
at least a 20% chance that 3-day rainfall totals exceed a half inch across
southern portions of Arizona and New Mexico. While these are not substantia=
l
totals from a hazards perspective, the risk of sudden convective episodes o=
f
rainfall could result in localized flash flooding. Flooding can occur even =
in
areas where rain does not fall given the potential for enhanced runoff acro=
ss
mountainous terrain and into the valleys. As a result, a flooding possible
hazard is highlighted across southeastern Arizona and southern New Mexico.



At the onset of week-2, the ECMWF and GEFS ensembles depict mid-level
troughing
across the Bering Sea and ridging over the western CONUS extending through =
the
Yukon. The progression of the trough further inland across Alaska and the
subsequent weakening of the ridge favors increased cloud cover and anomalou=
sly
cool conditions overspreading much of Alaska. Enhanced southerly flow may
bring
increased rain chances to the southern Mainland coast, especially early in =
the
period, but there are no indications of precipitation reaching pre-defined
hazards criteria.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri June 25 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 01 - 05 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical model solutions forecast an amplified circulatio=
n
pattern with a trough and negative 500-hPa height anomalies over the North
Pacific, centered over the Aleutians, and a ridge and positive 500-hPa heig=
ht
anomalies over the eastern North Pacific and western North America.
Downstream,
a trough with negative 500-hPa height anomalies is predicted over the
east-central CONUS.

Above normal temperatures are likely over the western CONUS, the Northern
Plains, the Northeast and the southern Florida Peninsula as well as the Ala=
ska
Panhandle, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies and consistent with the =
ERF
consolidation forecast tool. A predicted trough over the east-central CONUS
and
below normal 500-hPa height anomalies favor enhanced probabilities of below
normal temperatures for eastern areas of the Southwest, the Central and
Southern Plains, most of the Mississippi and  Ohio Valleys, and the Southea=
st.
Near to below normal temperatures are favored over much of Mainland Alaska =
and
eastern Aleutians, due to the predicted trough over the Aleutians and
associated potential storm system development and increased cloud cover.

A predicted ridge and anomalous northerly flow increase probabilities of be=
low
normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Plains, and mo=
st
of the Great Lakes region. A predicted trough over the east-central CONUS a=
nd
anomalous southerly surface flow around high pressure over the Atlantic fav=
or
above normal precipitation from the Southern Plains northeastward across mo=
st
of the eastern CONUS, excluding the southern Florida Peninsula, where below
normal precipitation is indicated, consistent with the ERF consolidation
forecast tool. Above normal precipitation is favored for much of the
Southwest,
due to enhanced surface moisture flow into the region and supported by the
ECMWF and GEFS forecasts. A predicted trough over the Aleutians and anomalo=
us
southerly flow enhance probabilities of above normal precipitation over the
eastern Aleutians, western and central Mainland Alaska. Near to below norma=
l
precipitation is favored for eastern areas of Mainland Alaska and the Alask=
a
Panhandle, under a predicted ridge.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5=
,
due to good agreement among the model circulation forecasts, and among the
temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 03 - 09 2021

During the week 2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, as ensemble sprea=
d
and uncertainty increasing. In particular the trough over the Aleutians
deamplifies and shifts northeastward to be centered over Mainland Alaska
during
the week 2 period.

Above normal temperatures remain likely for the western CONUS, the Northern
Plains,  most of the Great Lakes region, and the Northeast, under positive
500-hPa height anomalies. Near to below normal temperatures are favored ove=
r
most of the remainder of the CONUS, from eastern areas of the Southwest
monsoon
region across the Southern Plains and Central and Lower Mississippi Valley
into
the Southeast region, under the predicted trough and near zero 500-hPa heig=
ht
anomalies. Above normal temperatures are  favored for the central and south=
ern
Florida Peninsula, supported by dynamical model forecasts. Near to below
normal
temperatures are favored for most of Alaska, associated with the trough  an=
d
potential development of storm systems leading to increased cloud cover.

Probabilities of above normal precipitation are enhanced over Mainland Alas=
ka
and the eastern Aleutians due to the predicted trough. Below normal
precipitation is likely for the Alaska Panhandle, the Pacific Northwest,
Northern Plains, and western Great Lakes region, associated with the
predicted
ridging over the eastern North Pacific and western North America. Above nor=
mal
precipitation is favored from the Southern Plains and western Gulf Coast
northeastward across much of the eastern CONUS, except for the Florida
Peninsula and parts of the Mid-Atlantic Coast, where are likely to be drier=
,
consistent with the ERF consolidation tool. Near to above normal precipitat=
ion
is favored in week 2 across most of the southwestern CONUS, supported by
dynamical model forecasts.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 45% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts and temperature forecast
tools, offset by increasing uncertainty and differences among the
precipitation
forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 25 2021

SYNOPSIS: Excessive heat is likely to be ongoing across much of the western
contiguous U.S. associated with anomalous mid-level high pressure over the
region. This feature is forecast to weaken by the middle of the period,
possibly bringing some respite to heat concerns, although there are
indications
that the highest positive temperature anomalies may become positioned acros=
s
the north-central U.S. by the end of week-2. A cold front may stall across =
the
Lower Mississippi Valley region early in the period, becoming a focal point
for
heavy rain across parts of the Southern Plains extending through the Tennes=
see
and Ohio Valleys. Mid-level low pressure over the Bering Sea is forecast to
lead to elevated chances for below normal temperatures across Alaska due in
part due to increased cloud cover and rainfall, especially along the southe=
rn
Mainland coast.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Great Basin, North=
ern
Rockies, and Northern High Plains, Sat-Mon, July 3-5.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Pacific Northwest,
Northern
California, Great Basin, Northern and Central Rockies, Northern Plains, and
Upper Mississippi Valley, Sat-Wed, July 3-7.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the West and portions of the
Northern
and Central Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley, Sat-Fri, July 3-9.

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Southern Plains, Middle and
Lower
Mississippi Valley, and the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Sat-Wed, July 3-7.

Flooding possible across southeastern Arizona and southern New Mexico.

ehmBQxmIWoH$

FOR SATURDAY JULY 03 - FRIDAY JULY 09: The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensembles consistently show 500-hPa height anomalies of +120-180 meters ove=
r
the northwestern CONUS at the beginning of week-2, in line with ongoing
excessive heat. A high risk of excessive heat is continued for parts of the
Northern Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Northern High Plains on July 3r=
d
through the 5th. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least=
 a
60% chance of daily high temperatures exceeding the 85th climatological
percentile on the 3rd and 4th. By the 5th, temperature anomalies appear to
decrease somewhat, but above normal temperatures remain likely over the
region.
Given the prolonged nature of the heat wave, and continued lingering health
impacts that remain likely even after the most extreme heat passes, the hig=
h
risk is extended another day through the 5th. The high risk region also ali=
gns
well with the National Blend of Models forecast anticipating daily highs
approaching or surpassing record temperatures. Across lower elevations with=
in
the high risk area, daytime highs are likely to be in the triple digits, wh=
ile
higher elevations could still experience temperatures reaching the mid 90s.



By the middle of week-2, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict a lowerin=
g
of
the 500-hPa heights across the western CONUS, with increasing positive heig=
ht
anomalies becoming more favored across the Northern Plains by the end of th=
e
period. A moderate risk of excessive heat is highlighted for areas east of =
the
Pacific Intercoastal range from the Olympic Peninsula southward through
northern California, and extends eastward through parts of the Northern and
Central Rockies, Northern Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley on July 3-7.
The
moderate risk area coincides with where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
show at least a 40% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
climatological percentile over parts of the highlighted region. Uncalibrate=
d
guidance from the GEFS depicts increased potential for triple digit heat ov=
er
the Northern Plains by the middle of week-2, with the ongoing exceptional
drought conditions over the area likely playing a role in exacerbating the
heat.



The reforecast tools maintain at least a 20% chance that maximum temperatur=
es
exceed the 85th climatological percentile across much of the West and
north-central CONUS for all of week-2, justifying the continued slight risk
for
excessive heat. There are indications that this heat may persist into week-=
3
as
well, and for more information, please refer to the latest CPC week 3-4
outlook. Heat-driven impacts are expected to include: persistence and
worsening
of ongoing drought over the West, continued emergence of flash drought over
the
north-central CONUS, locally elevated fire weather conditions amidst the ho=
t
and dry air mass for much of the West, and direct health risks for people,
pets
and livestock across the highlighted regions. Heat remains the top
weather-related killer in the U.S., so consider reviewing the National Weat=
her
Service's heat safety page to help beat the heat:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat__;!!DZ3fjg!=
rH8FjeyS4XyDI3QOLwCLh_AiVs8ERyf91ybWJy_YMPkpa9k5oK4klYLGbNIMyehmBduOj8ES$ .



Mid-level heights show a weakness across the southern tier of the CONUS,
potentially opening up the south-central and eastern portions of the Lower-=
48
to heavy rain concerns. The Weather Prediction Center surface analysis on
day-7
(July 2) shows a cold front extending from the Ohio Valley though the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southern Plains. Model guidance shows the potential =
for
this cold front to stall and interact with Gulf moisture through the middle
part of week-2. As a result, a slight risk for heavy rain is posted across
parts of the Southern Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, and the
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys on July 3-7. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
both indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the
85th
climatological percentile across much of the highlighted region, and over 1
inch in the uncalibrated ECMWF guidance. Soil moisture observations for thi=
s
region are generally in the 70th through 90th historical percentile, so
localized flooding could occur but is not anticipated to be widespread enou=
gh
to include a possible flood risk.



Tropical cyclone activity over the East Pacific has been conditioning the
monsoonal region for what is hopefully a robust southwest monsoon year to h=
elp
with the ongoing drought. Tropical storm Dolores brought some moisture to t=
he
region last week, while model guidance suggests a possible moisture surge u=
p
the Gulf of California during week-2 associated with Tropical Storm Enrique
off
the southern Coast of Mexico. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
indicate
at least a 20% chance that 3-day rainfall totals exceed a half inch across
southern portions of Arizona and New Mexico. While these are not substantia=
l
totals from a hazards perspective, the risk of sudden convective episodes o=
f
rainfall could result in localized flash flooding. Flooding can occur even =
in
areas where rain does not fall given the potential for enhanced runoff acro=
ss
mountainous terrain and into the valleys. As a result, a flooding possible
hazard is highlighted across southeastern Arizona and southern New Mexico.



At the onset of week-2, the ECMWF and GEFS ensembles depict mid-level
troughing
across the Bering Sea and ridging over the western CONUS extending through =
the
Yukon. The progression of the trough further inland across Alaska and the
subsequent weakening of the ridge favors increased cloud cover and anomalou=
sly
cool conditions overspreading much of Alaska. Enhanced southerly flow may
bring
increased rain chances to the southern Mainland coast, especially early in =
the
period, but there are no indications of precipitation reaching pre-defined
hazards criteria.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Fri Jun 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

An isolated dry thunderstorm area was added to portions of the Four
Corners for Saturday afternoon. Mid-level moisture will slowly
meander westward across portions of the Lower Colorado River Valley
area, atop a dry sub-cloud layer extending up to 500 mb. Strong
diurnal heating/mixing within the sub-cloud layer will support
isolated, high-based thunderstorm development along the periphery of
deeper mid-level moisture, where 0.50-0.75 precipitable water values
are expected. Despite slow storm speeds and relatively low storm
coverage, fuels are very receptive to wildfire-spread, with the very
dry fuels serving as the primary motivator for the isolated dry
thunderstorm area addition.

Otherwise, locally dry and breezy conditions may still occur across
terrain favoring areas from the Cascades south-southeastward into
parts of the Lower Colorado River Valley given the presence of
thermally induced surface lee troughing. Latest guidance consensus
suggests that portions of the Columbia River Basin in southeast
Washington, as well as parts of western Utah, have the best chance
at seeing Elevated conditions tomorrow afternoon. Elevated
highlights may be added in future outlooks if later guidance trends
any windier/drier in these areas.

..Squitieri.. 06/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Fri Jun 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong blocking ridge will envelop the West Coast to start the
weekend, bringing record hot and dry conditions to much of the West.
The hot, dry, and unstable environment will support plume-dominated
fire conditions where recent lightning activity has occurred.
Mid-level troughing across the center of the country will support
widespread precipitation, limiting the potential for widespread
critical fire weather activity.

...Northern West Coast...
Beneath a 594 dm ridge, surface temperatures will soar to near
record values from the Pacific Northwest to northern California.
Daytime highs in excess of 100F will be common, supporting very dry
and unstable conditions across much of the West. Plume-dominated
fire activity appears likely given unstable surface conditions and a
deep and well mixed boundary layer. A thermally induced surface
pressure trough may also enhance surface winds to near 15 mph,
supporting locally elevated/critical fire weather conditions through
the forecast period.

...Historic and Dangerous Heat Wave with monthly/all-time record
temperatures probable over the Northwest/West...
...Anomalous heat for New England Monday into Wednesday...
...Persistent Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern
Rockies/Plains to Ohio Valley and eventually the Northeast...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Models and ensemble continue to advertise a highly anomalous upper
ridge to reach peak intensity over the Pacific Northwest early
next week while a compact upper low in the Pacific is forecast to
move toward the northern coast of California before opening up.
All models agree that the upper ridge will then gradually
weaken/flop over across southern Canada toward the latter half of
next week as the compact upper low lifts northward and edges into
the Pacific Northwest as an open wave.

An amplifying positively-tilted trough with an embedded closed
center moves little across the Midwest, Plains, into the Great
Lakes during this period due to the orientation of the upstream
ridge -- thought the 00z ECMWF was too far east with this feature
and that the 06z GFS/weaker form of the 00z Canadian was a better
way to go, model wise.  A broad and persistent southerly flow will
direct tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward through
the Deep South and interact with a slow-moving frontal boundary
across the mid-section of the country.

Downstream, this leads to an anomalously north and strong
subtropical ridge off the East coast, which leads to anomalous
heat in Maine/New England and the possibility of a tropical
wave/low to move westward from south of Bermuda to reach the
southeast U.S. coast during the early part of next week.  The
pressures, 500 hPa heights, and winds were comprised of a blend of
the 06z GFS/00z Canadian/00z UKMET/00z ECMWF early on before
increasing ensemble mean inclusion mid to late next week.  The
remainder of the grids showed a more even blend of deterministic
and ensemble mean guidance through the period, as always.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
A highly anomalous upper ridge is forecast to reach peak intensity
over the Northwest early next week before showing signs of
weakening later next week.  Temperatures will soar to 20-30
degrees above normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great
Basin/Rockies.  Numerous daily and monthly high temperature
records -- including for the states of WA, OR, and ID -- are
likely to be tied or broken from the Pacific Northwest and
interior California to the north/central Great Basin and northern
Rockies, where temperatures peaking between 100F and the upper
110sF are forecast for the lower elevations.  All-time record
highs are probable across portions of OR and WA.  Little rainfall
is expected to ease this excessive heat in a pattern with growing
drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough will dig and settle
into the north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and
slow moving front to stretch from the southern Plains to the
northeastern U.S. through the medium-range period.  This will
invite deep moisture to continue streaming in from the Gulf of
Mexico.  Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the
front with an elongated and focused zone from the southern
Rockies/Plains northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio
Valley and the Northeast -- drought conditions across the Upper
Midwest and Great Lakes in particular should ease if not be
outright eliminated over the next week.  Episodes of cell training
and flooding are likely across some of these areas with overall
progression slowed by the blocky synoptic pattern sandwiched
between the heat wave out West and a strong western Atlantic ridge
to the east.

Under the northward displaced Bermuda High, a heat wave appears to
develop and persist from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic where
afternoon temperatures are forecast to peak well into the 90s away
from the immediate coasts during next week.  The hottest days/most
anomalous readings will be across New England from days 3-5/Monday
through Wednesday next week before a front slips southward and
rain increases in coverage and intensity.  Last but not least,
tropical moisture/disturbances should move from the Atlantic into
FL/the Southeast underneath the displaced Bermuda High to fuel
convection next week.

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat wave likely throughout the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Great Basin this weekend...

...Multiple rounds of showers and potentially severe thunderstorms
anticipated between the Central/Southern Plains and Great Lakes,
generating a significant flash flooding concern that will abate as
the weekend progresses...

Today marks the beginning of what is expected to be a multi-day
extreme heat event across the northwestern United States. An
anomalously strong upper-level ridge has settled into its new home
over British Columbia, Canada where it is forecast to strengthen
over the next few days as it remains virtually motionless, held in
place by an Omega blocking pattern. Egged on by the persistent
ridging and with no precipitation or cold fronts in sight to keep
temperatures in check, daily highs are anticipated to rise
progressively throughout the weekend into record-breaking
territory. High temperatures throughout much of Oregon and
Washington will likely soar 20 to 30 degrees above normal into
triple digits, holding steady well into next week. Numerous
temperature records are slated to fall throughout the course of
this event, with some monthly and even the all-time records for
Washington, Oregon, and Idaho in the cross hairs. Excessive Heat
Warnings have been issued for much of Washington, Oregon, and
Idaho as well as northern California in preparation for the
dangerously hot conditions to come. Excessive Heat Watches have
also been put into effect for portions of central and southern
California, western Nevada, and south-central Idaho. It is worth
noting here that heat is the leading cause of weather-related
fatalities over a 30-year average from 1991-2020. As such,
residents are urged to take the proper precautions to deal with
the upcoming extreme conditions by staying hydrated, avoiding long
periods of time outdoors, and remaining in air-conditioned rooms.
Furthermore, with overnight temperatures remaining in the 70s
throughout the duration of the event and thus providing little
relief from the heat, heat stress and heat related illness will
also be major concerns.

Looking east, active weather is set to be found across the central
U.S. for much of the weekend. A quasi-stationary front is forecast
to extend from the Great Lakes to the Central/Southern Plains
throughout much of the short-range period and be the focus for
multiple rounds of heavy rain and thunderstorms. Given the stalled
frontal boundary, sufficient atmospheric moisture, and the
slow-moving nature of thunderstorms in the area, flash flooding
will be a major concern from southeast Kansas to west-central
Indiana through Saturday morning. Thunderstorms have already led
to significant flash flooding and over 10 inches of rain in far
northeast Kansas and northwest Missouri. Moving in concert with
the southward progression of the front, the greatest flash
flooding threat will slowly push southward overnight into the
Southern Plains. The Weather Prediction Center has issued a
Moderate Risk for Excessive Rainfall through Sunday morning that
covers parts of the Central/Southern Plains, Middle Mississippi
Valley, and western Ohio Valley in anticipation of the heavy
rainfall rates and high accumulation totals that are expected to
occur over the next couple of days. Flash Flood Watches have been
posted from the Southern Plains through the Great Lakes, while
Flood Warnings have been issued for portions of the Middle
Mississippi Valley.

In addition to flash flooding, severe weather will be another
hazard to look out for along the active frontal boundary through
Sunday morning. A Slight Risk for severe thunderstorms has been
issued by the Storm Prediction Center for an area encompassing the
central/southern High Plains to Illinois and a smaller area
covering portions of Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. Isolated
tornadoes, damaging winds gusts, and large hail are all a
possibility as storms form and strengthen along the stalled
frontal boundary this afternoon/evening. By Saturday, the severe
weather threat is forecast to shift southward and into the
southern High Plains as the western edge of the front pushes south.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Sat Jun 26 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level blocking pattern will continue to take hold across the
western United States on Saturday, bringing hot and dry conditions
to much of the area, including potentially record temperatures to
portions of the Pacific Northwest. This block will be anchored by a
strong mid-level anticyclone centered over Vancouver Island, Canada.
Beneath this anticyclone, hot/dry conditions and steep low-level
lapse rates will support plume-dominated fire conditions across much
of the West.

Farther east, downstream of the ridge, mid-level troughing will
support seasonably cool and wet conditions across much of the
central United States, limiting the overall critical fire weather
potential.

... Four Corners Area ...

The potential exists for isolated dry thunderstorms to develop
across the region as strong diurnal heating and modest mid-level
moisture combine with favored terrain areas to support convective
initiation. Meager low-level moisture and strong sub-cloud layer
mixing will result in high-based thunderstorms that will struggle to
produce wetting rains.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Sat Jun 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level high will slowly move east into western Canada on
Sunday, with the associated ridge axis progressing farther east into
the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, a seasonably strong mid-level
low will begin to move northward along the western periphery of the
aforementioned ridge. The net result of this interaction will be
sustained easterly flow across much of the lower troposphere.

Farther east, continued troughing across the central United States
should result in seasonably cool and wet conditions and limited
critical fire weather potential.

... Pacific Northwest ...

As the aforementioned mid-level ridge moves east and the mid-level
trough approaches, a surface trough will develop along the immediate
coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest. This will result in an
increasing surface-pressure gradient and a corresponding increase in
surface wind speeds. This increase in surface winds will coincide
with extremely hot temperatures -- potentially record setting in
some areas -- and a very dry boundary layer to support elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions. Additionally, given the
unstable lower troposphere across the region, conditions will
support plume-dominated fire concerns as well.

... Eastern Arizona northward into the Four Corners area ...

Strong diurnal heating may result in a few thunderstorms across the
area, with chances increasing to the east. Although mid-level
moisture is expected to be slightly greater on Sunday as compared to
Saturday, increasing 700-500 millibar northerly flow may allow for
storm speeds to be greater than on Saturday. The combination of
potentially faster storm speeds and a continued dry/well-mixed
sub-cloud layer will maintain support for isolated dry
thunderstorms.

This area will likely need to be adjusted in subsequent forecasts as
confidence in the location and speed of thunderstorm activity
increases.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 AM EDT Sat Jun 26 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Jun 29 2021 - 12Z Sat Jul 03 2021

...Historic and Dangerous Heat Wave with monthly/all-time record
temperatures probable over the Northwest/West...
...Anomalous heat for New England into Wednesday...
...Persistent Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern
Rockies/Plains to the Midwest and later into the Ohio Valley...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Models and ensembles agree that a highly anomalous upper ridge
over the Pacific Northwest will begin to weaken by around Tuesday
as a compact upper low just offshore is forecast to lift northward
as an open wave and edge closer toward the Pacific Northwest
coast.  The ECMWF and CMC have been slower than the GFS regarding
the forward motion of the upper low.  The 18Z and 00Z GFS runs
have slowed down the upper low to agree much better with the ECMWF
and CMC.  By later next week, models generally show the weakened
upper ridge will drift further inland across the northern Rockies
into the northern High Plains but with still impressive strength.

Across the northern tier states, a positively-tilted trough will
likely drift very slowly eastward with increasing model agreement
for a closed center to form over the Great Lakes toward the end of
next week.  Meanwhile, a broad and persistent southerly flow will
direct tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward through
the Deep South and interact with a slow-moving frontal boundary
across the mid-section of the country.  Downstream, this leads to
an anomalously strong subtropical ridge off the East Coast to
extend northward into the Canadian Maritimes.  A heat wave is
forecast for much of New England into the Mid-Atlantic into the
middle of next week before cooler air associate with the upper
trough filters into the region later next week.

Meanwhile, models continue to indicate the possibility of a
tropical wave/low to move westward from south of Bermuda to reach
the southeast U.S. coast during the early part of next week.

The pressures, 500 hPa heights, and winds were comprised of the
18Z GFS/GEFS, the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, together with smaller
contributions from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean.  A more even blend of
deterministic and ensemble mean guidance was adopted early on
before increasing ensemble mean inclusion mid to late next week to
handle the uncertainty.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
A highly anomalous upper ridge at peak intensity over the
Northwest early next week is forecast to weaken slowly later next
week.  Temperatures will soar to 20 to locally more than 30
degrees above normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great
Basin/Rockies.  Numerous daily and monthly high temperature
records -- including for the states of WA, OR, and ID -- are
likely to be tied or broken from the Pacific Northwest and
interior California to the north/central Great Basin and northern
Rockies, where temperatures peaking between 100F and the upper
110sF are forecast for the lower elevations.  All-time record
highs are probable across portions of OR and WA.  Little rainfall
is expected to ease this prolonged excessive heat in a pattern
with growing drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. through the medium-range period.  Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms which will significantly increase rainfall and runoff
potential along and ahead of the front with an elongated and
focused zone from the southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across
the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast.  Drought
conditions across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes in particular
should ease if not be outright eliminated over the next week.
Episodes of cell training and flooding are likely across some of
these areas with overall progression slowed by the blocky synoptic
pattern sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a strong
western Atlantic ridge to the east.

Under the northward displaced Bermuda High, a heat wave appears to
persist into mid-week from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic where
afternoon temperatures are forecast to peak well into the 90s away
from the immediate coasts.  The hottest days/most anomalous
readings will be across New England from days 3-5/Monday through
Wednesday next week before a front slips southward and rain
increases in coverage and intensity.  Last but not least, tropical
moisture/disturbances should move from the Atlantic into FL/the
Southeast underneath the displaced Bermuda High to fuel convection
and some gusty winds early next week.

Valid 12Z Tue Jun 29 2021 - 12Z Sat Jul 03 2021

...Historic and Dangerous Heat Wave with monthly/all-time record
temperatures probable over the Northwest/West...
...Anomalous heat for New England into Wednesday...
...Persistent Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern
Rockies/Plains to the Midwest and later into the Ohio Valley...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Models and ensembles agree that a highly anomalous upper ridge
over the Pacific Northwest will begin to weaken by around Tuesday
as a compact upper low just offshore is forecast to lift northward
as an open wave and edge closer toward the Pacific Northwest
coast.  The ECMWF and CMC have been slower than the GFS regarding
the forward motion of the upper low.  The 18Z and 00Z GFS runs
have slowed down the upper low to agree much better with the ECMWF
and CMC.  By later next week, models generally show the weakened
upper ridge will drift further inland across the northern Rockies
into the northern High Plains but with still impressive strength.

Across the northern tier states, a positively-tilted trough will
likely drift very slowly eastward with increasing model agreement
for a closed center to form over the Great Lakes toward the end of
next week.  Meanwhile, a broad and persistent southerly flow will
direct tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward through
the Deep South and interact with a slow-moving frontal boundary
across the mid-section of the country.  Downstream, this leads to
an anomalously strong subtropical ridge off the East Coast to
extend northward into the Canadian Maritimes.  A heat wave is
forecast for much of New England into the Mid-Atlantic into the
middle of next week before cooler air associate with the upper
trough filters into the region later next week.

Meanwhile, models continue to indicate the possibility of a
tropical wave/low to move westward from south of Bermuda to reach
the southeast U.S. coast during the early part of next week.

The pressures, 500 hPa heights, and winds were comprised of the
18Z GFS/GEFS, the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, together with smaller
contributions from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean.  A more even blend of
deterministic and ensemble mean guidance was adopted early on
before increasing ensemble mean inclusion mid to late next week to
handle the uncertainty.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
A highly anomalous upper ridge at peak intensity over the
Northwest early next week is forecast to weaken slowly later next
week.  Temperatures will soar to 20 to locally more than 30
degrees above normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great
Basin/Rockies.  Numerous daily and monthly high temperature
records -- including for the states of WA, OR, and ID -- are
likely to be tied or broken from the Pacific Northwest and
interior California to the north/central Great Basin and northern
Rockies, where temperatures peaking between 100F and the upper
110sF are forecast for the lower elevations.  All-time record
highs are probable across portions of OR and WA.  Little rainfall
is expected to ease this prolonged excessive heat in a pattern
with growing drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. through the medium-range period.  Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms which will significantly increase rainfall and runoff
potential along and ahead of the front with an elongated and
focused zone from the southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across
the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast.  Drought
conditions across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes in particular
should ease if not be outright eliminated over the next week.
Episodes of cell training and flooding are likely across some of
these areas with overall progression slowed by the blocky synoptic
pattern sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a strong
western Atlantic ridge to the east.

Under the northward displaced Bermuda High, a heat wave appears to
persist into mid-week from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic where
afternoon temperatures are forecast to peak well into the 90s away
from the immediate coasts.  The hottest days/most anomalous
readings will be across New England from days 3-5/Monday through
Wednesday next week before a front slips southward and rain
increases in coverage and intensity.  Last but not least, tropical
moisture/disturbances should move from the Atlantic into FL/the
Southeast underneath the displaced Bermuda High to fuel convection
and some gusty winds early next week.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PART OF WESTERN AND NORTHWEST NEW
MEXICO AND NORTHEASTERN ARIZONA....

No changes are necessary. See previous forecast below.

..Bentley.. 04/27/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Wed Apr 27 2022/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel shortwave trough will deamplify as it tracks
northeastward across the Southwest. Enhanced west-southwesterly
midlevel flow accompanying the trough will overspread the
south-central Rockies, encouraging lee cyclogenesis over eastern CO
with a diffuse dryline extending southward across eastern NM.
Farther east, strong westerly midlevel flow on the backside of a
large-scale trough will cross the Mid-Atlantic states, where a dry
post-frontal airmass will be in place.

...Southwest into the Southern and Central High Plains...
Beneath gradually clearing high clouds, diurnal heating of a dry
antecedent airmass will favor deep boundary-layer mixing into the
enhanced west-southwesterly flow aloft behind the dryline. As a
result, RH in the single digits to lower/middle teens will develop
over the Southwest, while 15-25 percent RH is expected over the
central/southern High Plains. Over northeastern AZ and northwestern
NM, 20-25 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds (with
higher gusts) coupled with the dry/deeply-mixed boundary layer will
yield critical fire-weather conditions. Slightly weaker sustained
winds over the central and southern High Plains should support
elevated conditions, though locally critical conditions will be
possible over terrain-favored areas.

...Dry Thunderstorms - Central and Southern High Plains...
In the vicinity of the lee surface low and southward extending
dryline, isolated to widely scattered high-based thunderstorm
development is expected. Deep inverted-v profiles, PWs near 0.5
inches, and quick storm motions should favor dry thunderstorms with
limited rainfall. As these thunderstorms move over very dry fuels,
isolated lightning-induced ignitions will be possible -- especially
in the early stages of development. Gusty/erratic outflow winds
could also accompany the stronger thunderstorms.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Under mostly clear skies, efficient diurnal heating/mixing of a dry
post-frontal airmass could favor 25-30 percent minimum RH across the
Mid-Atlantic states -- where 15 mph sustained west-northwesterly
surface winds are forecast. This could result in locally elevated
conditions, though recent measurable rainfall across the region
should generally mitigate the fire-weather threat.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 27 2022

SYNOPSIS: During early week-2, there continues to be disagreement among the
dynamical models in regards to the mid-level height pattern contributing to
uncertainty and precluding the issuance of temperature related hazards over
the
Lower 48 in the outlook. Surface low formation favored over the Great Plain=
s
increases the risk for heavy precipitation across portions of the Great
Plains,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during the first few days of the
period. Over Alaska, prevailing southerly flow is favored to bring above-
normal
temperatures throughout much of the Mainland, which may lead to localized
flooding during the ice river breakup and snowmelt season across the state.


HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Great Plains,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Great Lakes, and the Appalachians,
Thu-Fri, May 5-6.

Slight risk of high winds across the Northern and Central Great Plains and
Rockies, Thu-Sun, May 5-8.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible for much of the Alaska Interior and Southcentral Mainland=
.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 30 - WEDNESDAY MAY 04:

PCW_LRe0BTpD8scLCzHkncd7EoLp8g$

FOR THURSDAY MAY 05 - WEDNESDAY MAY 11: During early week-2, there continue=
s
to
be discrepancies in this morning's 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensemble forecasts =
of
the mean 500-hPa height pattern over the CONUS. While both models are in
agreement featuring a fairly amplified trough over the northeastern Pacific=
,
differences are revealed in the evolution and strength of the mid-level
pattern
downstream over the CONUS. At the start of the period, the ECMWF generally
features a more amplified pattern with anomalous ridging overspreading many
parts of the CONUS and an embedded shortwave disturbance centered over the
Rockies. Conversely, the GEFS favors a more zonal pattern at the start of t=
he
period, but features a more rapid development of anomalous troughing over t=
he
northeastern U.S by late next week. These differences in the ensemble guida=
nce
still result in conflicting perspectives in regards to hazardous temperatur=
e
potential, precluding the designation of temperature hazards in today's
outlook.



Tied to the anomalous troughing favored in the GEFS over the northeastern
CONUS, the GEFS reforecast tool continues to indicate a fairly broad area
across the Great Plains and the Midwest with at least a 20% chance of minim=
um
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile during the first several day=
s
of
the period. This cold signal remains absent in the ECMWF reforecast tool ea=
rly
in the period, but does depict increasing chances for minimum temperatures
approaching hazard criteria farther to the north and east and closer to the
middle of the period. In light of these differences due to the timing and
location of the anomalous troughing favored aloft in the models, and in
consideration of a warming climatology heading further into May, no
corresponding temperature hazards are posted.  Across the southern tier of =
the
CONUS, above-normal temperatures are predominately favored by both the GEFS
and
ECMWF ensembles.  There is some agreement between the reforecast tools over
the
Southern High Plains with at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 degrees F which would support a slight
risk of much above-normal temperature during the middle of the period.
However,
daily maximum temperatures in the uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF guidance are =
not
markedly anomalous. Due to the aforementioned disagreements in the mid-leve=
l
pattern among the models, no corresponding temperature hazard for the regio=
n.
It should be noted that the combination of above (below)-normal temperature=
s
(precipitation) favored during week-2 over the Central and Southern Plains =
is
likely to worsen drought conditions and enhance wildfire risk throughout th=
e
region.



For precipitation, a surface low and accompanying frontal system remains
favored over the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley which could bring
enhanced, and possibly locally heavy precipitation across the central CONUS
early in the period. The ECMWF and Canadian continue to be more bullish tha=
n
the GEFS with this heavy precipitation potential in the uncalibrated ensemb=
le
guidance, and the ECMWF reforecast tool continues to depict increased chanc=
es
(>20%) for 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile and 1
inch, with increased signals in the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley compared to yesterday. Given better run-to-run continuity, and highe=
r
mean week-2 precipitation forecast consolidation weights in the ECMWF than =
the
GEFS over this portion of the country, a slight risk of heavy precipitation
remains posted for May 5-6, and is shifted farther south relative to
yesterday's outlook.



Upstream, there are increasing signs of additional surface low formation in
the
ensemble and deterministic guidance over the Northern Plains. As this
secondary
low is favored to deepen and shift south, the ECMWF reforecast tool shows a=
t
least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20mph
through the middle of the period. Thus, a broad slight risk area of high wi=
nds
is issued across the Northern and Central Great Plains and neighboring Rock=
ies
for May 5-8. A flooding possible hazard is also posted for many areas
surrounding the Red River of the North where there is ongoing snow melt and
flooding. With above-average precipitation favored during week-1, any
additional precipitation during the period may worsen already saturated gro=
und
conditions over the region.



Over the western CONUS, both the GEFS and ECMWF are beginning to favor much=
 of
the anomalous troughing over the northeastern Pacific to shift westward ove=
r
the West Coast. The enhanced onshore flow is expected to promote above-norm=
al
precipitation across the northwestern CONUS, where reforecast guidance show=
s
increased chances of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th
percentile.
However, totals are not expected to exceed hazards thus no precipitation
related hazards are issued.



Over Alaska, there is good model agreement favoring mid-level troughing ove=
r
the Gulf of Alaska where the prevailing southeasterly flow is expected to k=
eep
much of the western Mainland on the warm side early in the period. As many
rivers are experiencing their seasonal ice break up during early May, the
favored warmer than normal temperatures may accelerate snow and ice melt an=
d
raises concern for river flooding and ice jams during the period. Across th=
e
interior where many areas have experienced above-average snowpack, signific=
ant
snowmelt is anticipated this week which may trigger localized flooding. Som=
e
of
this flooding risk may persist into the week-2 period, resulting in a possi=
ble
flood hazard posted for the interior and south-central Mainland.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Wed Apr 27 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 30 2022 - 12Z Wed May 04 2022

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues an active pattern with a series of
Pacific systems entering and progressing across the lower 48. The
first system will be a closed upper low and associated surface low
pressure that should lift slowly northeastward from the
north-central Plains, passing through the Northeast in weakened
form by next Monday-Tuesday. This will spread rain across much of
the central U.S. with some chance of wintry weather spreading into
the northern High Plains on the backside of the low. Lighter
rainfall will extend farther east. The next system should be
somewhat weaker, progressing from the West Coast to near the East
Coast during the period. Then a stronger system is likely to track
from the West Coast into the Rockies/Plains during
Monday-Wednesday. The latter two systems will bring rain and high
elevation snow to the Northwest and then areas of enhanced
precipitation to parts of the central and eastern U.S. depending
on system/frontal details.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Within what has been a fairly agreeable pattern from the multi-day
mean perspective, some challenges are ongoing for specifics of
individual systems. Solutions have converged fairly well for the
leading system tracking out of the Plains during the weekend but
still diverge a bit by day 5 Monday with the 06Z GFS and now the
12Z UKMET straying somewhat to the faster/northward side of the
spread. Meanwhile there are still meaningful detail and track
issues with the shortwave reaching the West during the weekend,
with the new 12Z ECMWF at least adjusting somewhat north of its
00Z run whose upper low center was on the southern side of the
envelope. Once this feature ejects from the West, model runs over
recent days have differed greatly over specifics (including the
surface reflection). However in a positive trend today's 00Z
through 12Z runs seem to be clustering a little better toward
maintaining enough definition of the shortwave to support a
surface wave over or just east of the Mid Mississippi Valley by
early Tuesday and near the East Coast Wednesday. There is still a
significant question of stream interaction over eastern North
America that complicates the forecast after early Tuesday. The
final system in the series continues to provide a difficult
forecast though. GFS runs remain on the faster side of the spread,
bringing it well into the Plains by midweek. The 00Z ECMWF jumped
back close to the persistently slow CMC (which itself changed to
an intermediate timing in the new 12Z run) while the new 12Z ECMWF
is close to its 00Z run. The 06Z GEFS mean hedged back to a
compromise, close to the 00Z CMC mean and a bit ahead of the ECMWF
mean, before gravitating closer to the operational run again in
the 12Z cycle. The array and variability of latest runs favored a
compromise approach between the GFS and 00Z ECMWF aloft, slower
than continuity but offering some flexibility pending future
trends.

Based on the guidance available through the 06Z cycle, the updated
forecast used a composite of 00Z/06Z models early to tone down the
more extreme aspects of one or more solutions, followed by adding
some input from the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means along with the models
to yield the desired intermediate solution late. Admittedly the
favored model/mean blend ended up producing a surface evolution a
tad slower than ultimately desired by day 7 Wednesday though.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The first surface low pressure system affecting the lower 48 over
the weekend will spread precipitation across much of the central
and eastern U.S., with some wintry weather possible in the Dakotas
and the best chances in the higher elevations of the Black Hills.
In portions of the Dakotas, precipitation may begin as rain and
transition to mixed precipitation or snow, though details of these
threats remain somewhat uncertain. Additionally, rain could become
heavy to locally excessive from parts of the Plains into the
Mississippi/Ohio Valleys on Saturday. Then as the low pressure
system shifts eastward early next week, precipitation chances
should spread eastward with heavier activity tending to become
more localized. The trailing front will likely stall over the
southern Plains as another system approaches from the West and
current forecasts show potential for heavy rainfall on Sunday
across this region. There is enough uncertainty with details of
this incoming system to suggest potential for future shifts in the
expected axis of heaviest rainfall. With another potential
early-mid week wave plus a trailing one reaching the Plains by
around Wednesday, rain/showers and thunderstorms will likely
persist from the Plains eastward through much of next week. Some
areas over the central U.S. will need to monitor forecasts of the
midweek system given its potential to produce significant weather
and sensitivity to additional rainfall. The latter two upper
shortwaves/surface systems will bring rounds of mostly light to
moderate precipitation (snow in the higher elevations and rain in
the lower elevations) across the Northwest, mainly in the
Saturday-Monday period and perhaps lingering over parts of the
Rockies after then.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and warmer than
average in the southern tier. The core of the coldest air should
be across the northern High Plains to Midwest, where highs will be
around 10-20F below average due to being in the cold sector of
initial low pressure affecting the region followed by influence
from the southern periphery of Canadian high pressure and moisture
arriving with another system toward midweek. Lows should stay
closer to normal though. Meanwhile, slightly above normal
temperatures should stretch across much of the southern tier, with
mainly warmer than average lows also spreading into the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys during the weekend and more of the East
next week.  Best potential for some plus 10-15F anomalies for
highs will be over the southern High Plains early next week while
similar anomalies for morning lows may be a little more common on
some days.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed April 27 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 03 - 07 2022

Model solutions remain consistent and in excellent agreement with an amplif=
ied
longwave trough over Alaska and the northeastern Pacific. As a shortwave
trough
emerges from this longwave trough and progresses eastward, 500-hPa heights =
are
forecast to at least briefly increase over the southeastern CONUS. The high=
est
forecast confidence in the 6-10 day temperature outlook exists across the
Southeast and along the Gulf Coast due to anomalous warmth in response to t=
he
strengthening ridge aloft. Model guidance differs on how fast cold air
advection shifts south from the northern Great Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley during the first week of May. The GEFS reforecast tool is most
expansive
with anomalous cold across the east-central CONUS, while the ECMWF reforeca=
st
tool only favors near normal temperatures for the Great Lakes and Corn Belt=
.
Given the better recent skill of the GEFS reforecast tool and an amplifying
500-hPa trough over the eastern CONUS later in this 5-day period, the 6-10 =
day
temperature outlook more closely matches the cooler GEFS reforecast tool. N=
ear
to above-normal temperatures are more likely for the southern Great Plains =
and
much of the western CONUS due to above-normal heights. However, enhanced
onshore flow slightly favors below-normal temperatures across the coastal
Pacific Northwest.

Model guidance remains in good agreement and consistent that three low
pressure
systems will affect the CONUS during the 6-10 day period. Therefore,
above-normal precipitation remains favored for a majority of the lower 48
states. Due to a predicted southward shift in the mid-level westerlies, the
axis of the heaviest precipitation and associated larger probabilities for
above-normal precipitation are centered across the Central and Southern Gre=
at
Plains, Middle Mississippi Valley, and Tennessee Valley. Consistent with th=
is
southward shift in the 5-day mean storm track, near to below-normal
precipitation is favored for areas closer to the U.S.-Canadian border.
Enhanced
onshore flow increases probabilities for above-normal precipitation across =
the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, but precipitation is unlikely to
extend
south into the Southwest.

Anomalous troughing and enhanced onshore flow elevate probabilities for abo=
ve
normal precipitation throughout the eastern half of Mainland Alaska and the
Alaska Panhandle. Below normal 500-hPa heights along with periods of
precipitation also favor below-normal temperatures for the Alaska Panhandle
and
parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska. Despite below-normal 500-hPa heights
throughout Alaska, reforecast temperature tools remain in good agreement fo=
r
increased probabilities of above-normal temperatures across western and
northern Mainland Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the precipitation tools offset by differences in the
temperature tools for parts of the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 05 - 11 2022

The GFS and ECMWF ensemble means remain in good agreement, depicting a 500-=
hPa
trough extending from Alaska southward to the West Coast, a ridge at the
higher
latitudes of central North America, and an amplifying trough over the easte=
rn
CONUS. During the past few days, the ensemble means have trended towards a
more
amplified longwave pattern over the northeastern Pacific and North America.
Based on a greater spatial coverage of below normal 500-hPa heights and the
preferred GEFS reforecast tool, below normal temperatures are favored for t=
he
Middle to Upper Mississippi Valley, Corn Belt, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast.
Although there are signs that cold air advection may shift farther to the
south
than expected in previous days, anomalous warmth early in week-2 elevates
probabilities for above normal temperatures for much of the Southeast, Gulf
Coast, and southern Great Plains. Along a predicted 500-hPa ridge axis, abo=
ve
normal temperatures are favored for the High Plains and Rockies. Enhanced
onshore flow coupled with below normal 500-hPa heights increase probabiliti=
es
for below-normal temperatures across the Pacific Northwest.

Shortwave troughs are forecast to undercut the anomalous ridging at the hig=
her
latitudes of central North America. Early in week-2, a low pressure system =
and
trailing cold front favor above normal precipitation for Mid-Atlantic,
Southeast, and Gulf Coast. A two category change from above to below-normal
precipitation, being favored today for parts of the Great Lakes, was necess=
ary
as heavier precipitation is expected to end by day 8 (May 5) due to a
southward
shift of a cold front. As an amplified trough enters the western CONUS late=
r
in
week-2, above-normal precipitation is favored from the Pacific Northwest an=
d
northern California eastward to the northern Rockies and northern high Plai=
ns.
A compromise between the GEFS (drier) and ECMWF (wetter) reforecast tools
yields a favored area of near to below normal precipitation across the Four
Corners Region. Although precipitation may overspread the Central Rockies, =
it
would be unusual for precipitation to occur as far south as the Desert
Southwest during early to mid-May.

The 500-hPa height pattern over the northern Pacific and Alaska remains the
most stable feature throughout the forecast domain. Daily plots of the
ensemble
means depict a weakening of the 500-hPa trough over these areas, but this m=
ay
be a function of increasing spread among ensemble members. Given the likely
continuation of a trough and onshore flow, above-normal precipitation remai=
ns
slightly favored for eastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. The
most
likely area for below normal temperatures is expected to be southeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. The favored area of above-normal
temperatures for western and northern Mainland Alaska is based on the GEFS =
and
ECMWF reforecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
improved agreement and convergence among the precipitation tools today offs=
et
by continued differences among the temperature tools.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
316 PM EDT Wed Apr 27 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 30 2022 - 12Z Wed May 04 2022

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues an active pattern with a series of
Pacific systems entering and progressing across the lower 48. The
first system will be a closed upper low and associated surface low
pressure that should lift slowly northeastward from the
north-central Plains, passing through the Northeast in weakened
form by next Monday-Tuesday. This will spread rain across much of
the central U.S. with some chance of wintry weather spreading into
the northern High Plains on the backside of the low. Lighter
rainfall will extend farther east. The next system should be
somewhat weaker, progressing from the West Coast to near the East
Coast during the period. Then a stronger system is likely to track
from the West Coast into the Rockies/Plains during
Monday-Wednesday. The latter two systems will bring rain and high
elevation snow to the Northwest and then areas of enhanced
precipitation to parts of the central and eastern U.S. depending
on system/frontal details.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Within what has been a fairly agreeable pattern from the multi-day
mean perspective, some challenges are ongoing for specifics of
individual systems. Solutions have converged fairly well for the
leading system tracking out of the Plains during the weekend but
still diverge a bit by day 5 Monday with the 06Z GFS and now the
12Z UKMET straying somewhat to the faster/northward side of the
spread. Meanwhile there are still meaningful detail and track
issues with the shortwave reaching the West during the weekend,
with the new 12Z ECMWF at least adjusting somewhat north of its
00Z run whose upper low center was on the southern side of the
envelope. Once this feature ejects from the West, model runs over
recent days have differed greatly over specifics (including the
surface reflection). However in a positive trend today's 00Z
through 12Z runs seem to be clustering a little better toward
maintaining enough definition of the shortwave to support a
surface wave over or just east of the Mid Mississippi Valley by
early Tuesday and near the East Coast Wednesday. There is still a
significant question of stream interaction over eastern North
America that complicates the forecast after early Tuesday. The
final system in the series continues to provide a difficult
forecast though. GFS runs remain on the faster side of the spread,
bringing it well into the Plains by midweek. The 00Z ECMWF jumped
back close to the persistently slow CMC (which itself changed to
an intermediate timing in the new 12Z run) while the new 12Z ECMWF
is close to its 00Z run. The 06Z GEFS mean hedged back to a
compromise, close to the 00Z CMC mean and a bit ahead of the ECMWF
mean, before gravitating closer to the operational run again in
the 12Z cycle. The array and variability of latest runs favored a
compromise approach between the GFS and 00Z ECMWF aloft, slower
than continuity but offering some flexibility pending future
trends.

Based on the guidance available through the 06Z cycle, the updated
forecast used a composite of 00Z/06Z models early to tone down the
more extreme aspects of one or more solutions, followed by adding
some input from the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means along with the models
to yield the desired intermediate solution late. Admittedly the
favored model/mean blend ended up producing a surface evolution a
tad slower than ultimately desired by day 7 Wednesday though.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The first surface low pressure system affecting the lower 48 over
the weekend will spread precipitation across much of the central
and eastern U.S., with some wintry weather possible in the Dakotas
and the best chances in the higher elevations of the Black Hills.
In portions of the Dakotas, precipitation may begin as rain and
transition to mixed precipitation or snow, though details of these
threats remain somewhat uncertain. Additionally, rain could become
heavy to locally excessive from parts of the Plains into the
Mississippi/Ohio Valleys on Saturday. Then as the low pressure
system shifts eastward early next week, precipitation chances
should spread eastward with heavier activity tending to become
more localized. The trailing front will likely stall over the
southern Plains as another system approaches from the West and
current forecasts show potential for heavy rainfall on Sunday
across this region. There is enough uncertainty with details of
this incoming system to suggest potential for future shifts in the
expected axis of heaviest rainfall. With another potential
early-mid week wave plus a trailing one reaching the Plains by
around Wednesday, rain/showers and thunderstorms will likely
persist from the Plains eastward through much of next week. Some
areas over the central U.S. will need to monitor forecasts of the
midweek system given its potential to produce significant weather
and sensitivity to additional rainfall. The latter two upper
shortwaves/surface systems will bring rounds of mostly light to
moderate precipitation (snow in the higher elevations and rain in
the lower elevations) across the Northwest, mainly in the
Saturday-Monday period and perhaps lingering over parts of the
Rockies after then.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and warmer than
average in the southern tier. The core of the coldest air should
be across the northern High Plains to Midwest, where highs will be
around 10-20F below average due to being in the cold sector of
initial low pressure affecting the region followed by influence
from the southern periphery of Canadian high pressure and moisture
arriving with another system toward midweek. Lows should stay
closer to normal though. Meanwhile, slightly above normal
temperatures should stretch across much of the southern tier, with
mainly warmer than average lows also spreading into the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys during the weekend and more of the East
next week.  Best potential for some plus 10-15F anomalies for
highs will be over the southern High Plains early next week while
similar anomalies for morning lows may be a little more common on
some days.

north-central Plains, passing through the Northeast in weakened
form by next Monday-Tuesday. This will spread rain across much of
the central U.S. with some chance of wintry weather spreading into
the northern High Plains on the backside of the low. Lighter
rainfall will extend farther east. The next system should be
somewhat weaker, progressing from the West Coast to near the East
Coast during the period. Then a stronger system is likely to track
from the West Coast into the Rockies/Plains during
Monday-Wednesday. The latter two systems will bring rain and high
elevation snow to the Northwest and then areas of enhanced
precipitation to parts of the central and eastern U.S. depending
on system/frontal details.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Within what has been a fairly agreeable pattern from the multi-day
mean perspective, some challenges are ongoing for specifics of
individual systems. Solutions have converged fairly well for the
leading system tracking out of the Plains during the weekend but
still diverge a bit by day 5 Monday with the 06Z GFS and now the
12Z UKMET straying somewhat to the faster/northward side of the
spread. Meanwhile there are still meaningful detail and track
issues with the shortwave reaching the West during the weekend,
with the new 12Z ECMWF at least adjusting somewhat north of its
00Z run whose upper low center was on the southern side of the
envelope. Once this feature ejects from the West, model runs over
recent days have differed greatly over specifics (including the
surface reflection). However in a positive trend today's 00Z
through 12Z runs seem to be clustering a little better toward
maintaining enough definition of the shortwave to support a
surface wave over or just east of the Mid Mississippi Valley by
early Tuesday and near the East Coast Wednesday. There is still a
significant question of stream interaction over eastern North
America that complicates the forecast after early Tuesday. The
final system in the series continues to provide a difficult
forecast though. GFS runs remain on the faster side of the spread,
bringing it well into the Plains by midweek. The 00Z ECMWF jumped
back close to the persistently slow CMC (which itself changed to
an intermediate timing in the new 12Z run) while the new 12Z ECMWF
is close to its 00Z run. The 06Z GEFS mean hedged back to a
compromise, close to the 00Z CMC mean and a bit ahead of the ECMWF
mean, before gravitating closer to the operational run again in
the 12Z cycle. The array and variability of latest runs favored a
compromise approach between the GFS and 00Z ECMWF aloft, slower
than continuity but offering some flexibility pending future
trends.

Based on the guidance available through the 06Z cycle, the updated
forecast used a composite of 00Z/06Z models early to tone down the
more extreme aspects of one or more solutions, followed by adding
some input from the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means along with the models
to yield the desired intermediate solution late. Admittedly the
favored model/mean blend ended up producing a surface evolution a
tad slower than ultimately desired by day 7 Wednesday though.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The first surface low pressure system affecting the lower 48 over
the weekend will spread precipitation across much of the central
and eastern U.S., with some wintry weather possible in the Dakotas
and the best chances in the higher elevations of the Black Hills.
In portions of the Dakotas, precipitation may begin as rain and
transition to mixed precipitation or snow, though details of these
threats remain somewhat uncertain. Additionally, rain could become
heavy to locally excessive from parts of the Plains into the
Mississippi/Ohio Valleys on Saturday. Then as the low pressure
system shifts eastward early next week, precipitation chances
should spread eastward with heavier activity tending to become
more localized. The trailing front will likely stall over the
southern Plains as another system approaches from the West and
current forecasts show potential for heavy rainfall on Sunday
across this region. There is enough uncertainty with details of
this incoming system to suggest potential for future shifts in the
expected axis of heaviest rainfall. With another potential
early-mid week wave plus a trailing one reaching the Plains by
around Wednesday, rain/showers and thunderstorms will likely
persist from the Plains eastward through much of next week. Some
areas over the central U.S. will need to monitor forecasts of the
midweek system given its potential to produce significant weather
and sensitivity to additional rainfall. The latter two upper
shortwaves/surface systems will bring rounds of mostly light to
moderate precipitation (snow in the higher elevations and rain in
the lower elevations) across the Northwest, mainly in the
Saturday-Monday period and perhaps lingering over parts of the
Rockies after then.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and warmer than
average in the southern tier. The core of the coldest air should
be across the northern High Plains to Midwest, where highs will be
around 10-20F below average due to being in the cold sector of
initial low pressure affecting the region followed by influence
from the southern periphery of Canadian high pressure and moisture
arriving with another system toward midweek. Lows should stay
closer to normal though. Meanwhile, slightly above normal
temperatures should stretch across much of the southern tier, with
mainly warmer than average lows also spreading into the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys during the weekend and more of the East
next week.  Best potential for some plus 10-15F anomalies for
highs will be over the southern High Plains early next week while
similar anomalies for morning lows may be a little more common on
some days.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Added an Elevated area for portions of the Mid Atlantic on Thursday.
Sustained winds are expected to be around 15 mph with relative
humidity 20 to 25 mph. Some light precipitation over the past few
days has increased fuel moisture. However, dry and breezy conditions
today should dry out most of the fine fuels. Therefore, fuels are
expected to be borderline critically dry tomorrow.

Expanded the Elevated area slightly east across west Texas and the
Texas Panhandle.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Wed Apr 27 2022/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough and enhanced west-southwesterly flow aloft will
overspread the Great Basin and impinge on the central and southern
Rockies. In response, a lee surface low will deepen over eastern CO,
with a dryline extending southward over the southern High Plains.
Farther east, deep/strong northwesterly flow on the backside of a
midlevel low will overspread the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states,
where a dry post-frontal airmass will remain in place.

...Southwest into the Southern High Plains...
As the enhanced west-southwesterly flow overspreads a dry antecedent
airmass across the Southwest and southern High Plains, 5-15 percent
RH will develop behind the dryline owing to efficient diurnal
heating/mixing. At the same time, sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds near 20-25 mph will develop atop critically dry fuels.
The best overlap of the strong surface winds and warm/dry
boundary-layer conditions is expected across portions of
east-central AZ, NM, and far west TX -- where Critical highlights
have been added.

...Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...
Breezy northwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph are forecast across
parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, where 25-30 percent
RH will develop by peak heating. While these meteorological
conditions may support enhanced fire-weather conditions across the
region, recent precipitation casts uncertainty on the overall
receptiveness of fuels. With that said, drying of fine fuels is
expected on Wednesday, and fuel trends will be monitored closely.

...Coastal storm to produce rain and elevation snow across
northern New England through the end of the week...

...Isolated chances for severe thunderstorms and flash flooding
over the next few days throughout the southern/central Plains and
Mid-Mississippi Valley, with critical fire weather expected across
the southern High Plains and southern Rockies through Friday...

...Developing storm system over the central U.S. on Friday to
generate areas heavy snow across the northern Rockies, heavy rain
over the northern Plains, and severe thunderstorms in the
central/southern Plains...

A strengthening area of low pressure over the Gulf of Maine
continues to strengthen, and is forecast to pivot near the Bay of
Fundy tonight. As it does so, rain and higher elevation snow
within a developing commahead region will expand over much of
northern New England. Northern Maine in particular is expected to
see the most impacts associated with snowfall, as accumulations
add up to around 4 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts in the
highest elevations, leading to minor potential winter storm
impacts (level 2/5) per the WPC WSSI.  This coastal storm will be
slow to exit as the associated upper-trough closes off and gets
stuck beneath a blocking high near Greenland. Accordingly, breezy
northwesterly winds and snow showers will linger through at least
late Friday over northern New England. The chilly northwesterly
flow will also aid in much of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
experiencing below average temperatures over the next several
days. In fact, below average temperatures will continue to stretch
into the Midwest and northern Plains thanks to a strong high
pressure system building southward from Ontario. Widespread highs
will reach into the 40s and 50s, with lows dipping into the 20s
and 30s. Sensitive vegetation throughout the Midwest, Ohio Valley,
and Mid-Atlantic will endure frost/freeze chances until late this
week, where a swath of Freeze Warnings are in effect through
Thursday and Friday.

Meanwhile, a stationary boundary extending from the
Mid-Mississippi Valley into the central Plains, a forming dryline
over the southern High Plains, and embedded shortwaves within an
upper-level ridge will support chances for isolated severe
thunderstorms and instances of flash flooding across the central
U.S. through Thursday. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe thunderstorms for today over
portions of the southern Plains, where a few storms could produce
damaging wind gusts and large hail. The marginal severe storm
threat shifts slightly east into the central and southern Plains
on Thursday for more damaging wind gusts and hail. Isolated
instances of flash flooding are also possible on Thursday from the
central Plains into the middle Mississippi Valley as showers and
storms form and backbuild along the aforementioned stationary
front. West of the dryline, critical fire weather is forecast from
the southern Rockies to the southern High Plains through the end
of the week. Low relative humidity and gusty winds could create an
environment conducive for rapid wildfire spread, which has also
prompted Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches to be issued
for parts of Arizona, New Mexico, southwest Colorado, and West
Texas.

The next large-scale weather-maker to impact the Nation will begin
to take shape late Thursday as a potent and negatively tilted
upper-level trough enters the Intermountain West. In tandem, an
area of low pressure is forecast to develop over the central High
Plains and aid in producing a widespread area of precipitation
extending across the northern Plains and northern Rockies on
Friday. Heavy snow is possible across the higher terrain of
northwest Wyoming and western/central Montana, where snowfall
accumulations up to a foot are possible for locations above 5000
feet and could impact travel overnight when snowfall is most
likely to stick to road surfaces. The latest WPC WSSI highlights
Moderate (level 3/5) winter storm impacts possible within these
higher terrain areas, particularly in Montana. A round of Winter
Storm Watches was hoisted this morning in the northern Rockies
through Friday evening. Additionally, periods of heavy rain are
expected over the northern Plains on Friday. Rainfall totals over
2 inches atop sensitive soils may lead to increasing chances for
flash flooding from south-central North Dakota to central South
Dakota, where a Slight Risk (level 2/4) of excessive rainfall has
been issued. Showers and thunderstorms will also extend into the
central/southern Plains and Mid-Mississippi Valley by Friday
afternoon ahead of a sharp dryline, where all modes of severe
weather are possible. SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5)
of severe weather from far southeast Nebraska to eastern Kansas,
with a larger Slight Risk (level 2/5) extending from Nebraska to
the Red River.

Extended Forecast Discussion

307 AM EDT Thu Apr 28 2022

Valid 12Z Sun May 01 2022 - 12Z Thu May 05 2022

...Overview...

An active pattern is likely during the medium range period with a
series of Pacific systems entering and progressing across the
lower 48. The first system will be a closed upper low and
associated surface low pressure that should lift slowly
northeastward from the Midwest to the Great Lakes and the
northeastern U.S./southeastern Canada as it weakens
Monday-Tuesday. This will spread rain across much of the central
U.S. with some enhanced rain totals and potential for severe
weather in the southern Plains to portions of the Mississippi
Valley, with lighter rainfall extending farther east. The next
system should be somewhat weaker, progressing from the West Coast
to near the East Coast during the period. Then a stronger system
is likely to track from the West Coast Monday across the Rockies,
Plains, and potentially into the Midwest by Thursday. These latter
two systems will bring rain and high elevation snow to the
Northwest and then areas of showers and thunderstorms to parts of
the central and eastern U.S., with specific areas of enhanced
precipitation depending on system/frontal details.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Recent model guidance has continued to show fair agreement with
the overall pattern with typical differences in the
details/specifics of individual systems. Model solutions have
converged fairly well for the leading system tracking across the
Midwest early next week, though with some divergence by
Monday-Tuesday with the surface low track and speed as it heads
into Canada while weakening. Meanwhile there are still meaningful
detail and track issues with the trough over the Northwest
Sunday--ECMWF runs have been persistent with an initial upper low,
which the 00Z CMC has now joined, but guidance has a trend toward
some weakening of the energy as it tracks east across the country
during the first half of the week. However, the shortwave should
still be strong enough to produce a surface wave over ~Illinois as
shown by model guidance from the last day or so, with some variety
in position from cycle to cycle. Newer 00Z guidance has shown a
bit of a westward position with the low over the Mid-Mississippi
Valley Tuesday morning compared to the 12/18Z cycle. The timing of
the surface low Tuesday-Wednesday is affected by the potential for
stream interaction over eastern North America and the timing of
the absorption of the shortwave.

Model guidance remains least agreeable with the last system of
note during the period--significant energy spilling into the West
Monday that likely forms a closed low as it tracks eastward
eventually into the central U.S. by Wednesday-Thursday,
accompanied by a surface low pressure/frontal system. The trend
for eastern/faster GFS runs and western/slower ECMWF runs has
stayed consistent through the 12/18Z and 00Z cycles, and the
ensemble means for both have generally followed their operational
model trends. The 12Z and now 00Z CMC as well as the 12Z CMC
ensemble mean have provided a middle ground in between these slow
and fast solutions with this feature. However, the CMC runs do
show an upper low farther north in south-central Canada around
Tuesday moving east through Thursday where other guidance handled
these northern stream features differently--though the 00Z ECMWF
is now a little closer to this--and has the northern feature
phasing with the U.S. upper low unlike other guidance. Thus while
the CMC runs seem to be a good middle ground over the U.S. its
pattern farther north and the evolution of those features is
somewhat questionable.

The WPC forecast early in the period used a blend of the
deterministic guidance led by the 12Z ECMWF and 18Z GFS. As the
period progressed, lessened the influence of the fast GFS and slow
ECMWF in favor of the ECMWF and the CMC ensemble means, while
keeping the 12Z CMC in the mix. This attempt at an intermediate
solution led to reasonably good consistency with the previous
forecast at least at the 500mb level, though the continued
uncertainty with the track of surface features could continue
leading to some changes in the frontal, temperature, and
precipitation forecasts going forward.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The first surface low pressure system affecting the lower 48 early
next week will spread precipitation across much of the eastern
U.S. with generally light to moderate rain, but with potential for
locally heavy to excessive amounts back across the central U.S.
where fronts are expected to stall. Current forecasts show the
heaviest rainfall amounts in the southern Plains Sunday-Sunday
night and spreading into the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley on
Monday, but exact positioning of the heaviest rain could shift
with future forecasts given lingering uncertainty. The same is
true for severe weather, but the Storm Prediction Center currently
indicates the best potential for severe thunderstorms across the
southern Plains Sunday and Monday. With another potential
early-mid week wave plus a trailing one reaching the Plains by
around Wednesday, rain showers and thunderstorms will likely
persist from the Plains eastward through much of next week. Some
areas over the central U.S. need to monitor forecasts of the
midweek system given its potential to produce significant weather
and sensitivity to additional rainfall. The latter two upper
shortwaves/surface systems will bring rounds of mostly light to
moderate precipitation (snow in the higher elevations and rain in
the lower elevations) across the Northwest, mainly in the
Saturday-Monday period and perhaps lingering over parts of the
Rockies after then.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and warmer than
average in the southern tier. The core of the coldest air should
be across the northern High Plains to Midwest, where highs will be
around 10-20F below average due to being in the cold sector of
initial low pressure affecting the region followed by influence
from the southern periphery of Canadian high pressure and moisture
arriving with another system toward midweek. Lows should stay
closer to normal though. Meanwhile, slightly above normal
temperatures should stretch across much of the southern tier, with
mainly warmer than average lows also spreading into the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys during the weekend and more of the East
next week. Best potential for some plus 10-15F anomalies for highs
will be over the southern High Plains early next week while
similar anomalies for morning lows may be a little more common on
some days.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
307 AM EDT Thu Apr 28 2022

Valid 12Z Sun May 01 2022 - 12Z Thu May 05 2022

...Overview...

An active pattern is likely during the medium range period with a
series of Pacific systems entering and progressing across the
lower 48. The first system will be a closed upper low and
associated surface low pressure that should lift slowly
northeastward from the Midwest to the Great Lakes and the
northeastern U.S./southeastern Canada as it weakens
Monday-Tuesday. This will spread rain across much of the central
U.S. with some enhanced rain totals and potential for severe
weather in the southern Plains to portions of the Mississippi
Valley, with lighter rainfall extending farther east. The next
system should be somewhat weaker, progressing from the West Coast
to near the East Coast during the period. Then a stronger system
is likely to track from the West Coast Monday across the Rockies,
Plains, and potentially into the Midwest by Thursday. These latter
two systems will bring rain and high elevation snow to the
Northwest and then areas of showers and thunderstorms to parts of
the central and eastern U.S., with specific areas of enhanced
precipitation depending on system/frontal details.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Recent model guidance has continued to show fair agreement with
the overall pattern with typical differences in the
details/specifics of individual systems. Model solutions have
converged fairly well for the leading system tracking across the
Midwest early next week, though with some divergence by
Monday-Tuesday with the surface low track and speed as it heads
into Canada while weakening. Meanwhile there are still meaningful
detail and track issues with the trough over the Northwest
Sunday--ECMWF runs have been persistent with an initial upper low,
which the 00Z CMC has now joined, but guidance has a trend toward
some weakening of the energy as it tracks east across the country
during the first half of the week. However, the shortwave should
still be strong enough to produce a surface wave over ~Illinois as
shown by model guidance from the last day or so, with some variety
in position from cycle to cycle. Newer 00Z guidance has shown a
bit of a westward position with the low over the Mid-Mississippi
Valley Tuesday morning compared to the 12/18Z cycle. The timing of
the surface low Tuesday-Wednesday is affected by the potential for
stream interaction over eastern North America and the timing of
the absorption of the shortwave.

Model guidance remains least agreeable with the last system of
note during the period--significant energy spilling into the West
Monday that likely forms a closed low as it tracks eastward
eventually into the central U.S. by Wednesday-Thursday,
accompanied by a surface low pressure/frontal system. The trend
for eastern/faster GFS runs and western/slower ECMWF runs has
stayed consistent through the 12/18Z and 00Z cycles, and the
ensemble means for both have generally followed their operational
model trends. The 12Z and now 00Z CMC as well as the 12Z CMC
ensemble mean have provided a middle ground in between these slow
and fast solutions with this feature. However, the CMC runs do
show an upper low farther north in south-central Canada around
Tuesday moving east through Thursday where other guidance handled
these northern stream features differently--though the 00Z ECMWF
is now a little closer to this--and has the northern feature
phasing with the U.S. upper low unlike other guidance. Thus while
the CMC runs seem to be a good middle ground over the U.S. its
pattern farther north and the evolution of those features is
somewhat questionable.

solution led to reasonably good consistency with the previous
forecast at least at the 500mb level, though the continued
uncertainty with the track of surface features could continue
leading to some changes in the frontal, temperature, and
precipitation forecasts going forward.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough accompanied by enhanced west-southwesterly flow
aloft will overspread the Intermountain West and impinge on the
central and southern Rockies. Meanwhile, a lee surface low will
deepen over eastern CO, with a dryline extending southward over the
southern High Plains. Farther east, strong northwesterly flow on the
backside of an occluded mid/upper-level low will persist over the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, where a dry post-frontal airmass
will remain in place.

...Southwest into the Southern High Plains...
As the enhanced west-southwesterly flow overspreads a dry antecedent
airmass across the Southwest and southern High Plains, diurnal
heating/mixing will result in widespread 5-15 percent RH behind the
dryline. Sustained west-southwesterly surface winds near 20-25 mph
will develop amid the critically low RH during the afternoon. The
best overlap of the strong surface winds and dry boundary-layer
conditions is expected across portions of east-central AZ, NM, and
far west TX -- where Critical highlights have been maintained.

...Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...
Breezy northwesterly surface winds near 15 mph are expected amid
20-25 percent RH by peak heating. With continued drying of fine
fuels across the region, elevated fire-weather conditions can be
expected over parts of eastern PA, NJ, and far southeastern NY.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHEASTERN
COLORADO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND MUCH
OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
***OUTBREAK OF DANGEROUS FIRE-WEATHER CONDITIONS EXPECTED OVER
SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO ON FRIDAY***

On the backside of an eastward-advancing western CONUS trough, an
intense west-northwesterly midlevel speed maximum will overspread
the central/southern Rockies and adjacent High Plains during peak
heating. In response, a lee surface low over western KS will rapidly
deepen, while a southward-extending dryline sharpens over the
southern High Plains. By the evening hours, the large-scale trough
and attendant surface cyclone will lift northeastward across the
central Plains, while a cold front sweeps southward across the
central and southern High Plains. This large-scale pattern will
yield extremely critical fire-weather conditions over southeastern
CO, and high-end critical conditions over parts of the Southwest and
much of the southern High Plains.

Farther east, strong/deep northwesterly flow will continue to
overspread the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on the backside of an
occluded mid/upper-level low. In the low-levels, a relatively
warm/dry post-frontal airmass will remain in place -- where fine
fuels continue to dry.

...Southeastern Colorado...
As temperatures climb into the upper 70s by early afternoon, strong
downslope warming/drying of a dry antecedent airmass will result in
5-10 percent minimum RH. Under mostly clear skies, the diurnally
deepening boundary layer will extend into the very strong
west-northwesterly flow aloft, while the surface pressure gradient
rapidly tightens behind the sharpening dryline. A multi-model
consensus suggests that these factors will favor sustained
west-northwesterly surface winds of 30-40 mph with gusts upwards of
55 mph. This volatile combination of strong/gusty surface winds and
anomalously low RH atop critically dry fuels will foster extreme
fire-weather behavior during the afternoon hours. Therefore, upon
collaboration with WFO PUB, Extremely Critical highlights have been
added for southeastern CO. By the late evening hours, a cold front
will sweep southward across the area, with a northwesterly wind
shift and breezy conditions persisting in its wake.

...Parts of the Southwest and much of the southern High Plains...
Behind the dryline, deep boundary-layer mixing will result in
widespread minimum RH of 5-15 percent by the early afternoon. At the
same time, sustained westerly surface winds of 20-30 mph will
develop as the pressure gradient tightens. This will result in an
expansive area of high-end critical conditions across parts of the
Southwest and much of the southern High Plains. The eastern extent
of critical conditions will be demarcated by the sharpening dryline.

...Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...
Efficient diurnal heating of the dry post-frontal airmass will allow
for 20-25 percent minimum RH, where fine fuels continue to dry
across the region. The dry boundary-layer conditions coupled with
sustained northwesterly surface winds near 15 mph will lead to
elevated fire-weather conditions during the afternoon hours.

...Developing storm system over the central U.S. on Friday to
generate areas heavy snow across the northern Rockies, heavy rain
over the northern Plains, and severe thunderstorms in the
central/southern Plains...

...Coastal rain and inland snow to continue across parts of Maine
through Friday...

...Critical to extreme fire weather located throughout parts of
the Southwest, southern Rockies, and southern High Plains...

An active weather pattern will begin to take shape later today and
extend into early this weekend as a multifaceted weather system
develops over the central United States. Before this system
develops, there is the chance for isolated instances of flash
flooding and severe weather along a quasi-stationary boundary
extending from the middle Mississippi Valley to the Central
Plains. A Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of excessive rainfall is in
effect for today from southeast Nebraska and eastern Kansas into
much of Missouri, where rainfall amounts over an inch could pose
isolated flash flooding concerns. The Storm Prediction Center has
issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe weather over western
Nebraska, and a larger Marginal Risk (level 1/5) that extends
southward and just east of dryline throughout the central and
southern Plains today. By early this evening, a negatively tilted
upper-level trough crossing the Intermountain West will lead to a
developing precipitation shield over the northern Rockies. Heavy
snow is forecast across parts of Montana, Idaho, and northwest
Wyoming. with moderate snowfall accumulations confined to regions
above 5000 feet in elevation. Additionally, a few damaging wind
gusts and some hail can't be ruled out across southeast Idaho,
northern Utah, and southwest Wyoming. A strong low pressure system
will begin to develop on Friday over the central Plains as the
aforementioned upper-level trough begins to close off while
continuing to push eastward. This will lead to an expanding
precipitation shield over the northern Plains and Mid-Mississippi
Valley. Widespread rainfall amounts up to, and locally exceeding,
2 inches may produce scattered areas of flash flooding from
south-central North Dakota to central South Dakota. A Slight Risk
(level 2/4) of excessive rainfall is in effect for this region.
Elsewhere, there is higher confidence that severe thunderstorms
capable all hazard types will impact an area extending from
southeast Nebraska to north-central Oklahoma, prompting SPC to
issue an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of severe weather.
Thunderstorms forming ahead of a dryline and approaching cold
front may contain tornadoes and produce significant hail. With
multiple strong storms, heavy rainfall rates are also likely and
could lead to isolated flash flood concerns. By Saturday, the
maturing low pressure system will continue to produce locally
heavy rain over the northern Plains, with wet snowflakes mixing
into the northern High Plains and Black Hills. Heavy rain and
severe thunderstorms will also remain possible along the advancing
cold front forecast to extend from the Midwest to the Southern
Plains.

Elsewhere, a wobbling upper-level low located over the Gulf of
Maine will continue to produce unsettled weather over northern New
England over the next few days. Northern Maine in particular will
experience the greatest impacts, with snowfall accumulations up to
5 inches and gusty winds possible throughout northern portions of
the state. Conditions will finally begin to improve on Saturday as
the system gradually slides further into the Atlantic. Meanwhile,
an attached cold front that has surged through the western
Atlantic and is currently found near central Florida could lead to
scattered thunderstorms capable of producing heavy rain and urban
flash flooding through Friday. A Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall has been issued along the southeastern Florida Atlantic
coastline. Behind this cold front much of the eastern U.S. will
experience a chilly end of the workweek. In fact, lows into the
upper 20s and low 30s will likely lead to frost/freeze concerns
over parts of the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic through at least
Saturday. The combination of dry air and gusty winds over the
Mid-Atlantic will also lead to fire weather concerns. Fire Weather
Watches and Red Flag Warnings have been issued for parts of
eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Fire weather is also a potential hazard across the Southwest,
southern Rockies, and southern High Plains over the next few days.
The combination of gusty southwesterly winds, low relative
humidity, above average temperatures, and dry terrain will lead to
critical to extreme fire weather conditions today and Friday. More
specifically, SPC has issued an area of extreme fire weather
danger over parts of southeast Colorado on Friday. Any new
wildfires could start with ease and new/existing fires may spread
uncontrollably. Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches are in
effect over southern Nevada, northern Arizona, the entire state of

...A major weekend snowstorm for the Central Rockies/High Plains
and a heavy rainfall threat from the south-central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Overview...

A potent closed upper trough/low will track from the Southwest to
the Southern Plains this weekend. This plus a well organized
surface low over the Central Plains will spread significant snow
to the Central Rockies and central High Plains, while severe
weather and heavy rain are possible across the south-central U.S..
Another amplified trough may dig into am unsettled West early next
week and serve as a kicker for the initial closed low, pushing it
northeastward as it weakens. The second system may reach the
south-central U.S. by next midweek.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble guidance is in reasonable agreement with the
overall pattern described above through the weekend and into early
next week. The 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/Canadian solutions seem
best clustered, have good GEFS/ECMWF ensemble support and offer
improving run to run continuity. A composite blend along with the
01 UTC National Blend of Models seems reasonable. The 18 UTC GFS
and to a lesser extent the 18 UTC GEFS mean overall become more
progressive with features than the rest of guidance days 5-7.
Suggest a solution on the less progressive side of the full
envelope of solutions given closed/amplified systems and stream
separated nature of the flow. A composite blend of the 12 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble mean solutions seems to fit
the bill and maintains good WPC continuity. The 00 UTC GFS trended
slower, but the 00 UTC ECMWF has thrown a troublesome curve ball
and no longer digs kicker upper trough energy strongly down over
the West next week.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Significant heavy snow along with gusty winds creating low
visibility and possible blizzard conditions are forecast across
the Central Rockies and central portions of the High Plains into
the weekend. More moderate snows will spread across the central
Plains into the Upper Midwest into early next week. In the warm
sector, heavy rains/convection will also develop in earnest and
spread from the south-central Plains to the mid-lower Mississippi
Valley/Mid-South where increasingly deep moisture inflow from the
Gulf of Mexico will wrap around the low into a slow-moving frontal
zone. SPC shows a severe weather threat for the Southern Plains to
the mid-lower Mississippi Valley unstable warm sector.

Subsequent evolution is less clear but expect a weakening system
will lift northeastward across the east-central U.S. early-mid
next week. Amplified and reinforcing northern stream upper trough
passage will in advance force cooled high pressure and lead cold
frontal push down through the East. There is potential to spread
some enhanced rainfall/convection across the South/Southwest and
Mid-Atlantic. Wrap-back moisture may also support some Midwest
snows and lead flow offers some chance for mainly light
overrunning snows from the north-central Appalachians through the
northern Mid-Atlantic.

The upstream kicker system for the West/Southwest had trended
stronger in guidance, except now for the much less diggy 00 UTC
ECMWF. Other than this ECMWF run, the system showed potential for
modest to moderate precipitation Sunday into Tuesday from the
Pacific Northwest into California to the south-central Great
Basin/Rockies. Forecast spread increases with time for overall
system evolution, but possible system emergence could spread some
renewed precipitation across the south-central Plains and the
mid-lower Mississippi Valley/The South by Tuesday-next Thursday.

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding possible over parts of
the Central/Southern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley through
Saturday...

...Warm temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average found across
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Friday morning...

...Significant winter storm to begin Friday evening into Saturday
morning across the Central Rockies and central High Plains...

...Critical risk of fire weather for central and southern New
Mexico...

An area of low pressure currently located over the Upper Great
Lakes is forecast to race northeastward into Canada today. Light
snowfall associated with this system will gradually come to an end
across the Upper Midwest and U.P. of Michigan. Meanwhile, a strong
cold front is expected to push across the Ohio Valley today and
make its way into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic by Friday morning.
Ahead of the cold front, temperatures will rise into the 60s and
70s across the region, with many daily records in jeopardy of
falling. Gusty winds and dry air, combined with the abnormally
warm temperatures, could lead to an elevated fire weather risk. In
fact, a Fire Weather Watch has been issued throughout portions of
the Mid-Atlantic.

Farther west, the aforementioned cold front will slow and
eventually stall across the Southern Plains. As a result, showers
and thunderstorms are expected to develop and remain over much of
the same region throughout the next couple of days. Over an inch
of rainfall can be expected through Saturday morning from North
Texas to southern Indiana, with upwards of two to three inches of
rain possible across south-central Missouri. WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall valid Friday to Saturday morning
for this area due to the increasing threat of flash flooding.
Along with the threat of heavy rain, severe thunderstorms will be
possible over the next few days. SPC has issued a Marginal Risk
for severe thunderstorms today from northeast Oklahoma to southern
Illinois. Damaging wind gusts and large hail is expected to be the
main threat with these storms as they develop this
afternoon/evening along the frontal boundary. By Friday the severe
storm threat shifts southwest and includes West Texas and
southwest Oklahoma. SPC has issued a Slight Risk for severe
thunderstorms across this region, with damaging wind gusts, large
hail, and isolated tornadoes possible. On the dry side of the
developing system across the southern High Plains, gusty winds
will make for another day of fire weather concerns across central
and southern New Mexico both today and Friday.

A large upper-level low spinning above the southwestern U.S. will
be the catalyst for an upcoming significant winter storm across
the Central Rockies and central High Plains. Before the system
fully develops this weekend, heavy snow could fall across the
higher elevations of the Intermountain West and Southwest.
Portions of Utah and Arizona could see over 6 inches of snow by
Saturday morning. Heavy mountain snow and lower elevation heavy
rain will also remain possible across southern California through
Friday. As the upper-level low moves eastward, an area of low
pressure is expected to develop across the central High Plains on
Friday and produce heavy snow across central Colorado and
southeast Wyoming this weekend. Light snow is forecast to develop
Friday evening across the region; however, much of the winter
weather impacts are forecast to occur later in the day on Saturday
and throughout much of Sunday. Widespread travel impacts are
likely. Winter Storm Watches have been issued and include
southeast Wyoming, northeast and north-central Colorado, as well
as western Nebraska.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
The main upper-level trough, currently residing across the West
Coast, is forecast to begin translating eastward into the Southwest
through the day Friday. Broad synoptic ascent ahead of the
approaching wave will induce surface pressure falls across the
southern High Plains through the day Friday. Height rises over the
Plains amid broad warm advection will begin to orient the flow over
the southern Rockies more meridionally, resulting in only modest lee
troughing over central New Mexico/far southern Colorado. An increase
in southerly surface winds is expected, but will likely be confined
to just New Mexico and the bordering portions of neighboring states.
Nonetheless, dry conditions and receptive fuels coupled with windy
conditions will result in another day of heightened fire weather
concerns.

...New Mexico...
Recent ensemble guidance maintains confidence in the fire weather
potential for Friday afternoon by featuring high probabilities for
relative humidity values in the single digits to low teens and wind
speeds between 15-25 mph across New Mexico. Low-level flow over the
next 48 hours will predominantly be out of the south/southwest with
trajectories emanating off the higher terrain of northern Mexico.
The resultant downslope warming/drying, coupled with daytime
heating/deep boundary-layer mixing, should support the ensemble RH
forecast. As with Thursday, the strongest mid-level flow will likely
be aligned from southwest to central NM, which will allow for better
wind potential within the higher terrain across the central portions
of the state. This also introduces some uncertainty for the RH/wind
forecast for the High Plains to the east (along the TX/NM border)
where downslope warming and drying may not be maximized. Fuels
across southern and eastern NM remain dry and receptive to fire
spread, but receptive fuels across the higher terrain in central and
northern NM will remain confined to lower elevations.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Dry post-frontal air is expected to overspread the Mid-Atlantic
region by late Friday after the passage of a cold front. Weakness in
cold advection behind the front and clearing skies by the afternoon
may allow for temperatures to warm enough to yield RH values as low
as 25% from western VA to eastern PA. Additionally, 10-15 mph post
frontal winds are expected, and if coincident with reduced RH, may
support some fire weather concern. This potential will largely be
conditional on minimal rainfall along the front and skies clearing
in time to allow some daytime heating. A notable spread in guidance
precludes any risk areas, though conditions will continue to be
monitored.

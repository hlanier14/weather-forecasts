Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Fri May 20 2022

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF EASTERN ARIZONA...NEW
MEXICO...WEST TEXAS...

The primary change with this outlook update is to expand the
Critical area into a larger portion of west TX, based on recent
observations and short-term guidance. Otherwise, the previous
reasoning remains valid, with a large area of relatively
long-duration critical conditions expected from eastern AZ into most
of NM and parts of west TX. Localized extremely critical conditions
will be possible, especially across portions of central/northern NM.

A small part of the Elevated area was trimmed across the OK/TX
Panhandles, within the post-frontal regime. The northeastward extent
of critical conditions remains somewhat uncertain due to the
progression of the cold front, though the dryline is still expected
to mix into some areas that are currently post-frontal by late this
afternoon.

Elevated to locally critical conditions are also expected within a
northerly flow regime across parts of the Sacramento Valley and
vicinity. See the previous discussion below for more details.

..Dean.. 05/20/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0117 AM CDT Fri May 20 2022/

...Synopsis...
Critical fire weather conditions remain likely this afternoon across
a large swath of the Southwest. A broad upper-level trough is noted
in early-morning water vapor imagery over the northwestern CONUS. An
elongated cold front, currently pushing southward through the
inter-mountain West and the central Plains, will help deepen the
trough over the next 12-24 hours. This will have the effect of
increasing mid-level winds over the Southwest as well as bolstering
surface pressure falls along/ahead of the cold front across the
southern High Plains by late afternoon. Consequently, strengthening
pressure-gradient winds from the lower CO River valley into the
southern High Plains will promote widespread fire weather concerns.

...Southwest to the Southern High Plains...
Latest fuel guidance and drought indices continues to show
widespread dry conditions with receptive fuels across much of the
Southwest and southern High Plains. Early-morning surface
observations across AZ, NM, and western TX show poor overnight RH
recovery with single-digit to low teen RH values noted. While modest
RH recovery is probable across parts of southwest AZ (via weak
moisture advection from Baja California), most locations will see
5-15% RH values by early afternoon. Widespread sustained winds
between 15-25 mph are possible as early as 18 UTC, and will likely
peak during the late afternoon hours. Wind gusts between 30-40 mph
are probable across the Critical risk area, and may support periods
of extremely critical conditions across the southern High Plains
where 30-35 mph gusts may coincide with 5-10% RH. While forecast
confidence remains high for most of the region, the southward
progression of the cold front through the afternoon remains somewhat
uncertain and may limit the northeastern extent of fire weather
concerns across northeast NM and west TX.

...Southern Nevada...
A cold front is noted in early-morning surface observations pushing
southward across NV. Despite cooler post-frontal air, mostly clear
skies this afternoon will support sufficient diurnal warming/drying
for RH values to fall into the low teens. Gusty 15-20 mph winds
behind the front will support elevated fire weather concerns this
afternoon.

...Sacramento Valley...
Northerly post-frontal winds are already being observed through the
Sacramento Valley. This downslope flow regime will persist through
the day and support RH reductions down to near 15% by late
afternoon. Fuels through most of the valley have begun to cure
(especially through the foothills per latest ERC analyses), which
will support the fire weather threat this afternoon.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
247 PM EDT Fri May 20 2022

Valid 12Z Mon May 23 2022 - 12Z Fri May 27 2022

...Heavy Rainfall/Runoff and Strong Thunderstorm Threat from the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the
Ohio Valley and Great Lakes early-mid next week...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A lead front is forecast to push across the South and East into
Monday to end the protracted heat wave over the South and also
usher in a cooler and more comfortable airmass over much of the
eastern U.S. after a sweltering weekend. Meanwhile, a rather
active weather pattern is expected to develop across the
continental U.S. going into next week, as multiple waves of low
pressure develop along a resurgent frontal boundary from the
Plains to the Great Lakes. This will be in response to a building
upper level trough over the High Plains and this main system will
slowly move eastward through next week. This offers a widespread
threat for heavy rainfall/convection and local runoff issues as
moisture and instability focus ahead/over the well organized and
wavy system. The experimental WPC Day 4/5 excessive rainfall
outlook has a "slight" risk from the southern Plains to the lower
Mississippi Valley, with activity spreading up through the Midwest
and eventually across the East. Meanwhile, a warming pattern over
the West by early-mid next week may be partially supplanted late
week as Pacific upper troughing works a front inland with modest
precipitation across the Northwest in an otherwise mainly dry week
west of the Rockies.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Forecast spread has decreased significantly with the latest model
runs whose mid-larger scale flow evolutions are now much better
clustered with the ensemble means days 3-7. While local convective
rainfall focus remains much less settled through medium range time
scales, guidance offers fairly consistent and uniform regional
areas of threat. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS and 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models (NBM)
days 3-5 (Monday-Wednesday) before enough uncertainty is
introduced to gravitate more toward the 06 UTC GEFS mean and 00
UTC ECMWF ensemble mean along with the best matched GFS/ECMWF and
NBM for better local detail consistent with predictability. This
general plan maintains good WPC product continuity and seems in
line with latest overall 12 UTC models and ensembles despite local
convective focus differences along with some lingering run to run
system timing/amplitude differences.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Temperatures behind the cold front exiting the East Coast next
week should return to near seasonal levels after a potentially
record setting early season heatwave. Low pressure forming along
the trailing front as it meanders near the Southeast Coast may
continue a moderate to heavy rainfall threat into Monday as well
for the southern Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

The next system developing over the south-central U.S. into
early-mid next week is expected to become the main weather
headline of this forecast period. There will likely be widespread
convection and heavy rainfall from the southern Plains to the Ohio
Valley with moist return flow into another slow moving and wavy
frontal system. There is the potential for flash flooding with the
slower moving storms within a very moist and unstable atmosphere.
The potential exists for additional heavy rain as the system
translates eastward into mid-later next week.

The western-central U.S. trough should keep temperatures below
normal across Rockies and Plains through at least Tuesday. Much of
the Western U.S. should remain mainly dry through the middle of
next week as upper ridging builds over the region and warmer
temperatures expand across the region, with the exception of some
showers entering the Northwest into Friday. This may lead to an
excessive heat episode over interior California and the Desert
Southwest next week, with lead transient system warming across the
Intermounmtain West.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri May 20 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 26 - 30 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting below normal 500-
hPa
heights across most of the higher latitudes of North America, consistent wi=
th
a
continuation of a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). In the mea=
n
mid-level height fields, a trough over the Aleutians and the Gulf of Alaska
extending to the Northwest is forecast. A ridge and above normal 500-hPa
heights are forecast across much of the central CONUS. Another trough is
likely
farther downstream over the eastern CONUS resulting in above normal 500-hPa
heights shifted eastward to the Northeast..

Above normal temperatures are favored over parts of southwestern Mainland
Alaska associated with predicted above normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal
temperatures are most likely for parts of eastern and northern Alaska due t=
o
persistent troughing. Probabilities for near to above normal temperatures a=
re
increased across much of the southwestern CONUS and High Plains due to
relatively high mid-level heights. Increased probabilities of near to below
normal temperatures are favored for the Pacific Northwest and the Lower and
Central Mississippi Valley in association with forecast troughing.
Probabilities for above normal temperatures are increased across the Florid=
a
Peninsula and Middle Atlantic States extending to the northeastern CONUS
consistent with predicted near to above normal 500-hPa heights.

Above normal precipitation is  favored for the northwestern CONUS and North=
ern
Plains as troughing is forecast to approach the Pacific Northwest. Enhanced
probabilities for near to below normal precipitation are indicated for the
Southern and Central Plains and Mississippi Valley during the period relate=
d
to
predicted above normal heights, supported by the consolidation forecast too=
l.
Probabilities of near to above normal precipitation are enhanced across the
eastern CONUS, ahead of a mean trough forecast over the east-central CONUS.=
 A
slightly drier pattern is likely for southwestern Mainland Alaska in
association with predicted above normal heights. Above normal precipitation=
 is
favored for eastern Mainland Alaska due to a mean mid-level trough.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by increasing uncertainty depicted by the temperatu=
re
and precipitation forecast tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 28 - JUN 03, 2022

During week-2, a mid-level trough is predicted to persist over Alaska and t=
he
Gulf of Alaska. With a separated flow downstream, troughing is favored to
propagate across the western CONUS, resulting in below normal 500-hPa heigh=
ts
in the manual blend over much of the western CONUS. An enhanced 500-hPa rid=
ge
is forecast to cross the eastern half CONUS associated with above normal
500-hPa heights.

Given the predicted propagation of anomalous troughing across the western
CONUS, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate elevated
probabilities
for below normal temperatures across most of the western CONUS. Above norma=
l
temperature probabilities are increased over the central and eastern CONUS,
related to the above normal 500-hPa heights. Elevated probabilities for nea=
r
to
below normal temperatures remain favored for much of Alaska due to forecast
troughing,  except  for parts of the southern coast of Alaska, where above
normal temperatures are consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Elevated probabilities for above normal precipitation are indicated over th=
e
Northwest, Northern and Central Great Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley,
along with increased potential for surface low development and frontal
activity. Both reforecast tools support enhanced below normal precipitation
probabilities across parts of the Southern Rockies, Central and Southern
Plains
and parts of the eastern CONUS due to persistent ridging except for the
Florida
Peninsula, where probabilities for above normal precipitation are favored
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Slightly elevated
probabilities for above normal precipitation are likely for eastern Alaska =
in
association with the troughing, while below normal precipitation is favored
for
southwestern Mainland Alaska in association with the above normal 500-hPa
heights.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 10% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
the potential for a significant pattern change during the period and
associated
substantial model disagreements.


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 16.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CDT Fri May 20 2022/

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure will become established over the
central/southern Plains through the day Saturday in the wake of the
surface cold front. Aloft, the departure of an embedded shortwave
disturbance will ease mid and upper-level wind speeds over the
southwestern CONUS. These factors will yield diminished fire weather
concerns compared to previous days for the Southwest and southern
High Plains where fuels are critically dry. Despite this, regional
fire weather concerns are expected for parts of central to southern
NM where pressure-gradient winds and dry conditions will maintain
fire weather concerns.

...Central to southern NM...
Modest moisture advection from Baja CA into AZ and cooler
post-frontal conditions across eastern NM will result in a pocket of
dry conditions across central/southern NM. RH values within this
region are forecast to fall into the 10-15% range by late afternoon
amid mostly clear skies. Despite the surface high over the southern
Plains, continued zonal flow over the central Rockies will support
modest lee troughing in the immediate lee of the terrain - mainly
over north-central NM based on hi-res and ensemble guidance. The
resulting pressure gradient over central to southern NM should
support sustained winds near 15 mph and at least elevated fire
weather conditions. Localized critical conditions are possible, but
mainly across the lower desert terrain where fuel loading is poor.

300 PM EDT May 20 2022

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is predominately favored over the eastern
half of the Lower 48, promoting generally above-normal temperatures through=
out
this region, and potential periods of excessive heat over parts of the
south-central U.S., especially during the first half of week-2. This presen=
ts
a
risk of rapid onset drought over Deep South Texas, where subnormal
precipitation and possible gusty winds exacerbate the heat. Farther west, a
significant mid-level trough is expected to slowly push eastward while
weakening. This could spawn several surface low pressure systems over the
western half of the Lower 48, creating a significant risk of another high
winds
episode over much of the Central and Southern Plains for the first half of
week-2, and somewhat enhancing high wind chances more generally over a larg=
e
portion of the Great Plains, Rockies, and southern Great Basin. This set-up
may
also spawn a late-season heavy snow event over a large part of western
Wyoming,
including parts of Yellowstone National Park, over Memorial Day Weekend.
Meanwhile, a fetch of tropical moisture from the Atlantic Ocean brings the
potential for one or more heavy rainfall events to the Florida Peninsula, a=
nd
springtime flooding remains a concern over parts of the Upper Midwest and s=
ome
river valleys across central and eastern Mainland Alaska.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for the southern High Plains and southweste=
rn
Great Plains, Sat-Tue, May 28-31.

Moderate risk of high winds across much of the Central and Southern Plains =
and
adjacent central Rockies, Sat-Mon, May 28-30.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Central and Southern Plai=
ns
and southern New Mexico, Sat-Fri, May 28-Jun 3.

Slight risk of high winds across much of the Great Plains, Rockies, and
southern Great Basin, and the Desert Southwest, Sat-Wed, May 28-Jun 1.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MAY 23 - FRIDAY MAY 27:

HuJ1jvBIN30V9UYLwI4TrABTFkIAD0$

FOR SATURDAY MAY 28 - FRIDAY JUNE 03: Models are in good general agreement
showing week-2 starting out with a fairly amplified mid-level trough along =
the
West Coast (stronger than most models showed yesterday) and a mid-level rid=
ge
with the greatest positive 500-hPa height anomalies just east of New Englan=
d.
As week-2 progresses, the western CONUS trough slowly drifts eastward and
weakens while building and reinforcing the eastern ridge to cover much of
southeastern Canada and the northeastern CONUS. South of this ridge, an
easterly surface and mid-level fetch of moisture-laden air may develop over
the
Florida Peninsula lasting much of much of week-2. The biggest point of
contention among the tools is how much tropical moisture gets advected fart=
her
west into the Gulf of Mexico and potentially Deep South Texas during week-2=
.
The preponderance of tools shows little precipitation in the region, which
would combine with the hot temperatures and potentially gusty winds to indu=
ce
a
risk of rapid onset drought there, but the Canadian ensemble mean brings in=
 a
significant amount of rain during this period. Given this, plus the global
long-term models=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD difficulty in handling tropical=
 moisture and storm
systems,
rapid drought onset is significantly uncertain at this time. However, given
the
favored heat and dryness during the next week to ten days, a rapid onset
drought risk is posted for southern Texas.



With the eastern North American ridge in place at the start of week-2, and
with
almost all tools pointing toward this feature broadening and increasing in
magnitude during the ensuing 7 days, above-normal temperatures appear likel=
y
to
affect most of the central and eastern CONUS. Excessive heat looks like a
significant risk in the west-central and south-central parts of the Plains,
particularly early in the period. Farther east, much above normal temperatu=
res
and summery heat may settle over the Great Lakes and Northeast, but it does
not
currently look like excessive heat thresholds will be met there.



With the preponderance of the models favoring a moderately deep mid-level
trough moving slowly through the western CONUS, individual shortwaves movin=
g
through the mean trough should induce one or more surface low pressure syst=
ems
in the western half of the CONUS and southern Canada. One storm system earl=
y
week-2 poses a threat for a late-season heavy snow event over western Wyomi=
ng
during Memorial Day Weekend, including parts of Yellowstone National Park. =
But
most of these systems will be moisture-starved, accompanied by little
precipitation, but the pressure gradient established to the east and south =
of
these systems will bring the threat for more periods of high winds to much =
of
the Rockies and Plains, with the reforecast tools showing similar hazard
threats as they have before with many of the high winds episodes plaguing t=
he
region during the last few months. Thus, a slight to moderate risk of high
winds remains posted throughout many portions of the western and central
CONUS.
 This will keep the wildfire threat relatively high over the southern half =
of
the Plains and Rockies through at least the middle of week-2.



For precipitation, the GEFS and the Canadian ensembles show a deep, moist
fetch
of air from the Atlantic Ocean into Florida. This enhances the chances for =
one
or more episodes of heavy rain across the Florida Peninsula during the earl=
y
and middle part of week-2, and a slight risk of heavy precipitation is issu=
ed
for the region for May 28-Jun 1. The European ensemble mean shows a similar
pattern, and is bringing more rainfall into Florida than it indicated
yesterday.



Over the north-central CONUS, there is ongoing flooding in the Red River
Valley
of the North, neighboring parts of the James River basin, parts of the
Sheyenne
River Basin, and across northern Minnesota due to antecedent above-normal
precipitation and seasonal snowmelt. With above-normal precipitation favore=
d
during the next two weeks across the north-central CONUS, the flooding risk=
 is
likely to persist into week-2. Thus the corresponding flooding possible are=
as
remain posted in today's outlook.



In Alaska, a deep higher-elevation snowpack remains in place near the Tanan=
a
Valley, and with above-normal temperatures reaching into the low 70=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs deg.
F,
rapid snowmelt will continue the threat for flooding in this area.

...Strong to severe storms possible from the Northeast to the
Southern Plains this weekend...

...Record-breaking heat expected from the Northeast to the
Southern Plains this weekend...

...Late-season winter storm to bring heavy snow to portions of the
central Rockies through Saturday...

A strong cold front, currently extending from the Great Lakes back
into the southwestern U.S., will slowly shift farther south and
east into the weekend.  From the Great Lakes and Northeast back
into the southern Great Plains, this front will likely be the
focus for numerous showers and thunderstorms.  Some of these
storms may become strong to severe, especially across portions of
northern Lower Michigan and a small portion of southern Oklahoma
and northern Texas near the Red River this evening.  A more
expansive threat may unfold tomorrow with scattered severe
thunderstorms capable of producing damaging winds and large hail
possible during the afternoon and evening from eastern Texas, into
the mid Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, and the Northeast.  On
Sunday, the threat for severe weather can be expected again across
portions of the Northeast. In addition to damaging winds and hail,
heavy rainfall, resulting in isolated to localized flash flooding,
may become a concern also.

Ahead of the front, well-above normal to record-breaking
temperatures will continue to surge north through the eastern U.S.
 From the Ohio Valley into the Mid Atlantic and Northeast, expect
numerous temperature records to be tied or broken tomorrow as
daytime temperatures climb as much as 20 degrees above normal,
while remaining well above their typical overnight lows as well.
It will remain hot for another day across eastern Texas into the
lower Mississippi Valley as well, with more records likely on
Saturday before the front arrives and a dramatic cooldown begins
for the latter half of the weekend.

While fire weather concerns are expected to be comparatively less
than those of previous days, regional concerns are expected to
continue for portions of the Southwest, where dry and windy
conditions may continue to promote conditions favorable for rapid
fire growth.

Behind the front, well-below normal temperatures will continue to
spread south and east across the northern to central Rockies and
Great Plains.  Freeze watches and warning, along with frost
advisories, currently extend from northern Minnesota to the
central Rockies.  A winter storm warning remains in effect for
portions of the central Rockies into the adjacent high plains,
including the Denver metro.  A late season winter storm is
expected to produce at least a few inches along the I-25 corridor
from Cheyenne to Denver, with amounts of a foot or more possible
across the mountains farther to the west and along the Palmer
Divide.

...Heavy Rainfall/Runoff and Strong Thunderstorm Threat from the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the
Ohio Valley and Great Lakes early-mid next week...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A lead front is forecast to push across the South and East into
Monday to end the protracted heat wave over the South and also
usher in a cooler and more comfortable airmass over much of the
eastern U.S. after a sweltering weekend. Meanwhile, a rather
active weather pattern is expected to develop across the
continental U.S. going into next week, as multiple waves of low
pressure develop along a resurgent frontal boundary from the
Plains to the Great Lakes. This will be in response to a building
upper level trough over the High Plains and this main system will
slowly move eastward through next week. This offers a widespread
threat for heavy rainfall/convection and local runoff issues as
moisture and instability focus ahead/over the well organized and
wavy system. The experimental WPC Day 4/5 excessive rainfall
outlook has a "slight" risk from the southern Plains to the lower
Mississippi Valley, with activity spreading up through the Midwest
and eventually across the East. Meanwhile, a warming pattern over
the West by early-mid next week may be partially supplanted late
week as Pacific upper troughing works a front inland with modest
precipitation across the Northwest in an otherwise mainly dry week
west of the Rockies.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Forecast spread has decreased significantly with the latest model
runs whose mid-larger scale flow evolutions are now much better
clustered with the ensemble means days 3-7. While local convective
rainfall focus remains much less settled through medium range time
scales, guidance offers fairly consistent and uniform regional
areas of threat. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS and 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models (NBM)
days 3-5 (Monday-Wednesday) before enough uncertainty is
introduced to gravitate more toward the 06 UTC GEFS mean and 00
UTC ECMWF ensemble mean along with the best matched GFS/ECMWF and
NBM for better local detail consistent with predictability. This
general plan maintains good WPC product continuity and seems in
line with latest overall 12 UTC models and ensembles despite local
convective focus differences along with some lingering run to run
system timing/amplitude differences.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Temperatures behind the cold front exiting the East Coast next
week should return to near seasonal levels after a potentially
record setting early season heatwave. Low pressure forming along
the trailing front as it meanders near the Southeast Coast may
continue a moderate to heavy rainfall threat into Monday as well
for the southern Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

The next system developing over the south-central U.S. into
early-mid next week is expected to become the main weather
headline of this forecast period. There will likely be widespread
convection and heavy rainfall from the southern Plains to the Ohio
Valley with moist return flow into another slow moving and wavy
frontal system. There is the potential for flash flooding with the
slower moving storms within a very moist and unstable atmosphere.
The potential exists for additional heavy rain as the system
translates eastward into mid-later next week.

The western-central U.S. trough should keep temperatures below
normal across Rockies and Plains through at least Tuesday. Much of
the Western U.S. should remain mainly dry through the middle of
next week as upper ridging builds over the region and warmer
temperatures expand across the region, with the exception of some
showers entering the Northwest into Friday. This may lead to an
excessive heat episode over interior California and the Desert
Southwest next week, with lead transient system warming across the
Intermounmtain West.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
536 PM EDT Fri May 20 2022

Valid 12Z Mon May 23 2022 - 12Z Fri May 27 2022

...Heavy Rainfall/Runoff and Strong Thunderstorm Threat from the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the
Ohio Valley and Great Lakes early-mid next week...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A lead front is forecast to push across the South and East into
Monday to end the protracted heat wave over the South and also
usher in a cooler and more comfortable airmass over much of the
eastern U.S. after a sweltering weekend. Meanwhile, a rather
active weather pattern is expected to develop across the
continental U.S. going into next week, as multiple waves of low
pressure develop along a resurgent frontal boundary from the
Plains to the Great Lakes. This will be in response to a building
upper level trough over the High Plains and this main system will
slowly move eastward through next week. This offers a widespread
threat for heavy rainfall/convection and local runoff issues as
moisture and instability focus ahead/over the well organized and
wavy system. The experimental WPC Day 4/5 excessive rainfall
outlook has a "slight" risk from the southern Plains to the lower
Mississippi Valley, with activity spreading up through the Midwest
and eventually across the East. Meanwhile, a warming pattern over
the West by early-mid next week may be partially supplanted late
week as Pacific upper troughing works a front inland with modest
precipitation across the Northwest in an otherwise mainly dry week
west of the Rockies.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Forecast spread has decreased significantly with the latest model
runs whose mid-larger scale flow evolutions are now much better
clustered with the ensemble means days 3-7. While local convective
rainfall focus remains much less settled through medium range time
scales, guidance offers fairly consistent and uniform regional
areas of threat. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS and 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models (NBM)
days 3-5 (Monday-Wednesday) before enough uncertainty is
introduced to gravitate more toward the 06 UTC GEFS mean and 00
UTC ECMWF ensemble mean along with the best matched GFS/ECMWF and
NBM for better local detail consistent with predictability. This
general plan maintains good WPC product continuity and seems in
line with latest overall 12 UTC models and ensembles despite local
convective focus differences along with some lingering run to run
system timing/amplitude differences.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Temperatures behind the cold front exiting the East Coast next
week should return to near seasonal levels after a potentially
record setting early season heatwave. Low pressure forming along
the trailing front as it meanders near the Southeast Coast may
continue a moderate to heavy rainfall threat into Monday as well
for the southern Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

The next system developing over the south-central U.S. into
early-mid next week is expected to become the main weather
headline of this forecast period. There will likely be widespread
convection and heavy rainfall from the southern Plains to the Ohio
Valley with moist return flow into another slow moving and wavy
frontal system. There is the potential for flash flooding with the
slower moving storms within a very moist and unstable atmosphere.
The potential exists for additional heavy rain as the system
translates eastward into mid-later next week.

The western-central U.S. trough should keep temperatures below
normal across Rockies and Plains through at least Tuesday. Much of
the Western U.S. should remain mainly dry through the middle of
next week as upper ridging builds over the region and warmer
temperatures expand across the region, with the exception of some
showers entering the Northwest into Friday. This may lead to an
excessive heat episode over interior California and the Desert
Southwest next week, with lead transient system warming across the
Intermounmtain West.

...Record heat in the East; record cold in the Rockies...

...Strong to severe storms possible from the Northeast to the
Southern Plains this weekend...

...Heavy snow ending late this morning over portions of the
central Rockies...

While it may look and feel like a return to winter over portions
of Colorado, mid-summer heat will grasp much of the East today and
linger into tomorrow over New England. A dip in the jet stream
will maintain much cooler than normal temperatures for the Rockies
into the Plains, with a strong cold front separating it from the
hot weather in the East. Along and ahead of this boundary, showers
and thunderstorms will again be common today with heavy rain/flash
flooding possible over the middle Mississippi Valley. In addition,
severe weather is possible anywhere from Texas northeastward to
northern New England today. Storms may be capable of producing
damaging winds and large hail. Temperatures to the east of the
cold front will be well above normal with many areas near record
highs for the date. This will also be the warmest day of the year
so far for some. 90s will be common even into the Northeast which
is about 20-25 degrees above normal. Heat advisories are in effect
for today. Behind the front, snow will gradually diminish through
the day over Colorado but temperatures will remain very cold for
late May -- nearly 40 degrees below normal.

On Sunday, the cold front will progress eastward into the
Northeast but slow as it moves into the Lower Mississippi Valley.
This will be the focus for heavy rain/flash flooding though many
thunderstorms can produce heavy rain. In the Northeast, Sunday
will bring another chance of severe weather as the front slowly
moves eastward. Temperatures will rise into the 80s and 90s once
again after a steamy start with lows only in the upper 60s to mid
70s. Farther west, Sunday will bring much cooler weather to the
Midwest, middle Mississippi Valley, and much of Texas behind the
cold front. Many areas will see highs about 20 degrees cooler on
Sunday compared to Saturday. Sunday night into Monday, the front
will push off the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic coast but stall
across the Southeast, maintaining a chance of showers and some
storms.

While fire weather concerns are expected to be comparatively less
than those of previous days, regional concerns are expected to
continue for portions of New Mexico, where dry and windy
conditions may continue to promote conditions favorable for rapid
fire growth.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1247 AM CDT Sat May 21 2022

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
Early-morning surface observations reveal a cold front continuing to
push southward across the southern Plains. Behind this front,
pressure rises denote a building surface high across the central
High Plains, which is forecast to migrate into the southern Plains
over the next 24 hours. Consequently, weaker winds and cooler
temperatures will limit fire weather concerns compared to previous
days for most of the southern High Plains. Regional fire weather
concerns are expected for parts of the Southwest where warm/dry
conditions will persist.

...Central to southern New Mexico...
Poor overnight RH recovery is noted across central to southern NM
with RH values generally between 10-20%. These dry conditions will
linger into the afternoon as the cold front stalls to the east due
to terrain blocking. Despite persistent zonal flow aloft, the
building surface high will limit any lee troughing to northern NM
where a weak low is noted in morning observations. This low will
likely undergo slight thermally-induced deepening through the day.
As a result, the tightening regional pressure gradient over
central/southern NM and parts of far eastern AZ should support
sustained winds between 15-20 mph. Diurnal RH reductions to well
below 15% are likely, and will support elevated fire weather
conditions. Localized critical conditions are possible, but are most
likely to occur through the lower desert terrain (roughly along the
I-25 corridor) where fuel loading is minimal. Additionally, poor
upper-level wind support will mitigate the potential for
sufficiently widespread/persistent critical conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CDT Sat May 21 2022

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns appear likely for Sunday afternoon across
parts of the Southwest and Four Corners region. An upper-level
disturbance embedded within the mean trough will approach the Four
Corners region on Sunday. Falling heights aloft will support surface
pressure falls over the central Rockies, which should boost regional
pressure-gradient winds from the eastern Great Basin, into the
Southwest, and across the High Plains. Increasing winds within an
antecedent dry air mass with receptive fuels will support at least
elevated fire weather concerns, though some regional details remain
uncertain.

...Arizona into New Mexico...
Sustained winds between 15-20 mph appear likely across eastern AZ
into western NM by late Sunday afternoon amid surface pressure falls
to the north across UT/CO. An antecedent dry air mass will support
widespread RH reductions to 10-15% by peak heating, and already
receptive fuels will contribute to the fire weather potential. Good
agreement among ensemble and deterministic solutions yields high
confidence in elevated conditions, and areas of critical conditions
are possible across parts of northeast AZ/northwest NM where
sustained winds may exceed 20 mph. Somewhat weak mid/upper-level
winds limits confidence in this scenario at this time, but a
Critical risk area may be introduced if the potential for widespread
sustained 20+ mph winds increases.

...Eastern Nevada into Utah...
Most deterministic solutions hint at areas of 15-20 mph winds
overlapping with 15-25% RH values across eastern NV into much of UT
Sunday afternoon. However, considerable spread in both the coverage
and duration of these conditions is noted, and similar spread is
observed in ensemble solutions. Furthermore, the coverage of
receptive fuels across this region is patchy based on recent ERC
analyses, so the overlap of elevated fire weather conditions with
receptive fuels is somewhat unclear. This uncertainty precludes
highlights at this time, but the potential for elevated fire weather
conditions is noted and a risk area may be introduced in subsequent
forecast updates.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
A dry return-flow pattern is expected for Sunday afternoon with
winds increasing to 15-20 mph from western OK and the TX Panhandle
into western KS/eastern CO. The recent frontal intrusion into the
Southern Plains will limit moisture return with 20-30% RH likely
across the region. However, ongoing rainfall (as of early Saturday
morning) across parts of western OK, northwest KS, and eastern CO
introduce some uncertainty regarding fuel status by Sunday
afternoon. Fuel trends will be monitored over the next 24 hours, and
highlights may be needed if confidence in the fire weather potential
increases.

...Sacramento Valley...
A northerly, down-valley flow regime is expected Sunday afternoon
for the Sacramento Valley. An unseasonably dry air mass currently
over northern CA (where dewpoints are currently near the 10th
percentile for mid/late May) will linger into Sunday and support RH
reductions down to 15-20%. Ensemble guidance suggests winds between
10-15 mph are likely, which may support areas of elevated fire
weather concerns.

...Heavy Rainfall and Strong Thunderstorm Threat from the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the Ohio Valley
and Great Lakes early-mid next week...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A rather active weather pattern is expected to develop across the
continental U.S. going into the middle of next week, as multiple
waves of low pressure develop along a frontal boundary situated
over the Plains and extending to the Great Lakes.  This will be in
response to a building upper level trough over the western High
Plains that will slowly move eastward through the week with the
front reaching the East Coast by Friday.  Meanwhile, a second
storm system is progged to reach the Pacific Northwest by late
Thursday and then reach the Rockies and the northern Plains by
early Saturday, although not currently expected to be as impactful
as the earlier event across the Plains.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in decent synoptic scale agreement
for the beginning to middle of next week, and there has been more
consolidation and less model spread compared to this time
yesterday.  However, there is still uncertainty with regards to
placement of heaviest QPF maxima as these will be the result of
multiple MCS clusters.  There are more model differences apparent
with the trough entering the Pacific Northwest by Thursday, with
the 00Z GFS indicating a faster solution and becoming more
amplified by Friday and Saturday with a closed upper low
developing.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily
derived from a multi-deterministic model consensus through
Wednesday, and then incorporated more of the ensemble means for
the Thursday-Saturday time period while still maintaining some of
the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

The next system developing over the south-central U.S. into
early-mid next week is expected to become the main weather
headline of this forecast period.  There will likely be widespread
convection and heavy rainfall from central/eastern Texas to the
Great Lakes with moist return flow into another slow moving and
wavy frontal system.  There is an increasing potential for some
flash flooding with the slower moving storms within a very moist
and unstable atmosphere.  The latest WPC experimental Excessive
Rainfall Outlook indicates a Slight Risk area for both Tuesday and
Wednesday across the ArkLaTex region and extending across Arkansas
and into western Tennessee, and the potential exists for 3 to 6
inch rainfall totals over that 48 hour time period.  Some severe
storms are certainly within the realm of possibility for these
same general areas where parameters of shear and instability are
greatest, although model differences remain on the placement of
MCS activity.

The west-central U.S. trough should initially keep temperatures
below normal across Rockies and extending across the central
Plains through about Wednesday before much warmer weather returns
by the end of the week.  Some late season snow showers will also
be possible across the higher terrain of central Colorado on
Tuesday.  Much of the southwestern U.S. should remain dry through
the end of next week as upper ridging builds over the region and
warmer temperatures expand across the region.  Building heat
across interior portions of California and the Desert Southwest
could result in highs running 10-20 degrees above normal for some
areas, with widespread 100+ degree high temperatures for the lower
elevations.  There will likely be some showers across the Pacific
Northwest by Friday and then reaching the northern Rockies by

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
258 AM EDT Sat May 21 2022

Valid 12Z Tue May 24 2022 - 12Z Sat May 28 2022

...Heavy Rainfall and Strong Thunderstorm Threat from the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the Ohio Valley
and Great Lakes early-mid next week...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A rather active weather pattern is expected to develop across the
continental U.S. going into the middle of next week, as multiple
waves of low pressure develop along a frontal boundary situated
over the Plains and extending to the Great Lakes.  This will be in
response to a building upper level trough over the western High
Plains that will slowly move eastward through the week with the
front reaching the East Coast by Friday.  Meanwhile, a second
storm system is progged to reach the Pacific Northwest by late
Thursday and then reach the Rockies and the northern Plains by
early Saturday, although not currently expected to be as impactful
as the earlier event across the Plains.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in decent synoptic scale agreement
for the beginning to middle of next week, and there has been more
consolidation and less model spread compared to this time
yesterday.  However, there is still uncertainty with regards to
placement of heaviest QPF maxima as these will be the result of
multiple MCS clusters.  There are more model differences apparent
with the trough entering the Pacific Northwest by Thursday, with
the 00Z GFS indicating a faster solution and becoming more
amplified by Friday and Saturday with a closed upper low
developing.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily
derived from a multi-deterministic model consensus through
Wednesday, and then incorporated more of the ensemble means for
the Thursday-Saturday time period while still maintaining some of
the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

The next system developing over the south-central U.S. into
early-mid next week is expected to become the main weather
headline of this forecast period.  There will likely be widespread
convection and heavy rainfall from central/eastern Texas to the
Great Lakes with moist return flow into another slow moving and
wavy frontal system.  There is an increasing potential for some
flash flooding with the slower moving storms within a very moist
and unstable atmosphere.  The latest WPC experimental Excessive
Rainfall Outlook indicates a Slight Risk area for both Tuesday and
Wednesday across the ArkLaTex region and extending across Arkansas
and into western Tennessee, and the potential exists for 3 to 6
inch rainfall totals over that 48 hour time period.  Some severe
storms are certainly within the realm of possibility for these
same general areas where parameters of shear and instability are
greatest, although model differences remain on the placement of
MCS activity.

The west-central U.S. trough should initially keep temperatures
below normal across Rockies and extending across the central
Plains through about Wednesday before much warmer weather returns
by the end of the week.  Some late season snow showers will also
be possible across the higher terrain of central Colorado on
Tuesday.  Much of the southwestern U.S. should remain dry through
the end of next week as upper ridging builds over the region and
warmer temperatures expand across the region.  Building heat
across interior portions of California and the Desert Southwest
could result in highs running 10-20 degrees above normal for some
areas, with widespread 100+ degree high temperatures for the lower
elevations.  There will likely be some showers across the Pacific
Northwest by Friday and then reaching the northern Rockies by
Saturday as the next front enters this region.

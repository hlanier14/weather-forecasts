Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1032 AM CST Mon Feb 21 2022

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Some adjustments were made to southern portions of the elevated
region. Given surface observations and cloud cover, fire weather
risk outside of northern portions of the Permian Basin and
Trans-Pecos should be brief if they do materialize.

Based on the timing of the shortwave trough, now in southern New
Mexico on water vapor imagery, the peak fire weather concern will
likely fall within the 2-6 PM CST time window. During this time,
locally extremely critical conditions may occur in southern portions
of the Texas Panhandle and adjacent South Plains. Winds will
diminish after 6 PM and RH will recover from the north with the cold
front's advance and from the south with Gulf moisture return.

..Wendt.. 02/21/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CST Mon Feb 21 2022/

...Synopsis...
Active mid-level southwesterly flow is forecast today across much of
the Southwest and southern Rockies/Plains. Within the southwest
flow, several shortwave troughs will move east and intensify ahead
of a broad but deepening trough across the West. As the strong flow
overspread the Rockies and southern Plains, a deepening lee
cyclone/surface trough will force dry downslope winds ahead of an
arctic front moving quickly south. With plentiful fuels in place,
the dry westerly flow will support widespread critical fire weather
conditions across portions of the southern High Plains.

...Southern Plains into southern New Mexico...
Ahead of the intensifying lee cyclone and cold front, strong
west-southwesterly winds are expected to develop by mid morning
across eastern NM and west TX. Continued amplification of the
surface flow is expected through the afternoon, as the top of the
well-mixed boundary layer intersects with an 80 kt speed max aloft.
With model soundings showing PBL depth of several kilometers,
widespread sustained winds of 25-40 mph appear likely with some
higher gusts possible. Owing to the well-mixed nature of the lower
atmosphere and downslope flow off the southern Rockies, low to very
low surface RH values are expected through peak heating. Hi-res
ensemble guidance shows strong confidence in widespread RH below
15%, with minimums in the high single digits possible across the
TX/OK Panhandles and eastern NM. The combination of strong winds and
low humidity will support widespread critical fire weather
conditions. Some potential for locally extremely critical conditions
may also develop where higher gusts and single digit RH can be
realized.

Farther south across southwest and south-central TX, greater
uncertainty in the spatial coverage of elevated/critical fire
weather conditions exists. While surface wind fields are projected
to remain quite strong, low-level moisture advection may result in
surface RH values above elevated/critical thresholds. Some potential
for high-based showers or even a few thunderstorms may also limit
the diurnal RH, especially later in the afternoon. Despite the
uncertainty on marginal RH criteria, the presence of very dry fuels
and the strong winds suggests some potential for fire weather
conditions. Portions of the critical area have been trimmed to the
northwest, but elevated highlights will be kept to account for the
threat.

...Heavy snow and ice threat spreads across the northern
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast into Friday...


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles still offer a reasonably similar larger scale
pattern evolution through medium range time scales and a guidance
composite seems ok for Friday. However, differences with the
handling of smaller scale embedded systems is more varied,
particularly from the weekend into next week with southern stream
energies digging into the West before ejecting out across the
central and eastern states. The 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET and to a lesser
extent the 12 UTC ECMWF/Canadian ensemble means are overall more
amplified/less progressive than the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean and 12
UTC Canadian. Preferred a solution slightly on the more amplified
side of the full envelope of solutions, most in line with the
ECMWF ensemble mean, considering the bulk of guidance works an
amplified upper ridge upstream into the West Coast. However, the
00 UTC models do not offer great run to run continuity with these
suspect southern stream systems.


...Pattern Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A potent ejecting southern stream shortwave will interact with
northern stream energies over the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley Friday.
Moisture will stream over a leading front to fuel enhanced
precipitation across the high pressure/cold air dammed northern
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Frontal wave approach and coastal low
reformation will favor a pronounced swath of significant snow and
ice on the northern/western side of the precipitation shield that
will lift enhanced in the right entrance region of a strong upper
jet. Cold high pressure will settle across much of the country in
the wake of this system. This will include Friday some record cold
pockets both over CA/AZ and the Plains as well as lingering record
pre-frontal warmth under amplified upper ridging over the
Southeast. Overall, the pattern will favor a drier pattern for
many. An exception may be from The South through the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic Saturday-Monday where uncertain ejecting
shortwave amplitude may be sufficient to support a swath of
enhanced precipitation. Another exception may be with advent of
modest precipitation for the Pacific Northwest starting this
weekend with the likely slow approach of northeast Pacific systems.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 AM CST Tue Feb 22 2022

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a potent western US trough will remain mostly
stationary while it deepens significantly through much of the day.
Strong southwesterly flow ahead of the trough will reside over the
Southwest and southern Rockies as a surface low moves off to the
east. Associated with the low, a backdoor cold front is forecast to
move south/southwest across the southern High Plains. The strong
winds and dry surface conditions ahead of the front will support
elevated fire weather potential across eastern NM and west TX.

...Southeastern New Mexico and far west Texas...
As the trough across the western US continues to deepen, strong flow
aloft will linger across the Southwest and southern High Plains. The
surface cold front will gradually move westward through portions of
West TX, as cold air surges southward. Despite a temporary
slackening of the surface pressure gradients from the departing lee
cyclone, the residual dry and well-mixed boundary layer and strong
flow aloft should support gusty surface winds and low RH of 10-20%.
The greatest confidence in sustained fire weather concerns will be
across southeastern NM farthest from the westward-moving front. To
the east, model uncertainty suggests some of west TX may only
experience a few hours of fire weather conditions before the arrival
of the colder airmass. Despite this concern, dry fuels across much
of southern NM and west TX will support elevated fire weather
conditions.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO
AND SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper trough and attendant 100 kt speed max over the southern
Great Basin are forecast to begin moving east across the
Southwest/southern Rockies Wednesday. As the trough and jet move
eastward, a strong cyclone will develop across the southern Great
Basin. Strong flow aloft associated with the powerful mid-level jet
and cyclone will overspread much of northern MX, southern NM and
southwest TX, supporting strong surface winds. Dry fuels along with
the warm and windy conditions will likely support critical fire
weather conditions Wednesday.

...Southern New Mexico...
Ahead of the eastward-moving trough and strong speed max, dry and
warm surface conditions are likely across much of southern NM. Deep
vertical mixing will support strong momentum transport to the
surface, where widespread critical winds of 25-35+ mph are expected
through the afternoon. Low surface humidity from dry trajectories
and warm temperatures will support minimum RH values of 8-15%.
Fuels, while not overly favorable, are sufficiently dry to support
elevated/critical fire weather conditions Wednesday.

...Rio Grande Valley...
Gusty southwest surface winds off the Mexican Plateau will
overspread the western Rio Grande Valley Wednesday, ahead of the
deepening western US trough. Downslope winds of 15-20 mph will
support dry surface conditions with RH of 10-20% through the first
half of Wednesday. Fuels remain quite dry suggesting elevated fire
weather conditions are likely.

An increase in surface winds is possible later in the afternoon and
early evening as the upper trough to the west begins to eject
eastward. A strong 100 kt speed max ahead of the trough is forecast
to move over northeastern MX and southwest TX late. The increase in
surface momentum transfer may support gusts of 20-35 mph near
sunset. Uncertainty exists on the impact the increase in winds may
have on fire weather conditions given rapid cooling and
boundary-layer separation after dark. Nonetheless, some potential
for locally critical conditions may develop late with the strong
winds and dry fuels.

...Significant winter storm impacting areas of the Great Lakes
into the Northeast on Tuesday into Wednesday morning...

...Risk of Excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorms increasing
from the Lower Mississippi to Tennessee/Ohio Valleys from Tuesday
into Wednesday...

...A second significant winter storm impacting areas of the
Southern Plains into the Ohio Valley on Wednesday into Thursday...

...Temperatures will be 20 to 30 degrees below average over the
Northern Rockies/Northern High Plains into the Northern/Central
Plains and parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley; In contrast,
temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average over East
Coast...

A strong wave of low pressure over the Middle Mississippi Valley
will move northeastward to Eastern Canada, while the associated
front moves off the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Coast by Wednesday
evening. The storm will produce a significant winter storm
impacting areas of the Great Lakes to Northern New England.
Periods of moderate to heavy snow will continue today across
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Additional snowfall may exceed
6 inches, bringing event-total snowfall to 1-2 ft in some areas.
Moderate to heavy snow combined with strong winds gusting over 30
mph will create near blizzard conditions at times with
considerable blowing and drifting snow. Travel is discouraged.
Periods of sleet and freezing rain will lift across Wisconsin and
Michigan through Tuesday evening. Significant ice accumulation
exceeding one quarter inches are possible, which will create
hazardous travel and isolated power outages. Very cold air is
expected for much of this week, with temperatures near record low
values and dangerously cold wind chills in the Plains. From
Tuesday afternoon into late Tuesday night, sleet and rain/freezing
rain will develop over parts of Northern New England.

Moreover, temperatures will be 20 to 45 degrees below average over
the Northern Rockies/Northern High Plains into the
Northern/Central Plains and parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley.
As a result, several locations will have record-breaking or tied
low temperatures. In contrast, temperatures will be 10 to 25
degrees above average over most of the East Coast, with several
locations having record-breaking or tied high temperatures from
Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

Meanwhile, as the cold front moves eastward over the Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, moisture will
pool along ahead of the boundary aiding in the development of
showers and thunderstorms; some thunderstorms will be severe.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Middle/Lower Mississippi and
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys through Wednesday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

In addition, there is a threat of excessive rainfall associated
with these thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate
Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Ohio Valley with a
second over parts of the Tennessee Valley. The associated heavy
rain will create numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore,
many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers
through Wednesday morning.

However, the threat of severe thunderstorms will diminish on
Wednesday into Thursday over parts of the Middle/Lower Mississippi
and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Furthermore, heavy rain will continue
as a strong stream of moisture comes off the Gulf of Mexico and
overruns the front producing heavy rain over Lower Mississippi and
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall with the heavy rain over parts of the
Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. The heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams the most vulnerable from Wednesday into
Thursday morning.

In the meantime, an upper-level low over the Pacific Northwest
moves southward to the Great Basin/Southern California by
Wednesday morning, then moves eastward to the Southern Rockies by
Thursday. The system will produce rain and higher elevation snow
over parts of the Northwest and Northern/Central California, with
snow over parts of the Great Basin on Tuesday. Snow will move into
the Southwest and Central Rockies overnight Tuesday into Wednesday
morning. The snow and lower elevation rain will continue over the
Southwest and Central Rockies and expand into the Southern Rockies
and parts of the Central/Southern High Plains overnight Wednesday
into Thursday.

Moreover, a second winter storm will develop as the system moves
out of the Southwest/Southern Rockies onto the Southern Plains.
The storm will develop over the Southern Plains on Wednesday,
moving toward the Ohio Valley on Thursday. Snow, sleet, and
freezing rain are all likely. Freezing rain and sleet are forecast
to expand over the Southern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley
starting Wednesday and continue into the Ohio Valley Thursday.
Significant ice accumulations are likely, with damaging ice
possible in the Ozarks. In addition, modest snowfall accumulations
are also possible. As a result, hazardous travel conditions and
impacts to infrastructure are becoming more likely. Details in the
track and timing of the storm and precipitation type and amounts
remain uncertain but will be refined in the next day or so.

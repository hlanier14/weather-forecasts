Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CDT Sun Apr 03 2022

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR EASTERN WYOMING...FAR
SOUTHWEST SOUTH DAKOTA...WESTERN AND CENTRAL NEBRASKA...FAR
NORTHEAST COLORADO...AND FAR NORTHERN KANSAS....

Expanded the critical delineation slightly north and west where
morning guidance shows relative humidity dropping into the upper
teens. Otherwise, the major change was to shrink the western and
southern extent of the IsoDryT area. The environment remains
favorable for isolated storm development with PWAT values in the 0.6
to 0.7 range. However, the dryline is forecast to set up farther
east and thus, storms are not likely as far west as previously
forecast. In addition, the capping inversion looks to be too strong
near the Big Bend for storm development outside the terrain favored
locations in Mexico.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0131 AM CDT Sun Apr 03 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected from the central Plains to the
southern High Plains this afternoon. Early-morning surface
observations show a surface low deepening in the lee of the northern
Rockies as a compact upper-level wave ejects into the Plains. This
low is forecast to migrate across the upper MO River Valley today
with a trailing surface trough/dryline draped southward across NE,
KS, and into western OK. Fire weather concerns will increase behind
this surface boundary, as well as across parts of the southern High
Plains where dry thunderstorms are probable.

...Central Plains...
Northwesterly winds behind the surface trough/dryline are forecast
to increase to 15-25 mph from southeast WY into southern SD, NE, and
northwest KS. This downslope wind regime typically supports RH
reductions more in line with warmer/drier solutions, which show
widespread critical fire weather conditions from far southeast WY
into central NE. These solutions are supported by a handful of
early-morning obs from southeast WY, which are reporting dewpoint
values lower than depicted by most guidance. Critical conditions
appear likely, and unseasonably high ERC values will support the
fire weather threat.

...Southern High Plains...
Weak zonal flow and gradual height falls aloft will support weak lee
cyclogenesis this afternoon across east NM and west TX.
Southwesterly winds are forecast to increase to 10-20 mph in
response to the surface pressure falls. Trajectories emanating from
northern Mexico will maintain depressed dewpoints across the region
with afternoon RH values in the teens. Elevated fire weather
conditions are expected and will be most pronounced in the immediate
lee of terrain features.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A dry, post-frontal air mass is expected to overspread the
Mid-Atlantic in the wake of a weak cold frontal passage early this
morning. The northwesterly offshore flow will support downslope
warming/drying in the lee of the Blue Ridge mountains. RH reductions
into the 20-35% range are possible and may coincide with sustained
winds near 15%. Areas of elevated fire weather conditions are
possible, but recent rainfall should limit the overall fire weather
potential.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
The observed 00Z sounding from MAF reveals a dry boundary layer
under steep lapse rates. The combination of gradual cooling aloft
with a modest influx of low-level moisture will support 100-500 J/kg
MUCAPE atop a dry, well-mixed boundary layer by late afternoon. The
inverted-V soundings, coupled with PWAT values between 0.5-0.6
inches, will support the potential for dry lightning strikes as well
as severe downburst winds with any thunderstorm that develops along
the diffuse dryline this afternoon. See the latest Day 1 convective
outlook for more details regarding the severe potential.

Valid 12Z Wed Apr 06 2022 - 12Z Sun Apr 10 2022

...Overview...

The lower 48 will see an amplified upper pattern during the medium
range period (Wed-Sun). During the mid to late week time frame the
dominant features will be a deep east-central U.S. trough anchored
by an Upper Midwest into Great Lakes low, and a western U.S.
ridge. The upper low/trough and associated surface evolution will
produce a broad area of precipitation across the northern Plains
and eastern half of the country (with some pockets of locally
heavy totals possible) while the western ridge will support much
above normal temperatures, including potential for some record
highs/warm lows over California and vicinity. By the weekend
expect a Pacific trough to move into the West, leading to a
cooling trend and some precipitation, while progression of the
eastern trough to East Coast should favor drier weather over the
East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

In the East, the 00z CMC and UKMET continued to be farther west
with it's track than consensus with the initial wave in the
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday. Upstream, concerning the Midwest closed
low, the 00z UKMET is quickest to open up the low, leading to a
faster progression of the system as a whole. Later 12z runs of the
CMC and UKMET seem to show better consistency with the GFS and
ECMWF for both features. Later in the period, the trough in the
East should linger/become elongated as ridging amplifies into the
Central U.S.. There are some timing concerns for the front late
period, but mostly not until it's well off the coast.

Out West, plenty of uncertainty continues to surround the
evolution of troughing into the region by next weekend. Models
show an initial wave moving through on Friday, with a bigger
closed low dropping down from the Gulf of Alaska by Sunday.
Biggest outlier was the 00z CMC which was quite a bit
deeper/amplified with the first system resulting in another
building ridge over the West Coast next weekend and less
progressive Gulf of Alaska low. The GFS and ECMWF were a little
bit more in line, racing the initial shortwave off into central
Canada as the next low reached the coast by Sunday. This general
evolution was also better supported in the ensembles. The 12z run
however of the CMC has abandoned this idea and seems to have come
much more into line with the GFS/ECMWF and ensemble means. But
detail differences among model runs and ensemble members continue
to suggest lower predictability for this overall trough versus the
ridge/trough configuration farther east.

The WPC blend for today utilized a non-UKMET consensus for the
first half of the period in the East. Out West, the CMC was left
out in favor of increasing weighting towards the ensemble means to
help mitigate the Western U.S. uncertainties. This provided very
good continuity with the previous WPC forecast as well.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The deep-layer low tracking over the Upper Midwest into Great
Lakes, along with a leading triple point wave that may become the
primary system by the end of the week--plus the trailing cold
front--should support multiple areas of enhanced precipitation
mid-late week. Specifics for heaviest totals are still fairly
uncertain though. One area of focus may be for some combination of
rain and/or snow over or a little west/south of Lake Superior,
just north of the parent low's track. Meanwhile the wave expected
to track from the Mid-Atlantic northeastward may produce some
locally moderate to heavy rainfall. Far interior sections of New
England may see some wintry weather on the leading side of the
moisture. More localized pockets of enhanced rainfall are possible
farther south along the trailing cold front.  The Storm Prediction
Center is monitoring potential for severe threats across the
southern tier. Check their latest outlooks for more information.
Expect lingering showery precipitation, possibly including some
snow from the Midwest into the Appalachians, under the cold upper
trough into Saturday.  The upper trough pushing into the West by
the weekend should bring mostly light to moderate rain and high
elevation snow into the Northwest starting Friday or Saturday.

The upper ridge building into the West will spread a broad area of
well above normal temperatures across the region mid-late week.
Highest temperatures will likely be on Thursday-Friday when parts
of California and Oregon into the Great Basin could see readings
15-25F above normal. Some daily records for highs/warm lows will
be possible. The upper trough arriving from the Pacific will bring
a rapid cooling trend during the weekend, with much of the West
seeing near to below normal highs by Sunday. Farther east, highs
generally 5-15F or so below normal will progress from the northern
Plains/northern-central Rockies into the East during
Wednesday-Saturday under the deep upper trough. Expect
temperatures to moderate noticeably by next Sunday. Flow ahead of
the upper trough will bring a couple days of above normal readings
(especially for morning lows) to the East around
Wednesday-Thursday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun April 03 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19790406 - 19880320 - 19910331 - 19970325 - 19560407


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 7 day periods centered on the following dates:
19910330 - 19880320 - 19790406 - 19710326 - 20080321

...Increasingly stormy conditions expected to impact the Pacific
Northwest to the northern High Plains for the next couple of days
as a deep low pressure system moves onshore...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorm threat expand across the
Deep South for the next couple of days as rain/snow moves across
the northern tier...

...Critical Fire Weather Risk today over the Northern/Central
Plains...

A potent low pressure system will bring increasingly active
weather into the western U.S. towards the Plains over the next
couple of days.  In the meantime, a compact low pressure is
forecast to intensify as it slides relatively quickly off the New
England coast later tonight. Some bands of rain/snow are expected
to rotate through New England tonight. The relatively fast motion
of this system will limit the snowfall amounts. Nevertheless, some
locally enhanced amounts of wet snow are possible particularly
over the higher elevations of upstate New York into interior New
England. Another fast-moving surface wave is forecast to spread
light amounts of rain/snow across the Upper Midwest and Northern
Plains tonight through Monday.

Farther south, a thunderstorm threat will be suppressed into
southern Florida for the next couple of days as a cold front
becomes nearly stationary.  Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will
begin to turn north toward the southern tier states and converge
with a cold front slowly moving through the Central Plains. This
will lead to a steady expansion of showers and thunderstorms from
the Southern Plains into the Deep South over the next couple of
days. The rain and storms are expected to intensify as they reach
into the Deep South later Monday into Tuesday with the possibility
of flash flooding and severe weather. Showers and thunderstorms
spread into the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic by Tuesday night.

Meanwhile, a potent low pressure system is forecast to bring
increasingly stormy weather across the Pacific Northwest through
the Northern Plains over the next couple of days. This system will
dump heavy snow along the Cascades before expanding into the
Northern Rockies together with high winds. Near the Pacific
Northwest coast, moderate to heavy rain and scattered
thunderstorms will be accompanied by strong and gusty winds,
especially on Monday. Heavy snow will be measured in feet over the
northern Cascades.  By Monday night into Tuesday morning, the low
pressure system is forecast to impact the Northern Plains/Rockies
with high winds as rain/snow moves through the region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF EASTERN WYOMING...FAR
SOUTHWEST SOUTH DAKOTA...AND THE WESTERN NEBRASKA PANHANDLE....

Expanded the elevated northward to the Canadian border. Some light
precipitation fell there, but it was mostly less than a tenth of an
inch in eastern Montana and western North Dakota where fine fuels
should have time to dry by tomorrow.

Also, added a critical area for the lower elevation areas of eastern
Wyoming into far southwest South Dakota and the western Nebraska
Panhandle. Very strong winds are expected in this area with
downslope warming/drying also anticipated. As a result, some
extremely critical meteorological conditions are expected with
sustained winds of 30 to 35 mph and relative humidity in the single
digits, especially closer to the terrain. Fuels in this area are on
the drier side, but may not technically be considered critically
dry. However, given the very strong winds, expect the potential for
rapidly spreading fires in fine fuels, even if fuel dryness is
marginal.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Sun Apr 03 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected again Monday afternoon across the
central to northern Plains, as well as across parts of southwest TX.
A strong zonal jet is forecast to nose into the Pacific Northwest
late Sunday into early Monday. This will support strong troughing in
the lee of the Canadian Rockies, which in turn will support
increasing southerly winds through the Plains. To the south,
westerly winds in the vicinity of a weak surface low will foster
areas of elevated fire weather conditions over a region with very
dry fuels.

...Central to Northern Plains...
Latest ensemble guidance shows reasonably high confidence in
sustained 15-20 mph winds from NE into the western Dakotas as the
surface low deepens through the day. Moisture return into the region
will be limited, and combined with diurnal heating, will support RH
reductions into the 20-25% range. Drier solutions hint that critical
wind/RH conditions are possible from eastern WY into far western NE
Monday afternoon, but low ensemble probabilities minimize confidence
in this potential. Fuels across much of the High Plains remain dry
with unseasonably high ERC values, and will support a fire weather
concern for locations that do not see wetting precipitation over the
next 24 hours. Elevated to critical fire weather conditions may
develop across southern and central WY as well, but latest fuel
guidance suggests fuels are not receptive across these areas.

...Southwest Texas...
The weak surface low that is forecast to develop this afternoon
across the southern High Plains is expected to meander south towards
the Rio Grande by Monday afternoon - driven primarily by broad
ascent associated with an upper-wave moving into northern Mexico.
This will support increasing westerly downslope winds from far
southwest TX and southeast NM into the Trans Pecos region and the
Big Bend region. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph coincident with
RH values in the teens appear likely. Currently dry fuels will
remain receptive to fire spread and will support elevated fire
weather concerns.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0113 AM CDT Mon Apr 04 2022

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN WYOMING INTO THE NEBRASKA
PANHANDLE...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist across parts of the High Plains
today as a strong upper-level jet begins to nose into the Pacific
Northwest. Critical fire weather conditions are most likely across
parts of eastern WY and western NE, but elevated conditions are
probable for parts of the western Dakotas, MT, and far southwest TX.

...Northern High Plains...
The latest observations from northern MT and AB/SK show surface
pressure falls indicating a deepening lee trough as an upper-level
jet begins to shift into the Pacific Northwest. This trend will
continue through the day and the resulting mass response will
support widespread winds between 15-25 mph along the northern High
Plains. An antecedent dry air mass (dewpoints in the single digits
to low teens) will maintain reduced RH values this afternoon via
diurnal warming and some degree of downslope warming/drying. Latest
ensemble guidance has maintained reasonably high probabilities for
critical wind/RH conditions across eastern WY into the NE Panhandle.
Locations in the immediate lee of terrain features may see periods
of extremely critical wind/RH conditions with sustained winds near
30 mph, gusting to 35-45 mph at times.

...Southwest Texas...
Early-morning surface observations from the Trans Pecos region and
southeast NM show westerly winds on the west side of a diffuse cold
front/surface trough. This boundary will migrate east through the
day as a weak surface low consolidates in northwest TX. Westerly
downslope winds will increase to 15-20 mph across the Trans Pecos
and Rio Grande River Valley to the Big Bend region. Upstream
dewpoints in the single digits and low teens will advect into the
region and support RH reductions into the teens. Consequently,
elevated fire weather conditions appear probable along the Rio
Grande to the Big Bend region where fuels remain very dry and are
receptive to fire spread.

...South-Central Appalachians...
Dry conditions are expected to persist across the south-central
Appalachians with RH values falling into the 25-35% range by the
late afternoon. Breezy gradient winds between 10-15 mph may support
brief periods of elevated fire weather conditions. Given the dry
fuels over the region, this may support a low-end fire weather
concern.

259 AM EDT Mon Apr 04 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 07 2022 - 12Z Mon Apr 11 2022

...Overview...

The large scale regime from late this week into early next week
will remain amplified but progression/evolution during the period
will essentially lead to a flip of the upper level pattern, with
an initial western ridge/east-central U.S. trough ultimately
trending toward a western trough/eastern ridge.  Precipitation
will steadily decrease in coverage and intensity over the eastern
half of the country while chilly temperatures will progress from
the Plains through East late week through the weekend.  Meanwhile
the West will see much above normal temperatures late this week,
with some daily records possible over and near California,
followed by a cooler trend during the weekend into early next week
while areas of precipitation spread across the region.  As this
occurs, above normal temperatures will shift into the Plains and
eventually parts of the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Based on 12Z/18Z guidance, an operational model blend early (with
least weight on the UKMET) followed by a mix of the GFS/ECMWF/CMC
and 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means provided a good depiction of
consensus.  Continuity adjustments were again fairly modest and
represented typical run-to-run detail refinements.  The overall
forecast of the deep eastern upper trough and associated surface
evolution is fairly consistent.  The majority cluster maintains
good definition of the embedded upper low into day 4 Friday,
followed by solutions showing varying ways in which it may
weaken/open up.   Latest UKMET runs have been the fast extreme
with shortwave energy on the east side of the trough and thus with
the Mid-Atlantic through New England coastal wave.  The
ECMWF/ECMWF mean are a bit on the slower side.  An intermediate
solution continues to look good for depicting the specifics of the
upper trough and surface reflection.  Forecasts of the upper
trough reaching the West have been more varied, due in part to
involvement of separate shortwaves.  Recent trends have been
toward a slightly broader trough as it reaches the Northwest early
in the weekend (a little more toward prior GFS runs) but by
Sunday-Monday the ensemble means from the past couple days have
been stable in depicting steady amplification.  Recent GFS runs
could be overdone with the leading shortwave energy pushing into
the consensus mean ridge cross southern Canada (toned down a bit
in the new 00Z run).  Otherwise the latest GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs
compare favorably to each other and the means. An embedded upper
low may reach the Northwest by next Monday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Heaviest rainfall with the system affecting the eastern half of
the country should be Thursday into Friday and focused by the
triple point wave lifting from the Mid-Atlantic into New England.
Specifics within this area of potentially enhanced rain are still
uncertain, with additional time needed to resolve important
details.  Some pockets of locally moderate to heavy rainfall could
extend along the trailing front as far south as Florida, and the
Storm Prediction Center is monitoring severe potential over parts
of the Mid-Atlantic.  Check SPC's outlooks for the latest
information on severe threats.  Precipitation in the vicinity of
the Great Lakes low should trend lighter after midweek.  However
cold air aloft associated with the upper trough will likely
promote areas of diurnally enhanced showers from the Midwest into
the northern half to two-thirds of the East into Friday-Saturday.
Some precipitation could be in the form of snow between the
Midwest and Appalachians.  The upper trough amplifying over the
West will gradually increase the coverage of mostly light to
moderate rain and higher elevation snow from late week onward.
Most of this precipitation should be over the northern half of the
region into early Monday but may push farther south thereafter.

The upper ridge over the West late this week will produce well
above normal temperatures across the region. Forecasts continue to
show highs reaching 15-25F above normal Thursday-Friday from parts
of California and Oregon into the Great Basin along with some
daily records for highs/warm lows. Then the upper trough arriving
from the Pacific will bring in cooler air, with the Northwest
trending below normal during the weekend and much of the West
likely to see highs 5-15F below normal by next Monday.  Meanwhile
highs of 5-15F or slightly more below normal will progress from
the Plains/Mississippi Valley into the East late week into the
weekend.  A trailing warming trend will bring plus 10-20F
anomalies into the Plains for the weekend and persisting over some
areas into Monday while eastern U.S. readings rebound closer to or
slightly above normal by early next week.

above normal temperatures across the region. Forecasts continue to
show highs reaching 15-25F above normal Thursday-Friday from parts
of California and Oregon into the Great Basin along with some
daily records for highs/warm lows. Then the upper trough arriving
from the Pacific will bring in cooler air, with the Northwest
trending below normal during the weekend and much of the West
likely to see highs 5-15F below normal by next Monday.  Meanwhile
highs of 5-15F or slightly more below normal will progress from
the Plains/Mississippi Valley into the East late week into the
weekend.  A trailing warming trend will bring plus 10-20F
anomalies into the Plains for the weekend and persisting over some
areas into Monday while eastern U.S. readings rebound closer to or
slightly above normal by early next week.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will become more widespread across the High
Plains on Tuesday, as an upper-level trough begins to deepen over
the central CONUS and a cold front sweeps to the southeast across
the Plains. Strong downslope flow off the central and southern
Rockies, in the wake of the cold front and behind a deepening
surface low, will support widespread critical conditions along the
High Plains.

...Central High Plains...
Latest forecast guidance continues to show good agreement in the
passage of a surface trough/cold front across the Plains early
Tuesday. Post-frontal winds will likely increase to 15-25 mph in a
dry, deeply mixed air mass. Downslope warming off the central
Rockies will support widespread RH reductions well below 25% across
the central Plains. Drier solutions hint that RH values may fall to
near 15% by late afternoon for parts of eastern WY and western NE.
Forecast soundings suggest boundary-layer mixing may extend up to
700-600 mb, which could allow for wind gusts as high as 40-50 mph by
mid afternoon. Widespread critical conditions appear likely over a
region with dry fuels. A corridor of sustained 30 mph winds speeds
may develop across the WY/CO/NE tri-state region. While confidence
in widespread sub-20% within this corridor is somewhat low (due to
the potential for lingering clouds after isolated morning showers),
periods of extremely critical conditions appear possible.

...Southern High Plains...
A secondary surface low is forecast to deepen across the southern TX
Panhandle into northwest TX through the day Tuesday. Behind this low
and an attendant surface trough, westerly winds will likely increase
to 20-25 mph across a broad swath from southwest TX into eastern NM
and the TX Panhandle. Downslope warming coupled with antecedent dry
conditions will support widespread RH reductions between 10-15% (and
possibly as low as the single digits). A deep, well-mixed boundary
layer with a unidirectional wind profile favors frequent gusts up to
30-40 mph. Widespread critical conditions are expected, and periods
of extremely critical wind/RH conditions are possible from
east-central NM into the southwestern TX Panhandle, where guidance
shows the most favorable overlap of the low-level thermal ridge and
mid-level speed maxima.

...Increasingly stormy conditions expected to impact the Pacific
Northwest to the northern Plains for the next couple of days as a
deep low pressure system moves onshore...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorm threat expand across the
Deep South for the next couple of days before moving up the East
Coast Tuesday night/Wednesday morning...

...Critical Fire Weather Risk will persist over the northern High
Plains...

A potent low pressure system will bring increasingly active
weather swiftly through the western U.S. and then across the
Plains during the next couple of days.  Abundant moisture ahead of
this system is already streaming onshore into the Pacific
Northwest and will continue to penetrate further inland.  Moderate
to heavy rain and scattered thunderstorms  near the coast will be
accompanied by strong and gusty winds today.  Meanwhile, heavy
snow will break out along the Cascades before expanding into the
northern Rockies later today together with high winds.  Heavy snow
will be measured in feet over the northern Cascades before the
snow tapers off Tuesday night.  As this system forces its way
through the northern Rockies into the northern High Plains,
widespread high winds are expected to impact through these area
and especially the foothills later today and through Tuesday
before gradually tapering of by Wednesday.  The high winds will be
accompanied with periods of mixed rain and snow as the system
reorganizes and expands over the northern Plains.  Farther south,
showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop ahead of an
intensifying cold front later on Tuesday as it sweeps across the
upper Midwest.  The thunderstorms could intensify further as they
reach the western portion of the Great Lakes by Wednesday morning
with strong and gusty winds.

Meanwhile across New England, a rapidly intensifying low pressure
system moving off the coast will manage to rotate some mixed
rain/snow especially across Downeast Maine this morning with gusty
northwesterly winds.  This system will move away by tonight with
clearing skies and diminishing winds.

Farther south, the thunderstorm threat will remain suppressed
across southern Florida for the next couple of days as a cold
front becomes nearly stationary.  Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico
will begin to surge north toward the southern tier states and
converge with the cold front slowly moving into the southern
Plains.  This will lead to a steady expansion of showers and
thunderstorms from the southern Plains into the Deep South over
the next couple of days.  The rain and storms are expected to
intensify as they reach into the Deep South later Monday into
Tuesday with the possibility of flash flooding and severe weather.
 By Tuesday night, the rain will likely spread into the eastern
U.S. with the highest threat of heavy rain and severe
thunderstorms moving across the Southeast.  A compact low pressure
system is forecast to intensify near the Carolina coast by
Wednesday morning with a period of enhanced rainfall and gusty
winds near its track.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1100 AM CST Tue Feb 09 2021

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEW MEXICO...

Expanded the elevated area westward across New Mexico where 15 to 20
mph winds are expected amid RH of 9 to 13 percent. No other changes
were made and the remainder of the forecast appears on track.

..Bentley.. 02/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CST Tue Feb 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
A relatively focused area of elevated to critical fire-weather
conditions will develop this afternoon from northeastern New Mexico
southward into far west Texas west of a slow-moving frontal zone
near the NM/TX border.  This frontal zone will separate an Arctic
airmass to its east from dry, breezy conditions to its west.  The
dry airmass will also reside beneath moderately strong mid-level
flow, which should help with enhancement of surface winds through
vertical mixing processes.

...Central/eastern New Mexico and far west Texas...
The aforementioned synoptic conditions will foster development of a
couple of corridors of 20+ mph surface winds - one from Torrance to
Quay Counties and another from Chaves to Lea counties.  These
surface winds will occur amidst a very dry airmass with 9-15% RH
values possible areawide during peak heating hours.  A critical
delineation has been drawn in these areas to address this scenario.

Surrounding the critical area, models indicate that winds will be
slightly weaker (in the 10-20 mph range).  The airmass should be
just as dry as in the critical area, though the eastern extent of
elevated conditions will depend on the westward progression of
Arctic area across the Texas South Plains/Panhandle.  Locally
elevated fire-weather conditions will also exist west of the central
New Mexico mountains where fuels are dry.

1250 PM EST Tue Feb 09 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Feb 12 2021 - 12Z Tue Feb 16 2021

...Arctic air extends across the Northern Rockies and Plains,
Surging South across the Plains and MS Valley, with multiple cold
temperature records expected...

...Mixed precipitation events possible for the mid-lower MS Valley
to the Ohio Valley... Appalachians...Mid-Atlantic...and
Northeast...

A large area of arctic air with strong high pressure emerges from
the northern Rockies and high Plains on Day 3 and moves east
across the Plains late this week, with cold air then surging south
across the Plains and MS Valley through the weekend.  Several
potential records for lowest maximum temperatures are possible
later this week, and both high and low minimum temperature records
over the MS Valley this weekend to early next week. Current
forecasts indicate dozens of low temperature records are possible
Sun 13 Feb and Mon 14 Feb across the central to southern Plains
east to the mid and lower MS Valley.  High temperature anomalies
of 30-45F below normal are forecast across the northern to central
Plains Days 4/ Saturday and Day 5/Sunday. The airmass gradually
moderates early next week.

Global models indicate a polar vortex centered in south central
Canada Fri will begin to weaken and slide eastward across the
Great Lakes by this weekend.  On the other hand, the 00-12z GFS
depicts shortwave energy rotates through the south side of the
polar vortex, resulting in frontal wave development in the Great
Lakes during the weekend.  The 00z ECMWF/CMC solutions are
preferred given the GEFS mean was more progressive than the
operational GFS with the vortex movement, as well as better
agreement with WPC continuity.

A pair of upper shortwaves move onshore in CA and moves across the
southwest, bringing rounds of valley showers/mountain snow.
The first 500 mb wave is forecast to weaken in confluent flow as
it ejects onto the Plains.  The second wave crossing the Southwest
Sun 14 Feb moves east across the southern Plains Mon and MS Valley
Tue. 16 Feb., leading to low pressure development in the Gulf Of
Mexico that produces a large swath of mixed precipitation across
the mid-lower MS Valley, Ohio Valley, and Appalachians. The 12z
UKMET/12z GFS were faster than the 06z GFS/00z ECMWF and their
respective ensemble means with the trough progression across the
southwest and southern Plains, so were given the last weighting.

The models continue to signal periods of snow on Days 4-5 across
the ranges of WA/OR, southern ID, WY, northern CA, northern NV and
UT.
On Day 6, the southwest trough is forecast to produce snows in the
ranges of AZ/UT/NM/CO. On Day 7, snows wind down in the southern
Rockies and then redevelop in the mountains of western WA/OR as
the next system approaches from the northeast Pacific Ocean.

The WPC medium-range forecasts were derived from a blend of the
00Z ECMWF/ECMWF Ensemble mean with less weighting on the 00z
Canadian global/00z CMC Ensemble mean.

...Arctic air extends across the Northern Rockies and Plains,
Surging South across the Plains and MS Valley, with multiple cold
temperature records expected...

...Mixed precipitation events possible for the mid-lower MS Valley
to the Ohio Valley... Appalachians...Mid-Atlantic...and
Northeast...

A large area of arctic air with strong high pressure emerges from
the northern Rockies and high Plains on Day 3 and moves east
across the Plains late this week, with cold air then surging south
across the Plains and MS Valley through the weekend.  Several
potential records for lowest maximum temperatures are possible
later this week, and both high and low minimum temperature records
over the MS Valley this weekend to early next week. Current
forecasts indicate dozens of low temperature records are possible
Sun 13 Feb and Mon 14 Feb across the central to southern Plains
east to the mid and lower MS Valley.  High temperature anomalies
of 30-45F below normal are forecast across the northern to central
Plains Days 4/ Saturday and Day 5/Sunday. The airmass gradually
moderates early next week.

Global models indicate a polar vortex centered in south central
Canada Fri will begin to weaken and slide eastward across the
Great Lakes by this weekend.  On the other hand, the 00-12z GFS
depicts shortwave energy rotates through the south side of the
polar vortex, resulting in frontal wave development in the Great
Lakes during the weekend.  The 00z ECMWF/CMC solutions are
preferred given the GEFS mean was more progressive than the
operational GFS with the vortex movement, as well as better
agreement with WPC continuity.

A pair of upper shortwaves move onshore in CA and moves across the
southwest, bringing rounds of valley showers/mountain snow.
The first 500 mb wave is forecast to weaken in confluent flow as
it ejects onto the Plains.  The second wave crossing the Southwest
Sun 14 Feb moves east across the southern Plains Mon and MS Valley
Tue. 16 Feb., leading to low pressure development in the Gulf Of
Mexico that produces a large swath of mixed precipitation across
the mid-lower MS Valley, Ohio Valley, and Appalachians. The 12z
UKMET/12z GFS were faster than the 06z GFS/00z ECMWF and their
respective ensemble means with the trough progression across the
southwest and southern Plains, so were given the last weighting.

The models continue to signal periods of snow on Days 4-5 across
the ranges of WA/OR, southern ID, WY, northern CA, northern NV and
UT.
On Day 6, the southwest trough is forecast to produce snows in the

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 09 2021

SYNOPSIS: The main weather story during Week-2 is likely to be an anomalous
cold spell that persists throughout most of the CONUS east of the Rockies. =
The
highest risk for the coldest temperatures exists throughout the Plains and
Great Lakes, with overnight temperatures forecast to be extremely cold for =
the
first few days of the outlook period. There is also a slight risk for heavy
precipitation throughout the Gulf States along the path of a fast moving
surface low.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the Plains,
Mississippi
Valley, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes, Wed-Thu, Feb 17-18.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the central and
eastern U.S., Wed-Fri, Feb 17-19.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for nearly all of the central
and
eastern U.S., Wed-Sat, Feb 17-20.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of the Southeast, Wed, Feb 17.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 12 - TUESDAY FEBRUARY 16:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!rvFBmyHh8xK_4-vb_KGHM4RTCU3ro3e4mO3dJAwLy28zOw0wviWuthQK3NpXw=
1fFBfvohY-Q$

FOR WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 17 - TUESDAY FEBRUARY 23: Anomalous cold is expected=
 to
persist from Week-1 into Week-2 as 500-hPa troughing is favored to remain i=
n
place during at least the first few days of the forecast period. Several of
the
most recent runs of the GFS and ECMWF ensembles suggest that a strong negat=
ive
500-hPa height anomaly will be centered over the Northern Plains at the
beginning of Week-2 and then shift from the Plains into the Northeast by th=
e
middle of the period.



Our GFS and ECMWF ensemble reforecast tools are in good agreement regarding
the
timing and extent of the coldest temperatures. Both tools suggest a high
chance
of much below normal minimum temperatures throughout most of the Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes during the first two days =
of
the period and a moderate risk for the first three days. We have issued
corresponding hazard regions for moderate and high risks of much below mini=
mum
temperatures for these periods. The GEFS, in particular, forecasts a 40%
chance
that overnight temperatures in the Central Plains will be in the bottom 2nd
percentile of climatology, which means the potential for record breaking
overnight lows reaching as far south as northern Texas.The high and moderat=
e
risk areas have shrunk slightly relative to yesterday's outlook to reflect =
the
latest forecasts that predict the pattern to deamplify and a moderation of
temperatures by the end of the forecast period.



The aforementioned trough is forecast to weaken and lift northeastward by t=
he
middle of Week-2. The axis of coldest temperatures should follow the trough
and
a corresponding slight risk (20% chance) of much below minimum temperatures
has
been posted through 2/20 for most of the CONUS east of the Rockies.



The ECMWF and GFS predict a surface low to move through the Southeast durin=
g
the first day of the period. Reforecast guidance supports at least a 20%
chance
that heavy precipitation will occur along the track of this storm and a
corresponding hazard is issued for the region. There is also a risk of heav=
y
snowfall throughout high elevations in the Cascades and northern Sierra Nev=
ada
mountains due to generally wet and cold conditions favored for the Pacific
Northwest during Week-2. We have not posted a related hazard because foreca=
st
snowfall amounts are not high enough to meet our criteria, but concerned
parties should monitor forecasts from their local NWS offices.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1252 AM CST Tue Feb 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will become far more localized on D2/Wed
compared to D1/Tuesday across the southern High Plains.  A small
area of breezy and dry conditions will develop immediately ahead of
a frontal zone (with very cold air to its east) across eastern New
Mexico.  The position of this frontal zone will ultimately determine
the eastward extent of fire-weather throughout the forecast period.

...New Mexico and a small part of west Texas...
Localized areas of 15-20 mph surface winds will develop along an
axis from the Guadalupe Mountains northward to roughly Guadalupe
County, New Mexico near Las Vegas.  These winds will occur within a
dry low-level airmass just west of the front characterized by 10-17%
minimum RH values.  Dry fuels are also in place - in part due to a
lack of recent rainfall and relatively dry antecedent conditions.
An elevated delineation is in place to address this scenario.

...Bitter arctic air to remain entrenched across the north-central
U.S. for the upcoming week while slowing expanding southward...

...Significant ice storm possible Wednesday into Thursday from the
Mid-Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley...

A cold and active weather pattern is expected to persist
throughout the next several days across the country, with mainly
the Southwest remaining warm and dry. Setting the stage for
another frigid February day is a brutally cold arctic high
pressure system located across the north-central United States.
High temperatures will struggle to make it above zero from Montana
to Minnesota through the next few days, with lows in the negative
teens and negative twenties. Wind chills as low as -40 to -50
degrees can be found across far northern portions of the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest due to the dangerous combination of very
cold temperatures and light wind. Thus Wind Chill Warnings and
Advisories stretch across the Northern/Central Plains to the
Midwest. Temperatures well below average also reach southward to
the Southern Plains and eastward to the Upper Ohio Valley. By
Thursday this cold airmass is expected to filter slowly south
across more of the south-central U.S., as well as the Pacific
Northwest.

On the southern edge of the arctic surface high and north of a
frontal boundary stretched from the Southern Plains into the
Southeast, freezing rain is forecast to develop. Significant ice
accumulation could start developing in the Southern Plains and
Mid-Mississippi Valley tonight and quickly spread east-northeast
to the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys on Wednesday. The areas with the
best chance to receive 0.25" or more of ice extends from the
Ozarks to the I-64 corridor in eastern Kentucky. Ice accumulation
exceeding 0.50" is possible in some locations. This amount of ice
will lead to hazardous travel conditions, power outages, and
scattered tree damage. Slightly to the north, areas of light snow
will be found across the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic throughout
Wednesday and Thursday. Through Thursday evening, the current
forecast shows the highest snow totals of 6+" across the Central
Appalachians. Meanwhile farther south along the aforementioned
front, widespread rain showers and thunderstorms are expected
across the southeastern U.S., which could lead to an inch or two
of rain through Friday, as well as some flooding issues for the
Southern Appalachians in particular.

Elsewhere, light snow is expected to wind down this evening across
the Northeast as the associated low pressure system pulls eastward
into the Atlantic. However, lake effect snow is likely to continue
downwind of Lake Ontario through Wednesday. Light snow is also
possible across portions of the Central/Northern High Plains over
the next couple of days. Then as a low pressure system moves
toward the Pacific Northwest and increases moist onshore flow,
increasing precipitation chances are expected on Thursday for the
Northwest. Snow levels will be particularly low past the cold
front in Washington, leading to the possibility of snow even in
lower elevation areas like Seattle. Another hazard of note is
Elevated to Critical fire weather conditions in the Southern
Plains through this evening, and Red Flag Warnings are in effect
for portions of eastern New Mexico and far West Texas.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Tue February 09 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 15 - 19 2021

Todays model solutions are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern across North America and adjacent ocean areas
during the 6-10 day period. Dynamical models forecast a broad longwave 500-=
hPa
trough across the CONUS. Upstream of this trough, ridging is forecast over =
the
Gulf of Alaska and offshore of  the West Coast of the CONUS. The manual hei=
ght
blend depicts negative height anomalies for most of the CONUS. Positive hei=
ght
anomalies are forecast across the Atlantic States, as well as northwestern
Mainland Alaska and parts of the immediate California Coast.

Probabilities below normal temperatures are elevated for most of the CONUS,
consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Todays forecast depict=
s
80% probabilities of below normal temperatures over most  of the Central an=
d
Southern Great Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley. Conversely,  above nor=
mal
temperature probabilities are increased for much of the Florida Peninsula
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Despite the positive 500-h=
Pa
height anomalies forecast over Alaska, strong easterly flow favors increase=
d
near to below normal temperature probabilities across most of the Mainland =
and
the Panhandle. A slight tilt toward increased above normal temperature
probabilities is highlighted across the Aleutians and Alaska Peninsula as
upstream troughing over the Central Pacific is forecast to promote increase=
d
southerly mid-level flow over these areas.

Mean frontal boundaries are favored to set up across the eastern CONUS wher=
e
above normal precipitation probabilities are increased. A continued active
storm track is favored across much of the northwestern CONUS coinciding wit=
h
enhanced above normal precipitation probabilities. Below normal precipitati=
on
probabilities are increased over parts of the southwestern CONUS due to
increased ridging. Elevated below normal precipitation chances also extend
through parts of the Northern and Southern Plains, as a result of the
influence
of surface high pressure and also consistent with the consolidation forecas=
t
tool. Across Alaska, most forecast tools are favoring near to below normal
precipitation probabilities due to prolonged influence of the ridge.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good tool agreement, and high confidence regarding below normal temperature=
s
across nearly the entire CONUS, offset by increasing uncertainty in regards=
 to
the precipitation forecast over the CONUS


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 17 - 23 2021

A continuation of a similar synoptic pattern is forecast during week-2 acro=
ss
North America. Troughing is favored over much  of the central CONUS, with
ridging persisting over the Gulf of Alaska, and extending closer to the Wes=
t
Coast of the CONUS compared to the 6-10 day period. Todays manual 500-hPa
height blend for week-2 depicts below normal heights across most of the CON=
US
east of the Rockies and most of Alaska. However, near to above normal heigh=
ts
are forecast for the West Coast, parts of the Southeast.

Predicted large scale troughing leads to enhanced probabilities of near to
below normal temperatures for most of the CONUS, with the highest chances
across the Middle Mississippi Valley. Above normal temperature probabilitie=
s
are increased over the Florida Peninsula consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools. A trend toward colder temperatures is forecast for much o=
f
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle consistent with the consolidation tool.

Probabilities of above normal precipitation remain slightly increased on th=
e
east side of the mean longwave trough axis over the CONUS, specifically ove=
r
much of the eastern CONUS, consistent with enhanced frontal activity across
the
region. Below normal precipitation probabilities are increased over much of
the
southwestern CONUS due to increased ridging. Elevated below normal
precipitation chances also extend through the Great Plains, as a result of =
the
influence of surface high pressure. Increased above normal precipitation
probabilities are favored across the Northwestern CONUS, due to the forecas=
t
progression of shortwave disturbances across these areas. Below normal
precipitation is likely for northern Mainland Alaska, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. A slight tilt toward increased above normal
precipitation probabilities are favored across the Aleutians, the southern
Mainland, and the Panhandle due to increasing southerly mid-level flow as t=
he
ridge axis retrogrades to the east.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement on a continued amplified pattern, offset by increasing uncertaint=
y
in
regards to the precipitation forecast over the eastern CONUS, as well as th=
e
surface pattern evolution across Alaska.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

...Bitter arctic air to remain entrenched across the north-central
U.S. through the week while slowing expanding southward...

...Significant ice storm possible tonight into Thursday from the
Mid-Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley...

A cold and active weather pattern is expected to persist
throughout the next several days across the country, with mainly
the Southwest remaining warm and dry. Setting the stage for
another frigid February day is a brutally cold arctic high
pressure system located across the north-central United States.
High temperatures will struggle to make it above zero from Montana
to Minnesota through the next few days, with lows in the negative
teens and negative twenties. Wind chills as low as -40 to -50
degrees can be found across far northern portions of the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest due to the dangerous combination of very
cold temperatures and light wind. Thus Wind Chill Warnings and
Advisories stretch across the Northern/Central Plains to the
Midwest. Temperatures well below average also reach southward to
the Southern Plains and eastward to the Upper Ohio Valley. By
Thursday this cold airmass is expected to filter slowly south
across more of the south-central U.S., as well as the Pacific
Northwest.

On the southern edge of the arctic surface high and north of a
frontal boundary stretched from the Southern Plains into the
Southeast, freezing rain is forecast to develop. Significant ice
accumulation could start developing in the Southern Plains and
Mid-Mississippi Valley tonight and quickly spread east-northeast
to the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys on Wednesday. The areas with the
best chance to receive 0.25" or more of ice extends from the
Ozarks to the I-64 corridor in eastern Kentucky. Ice accumulation
exceeding 0.50" is possible in some locations. This amount of ice
will lead to hazardous travel conditions, power outages, and
scattered tree damage. Slightly to the north, areas of light snow
will be found across the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic throughout
Wednesday and Thursday. Through Thursday evening, the current
forecast shows the highest snow totals of 6+" across the Central
Appalachians. Meanwhile farther south along the aforementioned
front, widespread rain showers and thunderstorms are expected
across the southeastern U.S., which could lead to an inch or two
of rain through Friday, as well as some flooding issues for the
Southern Appalachians in particular.

Elsewhere, light snow is expected to wind down this evening across
the Northeast as the associated low pressure system pulls eastward
into the Atlantic. However, lake effect snow is likely to continue
downwind of Lake Ontario through Wednesday. Light snow is also
possible across portions of the Central/Northern High Plains over
the next couple of days. Then as a low pressure system moves
toward the Pacific Northwest and increases moist onshore flow,
increasing precipitation chances are expected on Thursday for the
Northwest. Snow levels will be particularly low past the cold
front in Washington, leading to the possibility of snow even in
lower elevation areas like Seattle. Another hazard of note is
Elevated to Critical fire weather conditions in the Southern
Plains through this evening, and Red Flag Warnings are in effect
for portions of eastern New Mexico and far West Texas.

...Arctic air extends across the Northern Rockies and Plains,
Surging South across the Plains and MS Valley, with multiple cold
temperature records expected...

...Mixed precipitation events possible for the mid-lower MS Valley
to the Ohio Valley... Appalachians...Mid-Atlantic...and
Northeast...

A large area of arctic air with strong high pressure emerges from
the northern Rockies and high Plains on Day 3 and moves east
across the Plains late this week, with cold air then surging south
across the Plains and MS Valley through the weekend.  Several
potential records for lowest maximum temperatures are possible
later this week, and both high and low minimum temperature records
over the MS Valley this weekend to early next week. Current
forecasts indicate dozens of low temperature records are possible
Sun 13 Feb and Mon 14 Feb across the central to southern Plains
east to the mid and lower MS Valley.  High temperature anomalies
of 30-45F below normal are forecast across the northern to central
Plains Days 4/ Saturday and Day 5/Sunday. The airmass gradually
moderates early next week.

Global models indicate a polar vortex centered in south central
Canada Fri will begin to weaken and slide eastward across the
Great Lakes by this weekend.  On the other hand, the 00-12z GFS
depicts shortwave energy rotates through the south side of the
polar vortex, resulting in frontal wave development in the Great
Lakes during the weekend.  The 00z ECMWF/CMC solutions are
preferred given the GEFS mean was more progressive than the
operational GFS with the vortex movement, as well as better
agreement with WPC continuity.

A pair of upper shortwaves move onshore in CA and moves across the
southwest, bringing rounds of valley showers/mountain snow.
The first 500 mb wave is forecast to weaken in confluent flow as
it ejects onto the Plains.  The second wave crossing the Southwest
Sun 14 Feb moves east across the southern Plains Mon and MS Valley
Tue. 16 Feb., leading to low pressure development in the Gulf Of
Mexico that produces a large swath of mixed precipitation across
the mid-lower MS Valley, Ohio Valley, and Appalachians. The 12z
UKMET/12z GFS were faster than the 06z GFS/00z ECMWF and their
respective ensemble means with the trough progression across the
southwest and southern Plains, so were given the last weighting.

The models continue to signal periods of snow on Days 4-5 across
the ranges of WA/OR, southern ID, WY, northern CA, northern NV and
UT.
On Day 6, the southwest trough is forecast to produce snows in the
ranges of AZ/UT/NM/CO. On Day 7, snows wind down in the southern
Rockies and then redevelop in the mountains of western WA/OR as
the next system approaches from the northeast Pacific Ocean.

The WPC medium-range forecasts were derived from a blend of the
00Z ECMWF/ECMWF Ensemble mean with less weighting on the 00z
Canadian global/00z CMC Ensemble mean.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1152 PM CST Tue Feb 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will become much more focused along favored
terrain areas of central New Mexico southward into far west Texas.
A shallow Arctic airmass will very slowly migrate westward into
eastern New Mexico and vicinity while remaining entrenched across
much of the remainder of the country, mitigating fire-weather risks
in most areas.  Additionally, a continued onshore flow pattern and
recent rainfall will mitigate fire-weather concerns across the West.

...Central New Mexico southward through west Texas...
Models indicate a limited spatial area just west of the Arctic
frontal zone where breezy/dry conditions will develop during peak
heating hours.  Localized areas of 15-20 mph westerly surface winds
will become common during that time as RH values fall into the
12-20% range.  Dry fuels in this area will contribute to potential
fire spread.  An elevated fire-weather delineation is in place to
address this threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1152 PM CST Tue Feb 09 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The fire-weather risk initially centered over the southern High
Plains and vicinity on D1/Wed will become even more localized and
less concentrated on D2/Thu as Arctic air migrates even further
westward and synoptic support for stronger surface winds becomes
less pronounced.  The spatial extent of dry and breezy conditions is
localized enough to preclude any highlights for this outlook.

A relatively cold and stable airmass will continue to mitigate any
fire-weather concerns across much of the remainder of the country,
while onshore flow precludes any risk along the West Coast.

...Arctic air remains entrenched across the Plains and MS Valley
but should gradually moderate by early to middle of next week...

...Back-to-back winter weather events possible for the
northeastern U.S. followed by the south-central U.S to the
Northeast...

...Unsettled weather returns to the Pacific Northwest to the
western U.S....

Models and ensemble are in general agreement that a large dome of
arctic air will remain entrenched across the northern and central
U.S. into the weekend as the center of a meandering polar vortex
begins to slide eastward across the Great Lakes.  Despite this
general agreement, models have continued to make further
adjustments to important shortwave energies that rotate around it.
 The GFS has backed off on the amounts upper-level vorticity
ejecting across the central Plains, resulting in less robust
frontal wave development over the Great Lakes later in the
weekend.  The ECMWF on the other hand, has slowed down the
eastward progression of the polar vortex, resulting in a
better-defined inverted trough across the Great Lakes.  Thus, both
models have come into better agreement with each other as a winter
weather event appears to be in the offing for the northeastern
U.S. through the weekend. This is in response to frontal wave
developments across the Southeast where a decent rain event can be
expected near the coast.

Meanwhile, a couple of low pressure systems from the Pacific are
forecast to move steadily from northwest to southeast across the
western U.S. during the medium-range.  They will likely bring a
couple of rounds of mountain snows and valley rains from the
Pacific Northwest toward the Great Basin and the central to
southern Rockies. The first 500 mb wave is forecast to weaken in a
confluent flow as it ejects onto the Plains.  The second wave
crossing the Southwest on Sunday will then move east across the
southern Plains on Monday and into the MS Valley on Tuesday, and
will likely lead to low pressure development in the Gulf of
Mexico.  There is considerable run-to-run model variability
regarding this system.  Nevertheless, model consensus has been
trending toward a faster northeastward motion of this system
across the Southeast early next week.  There continues to be good
model signals for a large swath of snow and/or ice to extend from
the south-central U.S. to the Northeast early next week as the
arctic high pressure system retreats into eastern Canada.

With the arctic high pressure system remains in firm control, many
potential cold temperature records will be likely down the Plains
and into the lower to mid MS Valley this weekend to early next
week.  Record lows/low maxima should be most numerous on Sunday
before the airmass gradually moderates early next week.

The models continue to signal periods of snow on Days 4-5 across
the ranges of WA/OR, southern ID, WY, northern CA, northern NV and
UT.
On Day 6, the southwest trough is forecast to produce snows in the
ranges of AZ/UT/NM/CO. On Day 7, snows wind down in the southern
Rockies and then redevelop in the mountains of western WA/OR as
the next system approaches from the northeast Pacific Ocean.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 18Z GFS/GEFS, together with a
smaller contribution from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean and the 01Z NBM.
Mostly ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7 given the
increasing model uncertainties.

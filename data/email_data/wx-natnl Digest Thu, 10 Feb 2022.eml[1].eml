Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0958 AM CST Wed Feb 09 2022

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

An Elevated area was added for parts of the northeastern TX
Panhandle, western and north-central OK, and south-central KS. Here,
clear skies and downslope flow should favor deep boundary-layer
mixing and RH reductions into the middle/upper teens to lower/middle
20s by this afternoon (based on modified AMA/DDC/OUN/LMN 12Z
soundings). While a weak pressure gradient should generally limit
sustained winds to around 10-15 mph across this area, a belt of fast
flow aloft should favor frequent wind gusts of 20-25 mph as the
boundary layer deepens to around 2-3 km. In addition, fuels are
favorable for the development and spread of wildfires over the area,
with ERCs in the 70th-80th percentile (aided by ongoing drought and
a lack of substantial precipitation). Elsewhere, the previous
forecast remains valid, with localized elevated conditions possible
over north-central KS and the TX South Plains (see below).

..Weinman.. 02/09/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CST Wed Feb 09 2022/

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level troughing will dominate the upper pattern across the
central and eastern U.S. today as surface high pressure persists
across the inter-mountain West. This high pressure will spill into
the Plains states, fostering weak, dry northerly surface flow. Dry
offshore flow will also persist across California. In the Plains
states, fuels are very receptive to fire spread across most locales.
However, Elevated conditions are expected to remain localized given
the lack of a widespread, stronger surface wind field. The best
chance for any Elevated conditions would be across the central
Plains, where surface winds may exceed 15 mph and briefly coincide
with minimum RH around 20-25 percent by afternoon peak heating.
While winds will be weaker across western Texas, RH may drop into
the 10-15 percent range, supporting localized wildfire-spread
potential wherever gusty winds may occur.

Elevated to Critical meteorological surface conditions are expected
to accompany the offshore flow across southern California through
the day tomorrow. However, high fuel moisture will limit widespread
significant wildfire-spread potential.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
156 PM EST Wed Feb 09 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Feb 12 2022 - 12Z Wed Feb 16 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

Guidance continues to show a significant upper-level pattern
change over the course of the period.  The West Coast
ridge/eastern trough configuration this weekend should transition
toward an amplified western trough and southwesterly mean flow
farther east, as a shortwave traversing the North Pacific
ultimately drops southeastward downstream from a building Pacific
ridge likely to reach near 140W longitude by the middle of next
week.  Within the upper trough crossing the East, some details
seem to be more uncertain than 24 hours ago--affecting specifics
of low pressure expected to develop off the East Coast around
Sunday-Sunday night, along with the corresponding moisture shield.
 There are also detail questions for the trough digging into the
West during the first half of next week, affecting specifics of
associated precipitation and the leading wavy cold front.
Precipitation should increase over the central U.S. around midweek
as low level flow from the Gulf begins to interact with this
front.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Compared to earlier runs, some guidance has noticeably diverged
for the eastern U.S./western Atlantic evolution around
Sunday-Monday.  There is still a relative majority that shows
offshore development in response to energy within the upper trough
remaining open.  However the 00Z UKMET/12Z CMC have a closed upper
low crossing the Great Lakes region, drawing the surface low
closer to the East Coast and spreading much more precipitation
across the Northeast.  Meanwhile some GFS runs have been sharp
enough with energy farther south to emphasize the central-southern
Appalachians into Mid-Atlantic for precipitation while keeping the
developing low far enough offshore just to brush southern/eastern
New England.  Recent ECMWF runs have tended to be lighter/more
suppressed with its snow.  The 00Z UKMET/12Z CMC scenario is a
relative minority among ensembles (but within the envelope) thus
requiring minimal weight for a single deterministic forecast, but
taken as a whole there is somewhat more of a signal for at least
some snow over parts of the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast as ensemble
means had been hinting.

Meanwhile most models and means have come into better than average
agreement for the upper trough digging into the West, relative to
typical 5-7 day forecasts.  There is still some debate over
whether an embedded low may exist as it comes ashore (new 12Z
ECMWF adding to that cluster) and the 12Z UKMET is a little
southwest of models that show a low center at that time, but
ultimately by day 7 Wednesday the latest GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs all
show an upper low reaching the Southwest/Four Corners region while
the GEFS/ECens/CMCens means all imply such a low would exist at a
similar location.

Between these two features, in the Saturday-Monday time frame
models have been diverse and inconsistent with the details of a
weak clipper-type wave that may drop southeastward between the
Plains and west of the Appalachians before dissipating.  These
issues correspond to varying depictions of shortwave energy
forecast to feed into the mean trough aloft crossing the East.
Guidance behavior up to this point as well as the small scale of
the feature yield low confidence in any particular solution.

The early-period operational model blend of 00Z/06Z guidance
placed the least weight on the UKMET given its lower-probability
solution over the East.  Favorable guidance comparisons led to
transitioning the forecast blend toward the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean and
00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean/CMC by days 6-7 Tuesday-Wednesday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Brisk winds and colder air behind the system tracking just north
of Maine on Saturday should support an episode of light to
moderate lake effect snow across portions of Michigan and upstate
New York.  Expect low pressure to form along the trailing front
near the East Coast by Sunday, but with lower than desired
confidence in the strength/track of the system and
coverage/intensity of associated precipitation.  Recent trends are
at least signaling potential for some snow from the
central-southern Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic and
southern/eastern New England with rain possible over parts of the
Southeast/Florida.  However the current possibilities for the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast still range between minimal and significant
snowfall.  Continue to monitor forecasts of this system closely.
Expect the upper trough/wavy front moving into the West early next
week to bring an episode of rain and mountain snow, with highest
totals likely to extend from the Pacific Northwest into the
northern-central Rockies.  Precipitation should increase in
coverage and intensity over the central/southern Plains and
vicinity by next Wednesday or so as the surface front interacts
with a strengthening low level flow of Gulf moisture.  Some snow
may be possible from the central High Plains northeastward.

Many parts of the West will see well above normal temperatures
extend through the weekend with some areas seeing plus 10-20F
anomalies.  Best potential for daily records will be over
California Saturday-Sunday.  The upper trough approaching from the
Pacific will begin a cooling trend over the Pacific
Northwest/northern California by Monday while the Great Basin and
Southwest remain quite warm.  Then expect moderately below normal
highs to spread across the West/Rockies by Tuesday-Wednesday.
Meanwhile the Plains will see a warming trend (up to plus 10-20F
or so anomalies) from the weekend into early next week before the
western front approaches.  Areas near the East Coast will see a
warm day Saturday (plus 10F or greater anomalies) before passage
of a cold front, with trailing temperatures generally 10-20F below
normal progressing from the Mississippi Valley Saturday through
the East into early next week.  The East will likely rebound to
near or above normal by next Wednesday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
156 PM EST Wed Feb 09 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Feb 12 2022 - 12Z Wed Feb 16 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

Guidance continues to show a significant upper-level pattern
change over the course of the period.  The West Coast
ridge/eastern trough configuration this weekend should transition
toward an amplified western trough and southwesterly mean flow
farther east, as a shortwave traversing the North Pacific
ultimately drops southeastward downstream from a building Pacific
ridge likely to reach near 140W longitude by the middle of next
week.  Within the upper trough crossing the East, some details
seem to be more uncertain than 24 hours ago--affecting specifics
of low pressure expected to develop off the East Coast around
Sunday-Sunday night, along with the corresponding moisture shield.
 There are also detail questions for the trough digging into the
West during the first half of next week, affecting specifics of
associated precipitation and the leading wavy cold front.
Precipitation should increase over the central U.S. around midweek
as low level flow from the Gulf begins to interact with this
front.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Compared to earlier runs, some guidance has noticeably diverged
for the eastern U.S./western Atlantic evolution around
Sunday-Monday.  There is still a relative majority that shows
offshore development in response to energy within the upper trough
remaining open.  However the 00Z UKMET/12Z CMC have a closed upper
low crossing the Great Lakes region, drawing the surface low
closer to the East Coast and spreading much more precipitation
across the Northeast.  Meanwhile some GFS runs have been sharp
enough with energy farther south to emphasize the central-southern
Appalachians into Mid-Atlantic for precipitation while keeping the
developing low far enough offshore just to brush southern/eastern
New England.  Recent ECMWF runs have tended to be lighter/more
suppressed with its snow.  The 00Z UKMET/12Z CMC scenario is a
relative minority among ensembles (but within the envelope) thus
requiring minimal weight for a single deterministic forecast, but
taken as a whole there is somewhat more of a signal for at least
some snow over parts of the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast as ensemble
means had been hinting.

Meanwhile most models and means have come into better than average
agreement for the upper trough digging into the West, relative to
typical 5-7 day forecasts.  There is still some debate over
whether an embedded low may exist as it comes ashore (new 12Z
ECMWF adding to that cluster) and the 12Z UKMET is a little
southwest of models that show a low center at that time, but
ultimately by day 7 Wednesday the latest GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs all
show an upper low reaching the Southwest/Four Corners region while
the GEFS/ECens/CMCens means all imply such a low would exist at a
similar location.

Between these two features, in the Saturday-Monday time frame
models have been diverse and inconsistent with the details of a
weak clipper-type wave that may drop southeastward between the
Plains and west of the Appalachians before dissipating.  These
issues correspond to varying depictions of shortwave energy
forecast to feed into the mean trough aloft crossing the East.
Guidance behavior up to this point as well as the small scale of
the feature yield low confidence in any particular solution.

The early-period operational model blend of 00Z/06Z guidance
placed the least weight on the UKMET given its lower-probability
solution over the East.  Favorable guidance comparisons led to
transitioning the forecast blend toward the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean and
00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean/CMC by days 6-7 Tuesday-Wednesday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Brisk winds and colder air behind the system tracking just north
of Maine on Saturday should support an episode of light to
moderate lake effect snow across portions of Michigan and upstate
New York.  Expect low pressure to form along the trailing front
near the East Coast by Sunday, but with lower than desired
confidence in the strength/track of the system and
coverage/intensity of associated precipitation.  Recent trends are
at least signaling potential for some snow from the
central-southern Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic and
southern/eastern New England with rain possible over parts of the
Southeast/Florida.  However the current possibilities for the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast still range between minimal and significant
snowfall.  Continue to monitor forecasts of this system closely.
Expect the upper trough/wavy front moving into the West early next
week to bring an episode of rain and mountain snow, with highest
totals likely to extend from the Pacific Northwest into the
northern-central Rockies.  Precipitation should increase in
coverage and intensity over the central/southern Plains and
vicinity by next Wednesday or so as the surface front interacts
with a strengthening low level flow of Gulf moisture.  Some snow
may be possible from the central High Plains northeastward.

Many parts of the West will see well above normal temperatures
extend through the weekend with some areas seeing plus 10-20F
anomalies.  Best potential for daily records will be over
California Saturday-Sunday.  The upper trough approaching from the
Pacific will begin a cooling trend over the Pacific
Northwest/northern California by Monday while the Great Basin and
Southwest remain quite warm.  Then expect moderately below normal
highs to spread across the West/Rockies by Tuesday-Wednesday.
Meanwhile the Plains will see a warming trend (up to plus 10-20F
or so anomalies) from the weekend into early next week before the
western front approaches.  Areas near the East Coast will see a
warm day Saturday (plus 10F or greater anomalies) before passage
of a cold front, with trailing temperatures generally 10-20F below
normal progressing from the Mississippi Valley Saturday through
the East into early next week.  The East will likely rebound to
near or above normal by next Wednesday.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 09 2022

SYNOPSIS: Late in week-1, there is good agreement in the dynamical models
favoring the development of mid-level low pressure over the central CONUS,
which could result in surface low formation over the Great Plains. This
predicted surface feature has the potential for triggering heavy precipitation
across the southeastern lower 48, as well as possible heavy snow from the
Midwest to the Northeast early in the period. Over Alaska, the prevailing
mid-level height pattern supports the potential for much below-normal
temperatures across much of the Mainland, with heavy precipitation and high
elevation snow possible across the Southeast Mainland and the Panhandle early
in week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the Alaska Mainland
and Aleutians, Thu-Wed, Feb 17-23.

Slight risk of heavy snow for portions of the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys,
Great Lakes, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast Thu-Fri, Feb 17-18.

Slight risk of heavy snow for portions of southeast Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle, Thu-Sat, Feb 17-19.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation over portions of the Mississippi, Tennessee
and Ohio Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and the Southeast, Thu-Fri, Feb
17-18.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of southeast Mainland Alaska
and the Panhandle, Thu-Sat, Feb 17-19.

Slight risk of high winds for much of the eastern CONUS, Thu-Sat, Feb 17-19.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 12 - WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 16:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!u1-iiINe2LOfHdWp8BOhIaTU6Db1ffJZjeeSEzUbVzxKeuuRg3St4tp-JicEcb3iNTaXj2Z8$

FOR THURSDAY FEBRUARY 17 - WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 23: Early in week-2, this
morning's GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian 500-hPa height forecasts continue to favor
highly amplified ridging over the northeastern Pacific, with troughing
centered
over the southwestern CONUS tied to a transient shortwave disturbance
downstream. Since earlier this week, the GEFS has been consistently weaker
with
this latter mid-level feature compared to the ECMWF, however both the 0z and
6z
mean GEFS solutions favor the development of full latitude troughing with a
broad distribution of negative height departures overspreading the central
CONUS by the outset of the period. This development is much more robust than
the 0z ECMWF mean solution, which results in significant differences regarding
the potential for much below normal temperatures across much of the central
and
eastern CONUS during the first few days of the period. The GEFS reforecast
tool
depicts a broad region with at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures
falling below the 15th percentile across the central CONUS by the start of the
period. However, the ECMWF reforecast tool is much less onboard with this
hazardous cold potential, as it depicts little to no signal for minimum
temperatures reaching hazards criteria.  Given these differences, and in
consideration of models over forecasting the anomalous cold potential based on
short-term bias correction tools, no corresponding temperature hazards are
issued in the outlook.



Late in week-1, surface low formation remains possible over the Great Plains
tied to the aforementioned anomalous troughing favored aloft. As the low is
forecast to track northeastward from the Mississippi Valley, both the GEFS and
ECMWF ensembles continue to feature return flow from the Gulf to provide ample
moisture across the eastern third of the CONUS, where there is good agreement
in the uncalibrated guidance depicting elevated mean precipitation amounts.
The
highest daily mean amounts are favored in the warm sector across the
southeastern CONUS, supporting the continuation of a slight risk of heavy
precipitation from Feb 17 to 18 from the Mississippi Valley to the Eastern
Seaboard. With cold air advection likely on the backside of the low and
enhanced moisture favored in the deterministic and ensemble guidance over the
northeastern CONUS, a slight risk of heavy snow remains issued from Feb 17 to
18 and now extends from the Middle Mississippi Valley to the Northeast.
Additionally, the deep trough axis favored aloft is expected to be conducive
for elevated winds for many areas east of the Mississippi. A slight risk of
high winds is issued for the eastern third of the CONUS from Feb 17 to 19
where
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of sustained winds exceeding
the 85th percentile early in the period.



Over Alaska, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to feature 500-hPa
troughing  over the Beaufort Sea, with larger positive height departures over
eastern Russia compared to yesterday's guidance. This prevailing mid-level
pattern is expected to promote the advection of arctic air into many portions
of the Mainland, where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools show a large
coverage of probabilities of at least a 20% for minimum temperatures falling
below the 15th percentile over much of the Mainland and the Aleutians
throughout much of the period. Thus, a slight risk of much below normal
temperatures remains issued, and is expanded to include more of the interior
and southwest for the entirety of week-2 in the updated outlook.



Across the southern Mainland and Panhandle, increased onshore flow is expected
to promote above-normal precipitation over the region. Both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day totals exceeding the
85th percentile and two inches to support the continuation of a slight risk of
heavy precipitation early in the period. The favored increase in moisture also
increases the potential for locally heavy snowfall over the higher elevations,
and a slight risk of heavy snow remains designated for the southeastern
Mainland and the Panhandle for Feb 17 to 19. Due to antecedent wet conditions
in southeastern Alaska, where several locations have experienced near or more
than twice of their normal precipitation accumulation for the year, the
continuation of above-normal precipitation during week-2 is expected to
adversely affect the highlighted region and raises the concern for landslides
in the low elevations.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes were made with this update.

The previous forecast reasoning remains the same for the central and
southern Plains. Breezy westerly surface winds are expected over the
central Plains, but plenty of mid/upper-level moisture and related
thick cloud coverage will limit any substantial RH reductions.
Farther south across the southern Plains, greater RH reductions are
expected, but winds should generally remain light.

Across portions of the southwestern FL coast (between the Tampa Bay
area and Fort Myers), a dry, post-frontal airmass combined with
daytime heating and minimal cold air advection will support a few
hours of critically low RH -- where sustained north-northeasterly
winds will be near 10 mph. The light surface winds, weak flow
through the boundary layer, and recent precipitation should all
mitigate the fire-weather threat -- precluding the need for an
Elevated area.

...Synopsis...
Broad northwesterly mid-level flow will persist across the central
U.S. as one embedded 500 mb trough ejects into the Atlantic and a
second trough approaches from the northern Rockies/Plains
tomorrow/Thursday. Given the northward displacement of the upper
trough and accompanying surface cold front in the north-central
U.S., a relative lull in the more substantial wildfire-spread
potential is likely across the central Plains into the southern High
Plains, with modestly dry conditions but overall weaker surface flow
expected.

Surface high pressure will also remain in place across the Interior
West, with Elevated to Critically dry and breezy surface conditions
persisting across southern California. However, marginally receptive
fuels should limit widespread significant wildfire-spread potential.

...Early taste of spring across most of the continental U.S.;
record warmth in California; cold air spills into Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes on Friday...

...First in a pair of storm systems to produce snow showers across
the Great Lakes tonight...

...Heavier snowfall to come with the second storm system on
Thursday across the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes...

A strong dome of upper-level high pressure over the western third
of the country and a lack of a frigid Canadian air-mass will
provide much of the Lower 48 with an early taste of spring over
the next couple of days. Daytime highs are forecast to reach the
50s and 60s over much of the Great Plains on Thursday while more
March-like temperatures arrive in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.
The most anomalous warmth over the next couple days is set to
occur in the Northern Plains and along the West Coast. The former
will be warmest on Thursday when daily temperature departures
range between 15 to 25 degrees above normal from Montana and
northern Wyoming to the Dakotas. Meanwhile, this will be a daily
occurrence on the West Coast and more specifically California.
Daytime highs in parts of Southern California will be in the 80s
through the weekend with highs near 90 degrees possible. Due to
the unusually hot temperatures for early February, Heat Advisories
have been issued for Orange County and the Inland Empire through
the end of the week. Numerous record highs could be broken not
just in Southern California, but along the coast and throughout
the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys through Sunday. Florida
will remain cooler than normal and dry during this period.

The first of two storm systems will track across the Great Lakes
and Northeast through Thursday, but will only produce light
precipitation. The cold air spilling in behind this storm will
trigger some areas of lake effect snow showers, most notably in
Michigan's U.P. and in western portions of the state tonight. Some
snow showers may also bring light accumulations to the interior
Northeast on Thursday as the storm passes through. Meanwhile, the
second and more potent wave of low pressure is hot on its heels,
racing into the Upper Midwest Thursday afternoon. Periods of snow
will blanket parts of northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and
northern Michigan in as much as 3 to 6 inches of snowfall. The
trailing cold front and upper level disturbance tracking south
through Montana delivers snow to parts of the Northern Rockies and
High Plains Thursday night and into Friday. High pressure will
descend upon the Plains beginning Friday night, sending the
preceding cold front and frigid air into the central and eastern
portions of the country this weekend.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Wed February 09 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 15 - 19 2022

Today's model solutions are in fairly good agreement on the 500-hPa flow
pattern across most of the forecast domain. All models predict a strong ridge
over the Northeast Pacific associated with positive height anomalies over most
of Alaska, along the western Canadian coast, and over the Northwest CONUS.
Today's models also forecast a large-scale trough centered over the CONUS,
however the speed that the trough progresses eastward is uncertain. Today's 6z
GEFS mean predicts a more progressive trough (centered over the Great Lakes
region by day 9), while today's 0z Canadian and ECMWF ensemble means forecast
the trough over the Plains on day 9. Downstream of the trough, today's 0z
Canadian and ECMWF ensemble means predict ridging over the eastern CONUS,
while
the GEFS forecasts this ridging to be mainly offshore. Today's manual 500-hPa
blend favors the ECMWF ensemble mean solution for several reasons. A
teleconnection based on the large positive height anomaly centered south of
Alaska supports troughing further west than the GEFS, and ridging across the
East, which is in line with the ECMWF. In addition, the past several
deterministic GFS runs align more with the ECMWF. Finally, the weights used in
the forecast consolidation tool indicate that the ECMWF ensemble temperature
and precipitation forecasts have been more skillful during this season last
year, and in the recent past.

Above normal temperatures are favored along the west coast of the CONUS
underneath positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Cold air advection behind a cold
front originating from Canada increases the likelihood of near normal
temperatures for much of the Great Basin, Four Corners region, and Southern
Plains. Above normal temperatures are favored over parts of the Northern and
Central Plains, towards the central Mississippi Valley, due to downsloping low
level winds forecast to develop towards the end of the period. Ridging and
above normal heights support enhanced chances of near to above normal
temperatures east of the Mississippi. This is a significant change from
yesterday's outlook, which had below normal temperatures for parts of the
East.
However, the reasons for favoring the ECMWF ensemble mean mentioned above
strongly favor making this change. Southerly low level winds forecast for the
Alaska Panhandle and southern portions of the Mainland increase chances of
above normal temperatures there. Cold surface high pressure favors below
normal
temperatures for parts of central and northern Mainland Alaska.

East of the predicted Pacific ridge, dry conditions are likely, highly
favoring
below normal precipitation for much of the West. A storm system is predicted
to
develop over the higher terrain of the West early in the period and track
eastward across the country, favoring above normal precipitation for much of
the eastern and southern CONUS. However, near to below normal precipitation is
favored for parts of the Northern Plains, well to the north of the predicted
storm track. One or more storm systems are predicted to cross over Alaska
during the period, favoring near to above normal precipitation for the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Yesterday's
operational 18z GFS centered on Day 7, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
fairly good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern
over most of the domain, offset by large disagreements among the temperature
tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 17 - 23 2022

During the week-2 period, models depict 500-hPa heights increasing across most
of the domain. Positive height anomalies are forecast over Alaska and the
western and eastern CONUS. Height anomalies are forecast to be near normal
across the Southern and Central Plains, and negative over the Northern Plains
and Great Lakes region. There continues to be a difference in the amount of
ridging forecast in the East between the latest ECMWF and GEFS ensemble means,
as there was in the 6-10 day period. The ECMWF ensemble mean indicates more
ridging across the eastern U.S. than the GEFS. The ECMWF ensemble mean is
favored in the week-2 period for the same reasons it's favored in the  6-10
day
period.

Increasing heights predicted over most of the CONUS leads to increased chances
of near to above normal temperatures for the entire CONUS. Probabilities of
above normal temperatures are highest east of the Rockies and Great Basin due
to predicted downloping low level winds, and for the Eastern Seaboard due to
persistent positive height anomalies and southerly low level flow. A decrease
in southerly flow is forecast for much of Alaska, along with increasing
easterly low level flow from Canada, favoring near to below normal
temperatures
for the Aleutians and Mainland Alaska. Above normal temperatures are favored
for parts of the Alaska Panhandle as onshore winds are forecast to persist
during the week-2 period.

Near to below normal precipitation is favored over the western half of the
CONUS, downstream of ridging offshore of the West Coast. The same storm system
predicted to bring precipitation to parts of the eastern half of the U.S.
during the 6-10 day period is still a factor for the eastern half of the CONUS
in the week-2 period. However, probabilities of above normal precipitation are
relatively low as the storm system is expected to move offshore early in the
period. Near to above normal precipitation is favored again for Alaska due to
one or more possible storm systems.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 60% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's operational 6z GFS
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
relatively good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation
pattern, offset by some disagreement among the temperature tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 17.

Valid 12Z Sat Feb 12 2022 - 12Z Wed Feb 16 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

Guidance continues to show a significant upper-level pattern
change over the course of the period.  The West Coast
ridge/eastern trough configuration this weekend should transition
toward an amplified western trough and southwesterly mean flow
farther east, as a shortwave traversing the North Pacific
ultimately drops southeastward downstream from a building Pacific
ridge likely to reach near 140W longitude by the middle of next
week.  Within the upper trough crossing the East, some details
seem to be more uncertain than 24 hours ago--affecting specifics
of low pressure expected to develop off the East Coast around
Sunday-Sunday night, along with the corresponding moisture shield.
 There are also detail questions for the trough digging into the
West during the first half of next week, affecting specifics of
associated precipitation and the leading wavy cold front.
Precipitation should increase over the central U.S. around midweek
as low level flow from the Gulf begins to interact with this
front.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Compared to earlier runs, some guidance has noticeably diverged
for the eastern U.S./western Atlantic evolution around
Sunday-Monday.  There is still a relative majority that shows
offshore development in response to energy within the upper trough
remaining open.  However the 00Z UKMET/12Z CMC have a closed upper
low crossing the Great Lakes region, drawing the surface low
closer to the East Coast and spreading much more precipitation
across the Northeast.  Meanwhile some GFS runs have been sharp
enough with energy farther south to emphasize the central-southern
Appalachians into Mid-Atlantic for precipitation while keeping the
developing low far enough offshore just to brush southern/eastern
New England.  Recent ECMWF runs have tended to be lighter/more
suppressed with its snow.  The 00Z UKMET/12Z CMC scenario is a
relative minority among ensembles (but within the envelope) thus
requiring minimal weight for a single deterministic forecast, but
taken as a whole there is somewhat more of a signal for at least
some snow over parts of the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast as ensemble
means had been hinting.

Meanwhile most models and means have come into better than average
agreement for the upper trough digging into the West, relative to
typical 5-7 day forecasts.  There is still some debate over
whether an embedded low may exist as it comes ashore (new 12Z
ECMWF adding to that cluster) and the 12Z UKMET is a little
southwest of models that show a low center at that time, but
ultimately by day 7 Wednesday the latest GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs all
show an upper low reaching the Southwest/Four Corners region while
the GEFS/ECens/CMCens means all imply such a low would exist at a
similar location.

Between these two features, in the Saturday-Monday time frame
models have been diverse and inconsistent with the details of a
weak clipper-type wave that may drop southeastward between the
Plains and west of the Appalachians before dissipating.  These
issues correspond to varying depictions of shortwave energy
forecast to feed into the mean trough aloft crossing the East.
Guidance behavior up to this point as well as the small scale of
the feature yield low confidence in any particular solution.

The early-period operational model blend of 00Z/06Z guidance
placed the least weight on the UKMET given its lower-probability
solution over the East.  Favorable guidance comparisons led to
transitioning the forecast blend toward the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean and
00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean/CMC by days 6-7 Tuesday-Wednesday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Brisk winds and colder air behind the system tracking just north
of Maine on Saturday should support an episode of light to
moderate lake effect snow across portions of Michigan and upstate
New York.  Expect low pressure to form along the trailing front
near the East Coast by Sunday, but with lower than desired
confidence in the strength/track of the system and
coverage/intensity of associated precipitation.  Recent trends are
at least signaling potential for some snow from the
central-southern Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic and
southern/eastern New England with rain possible over parts of the
Southeast/Florida.  However the current possibilities for the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast still range between minimal and significant
snowfall.  Continue to monitor forecasts of this system closely.
Expect the upper trough/wavy front moving into the West early next
week to bring an episode of rain and mountain snow, with highest
totals likely to extend from the Pacific Northwest into the
northern-central Rockies.  Precipitation should increase in
coverage and intensity over the central/southern Plains and
vicinity by next Wednesday or so as the surface front interacts
with a strengthening low level flow of Gulf moisture.  Some snow
may be possible from the central High Plains northeastward.

Many parts of the West will see well above normal temperatures
extend through the weekend with some areas seeing plus 10-20F
anomalies.  Best potential for daily records will be over
California Saturday-Sunday.  The upper trough approaching from the
Pacific will begin a cooling trend over the Pacific
Northwest/northern California by Monday while the Great Basin and
Southwest remain quite warm.  Then expect moderately below normal
highs to spread across the West/Rockies by Tuesday-Wednesday.
Meanwhile the Plains will see a warming trend (up to plus 10-20F
or so anomalies) from the weekend into early next week before the
western front approaches.  Areas near the East Coast will see a
warm day Saturday (plus 10F or greater anomalies) before passage
of a cold front, with trailing temperatures generally 10-20F below
normal progressing from the Mississippi Valley Saturday through
the East into early next week.  The East will likely rebound to
near or above normal by next Wednesday.

Valid 12Z Sun Feb 13 2022 - 12Z Thu Feb 17 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A rather significant pattern change is coming early next week as a
strong trough, originating over the Gulf of Alaska, drops
southeastward across the West Coast region.  This will abruptly
replace the long-standing upper ridge that will be over the
western third of the nation through this weekend, which is
expected to lead to surface cyclogenesis by the middle of next
week across the western High Plains.  This will tend to displace
the ridge axis farther east across the Plains, although less
amplified than before, and resulting in more of a quasi-zonal flow
pattern across much of the central and eastern U.S. as the deep
upper trough over the East Coast region lifts out by early-mid
next week.  Additionally, there will be an offshore low that
develops off the East Coast for late Sunday and then lifts
northeastward to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, with increasing
chances for snow across parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z deterministic model guidance is in very good agreement on
the expected synoptic scale evolution of the western U.S. trough
that builds in for early next week.  However, there are still some
model differences with shortwave energy crossing the eastern U.S.
through early Monday and its role in offshore surface
cyclogenesis.  The 12Z CMC was the outlier solution with a closed
low forming farther west and had the main QPF axis well inland
compared to the model consensus, so it was not incorporated for
the fronts/pressures forecast.  However, the 00Z CMC is more
compatible with the other guidance.  The WPC fronts/pressures
forecast was primarily derived from a GFS/ECMWF/UKMET blend
through Monday, and then gradually increasing percentages of the
means through the middle of next week.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

An offshore low is expected to develop along the exiting cold
front on Sunday as shortwave energy from an approaching upper
level trough induces cyclogenesis.  There has been a very slight
westward trend in the guidance over the past 24 hours, but this
still keeps the majority of the precipitation off the coast.
However, some snow is becoming increasingly likely for portions of
eastern New England and also across parts of the Delmarva and into
Virginia.  This may begin as a cold rain before changing to snow.
Later in the forecast period across the central U.S., widespread
showers and thunderstorms are likely to develop by Wednesday into
Thursday as the surface low develops further across the Plains and
advects copious Gulf of Mexico northward, with some strong storms
possible in this type of synoptic scale set-up.  There may also be
some accumulating snow on the northern periphery of this low
pressure system across portions of the Midwest states.

In terms of temperatures, below average readings are expected by
Sunday and into early next week for the eastern U.S. as the strong
cold front ushers in a renewed round of cold weather.  Highs up to
20 degrees below normal are possible for portions of the Great
Lakes region this weekend.  It should be mild once again across
most of the Plains for Sunday and into Monday with the West Coast
region beginning to cool down with the trough building in, after
anomalous warmth across portions of California this weekend.

...Early taste of spring across most of the Lower 48; record
warmth in California and the Pacific Northwest...

...Frontal system to produce rain and snow showers across the
eastern Great Lakes and New England...

...Heavier snowfall to come with the second storm system on
Thursday across the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes, next round of
Arctic air arrives in the Midwest by the start of the weekend...

The weather pattern the second half of the workweek is highlighted
by a robust upper level ridge positioned atop the West Coast. This
ridge is responsible for fostering considerably warmer than normal
temperatures for mid-February throughout the western third of the
U.S.. The most impressive warmth will be focused in California
where daytime highs look to range between 15 to 25 degrees above
normal. Some locations in Southern California may top 90 degrees
each day and daily record high temps could be broken from San
Diego to both Oregon and Washington State. Heat Advisories have
been issued for the greater Los Angeles metro area through the
upcoming weekend. Not only are there Heat Advisories, but Wind
Advisories are also in place for a good portion of Southern
California due to a favorable pattern for Santa Ana winds to
transpire. Farther north, there are High Wind Warnings in place
for parts of the northern Rockies where an approaching upper level
disturbance is primed to cause wind gusts potentially in excess of
60 mph.

Farther east, March-like temperatures will be common throughout
the Great Plains, the Deep South, and up the East Coast. Daytime
high temperature departures in the northern High Plains will range
between 20 to 30 degrees above normal while portions of the
Mid-Atlantic reach as high as 60 degrees. Highs in the 70s are
expected for parts of the South Central U.S. today and Friday. In
contrast, the Great Lakes will be on the colder side thanks to a
cold front having ushered in a colder air-mass for Thursday. Some
lake effect snow showers are possible in the eastern Great Lakes
this morning but should diminish by Thursday evening. The same
cold front is set to trigger rain and snow showers in New England
with minimal snowfall accumulations expected. One area likely to
receive up to six inches of snow is near the Adirondacks in
northern New York where Winter Weather Advisories are in effect
through this evening.

Meanwhile, a storm system emerging out of the Canadian Prairies
delivers another round of snow to the Upper Midwest today then
makes a push into the northern Great Lakes Thursday night. Snow
totals appear to range between 3 to 6 inches in northern
Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, Michigan's U.P., and northwest
Michigan. The primary cold front associated with the wave of low
pressure will trigger scattered rain and snow showers from the
Ohio Valley to the Great Lakes on Friday with these showers
spreading east into the northern and central Appalachians Friday
night. A secondary cold front trailing the main storm system
provides a fresh injection of Arctic air into the Midwest late
Friday into Saturday morning. By early Saturday morning, lows will
plummet below zero throughout much of Minnesota with frigid
temperatures returning to parts of the Middle Mississippi and Ohio
Valleys later in the day on Saturday.

0147 AM CST Thu Feb 10 2022

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow aloft will overspread the CONUS as a surface
cyclone approaches the Great Lakes and a cold front moves southeast
across the northern Plains. Relatively cooler temperatures and
resultant higher RH in proximity to the cold front should limit
wildfire spread potential across the central/northern Plains. Drier
surface air is expected across the southern High Plains, but the
lack of an appreciable surface wind field should also limit wildfire
spread concerns here as well.

Dry offshore flow is expected to continue across southern
California, with Elevated to occasionally Critical meteorological
surface conditions likely. Nonetheless, fuels are poorly receptive
to fire spread on a widespread basis, with no fire weather
highlights introduced.

0151 AM CST Thu Feb 10 2022

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough embedded in the larger scale 500 mb northwesterly
flow is expected to amplify while surging southeast across the
central and southern Plains in tandem with a surface cold front
tomorrow/Friday. Windy conditions are expected across the central
and southern Plains, where fuels in several locales are highly
receptive to wildfire spread. At the moment though, the latest suite
of available guidance lacks consensus in low-level moisture
depiction, with minimum RH varying from 15-35 percent across the
central Plains. As such, fire weather highlights have been withheld.
Elevated or Critical highlights may be added across portions of the
central Plains in future outlooks should guidance consensus trend
drier. 15-25 percent RH should overspread the southern High Plains
by afternoon peak heating given downslope flow, though surface winds
appear too weak to add Elevated highlights this outlook.

Dry offshore flow should persist across southern California, though
poorly receptive fuels should limit widespread significant wildfire
concerns.

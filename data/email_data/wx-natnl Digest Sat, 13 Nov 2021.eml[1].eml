Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1041 AM CST Fri Nov 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 11/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CST Fri Nov 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level low over the Great Lakes will move eastward
through the day today as a strong mid-level jet along the backside
of the low moves over the southern Plains. At the surface, a
developing cold front is forecast to move south with dry and windy
conditions expected behind the front. While fuel conditions are
marginal, strong winds and low humidity may support elevated fire
weather potential over portions of the southern Plains this
afternoon.

...Southern Plains...
As the aforementioned cold front develops and moves south early this
morning, surface flow should veer to the northwest and increase as
pressure gradients tighten. Bolstered by deep mixing from an 80 kt
mid-level jet, northwesterly surface winds of 20-30 mph, and higher
gusts, are expected through much of the day across the Plains. While
temperatures will be modest, the downslope nature of the flow and
dry continental air behind the cold front will support surface
humidity values in the teens and low 20s through the afternoon. As
such, elevated fire weather conditions may develop across portions
of the southern Plains before RH begins to increase after sunset.

...Southern California...
Periodic offshore flow is expected across portions of southern
California this morning as surface pressure gradients strengthen in
response to increasing pressure over the Great Basin and Rockies.
Surface conditions are not forecast to be overly dry with daytime
humidity values around 20%. As such, locally elevated fire weather
conditions may occur across the higher terrain of the southern
California coastal ranges, but widespread fire weather concerns are
not anticipated.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1222 PM CST Fri Nov 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains unchanged. With the shortwave trough moving
into the Plains, some lee troughing is expected to develop into the
southern High Plains. With high surface pressure in the West, some
increase in westerly/southwesterly winds will occur. However, RH
will be marginal (near 20%) as will winds (near 15 mph). Only
locally elevated conditions are expected in parts of eastern New
Mexico into the Texas South Plains.

..Wendt.. 11/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CST Fri Nov 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime is forecast to continue
Day2/Saturday as the Great Lakes upper low weakens and continues
eastward. A second shortwave trough within northwesterly flow over
the Rockies is forecast to intensify as it moves southeastward
through the day. At the surface, high pressure will build over the
Great Basin and Rockies in the wake of a cold front sweeping through
the eastern half of the country. Given cooler and drier conditions
along with modest available fuels, fire weather potential is
forecast to remain low with only locally elevated conditions
possible across portions of southern California where weak offshore
flow may develop late in the day.

Valid 12Z Mon Nov 15 2021 - 12Z Fri Nov 19 2021

...Moderate to heavy precipitation over the Pacific Northwest
continues into Monday...

...Overview...

Expect the western ridge/eastern trough upper pattern as of the
start of the week to transition toward progressive and broadly
cyclonic mean flow. As this transition begins, Pacific energy
about to enter western North America will direct an axis of
moisture into the Pacific Northwest, while under the eastern
trough aloft the chilly low level flow around a system tracking
into the Canadian Maritimes will promote lake effect/enhanced rain
or snow. Over the course of the week the Pacific shortwave will
continue across the continent, supporting a strong southern Canada
surface low and trailing cold front that ultimately crosses much
of the lower 48--along with some strong/gusty winds over parts of
the northern tier and later some rain over the east-central U.S.
Well above normal temperatures from the West into the Plains and
cool conditions over the East early in the week should moderate
later in the week with the flatter trend for the mean pattern.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance from the 00/06Z cycle shows fairly good agreement
with the broader pattern especially early on in the period, and
the WPC forecast was able to use a composite blend of the 06Z GFS
and 00Z ECMWF, UKMET, and CMC. The blend served to smooth out
remaining differences with shortwaves and surface low pressure
systems in the East. Guidance did continue its trend toward more
amplified troughing coming into the West by Tuesday, which
continues to be reflected in most new 12Z models as well (though
the 12Z GFS ends up with an open 500 mb trough on Wednesday unlike
the consensus closed low). This amplified flow trend may lead to a
slightly faster track of the surface low through southwestern and
south-central Canada and its associated cold front sweeping across
the CONUS during the week compared to the previous forecast. By
the latter part of the week, differences in the axis/tilt of the
central U.S./Canada trough stemming from the low increase, as GFS
and CMC runs bring shortwave energy through the southern part of
the trough to produce a neutral-negative tilt, while the 00Z ECMWF
holds onto a positively tilted trough Thursday. Given that this
tilt in the EC showed almost the deepest solution compared to
CMC/EC/GFS ensemble members in the southern U.S. Thursday and
Friday, leaned away from that solution, and the new 12Z run
trended away as well (though the 12/00Z EC runs have been
flip-flopping back and forth on this type of solution). Farther
upstream, flow out of the eastern Pacific into the West remains
quite uncertain, with the potential for shortwaves to break
through ridging at various times and areas in separate Pacific
streams. Thus for the latter part of the medium range period, used
a blend with increasing influence from the GEFS and EC means,
lessening the ECMWF and GFS influence, which led to generally flat
flow in the Pacific, a conservative approach while awaiting
improved agreement.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A band of enhanced moisture along a wavy front heading into the
Northwest will produce locally heavy precipitation into the early
part of the week. Precipitation should be all rain even in higher
elevations of the Olympics and Cascades into Monday but snow
levels should lower Monday night as the cold front comes through.
Expect the highest precipitation totals over the Olympics and
Cascades with locally heavy rain possible over areas that have
been quite wet over the last week or so. Some rain and higher
elevation snow should spill into the northern Rockies late Monday
through Tuesday. Meanwhile shortwaves moving through the southwest
side of the initial eastern U.S. upper trough and cold
northwesterly low level flow behind a consolidating system
tracking into the Canadian Maritimes will produce lake
effect/enhanced precipitation downwind of the Great Lakes through
Tuesday. The surface system itself could bring light rain and
higher elevation/interior Northeast snow. Then the potent surface
low tracking across southern Canada Monday onward will bring a
period of strong/gusty winds to northern tier areas, especially
the Northern Plains on Tuesday into Wednesday. Moisture should
increase ahead of the low's trailing cold front from midweek
onward, leading to increasing rain chances for portions of the
Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys along with additional
precipitation for the Great Lakes region. Most of this activity
should be light to moderate.

Well above normal temperatures will prevail over the West and into
the Plains Monday-Tuesday with a broad area of plus 10-25F
anomalies. Some readings could reach daily record values, perhaps
with a slightly better chance for record warm lows relative to
highs. At the same time the East will be on the cool side, with
Monday seeing the best potential for some highs 10-15F below
normal. The cold frontal passage will spread slightly below normal
temperatures from west to east across the lower 48 mid-late week.
Leading warm anomalies reaching the South and East
Wednesday-Thursday will be only in the plus 5-15F range.

...Moderate to heavy precipitation over the Pacific Northwest
continues into Monday...

...Overview...

Expect the western ridge/eastern trough upper pattern as of the
start of the week to transition toward progressive and broadly
cyclonic mean flow. As this transition begins, Pacific energy
about to enter western North America will direct an axis of
moisture into the Pacific Northwest, while under the eastern
trough aloft the chilly low level flow around a system tracking
into the Canadian Maritimes will promote lake effect/enhanced rain
or snow. Over the course of the week the Pacific shortwave will
continue across the continent, supporting a strong southern Canada
surface low and trailing cold front that ultimately crosses much
of the lower 48--along with some strong/gusty winds over parts of
the northern tier and later some rain over the east-central U.S.

300 PM EST November 12 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast to develop over eastern Canada
early in week-2, favoring relatively cool conditions across parts of the
eastern and central U.S. during the period. An area of mid-level high
pressure,
centered over the Bering Strait and southern Arctic Ocean, is likely to res=

in below normal temperatures across much of Alaska for most of week-2. Onsh=
ore
flow is forecast to increase over the Alaska Panhandle and possibly extend
into
the northwestern contiguous U.S., with the exact orientation dependent on t=
he
strength of ridging in the Northeast Pacific. Models continue to differ
regarding the degree of amplification of the overall pattern over the lower=
 48
leading to a low confidence hazards forecast.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of southwestern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, Sat-Tue, Nov 20-23.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of Mainland Alaska =
and
the Alaska Peninsula, Sat-Fri, Nov 20-26.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the Alaska Panhandle, Sun-Fri, Nov 2=

yHl5Aj2TU6A$

FOR SATURDAY NOVEMBER 20 - FRIDAY NOVEMBER 26: The largest amplification in
the
500-hPa height forecast is forecast across the North Pacific in week-2, whe=
re
the ECMWF, GEFS and Canadian ensembles depict anomalous ridging over the
Bering
Strait and Arctic Ocean, troughing to the south of the Aleutians, and ridgi=
ng
across the Northeast Pacific and western CONUS. The ECMWF and Canadian
ensembles continue to be more amplified with these features compared to the
GEFS, although the GEFS depicts a more amplified solution compared to
yesterday. The mid-level flow pattern is generally less amplified across th=
e
central and eastern CONUS, although weak troughing is forecast to develop
across the East, likely a result of the forecast downward trend in both the
North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation indices, in addition to t=
he
ridging favored upstream over the West. This pattern may continue to allow
waves of anomalously cold air to dive into the eastern U.S. during late
November, as well as increased chances for cyclogenesis in the East, althou=
gh
the exact timing and location of this potential is very uncertain.



The anomalous mid-level heights forecast across the Bering Sea, and associa=
ted
surface high pressure over the Arctic, favor anomalously cold temperatures
across Mainland Alaska. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is
posted for parts of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula for all of wee=
k-2
where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict at least a 20% chance
minimum temperatures drop below the 15th climatological percentile. Both
reforecast tools also depict increased chances (40-60%) for minimum
temperatures dropping below -20 deg F over the eastern and central interior
Mainland, especially early in the period. There is also increasing confiden=
ce
for anomalous cold expanding across the southwestern Mainland and the Alask=
a
Peninsula where both reforecast tools depict probabilities exceeding 40% fo=
r
temperatures falling below the 15th climatological percentile and 0 deg F,
supporting a moderate risk for much below normal temperatures over these ar=
eas
from 11/20 through 11/23. The ECMWF indicates the most anomalous cold early=
 in
the week-2 period, with the GEFS favoring it closer to the middle of the
period. By the end of the period, troughing is forecast to shift closer to =
the
state, which favors a more southerly flow developing over the eastern
Mainland.
The dynamical models indicate some moderation in temperatures over eastern
Alaska by the end of week-2. However, the anomalous cold looks to remain
entrenched across the southwestern Mainland and the Alaska Peninsula for al=
l
of
week-2 as this troughing moves overhead.



Troughing moving closer to Alaska also favors an increase in onshore flow
across the Panhandle and southeastern Mainland toward the middle of the
period,
leading to areas of heavy rain along the coast and snow for the higher
elevations. The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools depict some areas having at
least a 20% chance for 3-day liquid-equivalent precipitation tools to excee=
d
the 85th climatological percentile and 2 inches, corresponding with a sligh=
t
risk for heavy precipitation starting 11/21 and lasting through the end of =
the
period. There is more uncertainty regarding heavy precipitation extending
further south into the northwestern CONUS. The stronger ridging in the ECMW=
F
and Canadian ensembles favors the heaviest precipitation remaining north of
the
Canadian border. The GEFS has trended toward these more amplified solutions=
,
with recent runs of the deterministic GFS also depicting a more expansive a=
rea
of positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the western CONUS. As a result, t=
he
heavy precipitation hazard is not extended into the northwest CONUS at this
time, although intermittent periods of heavy rain or high elevation snow
cannot
be ruled out across the Pacific Northwest, especially over areas closer to =
the
Canadian border.



A cold front is forecast to move through the eastern U.S. late in week-1,
which
will result in a relatively cool air mass setting up across the Midwest
through
the Eastern Seaboard during week-2 as weak mid-level troughing develops ove=
r
the area. Reinforcing shots of cold air are possible throughout the period,
with the ECMWF reforecast tool depicting increased probabilities (20-40%) f=
or
subzero temperatures across portions of the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley. However, the GEFS reforecast tool is not as anomalous w=
ith
the cold, and probabilities for minimum temperatures dropping below the 15t=
h
percentile are less than 20% in nearly all areas of the CONUS. Much of the
eastern and central CONUS have already experienced their first freeze,
reducing
the chances of any significant impacts to agriculture, so a related
temperature
hazard is not posted. The increased frontal activity in the eastern half of
the
CONUS may enhance precipitation chances over some areas, with the ECMWF
ensemble being particularly robust regarding heavy precipitation potential
across the south-central and southeastern states toward the middle of the
period. However, due to limited support from the other guidance and transie=
nt
nature of the system, no related hazard is posted.

...Heavy rain and strong to severe thunderstorms across the
Northeast to move offshore overnight...

...Flash flooding potential to persist over the Pacific Northwest
through the weekend as onslaught of heavy rainfall continues...

...An Alberta clipper will deliver another around of snow from the
Northern Plains to the Great Lakes Saturday into Sunday...

The occluded low pressure system that brought snow and high winds
to the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest will progressively weaken
today as it slowly moves across the Great Lakes. In spite of this
weakening gusty winds will continue to blow on the southwest side
of the system through the afternoon while any lingering light
snowfall transitions into mixed precipitation. Meanwhile, the
easternmost cold front associated with this system will pass
through the Eastern Seaboard, bringing showers and thunderstorms
to portions of the Northeast and south Florida. Isolated instances
of severe weather in the form of damaging wind gusts and a tornado
or two will be possible over southern New England this afternoon,
prompting the issuance of Marginal Risk of Severe Thunderstorms by
the Storm Prediction Center through Saturday morning. In addition
to the severe weather these storms may produce heavy rainfall over
the Northeast, where high rain rates could lead to isolated
instances of runoff and flash flooding. As such, the Weather
Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall
for portions of the Northeast effective through Saturday morning.

Strong cyclonic flow around the deep Great Lakes low pressure
system will serve to transport colder Canadian air southward into
the central US, allowing for the development of a secondary cold
front extending from the Ohio Valley to the Southern Plains. This
influx of cooler air will force temperatures to drop well below
normal over the eastern half of the country throughout the
weekend. The greatest hit to daily high temperatures will occur on
Saturday in the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys where highs in the 40s
and low 50s are expected, which translates to a departure from
normal of around 15 to 20 degrees. Overnight lows are also
expected to take a steep drop to near or below freezing in the
Southern Plains and Southeast this weekend, prompting the issuance
of Freeze Warnings and Freeze Watches in these regions,
respectively.

Shifting focus out west, onshore moisture flow from yesterday's
atmospheric river will continue to wind down this afternoon,
however, the potential for high rainfall rates of 0.5-0.75 inches
per hour and flooding associated with these heavy downpours will
persist, especially across steep terrain and burn scarred areas.
As such, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk
of Excessive Rainfall for portions of the Pacific Northwest. A
brief reprieve from the rain will occur early Saturday before a
second, stronger atmospheric river reaches the coastline Saturday
night, this time delivering 3-5 inches of rain in 24 hours to the
region. Given the already saturated soils from the previous days'
rain and the concern for more widespread rapid run-off and urban
flooding, the Weather Prediction Center has upgraded to a Slight
Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of extreme northwest
Washington beginning Sunday morning.

Further inland, a new low pressure center will organize over
Alberta, Canada tonight as the energy from the dissipating
atmospheric river progresses east. Reinforced by a shortwave
trough aloft, this system will deepen overnight as it moves
southeast into the Northern Plains. Trailing to the south of the
low an associated warm front is expected to serve a dual purpose:
allow temperatures throughout the west and Great Plains to rise 10
to 15 degrees above normal and provide instability for another
round of snow across the Northern Tier. Widespread snowfall totals
of 2-4 inches are expected from eastern North Dakota to Michigan,
while a precipitation transition zone further west will allow for
the development of freezing rain and light ice accumulations from
northeast Montana to western Minnesota.

Elsewhere in the Central/Southern Plains, dry and breezy
conditions coinciding with low values of relative humidity has
prompted the issuance of an Elevated Risk of fire weather by the
Storm Prediction Center through Saturday morning, as these
conditions could allow any fires that ignite to spread rapidly.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 18 - 22 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions depict a variable 500-hPa=
 flow pattern across most
of
the forecast domain, and quickly progress it eastward during the 6 to 10 da=
y
period. Model ensemble solutions are in relatively better agreement across
Alaska as an amplified upstream ridge over Eastern Siberia will likely prom=
ote
troughing and anomalous northerly mid-level flow across most of  Mainland
Alaska. The 500-hPa manual height blend, based primarily on the ensemble me=
ans
from the GEFS and ECMWF, generally features near to below normal heights ov=

the east-central CONUS and near to above normal heights across the rest of =
the
CONUS, consistent with the expected variable pattern. Above normal heights =
are
favored for northwestern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle with near to bel=
ow
normal heights forecast across most of Mainland Alaska and Aleutians.

Anomalous northerly mid-level flow forecast downstream of the eastern Siber=
ia
ridge and near surface easterly flow from western Canada lead to increased
odds
of below normal temperatures across Alaska. Near to above normal temperatur=
es
are favored for much of the western half of the CONUS, underneath above nor=
mal
500-hPa heights and anomalous southeasterly low-level flow. Near to below
normal temperatures are likely for most of the Midwest and Central Mississi=
ppi
Valley under forecast below normal 500-hPa heights which bring the cold air
mass from Canada. Near to above normal temperatures are predicted across mu=
ch
of the eastern coastal regions consistent with the consolidation forecast
tool.

Anomalous northerly mid-level flow and offshore low-level flow are expected=
 to
combine to favor a dry pattern for most of western Mainland Alaska. Farther=
 to
the south, mean onshore flow is expected, favoring an active pattern with
elevated probabilities for above normal precipitation across parts of
southeastern Alaska and the Panhandle. Mean surface high pressure is foreca=
st
across much of the remainder of the CONUS, favoring below normal precipitat=
ion
over most areas. However, as surface high pressure progresses eastward acro=

the Southeast, return moisture flow and forecast front activity may enhance
precipitation across parts of the western Gulf Coast, Lower Mississippi Val=

...Moderate to heavy precipitation over the Pacific Northwest
continues into Monday...

...Overview...

Expect the western ridge/eastern trough upper pattern as of the
start of the week to transition toward progressive and broadly
cyclonic mean flow. As this transition begins, Pacific energy
about to enter western North America will direct an axis of
moisture into the Pacific Northwest, while under the eastern
trough aloft the chilly low level flow around a system tracking
into the Canadian Maritimes will promote lake effect/enhanced rain
or snow. Over the course of the week the Pacific shortwave will
continue across the continent, supporting a strong southern Canada
surface low and trailing cold front that ultimately crosses much
of the lower 48--along with some strong/gusty winds over parts of
the northern tier and later some rain over the east-central U.S.
Well above normal temperatures from the West into the Plains and
cool conditions over the East early in the week should moderate
later in the week with the flatter trend for the mean pattern.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance from the 00/06Z cycle shows fairly good agreement
with the broader pattern especially early on in the period, and
the WPC forecast was able to use a composite blend of the 06Z GFS
and 00Z ECMWF, UKMET, and CMC. The blend served to smooth out
remaining differences with shortwaves and surface low pressure
systems in the East. Guidance did continue its trend toward more
amplified troughing coming into the West by Tuesday, which
continues to be reflected in most new 12Z models as well (though
the 12Z GFS ends up with an open 500 mb trough on Wednesday unlike
the consensus closed low). This amplified flow trend may lead to a
slightly faster track of the surface low through southwestern and
south-central Canada and its associated cold front sweeping across
the CONUS during the week compared to the previous forecast. By
the latter part of the week, differences in the axis/tilt of the
central U.S./Canada trough stemming from the low increase, as GFS
and CMC runs bring shortwave energy through the southern part of
the trough to produce a neutral-negative tilt, while the 00Z ECMWF
holds onto a positively tilted trough Thursday. Given that this
tilt in the EC showed almost the deepest solution compared to
CMC/EC/GFS ensemble members in the southern U.S. Thursday and
Friday, leaned away from that solution, and the new 12Z run
trended away as well (though the 12/00Z EC runs have been
flip-flopping back and forth on this type of solution). Farther
upstream, flow out of the eastern Pacific into the West remains
quite uncertain, with the potential for shortwaves to break
through ridging at various times and areas in separate Pacific
streams. Thus for the latter part of the medium range period, used
a blend with increasing influence from the GEFS and EC means,
lessening the ECMWF and GFS influence, which led to generally flat
flow in the Pacific, a conservative approach while awaiting
improved agreement.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A band of enhanced moisture along a wavy front heading into the
Northwest will produce locally heavy precipitation into the early
part of the week. Precipitation should be all rain even in higher
elevations of the Olympics and Cascades into Monday but snow
levels should lower Monday night as the cold front comes through.
Expect the highest precipitation totals over the Olympics and
Cascades with locally heavy rain possible over areas that have
been quite wet over the last week or so. Some rain and higher
elevation snow should spill into the northern Rockies late Monday
through Tuesday. Meanwhile shortwaves moving through the southwest
side of the initial eastern U.S. upper trough and cold
northwesterly low level flow behind a consolidating system
tracking into the Canadian Maritimes will produce lake
effect/enhanced precipitation downwind of the Great Lakes through
Tuesday. The surface system itself could bring light rain and
higher elevation/interior Northeast snow. Then the potent surface
low tracking across southern Canada Monday onward will bring a
period of strong/gusty winds to northern tier areas, especially
the Northern Plains on Tuesday into Wednesday. Moisture should
increase ahead of the low's trailing cold front from midweek
onward, leading to increasing rain chances for portions of the
Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys along with additional
precipitation for the Great Lakes region. Most of this activity
should be light to moderate.

Well above normal temperatures will prevail over the West and into
the Plains Monday-Tuesday with a broad area of plus 10-25F
anomalies. Some readings could reach daily record values, perhaps
with a slightly better chance for record warm lows relative to
highs. At the same time the East will be on the cool side, with
Monday seeing the best potential for some highs 10-15F below
normal. The cold frontal passage will spread slightly below normal
temperatures from west to east across the lower 48 mid-late week.
Leading warm anomalies reaching the South and East
Wednesday-Thursday will be only in the plus 5-15F range.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 AM EST Sat Nov 13 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Nov 16 2021 - 12Z Sat Nov 20 2021

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show the upper pattern settling into
broadly cyclonic mean flow, with a hint of a strengthening eastern
Pacific ridge by next weekend. The relatively low amplitude and
progressive nature of this regime should decrease predictability
for forecast details behind a vigorous shortwave that will move
eastward from western North America Tuesday onward and support a
strong southern Canada surface low and trailing cold front
crossing most of the lower 48. This system will produce a period
of strong/gusty winds over northern tier areas of the U.S. and
then some rain over the east-central U.S. Well above normal
temperatures over the Plains and southern half of the West at the
start of the period on Tuesday will moderate and move eastward
ahead of the advancing cold front. Somewhat below normal
temperatures behind the front will spread into the central/eastern
U.S. mid-late week. During the latter half of the week the
precipitation and surface pattern details farther west become
increasingly uncertain.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models have continued to show some difficulty in resolving the
details of the strong upper trough (likely with an embedded closed
low tracking just north of the U.S.-Canadian border around
Wednesday) and thus with the forecast of the cold front crossing
the lower 48 and anchoring low pressure in Canada. 12Z/18Z GFS
runs had been on the slower/sharper side of the envelope with the
upper trough and thus slow with the cold front. The new 00Z GFS
made a considerable adjustment toward the 12Z ECMWF--as did the
00Z UKMET from a previously more suppressed surface evolution.
Meanwhile latest CMC runs and the 12Z CMC mean are on the fast
side. Finally, latest 00Z runs thus far appear to confirm 12Z
guidance favoring a moderately flat/progressive handling of the
upper trough once it reaches the East, in contrast to the
slow/amplified depiction in yesterday's 00Z ECMWF. An initial
blend of 12Z/18Z guidance available at the time of forecast
preparation ultimately led to an evolution closest to the 12Z
ECMWF.

Upstream shortwave details still appear to be a ways from being
resolved. There is a leading feature around 145-150W longitude as
of early Tuesday and even latest 00Z runs range between a diffuse
shearing out (most models in some fashion) and a stronger one
(CMC), leading to dramatic differences in western U.S.
precipitation coverage/intensity. Whether left over from the
initial shortwave or originating farther upstream, additional
Pacific energy comes into the West while northern stream flow from
the Northeast Pacific and vicinity may also reach Canada and the
northern lower 48 late in the period. Thus far the GFS/CMC runs
have been leaning toward the progressive side for the general area
of shortwave energy expected to reach the West by Thursday and
continue along thereafter while the ECMWF/ECMWF mean have been
slower. Latest GEFS means have been moderately progressive too but
with less of a surface reflection. The past 12 hours of GFS runs
have been trending less amplified with the overall trough, thus
leading to a more suppressed surface system over/near the
Southeast by late in the period--a nod to the ensemble means that
have generally tended to keep fairly strong high pressure over
much of the East. The progressive nature of the pattern could
suggest the 12Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean (with a wave back over the Plains
early Saturday) could be somewhat slow but at least they have been
more consistent thus far. The latter half of the manual forecast
trended toward a majority weight of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means
due to the uncertainty, with the rest composed of a little more
12Z ECMWF weight versus the 18Z GFS.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Expect mostly light to moderate rain and higher elevation snow
over the northern Rockies through Tuesday in association with the
upper trough/leading cold front pushing through the region. The
potent surface low tracking across southern Canada Tuesday onward
will bring a period of strong/gusty winds to northern tier areas,
especially the Northern Plains on Tuesday into Wednesday. Moisture
should increase ahead of the low's trailing cold front from
midweek onward, leading to mostly light/moderate rain over
portions of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys along
with some light precipitation in the Great Lakes region. The
Florida Peninsula may see increasing rainfall for a time mid-late
week as moisture interacts with a stalled front to the south, with
fairly low confidence in coverage/intensity details at this time.
Likewise confidence is below average for any precipitation that
could reach the West around mid-late week, with the full range of
possibilities ranging between only light/scattered activity and an
area of heavier/more organized precipitation. The significant
uncertainty extends into the central and eastern U.S. by
Friday-Saturday with minimal confidence in any specific solution
for precipitation coverage/intensity.

Well above normal temperatures will continue into Tuesday over the
Plains and southern half of the West. The warmest readings versus
normal should be over the Plains where plus 15-25F anomalies will
be common and some daily records for highs/warm lows will be
possible. Currently the best potential for highs to approach/reach
record values is over the western half of Texas. As the cold front
emerging from the Northeast continues onward, warmth will extend
into the South and East Wednesday-Thursday but in modified form
with highs/lows generally only up to 10-15F above normal. Cooler
air behind the front will spread mostly 5-10F below normal
temperatures across the central and eastern U.S. from Wednesday
through the rest of the week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CST Sat Nov 13 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Long wave troughing with several embedded shortwave features will
continue across the eastern half of the US today as a strong
mid-level jet and shortwave trough traverse the central Rockies. At
the surface, high pressure will strengthen through the Great Basin
while a lee trough develops across the High Plains. Cooler and drier
conditions across the CONUS will limit fire weather potential,
through locally elevated conditions may linger in spots through the
day.

...Eastern New Mexico and portions of the Southern High Plains...
With lee troughing expected to develop through the day across the
High Plains, gusty west/southwest winds will likely increase through
the afternoon across portions of eastern New Mexico and west Texas.
Winds of 15-20 mph will be possible with occasional higher gusts in
and around the higher terrain. Despite cooler surface conditions to
start the day, model soundings also show relatively dry low-levels
with RH less than 25% possible through peak heating. Some overlap of
dry and windy conditions is expected, though fuels remain somewhat
limited across the region. This suggests that any fire weather
threat should remain local in nature.

...Southern California...
Moderate offshore flow will linger through the day Saturday as drier
air begins to move in from the interior deserts. Despite
increasingly warm temperatures and low humidity, upper level support
remains relatively weak suggesting low-level winds will remain
mostly unfavorable for widespread fire weather conditions across
much of southern California. Some increase in winds early in the
period and late overnight suggests low-end elevated fire weather
potential will be possible across the coastal ranges where fuels are
supportive. However, fire weather concerns remain low.

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime will continue Day2/Sunday as the
shortwave trough over the Rockies ejects eastward and deepens across
the central and eastern US. To the west, ridging will steadily
build, shunting stronger mid-level flow to the north and east. High
pressure over the Great Basin will intensify, supporting warmer and
drier conditions through much of the West. Occasional dry and breezy
conditions will likely linger over portions of the High plains,
though coverage should remain low. With high pressure in place
little overlap between strong winds and warm/dry conditions is
expected across the lower 48 Sunday. As such, no fire weather areas
will be included at this time.

...Low pressure formation tonight over New England will likely
bring a round of enhanced rain/wet snow and gusty winds across the
region...

...A lull in the active weather today over the Pacific Northwest
before the next wave of heavy rain arrives on Sunday....

...An Alberta clipper will deliver another around of snow and
gusty winds across the northern tier states through the weekend...

Even as the large cyclonic circulation over the Great Lakes
weakens and retreats into Canada, one last piece of upper-level
energy rotating around the back side of the system is interacting
with a secondary cold front to produce an organized band of rain
moving toward the Appalachians this Saturday morning.  The rain is
accompanied by temperatures falling into the 30s together with
wind directions shifting to the west as a large cool air mass over
the mid-section of the country moves into behind the cold front.
By tonight, a low pressure center is forecast to form and
intensify rather quickly over New England as the cold front begins
to exit the East Coast.  Some thunderstorms could form later today
over southern New England as the low develops, and they could
become strong.  In addition, a burst of precipitation is forecast
for interior New England tonight following the passage of the low
center.  The higher elevation could see a burst of wet snow
together with gusty winds right behind this intensifying compact
storm.

Shifting focus out west, onshore moisture flow from yesterday's
atmospheric river will continue to wind down this afternoon,
however, the potential for high rainfall rates of 0.5-0.75 inches
per hour and flooding associated with these heavy downpours will
persist, especially across steep terrain and burn scarred areas.
As such, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk
of Excessive Rainfall for portions of the Pacific Northwest. A
brief reprieve from the rain will occur early Saturday before a
second, stronger atmospheric river reaches the coastline Saturday
night, this time delivering 3-5 inches of rain in 24 hours to the
region. Given the already saturated soils from the previous days'
rain and the concern for more widespread rapid run-off and urban
flooding, the Weather Prediction Center has upgraded to a Slight
Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of extreme northwest
Washington beginning Sunday morning.

Further inland, a new low pressure center will organize over
Alberta, Canada tonight as the energy from the dissipating
atmospheric river progresses east. Reinforced by a shortwave
trough aloft, this system will deepen overnight as it moves
southeast into the Northern Plains. Trailing to the south of the
low an associated warm front is expected to serve a dual purpose:
allow temperatures throughout the west and Great Plains to rise 10
to 15 degrees above normal and provide instability for another
round of snow across the Northern Tier. Widespread snowfall totals
of 2-4 inches are expected from eastern North Dakota to Michigan,
while a precipitation transition zone further west will allow for
the development of freezing rain and light ice accumulations from
northeast Montana to western Minnesota.

Elsewhere in the Central/Southern Plains, dry and breezy
conditions coinciding with low values of relative humidity has
prompted the issuance of an Elevated Risk of fire weather by the
Storm Prediction Center through Saturday morning, as these
conditions could allow any fires that ignite to spread rapidly.

Even as the large cyclonic circulation over the Great Lakes
weakens and retreats into Canada, one last piece of upper-level
energy rotating around the back side of the system is interacting
with a secondary cold front to produce an organized band of rain
heading toward the Appalachians this Saturday morning.  The rain
is accompanied by temperatures falling into the 30s together with
wind directions shifting to the west as a large cool air mass over
the mid-section of the country moves in behind the cold front.  By
tonight, a low pressure center is forecast to form and intensify
rather quickly over New England while the cold front exits the
East Coast.  Some thunderstorms could form and become strong later
today over southern New England as the low pressure center
develops.  In addition, a burst of precipitation is forecast for
interior New England tonight following the passage of the low
center.  The higher elevation could even see a burst of wet snow
together with gusty winds right behind this intensifying compact
storm.

The quick round of rain/wet snow is forecast to depart New England
on Sunday as the compact storm exits into the Canadian Maritimes.
Colder air will then be ushered across the Great Lakes, leading to
the likelihood of lake-effect snow or mixed precipitation in the
lee of the Great Lakes on Sunday.  Meanwhile, an Alberta clipper
is forecast to track across the northern Plains today and across
the Great Lakes on Sunday.  This quick-moving storm will deliver
another around of snow and gusty winds through these areas, with
rain showers farther to the south.  By Monday morning, the Alberta
clipper should be tracking near the Canadian border of New England
while another low pressure system is forecast to form near the New
England coast.  The new system will later take over as the more
dominant system.

Over the Pacific Northwest, a lull in the recent onslaught of
heavy rain is expected for today.  However, the next round of
heavy rain is scheduled to arrive on Sunday ahead of an active
warm front coming from the Pacific.  While it appears that this
next round of heavy precipitation will be confined to the
northwestern portion of Washington states, this surge of moisture
will be unrelenting into Monday morning.  The higher elevations of
the northern Cascades will likely see heavy snow measured in feet
during the next few days.

The entire western U.S. will remain milder than normal through the
weekend.  Much milder than normal conditions are expected over the
northern High Plains on Monday with developing downslope flow as
another Alberta clipper is forecast to form.

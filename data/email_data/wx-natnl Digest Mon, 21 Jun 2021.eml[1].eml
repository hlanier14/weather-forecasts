Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1135 AM CDT Sun Jun 20 2021

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST UTAH INTO NORTHWEST
COLORADO...

...Great Basin...
A stronger corridor of downslope surface winds seems likely across
parts of northeast Utah into northwest Colorado. This will be driven
by a tightening surface gradient near the front as well as moderate
flow aloft on the southern flank of the upper trough. A critical
area has been added.

...Southwest...
While isolated thunderstorms are possible in the higher terrain,
northwest flow and decreasing mid-level moisture is evident on water
vapor imagery. Coverage of these thunderstorms still appears too low
to warrant highlights.

...Southern California...
Recent lightning activity, continued hot/dry conditions, and some
increase in westerly surface winds will drive locally elevated fire
weather concerns within the some of the higher terrain and their
immediate lee. There is some potential for plume-dominated growth
given the unstable low/mid levels that will develop this afternoon.

..Wendt.. 06/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Sun Jun 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing will gradually deepen across the north-central
CONUS today, while high pressure remains entrenched across the
Southwest. Mid-level ridging will gradually build later this
afternoon, keeping warm and dry conditions across the Southwest. At
the surface, a cold front will move south across the Rockies and
back up to the Front Range this evening. Ahead of the front, warm
and dry conditions will support elevated fire weather potential
through the Southwest and portions of the Rockies.

...Southwest and southern Rockies...
As the mid-level trough across the northern US continues to dig
southeastward, northwest flow will overspread much of the Great
Basin and Southwest this afternoon. Gusty surface winds around 15-20
mph will coexist with warm temperatures and low humidity below 20%.
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions appear possible
from southwest Wyoming to southern Arizona. Fire weather conditions
will begin to diminish this evening as a cold front moves south
bringing cooler and less favorable conditions.

Across southwestern New Mexico and eastern Arizona, isolated
thunderstorms are again forecast to develop during the afternoon
hours. Warm surface temperatures above 90 F will favor high-based
storms with little precipitation potential. A few dry lightning
strikes will be possible with any storms that develop along the
higher terrain through the afternoon. The resurgence of the ridge
should limit storm coverage with only a few dry strikes expected.

Valid 12Z Wed Jun 23 2021 - 12Z Sun Jun 27 2021

...Heat intensifies late week over the interior Northwest/West
toward record levels...
...Mid-late week heat eases for the Plains before possibly
returning during weekend over the northern Plains...
...Heavy rain threat for the mid-section of the country late this
week...


...Overview...

Ample upper ridging is again forecast to build/strengthen into
parts of the West next week as an upper vortex along the West
Coast slowly drifts offshore leading to a Rex block pattern.  This
will allow another stretch of warm/hot weather and record highs to
expand over the Pacific Northwest southward to the Desert
Southwest by late in the week.  In turn, this will promote
downstream troughing over the Great Lakes/Midwest as another
frontal boundary pushes through the region with showers and
storms.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

A composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean together with the 00
UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and some contribution from the 00Z
CMC/CMC mean appears to offer a good starting point for the day
3-5 (Wednesday-Friday) forecast period in a pattern with above
average continuity and predictability.  Uncertainty and model
spread increase across southern Canada into the northern Plains by
next weekend as model solutions are trending toward digging
additional energy downstream from the top of the Rex block.  This
calls for increasing usage of the ensemble means for Days 6 and 7.
 Developing model differences included details with the hot
ridging over the West, but especially with the amplitude and
longitudinal focus of downstream upper trough amplification over
the east-central U.S.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low just off northern California is forecast to detach
from the northern stream and then meander in the same vicinity as
a ridge of high pressure over the Pacific builds into the
Northwest through the medium-range period.  This will allow
temperatures to climb to 15-25+ degrees above normal in
Washington/Oregon next weekend, and more generally 5-15 degrees
above normal along and west of the Rockies.  Record highs are
likely to expand across the area especially across the Pacific
Northwest and into the northern Rockies late in the week where
afternoon temperatures peaking over 100F and possibly 110F are
forecast for the interior sections of the West.  Little to no
rainfall is expected to ease the heat throughout the region.  The
heat may then expand eastward into the northern Plains late next
weekend.

Farther east, an increasingly robust/amplified upper trough
digging from south-central Canada will carry a wavy and fortified
cold front southeastward into the east-central U.S. as a warm
front lifts through and out of the southern Plains, inviting
moisture return northward by later week.  Showers and storms will
significantly increase in coverage and intensity later this week
along and ahead of the front and near areas of low pressure, with
focuses over the Upper Midwest/Corn Belt through the
Mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys.  It appears that the
Mid-Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys will be the most likely
regions to see some heavy rainfall late next week.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun June 20 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

 ...Tropical Depression Claudette to continue producing pockets of
heavy rain and thunderstorms throughout the eastern Carolinas this
evening, with gusty winds possible along coastal regions into
early Monday morning...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across parts the
Midwest tonight and into the Interior Northeast on Monday...

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat wanes across California and
the Southwest to start the workweek, while expanding into the
Pacific Northwest...

Tropical Depression Claudette is currently moving into Upstate
South Carolina this afternoon and is forecast to swing
northeastward into eastern North Carolina by Monday morning. As it
does so, Claudette is expected to restrengthen into a tropical
storm and produce gusty winds along coastal sections of North
Carolina. Tropical Storm Warnings have been issued. Additionally,
areas of heavy rain and severe thunderstorms will remain possible
from northern Florida and the Florida Panhandle to southeast North
Carolina overnight. By Monday afternoon the system will exit into
the eastern Atlantic Ocean and all associated weather hazards will
quickly diminish.

Farther northwest, a strengthening area of low pressure and potent
cold front will be responsible for isolated flash flooding
concerns and severe thunderstorms throughout the Midwest and
portions of the Great Lakes tonight. The Storm Prediction Center
has issued and Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of severe weather from
Lower Michigan and northwest Ohio to far southeastern Iowa.
Isolated tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large hail are all a
possibility. Multiple rounds of heavy rain could also cause
isolated instances of flash flooding throughout this same region.
By Monday, the aforementioned cold front is forecast to reach the
Ohio and Lower Mississippi valleys. Showers and thunderstorms will
be widespread ahead of and along the frontal boundary. A few
storms could turn severe and produce damaging wind gusts and
isolated tornadoes between the Ohio Valley and interior sections
of the Northeast. Meanwhile, flash flooding will be the main
hazard throughout the Tennessee Valley and Deep South on Monday,
as many areas recently received an excess amount of rain over the
last week. The cold front is then expected to squeeze most of the
rain chances to the Southeast, Gulf Coast, and East Coast on
Tuesday, while also ushering in comfortable and below average
temperatures.

For the western U.S., a long-awaited cooling trend is finally on
the way for the Southwest on Monday. High temperatures will once
again soar well into the triple digits this afternoon, but will
settle to near and slightly below average early this week as an
upper-level low spins off the coast of California. Excessive Heat
Warnings and Heat Advisories remain in effect for much of
California, the Southwest, and the central Great Basin. The
opposite will be true throughout the Pacific Northwest as this
region has mostly avoided the recent heat wave until now. High
temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average will be felt across
Oregon and Washington through Monday, before cooler temperatures
return on Tuesday. With the ongoing heat and exceptionally dry
soil, fire weather is also a concern for much of the Intermountain
West and Southwest over the next couple of days.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0236 PM CDT Sun Jun 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEVADA...

...Southern Nevada...
With very strong heating and thermal pressure trough development,
the increasing mid-level flow across southern Nevada will lead to
lead to a targeted area of critical fire weather in southern Nevada.
With lightning activity within the last three days, there is some
potential for holder fire activity.

...Northern California/Oregon...
With the approach of a shortwave trough late in the day, isolated
thunderstorms could develop within south-central Oregon during the
afternoon. A broader area of mid-level convection is possible into
the overnight as a disturbance moves northward through the area.
PWAT values will be increasing through the day and will potentially
be near 0.8-0.9 in. during the overnight. However, there still is
potential for lightning ignitions for a few reasons: 1) elevated
convection will be moving quickly, 2) limited buoyancy will keep the
lifespan of any one convective element short, and 3) low-levels
still appear modestly dry in forecast soundings.

..Wendt.. 06/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Sun Jun 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A deepening trough across the northern third of the US will keep
cooler and wetter conditions across the center of the country
through Monday. High pressure over the Southwest will gradually
weaken as a mid-level low moves onshore across California. Elevated
fire weather conditions may develop across portions of the
Southwest, while thunderstorms are expected across the West Coast.

...Southern Great Basin...
On the periphery of the suppressed ridge across the Southwest,
stronger mid-level flow will begin to overspread the southern Great
Basin ahead of a Pacific trough Day2/Monday. Sheltered from the
cooler airmass associated with the stalled front through the
Rockies, warm and dry conditions are expected with surface RH of
10-15%. The favorable overlap of dry surface conditions and gusty
winds will support elevated to near critical fire weather potential
through the day. A corridor of critical fire weather conditions may
develop across southern Nevada and Utah Monday afternoon, where
stronger mid-level flow may enhance westerly surface winds to 20-30
mph. However, model differences highlight some uncertainty with the
eastward extent of the stronger mid-level flow, suggesting low
predictability for widespread/concentrated critical conditions.

..Northern California and southern Oregon...
A few thunderstorms may develop Monday as moist onshore flow ahead
of the Pacific trough overspreads the West Coast. Model soundings
show sufficient instability for isolated lightning strikes from late
afternoon through the evening. Fuels are receptive to starts, but
increasing moisture with PWATS near 1 inch suggest storms may
produce enough precipitation to limit significant potential for dry
strikes.

...Heat intensifies late week over the interior Northwest/West
toward record levels...
...Heavy rain threat for the mid-section of the country late this
week...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was derived from a composite of
best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET and NAEFS/ECENS means along with the 01 UTC National
Blend of Models days 3-4 (Thu-Fri) in a pattern with above average
continuity and predictability. Prefer a solution more in line with
the still compatible GEFS/NAEFS/ECENS means starting next weekend
amid growing forecast spread. Developing differences include hot
ridge transitions over the West, but especially with longitudinal
focus of downstream trough amplification over the central U.S. as
energies dig lee of Rex blocking. 00 UTC model guidance does not
seem to clarify the differences.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low just off northern California is forecast to meander
offshore later this week as a hot ridge builds inland through the
Northwest. This will allow temperatures to climb to 15-25+ degrees
above normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Rockies, and
more generally 5-15 degrees above normal along and west of the
Rockies. Record highs are likely from the Pacific Northwest to the
northern Rockies, with afternoon temperatures peaking well over
100F are forecast for the interior sections of the West. Little to
no rainfall is expected to ease the high heat throughout the broad
region.

Downstream, robust upper trough digging from south-central Canada
will solidify a wavy and fortified cold front to move steadily
over the central to eastern U.S., inviting moisture return by
later week. Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall/runoff potential along and ahead of the front
from the Midwest to the Mid-South, Southern Plains and across the
Ohio Valley and Appalachians to the Northeast.

0208 AM CDT Mon Jun 21 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
The mid-level flow pattern across the CONUS will become more
amplified today, as a broad trough deepens across the Great Lakes.
Over the West, a mid-level ridge will be compressed by an
approaching upper low off the California coast. Increasing westerly
flow aloft will spill over into the Great Basin supporting critical
fire weather conditions, while thunderstorms develop over the West
Coast.

...Southern Great Basin and Vicinity...
Ahead of the Pacific trough, southwesterly mid-level low will
increase across eastern California and west-southwestern Nevada.
Warm and dry conditions will persist under the northward extension
of the ridge, as westerly downslope flow increases through the day.
Across the southern Great Basin, widespread surface RH below 15% is
expected by early afternoon. As winds increase through the diurnal
cycle, 20-25 mph sustained westerlies will overlap with the dry
airmass, supporting critical fire weather conditions.

...West Coast Dry Thunder...
Moist onshore flow will develop across much of the West Coast ahead
of the mid-level low. Regional model soundings show modest buoyancy
developing above relatively dry sub-cloud layers across northern
California and southern Oregon. Isolated dry lightning strikes
appear likely over dry fuels. Moisture should continue to increase
through the evening and overnight hours, augmenting precipitation
efficiency. However, fast-moving and high-based storms will likely
still support a few dry strikes as the mode becomes wetter.

0213 AM CDT Mon Jun 21 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE
NEVADA...UTAH...AND ARIZONA...

...Synopsis...
Eastern US troughing is forecast to deepen Day2/Tuesday, while an
upper low off the West Coast slowly moves onshore. Flanked by the
troughs, a mid-level ridge over the Southwest will become
increasingly elongated as it is shunted to the east by falling
heights over to the west. Increasing mid-level flow will result in
warm, dry, and windy conditions developing across much of the Desert
Southwest, supporting critical fire weather.

...Nevada, Utah, and Arizona...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions are expected to develop
Day2/Tuesday afternoon across the southern Great Basin and
southwestern US. Southwesterly flow aloft ahead of the main upper
low will increase, with 500 mb winds of 30-40 kts overspreading
southern Nevada and western Utah by early afternoon. Enhanced
mixing, both mechanical and thermally driven, should bolster surface
winds to 25-30 mph across a broad swath of southern Nevada and Utah.
Widespread critical fire weather conditions appear likely given
recent fire activity and exceptionally dry fuels. Critical
conditions will likely extended to the east of this enhanced
corridor, across the higher terrain of southern and central
Colorado. Here, sustained surface winds are likely to be lower owing
to weaker flow aloft. However, frequent gusts to near 25 mph should
be adequate for a few hours of critical conditions, given recent
lightning and likely holdover fire activity.

...Northwest...
As flow aloft from the approaching West Coast trough strengthens,
cross Cascade pressure gradients will tighten driving westerly flow
down the leeward slopes. The dry downslope nature of the flow will
likely support a few hours of locally elevated/critical fire weather
conditions through the afternoon. Model guidance differs on arrival
of the stronger flow aloft, casting considerable uncertainty of the
longevity of any fire weather threat across the area.

Additionally, some risk for thunderstorms along the West Coast will
continue Day2/Tuesday as deeper moisture and forcing for ascent
spread inland. Storm coverage should remain widely scattered, but
increasingly moist surface profiles may favor a storm mode less
favorable for efficient lightning strikes. A few dry strikes are
possible over dry fuels through the evening, but sufficient coverage
for dry thunder probabilities appears unlikely at this time.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Central Appalachians/Ohio Valley to the Lower Mississippi Valley
and parts of the Western to Eastern Gulf coast through Tuesday
morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Ohio
Valley/Central Appalachians through Tuesday morning...

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat wanes across California and
the
Southwest, while expanding into the Pacific Northwest on Monday...

A front extends from the Great Lakes roughly southwestward to the
Southern High Plains, moves eastward off the Northeast Coast by
Tuesday evening and off the Southeast Coast by Wednesday morning.
Moisture will be pooling along the boundary and showers and
thunderstorms as the front moves eastward through Wednesday.  The
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams are the most vulnerable through Tuesday morning.
Similarly, upper-level energy will be over the Gulf Coast with
tropical moisture in place, showers and thunderstorms will develop
over the region.  The WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams are the most vulnerable through Tuesday
morning.

Furthermore, the front will produce showers and thunderstorms over
the Northeast. The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic
and parts of the Ohio Valley/Central Appalachians through Tuesday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.

The severe thunderstorm threat weakens a bit on Tuesday along the
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.  The excessive rainfall threat
weakens, too. However, there will be a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Southeast and Southern Appalachians on
Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

Tropical Depression Claudette is forecast to move eastward off the
North Carolina Coast on Monday, redevelops into a Tropical Storm.
Claudette will then move northeastward out over the Western
Atlantic off the Northeast Coast towards the Canadian Maritimes by
Wednesday.  Check the latest advisory from the National Hurricane
Center for the most up-to-date track and intensity of Claudette.
Claudette will produce heavy rain over parts of the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic until the storm moves off the coast on
Monday.

Elsewhere, the high heat over most of the western U.S. will end as
the temperature becomes more average. However, there is a
potential for record-breaking high minimum temperatures across the
Northwest on Monday. The combination of heat and exceptional
drought is also leading fire weather concerns throughout the Great
Basin and parts of the Southwest through Wednesday. Red Flag
Warnings are in effect across parts of Utah, western Colorado, and
northwestern Nevada.

excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams most vulnerable through
Tuesday morning.

Furthermore, the front will produce showers and thunderstorms over
the Northeast. The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic
and parts of the Ohio Valley/Central Appalachians through Tuesday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.

The severe thunderstorm threat weakens a bit on Tuesday along the
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.  The excessive rainfall threat
diminishes as well. However, there will be a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Southeast and Southern
Appalachians on Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

Claudette is forecast to move eastward off the North Carolina
Coast today and then move northeastward out over the Western
Atlantic off the Northeast Coast towards the Canadian Maritimes by
Wednesday.  Claudette will produce heavy rain over parts of
eastern North Carolina through this morning. Check the latest
advisory from the National Hurricane Center for the most
up-to-date track and intensity of Claudette.

Elsewhere, the high heat over most of the western U.S. will end as
the temperature becomes more average. However, there is a
potential for record-breaking high minimum temperatures across the
Northwest today. The combination of heat and exceptional drought
is also leading to fire weather concerns throughout the Great
Basin and parts of the Southwest through Wednesday. Red Flag
Warnings are in effect across parts of Utah, western Colorado, and
northwestern Nevada.

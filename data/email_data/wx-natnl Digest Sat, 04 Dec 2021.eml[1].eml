Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1048 AM CST Fri Dec 03 2021

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments
were made with this update based on the latest observations and
high-resolution model guidance. A few hours of Elevated fire-weather
conditions remain possible this afternoon across parts of the Texas
South Plains. Clear skies across the area combined with downslope
warming/drying on the backside of a weak shortwave trough should
support RH of 15-20 percent and west-southwesterly surface winds of
15-20 mph with higher gusts. Based on the observed 12Z MAF sounding,
these conditions will be most likely for areas that warm to near
80F, allowing for deeper mixing.

Farther east across the Mid-Atlantic states, warm and dry conditions
will develop this afternoon where receptive fuels exist, though
generally weak northwesterly surface winds should limit the overall
fire-weather threat.

..Weinman/Moore.. 12/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1223 AM CST Fri Dec 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
The strongest winds aloft will remain across the Canadian border
today. A weak shortwave trough will impact parts of West Texas into
the ArkLaTex region through the day. At the surface, a cold front
will make steady progress to the south before stalling in the
vicinity of the Red River.

...Texas South Plains...
Westerly winds are expected to increase ahead of the approaching
front. RH will most likely fall to near 20% with winds of 15-20 mph.
The duration of these conditions is in question, but some areas of
the South Plains could see 3-5 hours of elevated fire weather.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 PM EST Fri Dec 03 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Dec 06 2021 - 12Z Fri Dec 10 2021

...Overview...

Expect a broad mean trough aloft to prevail across much of the
lower 48 next week, with an axis generally extending from
central/east-central Canada into the western U.S. Embedded
shortwaves will push low pressure/frontal systems across the
country, leading to a somewhat more active weather pattern than
has been the case lately. In particular, parts of the West should
see a couple episodes of meaningful precipitation while the
intensity/coverage of rainfall should increase over the
southeastern quadrant of the country and some snow may fall over
northern parts of the East.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to show unusually great spread for the compact
system forecast to approach the Pacific Northwest by early Monday.
GFS/ECMWF runs and their means have converged for track/timing but
GFS runs have been on the deep side of the spread (even with the
upper shortwave becoming less closed in the 12Z run) while the
latest UKMET/CMC are slower and weaker/elongated due to a weaker
shortwave. The past couple GEFS runs show even more spread among
individual members, with the weak and strong extremes at least
20-30 mb apart. The relatively small scale of the shortwave keeps
predictability unusually low for a day 3 forecast, GFS/ECMWF
timing and ECMWF depth looking like the best intermediate approach
at this time. On the other hand the models and ensembles are more
agreeable for for the strong system tracking into eastern Canada
and the trailing front that crosses the eastern U.S., albeit with
some ongoing nudges for details.

In spite of the issues with shortwave energy initially heading
into the Northwest, solutions have trended at least a closer
together than in previous days for what happens downstream.
Consensus now shows enough amplification into the West to support
fairly quick ejection of the leading upper low over Baja
California as of early Monday but then decent progression
thereafter. However meaningful differences still arise over the
East, leading to evolution and track/timing uncertainty for an
area of low pressure from the eastern U.S. into the western
Atlantic Wednesday-Thursday. One multi-day trend of note is that
the forecast surface pattern over the East valid early Wednesday
has generally been trending more suppressed (higher pressures).

There is fairly good agreement on another bundle of Pacific energy
coming into North America Wednesday, with less amplification than
its predecessor, producing southern Canada low pressure that
anchors a front reaching into the West/Plains/Great Lakes. A
trailing feature should amplify more into the West by late in the
week with a model/mean blend generally looking good for this
feature though the 12Z CMC depth is a bit on the more extreme
side.

Model preferences led to starting with a composite of 00Z/06Z
operational models for about the first half of the period. Then
the forecast blend transitioned to a blend operational guidance
and the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A relatively strong surface low pressure system tracking away from
the Great Lakes on Monday should support snow over the region
along with a broader area of strong winds over the northeastern
quadrant of the nation in the tight pressure gradient behind the
low. Conditions will be favorable for lake effect snow behind the
system through Tuesday. Additionally, expect rain to fall along
the trailing cold front associated with the low. Best potential
for meaningful totals should extend from the Ohio Valley to
south-central U.S. but amounts are likely to be tapering down
somewhat compared to Sunday-Sunday night. However, Gulf moisture
should increase again by Tuesday into Wednesday and cause moderate
to possibly locally heavy rainfall from the Lower Mississippi
Valley into the Tennessee Valley and Southeast. Moisture spreading
farther north into cooler air could lead to snow across the
northern latitudes, with relatively higher probabilities from the
Great Lakes into northern New England. There is still considerable
uncertainty over how low pressure from the eastern U.S. into the
western Atlantic will evolve/track, so confidence is fairly low
for exactly how much precipitation may fall over the Northeast.
Some rain could continue near a wavy front lingering over the
extreme Southeast.

A couple of shortwaves moving into/across the West will bring
increasing precipitation chances there, with favored windward
terrain seeing the highest amounts. The Pacific Northwest into
much of the Intermountain West and Rockies should see
precipitation Monday and clearing out by Tuesday while chances
ramp up in the Southwest. Some locations in the Northwest may see
fairly low snow levels with the start of the Monday event. Then
the next round is likely for the Northwest on Wednesday and
spreads into California eastward by Thursday as energy aloft drops
southward. Generally expect higher elevation snow and lower
elevation rain, with snow levels likely to decline later in the
week as upper troughing amplifies over the West.

Chilly temperatures are likely across the far north-central U.S.
on Monday and Tuesday given snow cover from Sunday's system, with
temperatures 10-20F below normal. Meanwhile the Eastern Seaboard
can expect temperatures about 10-20F above normal on Monday ahead
of a cold front that will bring temperatures down to near average
by Tuesday. Temperatures should be within about 10 degrees of
normal in most places across the lower 48 Tuesday and Wednesday,
before a warmup by Thursday and Friday from the Plains eastward,
with 10-15F above average temperatures. Cooler temperatures may
spread into the West late in the week (highs 5-10F or so below
normal by Friday) with the potential for upper troughing to
amplify over the region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 PM EST Fri Dec 03 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Dec 06 2021 - 12Z Fri Dec 10 2021

...Overview...

Expect a broad mean trough aloft to prevail across much of the
lower 48 next week, with an axis generally extending from
central/east-central Canada into the western U.S. Embedded
shortwaves will push low pressure/frontal systems across the
country, leading to a somewhat more active weather pattern than
has been the case lately. In particular, parts of the West should
see a couple episodes of meaningful precipitation while the
intensity/coverage of rainfall should increase over the
southeastern quadrant of the country and some snow may fall over
northern parts of the East.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to show unusually great spread for the compact
system forecast to approach the Pacific Northwest by early Monday.
GFS/ECMWF runs and their means have converged for track/timing but
GFS runs have been on the deep side of the spread (even with the
upper shortwave becoming less closed in the 12Z run) while the
latest UKMET/CMC are slower and weaker/elongated due to a weaker
shortwave. The past couple GEFS runs show even more spread among
individual members, with the weak and strong extremes at least
20-30 mb apart. The relatively small scale of the shortwave keeps
predictability unusually low for a day 3 forecast, GFS/ECMWF
timing and ECMWF depth looking like the best intermediate approach
at this time. On the other hand the models and ensembles are more
agreeable for for the strong system tracking into eastern Canada
and the trailing front that crosses the eastern U.S., albeit with
some ongoing nudges for details.

In spite of the issues with shortwave energy initially heading
into the Northwest, solutions have trended at least a closer
together than in previous days for what happens downstream.
Consensus now shows enough amplification into the West to support
fairly quick ejection of the leading upper low over Baja
California as of early Monday but then decent progression
thereafter. However meaningful differences still arise over the
East, leading to evolution and track/timing uncertainty for an
area of low pressure from the eastern U.S. into the western
Atlantic Wednesday-Thursday. One multi-day trend of note is that
the forecast surface pattern over the East valid early Wednesday
has generally been trending more suppressed (higher pressures).

There is fairly good agreement on another bundle of Pacific energy
coming into North America Wednesday, with less amplification than
its predecessor, producing southern Canada low pressure that
anchors a front reaching into the West/Plains/Great Lakes. A
trailing feature should amplify more into the West by late in the
week with a model/mean blend generally looking good for this
feature though the 12Z CMC depth is a bit on the more extreme
side.

Model preferences led to starting with a composite of 00Z/06Z
operational models for about the first half of the period. Then
the forecast blend transitioned to a blend operational guidance
and the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A relatively strong surface low pressure system tracking away from
the Great Lakes on Monday should support snow over the region
along with a broader area of strong winds over the northeastern
quadrant of the nation in the tight pressure gradient behind the
low. Conditions will be favorable for lake effect snow behind the
system through Tuesday. Additionally, expect rain to fall along
the trailing cold front associated with the low. Best potential
for meaningful totals should extend from the Ohio Valley to
south-central U.S. but amounts are likely to be tapering down
somewhat compared to Sunday-Sunday night. However, Gulf moisture
should increase again by Tuesday into Wednesday and cause moderate
to possibly locally heavy rainfall from the Lower Mississippi
Valley into the Tennessee Valley and Southeast. Moisture spreading
farther north into cooler air could lead to snow across the
northern latitudes, with relatively higher probabilities from the
Great Lakes into northern New England. There is still considerable
uncertainty over how low pressure from the eastern U.S. into the
western Atlantic will evolve/track, so confidence is fairly low
for exactly how much precipitation may fall over the Northeast.
Some rain could continue near a wavy front lingering over the
extreme Southeast.

A couple of shortwaves moving into/across the West will bring
increasing precipitation chances there, with favored windward
terrain seeing the highest amounts. The Pacific Northwest into
much of the Intermountain West and Rockies should see
precipitation Monday and clearing out by Tuesday while chances
ramp up in the Southwest. Some locations in the Northwest may see
fairly low snow levels with the start of the Monday event. Then
the next round is likely for the Northwest on Wednesday and
spreads into California eastward by Thursday as energy aloft drops
southward. Generally expect higher elevation snow and lower
elevation rain, with snow levels likely to decline later in the
week as upper troughing amplifies over the West.

Chilly temperatures are likely across the far north-central U.S.
on Monday and Tuesday given snow cover from Sunday's system, with
temperatures 10-20F below normal. Meanwhile the Eastern Seaboard
can expect temperatures about 10-20F above normal on Monday ahead
of a cold front that will bring temperatures down to near average
by Tuesday. Temperatures should be within about 10 degrees of
normal in most places across the lower 48 Tuesday and Wednesday,
before a warmup by Thursday and Friday from the Plains eastward,
with 10-15F above average temperatures. Cooler temperatures may

FOR SATURDAY DECEMBER 11 - FRIDAY DECEMBER 17: Amplified ridging (troughing=
)
over the western Aleutians (eastern Mainland Alaska) is likely to persist a=
nd
maintain a cold pattern throughout Alaska. Probabilities for minimum
temperatures falling into the lowest 15th percentile of the climatological
distribution across southwest Mainland Alaska remain above 40 percent in th=
e
GEFS probabilistic tool, supporting a continuation of a moderate risk of mu=
ch
below normal temperatures from Dec 11 to 14. Within the moderate risk area,
daily minimum temperatures are expected to range from -20 to -40 degrees F.
The
GEFS probabilistic tool depicts the anomalous cold peaking around Dec 12 wh=
en
there is more than a 20 percent chance of minimum temperatures falling belo=
w
the 5th percentile of the climatological distribution for that time of year=
.
Since the ensemble means depict an increase in 500-hPa heights and smaller
negative anomalies across central and western Mainland Alaska later in week=
-2,
the slight risk of much below normal temperatures is discontinued after Dec
15.
However, the cold hazard persists through the end of week-2 for southeaster=
n
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.



Model solutions are in good agreement and remain consistent that a 500-hPa
trough expands south into the western CONUS prior to week-2. Meanwhile, a
500-hPa ridge is likely to amplify over the northern Pacific and Aleutians
during early to mid-December. This longwave pattern over the northern Pacif=
ic
and western North America is forecast to become well-established and remain
fairly stable through much of week-2. Based on the GEFS probabilistic tool =
(20
to 30 percent chance of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th
percentile and near 1 inch or more, liquid equivalent), a slight risk of he=
avy
snow is posted for the Cascades, northern Sierra Nevada Mountains, and part=
s
of
the northern Rockies from Dec 11-17. Recent deterministic GFS model runs
indicate multiple feet of snow accumulating across these areas during the n=
ext
two weeks. Due to uncertainty on timing of when the heaviest snowfall occur=
s,
a
moderate risk of heavy snow is not posted. The GEFS and deterministic 0Z an=
d
6Z
GFS model runs indicate accumulating snow with the potential for winter sto=
rm
criteria amounts across the lower elevations of the Pacific Northwest,
including Portland, Oregon on Dec 11 and 12. However, the ECMWF model depic=
ts
accumulating snowfall remaining at the higher elevations early in week-2. T=
he
uncalibrated ECMWF model output along with the increased potential for an
atmospheric river supports a slight risk of heavy precipitation across part=
s
of
the Pacific Northwest and northern California from Dec 11-17. The ECMWF and
Canadian ensemble means with their longwave trough axis just offshore of th=
e
West Coast would imply a greater risk of heavy rainfall for the Pacific
Northwest and northern California.



Following a wet November when precipitation averaged 150 to 200 percent of
normal, many river levels across northwest Washington are running above the
95th percentile. Due to the ongoing antecedent wetness and heavy rainfall (=
3
to
5 inches) forecast during the next week, a flooding possible hazard is post=
ed
for northwest Washington. This flooding risk may persist throughout week-2,
since above normal precipitation is favored to continue.



As an amplified 500-hPa trough extends southward at times from the higher
latitudes of western North America, periods of anomalous cold are expected =
to
affect the northwestern CONUS during mid-December. A slight risk of much be=
low
normal temperatures is posted from the Pacific Northwest east to the northe=
rn
high Plains where the GEFS reforecast tool depicts minimum temperatures hav=
ing
at least a 20 percent chance of minimum temperatures falling into the lowes=
t
15th percentile. Compared to the hazards outlook released on Dec 2, this
slight
risk area was extended east to include the northern high Plains as anomalou=
s
cold is expected to shift east of the Continental Divide periodically.



A low pressure system and trailing front are forecast to progress eastward
from
the Mississippi Valley to the East Coast, late in week-1 through the beginn=
ing
of week-2. Based on a model consensus, a slight risk of heavy precipitation=
 is
posted from the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys east to the central and southern
Appalachians. The predicted rainfall forecast during the next week to ten d=
ays
is expected to alleviate short-term dryness.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0134 PM CST Fri Dec 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes were made
with this outlook. A period of locally enhanced fire-weather
conditions remains likely across portions of eastern Wyoming during
the afternoon hours, though the threat appears too localized and
brief to warrant highlights at this time. The latest short-term
model guidance continues to depict only a small overlap of
breezy/gusty westerly surface winds and low RH, with the stronger
surface flow displaced westward (across the higher terrain) from the
better downslope related RH reductions.

A modest offshore surface pressure gradient and strengthening
north-northeasterly flow aloft will contribute to increasing surface
winds and low RH across terrain-favored areas of southern California
from Saturday afternoon through Sunday. While locally enhanced
fire-weather conditions will be likely, the higher threat appears to
be on Sunday as the offshore pressure gradient strengthens.
Therefore, no delineations have been introduced for Saturday at this
time.

..Weinman/Moore.. 12/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0115 AM CST Fri Dec 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong northern jet stream will begin to amplify on Sunday. A
shortwave trough will develop and dig southward through the Northern
Rockies. At the surface, a cyclone will deepen in the lee of the
higher terrain of eastern Montana and eastern Wyoming. Within the
Great Basin, higher surface pressure is expected to develop along
with stronger northerly winds aloft on the western flank of the
digging trough.

...Eastern Wyoming...
Temperatures in the surrounding region may be slightly cooler owing
the recent cold front. However, strong downslope winds will help to
warm and dry the airmass in the immediate lee of the Big Horns and
the Laramie Range. With fuels remaining dry, locally elevated
conditions are probable. Confidence in winds of 15-25 mph is
relatively high. Confidence in broadly low RH is not as high. With
conditions so spatially limited, no highlights will be added.

...Southern California...
Locally elevated conditions are possible in the higher terrain
towards late Sunday and early Monday. Terrain-favored areas could
see 15-25 mph with RH of 15-20%. Upper-level winds will favor
stronger gusts. Recent model guidance has shows an overall
decreasing trend in the offshore pressure gradient strength.
Sustained elevated fire weather conditions still appear too
localized to warrant highlights.

...Record breaking warmth continues from the Southeast to the
Southern Plains today, with widespread above average temperatures
lingering throughout much of the Nation this weekend...

...Heavy snow to impact portions of the Northern Plains and Upper
Midwest beginning Saturday morning...

The tranquil, dry, and warm weather pattern in place over the last
few days is expected to linger over much of the Lower 48 this
afternoon before cooler and more active weather enters the picture
this weekend. A potent ridge of high pressure will be responsible
for an expansive area of above average temperatures engulfing
nearly the entire Nation over the weekend, with the Northeast and
Northwest being the only exceptions. A weak cold front bisecting
the eastern U.S. will allow for record breaking warmth to be
confined to the southern third of the country to end the workweek.
Highs into the 70s and low 80s will be common throughout the
Southeast, Lower Mississippi Valley, Southern Plains, and
Southwest. Slightly cooler, but still well above average
temperatures are forecast to extend into the Midwest this weekend.
For New England, cold and blustery northwest winds force
temperatures to stay below average for early December. In
addition, persistent lake effect snow showers are possible through
Sunday morning with some enhancement possible on Saturday as a low
pressure system passes just to the north. A few inches of snowfall
are most likely across the eastern U.P. of Michigan and the Tug
Hill Plateau of New York.

Meanwhile, more widespread and impactful winter weather is likely
throughout the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest to kick off the
first weekend of December. An upper level disturbance entering the
Northwest on Saturday combined with an arctic airmass located just
north of the U.S.-Canada border allows for an area of snowfall to
develop over the Northern High Plains Saturday morning. Snow is
also likely across the far Northern Rockies and the Washington
Cascades as a stream of moisture  arrives from the Pacific. By
Saturday night into Sunday morning, a developing area of low
pressure over central Montana is expected to move east with the
associated precipitation, leading to a swath of moderate-to-heavy
snow from northeast Montana to northern Minnesota. Widespread
snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches is likely across the
northern half of North Dakota (mainly north of Interstate 94), and
northern Minnesota. These snowfall totals and the potential for
periods of heavy snow will lead to hazardous travel conditions.
The swath of heavy snow reaches the Upper Great Lakes by Sunday
evening, resulting in potentially 6 inches or more of snowfall in
portions of Michigan's Upper Peninsula Sunday night.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri December 03 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 09 - 13 2021

Today's model solutions are in fairly good agreement on the predicted 500-h=
Pa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. In the mean mid-level height field, ridging is forecast ov=
er
the Aleutians, leading to anticipated troughing downstream across Mainland
Alaska and the Panhandle. Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are likely o=
ver
much of the eastern CONUS, while mean troughing with below normal 500-hPa
heights is predicted over most of the western and central CONUS. Due to rec=
ent
model performance, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa height =
blend forecast gives equal
weight to the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means and less weight to the Canadian
ensemble mean.

Troughing over the western CONUS leads to increased chances of below normal
temperatures over most of the western and north-central CONUS. Ridging with
near to above normal 500-hPa heights during the period favors above normal
temperatures over much of the eastern and south-central CONUS. Troughing
forecast over much of Alaska leads to increased chances of below normal
temperatures across most of the state, consistent with the Auto Blend and
consolidation temperature forecast tools.

The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of above normal
precipitation over the western CONUS. Near to above normal precipitation is
also favored over most of the eastern CONUS and the Mississippi Valley, ahe=
ad
of mean troughing predicted over the central CONUS. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored across parts of the Southern Plains and the Florid=
a
Peninsula, consistent with the operational Auto Blend and consolidation
precipitation forecast tools. Troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights le=
ad
to increased chances of above normal precipitation across most of Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
fairly good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutio=
ns.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 11 - 17 2021

In the week-2 period, strong ridging and associated positive 500-hPa height
anomalies continue to be forecast near the Aleutians. Troughing over easter=
n
Alaska is likely to persist into week-2 and extend southward to the western
CONUS. Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over most of the
southern and eastern CONUS.

Increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast in week-2 for
nearly all of Alaska and the West Coast of the CONUS as well as parts of th=
e
Northern Rockies underneath predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa
heights. Forecast near to above normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased
chances of above normal temperatures across most of the remainder of the
CONUS.
This is also consistent with the consolidation temperature forecast tool.

Above normal precipitation is favored across most of the western CONUS, due=

troughing and enhanced Pacific flow predicted across the West Coast. Near t=

due to the forecast above normal heights. Above normal precipitation is
favored
over parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley,
and
Great Lakes due to predicted mean cyclonic flow and associated forecast
frontal
passages. Probabilities of near to above normal precipitation are slightly
elevated for central and northern Mainland Alaska. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored for most of the southern third of Alaska, supporte=

the operational Auto Blend and consolidation precipitation forecast tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1248 AM CST Sat Dec 04 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong jet stream across the Canadian border will begin to amplify
by the end of today. As this occurs, a surface trough will deepen
and slide eastward from the northern Rockies into the northern
Plains. High pressure will build into the Northwest and Great Basin.

...Eastern Wyoming...
Strong flow at mid-levels will shift southward over Wyoming during
the day. With the surface trough deepening in the High Plains,
strong westerly winds will develop by afternoon. Winds could reach
20-25 mph. With the recent cold font, temperatures will be rather
cool outside of areas of downslope winds. Locally elevated
conditions are possible in the lee of the Big Horns and Laramie
Range where RH is more likely to drop to around 20%.

...Southern California...
A modest offshore pressure gradient is expected to develop by late
Saturday into early Sunday. Northerly/northeasterly winds aloft will
also strengthen through the period along the westerly flank of a
mid-level trough. RH reductions to near 15-20% may occur along with
winds of 15-20 mph. Models continue to trend slightly weaker with
the offshore gradient strength. Elevated conditions will be confined
to higher terrain and are not expected to become widespread.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1250 AM CST Sat Dec 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will continue to amplify as it moves into the
northern Plains and eventually the upper Midwest on Sunday. At the
surface, a stronger cold front will push quickly through the Plains
during the day. Across the western coast, northerly mid-level winds
will remain along with high surface pressure in the Great Basin.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather is expected to occur as
the surface pressure gradient tightens ahead of the advancing cold
front. Winds of 15-25 mph are possible. RH will generally fall to
near 20%, but some locations could see values as low as 15%.

...Southern California...
The modest offshore pressure gradient will likely peak on Sunday
into Monday morning. A few hours of locally elevated conditions are
likely within the higher terrain/foothills from Santa Barbara into
Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. RH near 15% is probable, but
sustained winds will not be overly strong away from wind-prone
areas. A few stronger gusts to 35-40 mph may occur given the
favorable winds aloft.

...Central Plains...
Localized fire weather concerns are possible ahead of the front in
parts of eastern Colorado into western Kansas. RH of less than 20%
appears probable, but winds of 15-20 mph will likely only occur in
terrain-favored locations. Northerly winds of 20-30 mph behind the
cold front may briefly coincide with marginally reduced RH. RH
recovery behind the front will be swift, however.

210 AM EST Sat Dec 04 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Dec 07 2021 - 12Z Sat Dec 11 2021

...Notable snow in the interior Northeast is currently expected
Wednesday, with wintry impacts potentially reaching southward into
the I-95 corridor and possibly the Mid-Atlantic states, while
locally heavy rain may occur over the Southeast...

...Considerable mountain snows are likely across the Cascades,
Sierra Nevada, Intermountain West, and Rockies during the latter
half of next week...

...Overview...

Expect a broad mean trough aloft to prevail across much of the
lower 48 next week, with an axis generally extending from
central/east-central Canada into the western U.S. Embedded
shortwaves will push low pressure/frontal systems across the
country, leading to a somewhat more active weather pattern than
has been the case lately. In particular, parts of the West should
see meaningful precipitation while the intensity/coverage of
rainfall should increase over the southeastern quadrant of the
country and some impactful snow may fall over northern parts of
the East.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

After multiple days of GFS runs had been significantly stronger
with shortwave energy coming into the West Day 3/Tuesday, the 18Z
and 00Z GFS have come in weaker with the feature, more in line
with other guidance. So there seems to be an increasing consensus
with this shortwave, but uncertainty is still somewhat high given
the energy stems from the less predictable high latitudes. The
uncertainty in the details of the forecast continues Wednesday
onward despite reasonable consensus for the overall pattern.
Differences in the handling of this shortwave energy as well as
northern stream/Great Lakes energy lead to evolution and
track/timing uncertainty for an area of low pressure from the
eastern U.S. into the western Atlantic Wednesday-Thursday. Overall
the low pressure system continued its overall trend more
suppressed, but with considerable variability in its track and
timing with the 12/18Z model cycle and the incoming 00Z cycle,
which leads to uncertainty with precipitation amounts across the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.

Overall there is fairly good agreement on another bundle of
Pacific energy coming into North America Wednesday, with less
amplification than its predecessor, producing southern Canada low
pressure that anchors a front reaching into the West/Plains/Great
Lakes. The 12Z ECMWF appears to be the outlier with this surface
low, faster/farther east compared to consensus and the previous
model cycles. Then, energy is yet again expected to dig southward
and amplify troughing in the West by Friday, though the degree of
amplification differs among guidance, with the 12Z CMC depth a bit
on the more extreme side.

Model preferences led to starting with a composite of 12Z/18Z
operational models for about the first half of the period. Then
the forecast blend transitioned to a blend of the operational
12/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF and the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF mean.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Gulf moisture should increase by Tuesday into Wednesday ahead of
frontal systems and cause moderate to possibly locally heavy
rainfall from the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee
Valley and Southeast. Moisture spreading farther north into cooler
air should lead to snow across the northern latitudes, with the
highest probabilities of notable snow across the Northeast. There
is still considerable uncertainty over how low pressure from the
eastern U.S. into the western Atlantic will evolve/track, so
confidence is fairly low for exactly how much precipitation may
fall over the Northeast, and how far south significant snow
reaches. Some rain could continue late next week near a wavy front
lingering over the extreme Southeast.

Fairly light precipitation is forecast for the Pacific Northwest
and the Four Corners states on Tuesday, before precipitation
chances increase from midweek onward. As shortwave energy and
troughing drop southward through the West, precipitation will
spread from the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies Wednesday
southward to California into the Great Basin to Central Rockies
Thursday and Friday. Generally expect higher elevation snow and
lower elevation rain, with snow levels likely to decline later in
the week as upper troughing amplifies over the West. Parts of
Southern California may see its first rainfall in over a month.

Chilly temperatures are likely across the far north-central U.S.
on Tuesday given snow cover from Sunday-Monday's system, with
temperatures 10-20F below normal. Other than that, temperatures
should be within about 10 degrees of normal in most places across
the lower 48 Tuesday and Wednesday before a warmup by Thursday
through Saturday from the Plains eastward, with 10-20F above
average temperatures. Cooler temperatures may spread into the West
late in the week (highs 5-15F or so below normal by Friday and
Saturday) with the potential for upper troughing to amplify over
the region.

frontal systems and cause moderate to possibly locally heavy
rainfall from the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee
Valley and Southeast. Moisture spreading farther north into cooler
air should lead to snow across the northern latitudes, with the
highest probabilities of notable snow across the Northeast. There
is still considerable uncertainty over how low pressure from the
eastern U.S. into the western Atlantic will evolve/track, so
confidence is fairly low for exactly how much precipitation may
fall over the Northeast, and how far south significant snow
reaches. Some rain could continue late next week near a wavy front
lingering over the extreme Southeast.

Fairly light precipitation is forecast for the Pacific Northwest
and the Four Corners states on Tuesday, before precipitation
chances increase from midweek onward. As shortwave energy and
troughing drop southward through the West, precipitation will
spread from the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies Wednesday
southward to California into the Great Basin to Central Rockies
Thursday and Friday. Generally expect higher elevation snow and
lower elevation rain, with snow levels likely to decline later in
the week as upper troughing amplifies over the West. Parts of
Southern California may see its first rainfall in over a month.

Chilly temperatures are likely across the far north-central U.S.
on Tuesday given snow cover from Sunday-Monday's system, with
temperatures 10-20F below normal. Other than that, temperatures
should be within about 10 degrees of normal in most places across
the lower 48 Tuesday and Wednesday before a warmup by Thursday
through Saturday from the Plains eastward, with 10-20F above
average temperatures. Cooler temperatures may spread into the West
late in the week (highs 5-15F or so below normal by Friday and
Saturday) with the potential for upper troughing to amplify over
the region.

...Winter storm to produce heavy snow and gusty winds from the
Northern Plains to the Upper Great Lakes this weekend...

...A strong cold front entering the Midwest and Southern Plains by
Sunday evening could spark isolated severe thunderstorms and
instances of flash flooding from the lower Ohio Valley to eastern
Texas...

Much of the active weather located across CONUS through the
beginning of next week will be associated with a strong area of
low pressure forecast to traverse the northern tier. Upper level
energy combined with Pacific moisture are currently entering the
Northwest and will spread into the northern High Plains this
morning. As it does so, the Washington Cascades and far northern
Rockies are expected to pick up around 6 to 12 inches of snow
today, with locally higher amounts. By this evening and into early
Sunday, a developing area of low pressure over central Montana
will move eastward and spread moderate-to-heavy snowfall just to
the south of the U.S.-Canada border. This storm system is then
forecast to continue strengthening on Sunday as it enters the
Upper Midwest and Great Lakes, with gusty winds and bitterly cold
air trailing closely behind. By Monday morning, storm total
snowfall amounts over 6 inches are expected to stretch through
northern North Dakota/Minnesota and into portions of far northern
Wisconsin and the U.P. of Michigan. The combination of heavy snow
and gusty winds will likely make travel treacherous at times for
this region. Winter Storm Watches and Warnings, as well as Winter
Weather Advisories have been issued.

The other facet of this early-December winter storm will be found
along and ahead of an attached cold front that is forecast to
reach the Midwest and Southern Plains by Sunday evening. Warm and
well above average temperatures out ahead of this cold front will
clash with the approaching arctic airmass and likely spark a line
of showers and thunderstorms extending from the Ohio Valley to
eastern Texas. Isolated instances of severe weather and flash
flooding are possible into Monday morning for this section of the
country. Correspondingly, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Marginal Risk (level 1/5) of severe weather from far southern
Indiana to East Texas. A Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of excessive
rainfall has been issued between far southwest Ohio and central
Arkansas.

Elsewhere, light snow showers and lake effect snow is likely
throughout the Interior Northeast and northern New England later
today as a weak area of low pressure swings into the region from
Canada. For the Northwest, another round of wintry weather is
forecast to enter by Monday morning. Air temperatures associated
with this system could be cold enough to support light snow in the
lower elevations of Washington.

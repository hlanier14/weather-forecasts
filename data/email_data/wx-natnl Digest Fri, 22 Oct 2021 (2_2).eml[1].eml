...A trio of Pacific storm systems to produce copious amounts of
rain and mountain snow in the Northwest and California this
weekend...

...Severe storms possible in parts of the Southeast; Moderate to
heavy rain and severe thunderstorms expected in the Central Plains
Saturday in association with a developing low pressure system...

...Above normal temperatures persist in the Central and Southern
Plains; more seasonal temperatures to return to the Intermountain
West and Northeast; cooler than average in the Midwest and along
the West Coast...

The first in a barrage of Pacific cyclones is making for a wet,
dreary, and in some cases gusty start to the day in the Pacific
Northwest. Some locations containing burn scarred areas, however,
do remain susceptible to potential flash flooding, rapid runoff,
and debris flows. A Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall remains
in place for burn scarred areas of the northern Sierra Nevada
today. The storm weakens as it tracks further inland today and
reaches the northern Rockies tonight. This allows for areas of
valley rain and mountain snow to transpire with light
accumulations. Precipitation remains a welcome sight for the
drought stricken areas of the Intermountain West and West Coast,
and a second storm system will usher in more beneficial rainfall
to the Pacific Northwest on Saturday. Similar to today's storm,
rainfall rates could be excessive at times and burn scarred areas
could contend with rapid runoff and debris flows. This has led to
the issuance of another Marginal Risk for those at-risk areas of
Northern California and southwest Oregon on Saturday. By Saturday
night, a rapidly intensifying Pacific cyclone directing a powerful
atmospheric river squarely at the West Coast delivers a fire hose
of rich subtropical moisture into California. Snow levels will be
low enough to blanket the Sierra Nevada in heavy snow on Sunday
while prolonged periods of rain soak the coast and valleys of
northern and central California. This atmospheric river is set to
drop heavier rainfall amounts and in a shorter time span, leading
to more flash flooding and debris flow concerns for burn scarred
areas of California. In response, a Slight Risk has been issued
for much of Northern California on Sunday.

Further east, a cold front draped along the East Coast may trigger
additional thunderstorms in parts of the Southeast today. Some
thunderstorms could be severe, especially in eastern North
Carolina. Heavy showers and strong thunderstorms are also possible
out ahead of the front in South Florida. Meanwhile, an organizing
area of low pressure in the Southern Plains will become a focus
for strong-to-severe thunderstorms overnight. By Saturday, an
upper level impulse exiting the Rockies provides a boost in the
development of the Southern Plains frontal system and in doing so,
generating a larger swath of showers and thunderstorms in the
Middle Mississippi Valley. The setup is favorable enough for
severe weather that the Storm Prediction Center has issues a
Slight Risk on Saturday for northeast Kansas. By Sunday morning,
widespread showers and thunderstorms will extend from the central
Plains to the Lower Great Lakes.

Temperature regimes will be clearly depicted thanks to a pair of
frontal systems east of the Rockies. Temperatures north of a
quasi-stationary boundary draped from the northern High Plains to
the Ohio Valley may feel more like early November with departures
averaging nearly 10 degrees below normal both Friday and Saturday
in the Midwest. A cold frontal passage in the Northeast and Ohio
Valley prompts the return of seasonally cool conditions for these
regions. To the South, temperatures are considerably warmer with
the warmest anomalies focused in the southern High Plains. Much of
the High Plains can expect temps in the 70s but Saturday's highs
will eclipse 90 degrees along the Rio Grande in South Texas and
widespread 80s in Texas and Oklahoma. The combination of dry and
hot conditions as well as increasingly gusty winds promotes
favorable fire weather conditions Saturday, and thus an Elevated
Risk has been issued in the SPC's Fire Weather Outlook. Along the
West Coast, the persistent onshore flow and unsettled weather
pattern looks to keep temperatures below normal to close out the
week and throughout the weekend. Daily high temperature anomalies
are likely to range between 10 and 20 degrees below normal across
much of California.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Thu May 13 2021

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

The isolated dry thunderstorm delineation across parts of the
Northern Plains has been adjusted to account for the latest guidance
consensus. Otherwise, the previous forecast for the Northern Plains
remains on track. Please see the previous forecast below for more
details.

Otherwise, locally Elevated winds/RH are likely to briefly overlap
over terrain favoring locations across portions of the southwest
U.S. Isolated dry thunderstorms are also possible across central New
Mexico this afternoon. However, ERCs across the higher terrain areas
are around average, with only patchy areas of relatively more
receptive fuels noted. Given slow storm speeds and lack of more
widespread critically dry fuels, an isolated dry thunderstorm
delineation has been withheld.

..Squitieri.. 05/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0123 AM CDT Thu May 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
...Eastern North Dakota...

A dry airmass is in place across the northern Plains this morning
with dewpoints in the 20s to 30s. A weak mid-level shortwave trough
will cross North Dakota this afternoon and provide enough weak
ascent for shower and thunderstorm development by this afternoon.
PWAT values are forecast to be around 0.6 to 0.7 which should result
in limited precipitation from these storms. However, storm motion is
expected to be slow which could lead to increased rainfall
accumulation from storms. Regardless, record dry fuels in the region
should be primed for fire starts. Therefore, an isolated dry
thunderstorm delineation is warranted. In addition, low-level winds
are forecast to be 10 to 15 mph which could lead to some fire
spread.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 13 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is anticipated to form over the western half
of the contiguous U.S., which could support a cold front lingering across the
Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley from the end of week-1 into the
beginning of the period. This feature could bring heavy precipitation to the
region. Mid-level flow over Alaska is predicted to be near normal, decreasing
the chances for widespread hazards over the state. Downstream, mid-level high
pressure is predicted across the eastern half of the lower 48 at the beginning
of the period, promoting anomalously warm temperatures across parts of the
Midwest and Northeast. The mid-level height pattern is expected to deamplify
from the middle to end of the period, lessening the potential for widespread
hazards based on predefined threshold criteria.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain across portions of the Southern and Central Plains
and the Lower Mississippi Valley, Fri, May 21.

Possible flooding for parts of eastern Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MAY 16 - THURSDAY MAY 20:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pKrLJPWck6CCntBBOzbEEIFrjbx3DYcvlEagmzbqXPTvTge_pKFIHhkqJSMWbAxBb3mGV2cv$

FOR FRIDAY MAY 21 - THURSDAY MAY 27: A surface low and associated cold front
forecast across the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley may linger
from the end of week-1 into the beginning of week-2. This disturbance and
front, combined with enhanced moisture from the Gulf of Mexico may bring heavy
rainfall to parts of the South-Central CONUS at the start of the period. A
slight risk of heavy rainfall is posted for day 8 only (May 21) since much of
the heavy precipitation is anticipated to occur day 7 (see WPC's 3-7 day
hazards outlook) extending into day 8. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
show
at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th
percentile and one inch across the highlighted area, although the majority
likely occurring on day 8.



The Weather Prediction Center anticipates the area under the slight risk for
heavy rain to experience anywhere from 1 to 5 inches of precipitation during
the prior week, while observed soil moisture levels across parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley and northeastern Texas exceed the 90th historical
percentile. Both of these factors as well as increased potential for heavy
rainfall from week-1 into week-2, support an increased risk of localized river
or flash flooding, which is highlighted for eastern Texas and parts of
Oklahoma

Mid-level ridging is predicted to build across parts of the Great Lakes
region,
Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Tennessee Valley at the beginning of the period,
which could support anomalously warm temperatures across these areas. Both the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance for these areas
to experience maximum temperatures in the 85th percentile. However,
temperatures are not anticipated to exceed 90 DegF, precluding a related
excessive heat risk from being designated at this time.



Weak mid-level flow is forecast for Alaska during week-2, limiting concerns
for
widespread hazards based on predefined hazardous threshold criteria. By week-2
the vast majority of river ice should be broken up across Alaska, thus no
temperature concerns are apparent.

...Heavy rainfall possible over parts of the Southern Plains into
the Mississippi Valley from early through at least middle of next
week...


...Overview...

An upper-level trough forecast to exit the southern Rockies will
likely open the door for a persistent stream of moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico northward into much of the southern and central
Plains, leading to a threat of significant rainfall for these
areas through the medium-range period.  Locations and magnitude of
heaviest rainfall will likely vary on a day-to-day basis and some
specifics may take until well into the short range to be resolved,
but the model signal for a wet pattern over the central U.S. has
been quite consistent.  Some variation of this pattern could
extend beyond the medium range period based on the latest 8-14 Day
forecast from the Climate Prediction Center.  In addition to this
area of focus, locations from the Midwest eastward into the
Mid-Atlantic may see one or more convective systems aided by a
wavy front and shortwave energy aloft.  An upstream trough
reaching the Northwest will likely bring unsettled weather to that
region but with lighter totals.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Latest model and ensemble solutions generally show good agreement
on the above-mentioned synoptic settings, and have slowed down the
east/northeastward progression of the upper trough across the
central U.S. midweek next week.  The GFS continues to depict a
broader trough configuration in contrast with the more compact
configuration depicted by the ECMWF and CMC.  A slight preference
was given to the ECMWF/EC mean solutions.  A consensus of these
models yielded a stationary boundary extending across the
mid-section of the country toward the Mid-Atlantic region.  The
boundary appears to weaken with time by midweek as it begins to
lift northward as a warm front.  Nevertheless, convection appears
to remain most active south of this boundary over the southern
Plains into the latter part of next week.

Over the Pacific Northwest, an upper trough from the Pacific is
forecast to approach the region by next Wednesday to Thursday,
thereby introducing higher degrees of uncertainty although the
associated precipitation amounts appear to be modest.  The latest
(12Z) ECMWF now depicts a much amplified trough digging into the
West Coast during this period.  Another feature of note is the
potential for trough fracture or cut-off low formation over New
England midweek next week.  The GFS is more progressive as opposed
to the deeper solution of ECMWF and the most aggressive CMC
solution.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  This yielded a
solution close to WPC continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The overall forecast is consistent in highlighting the potential
for a multi-day wet pattern over the central U.S., most likely
over parts of the southern Plains into the Mississippi Valley, as
persistent low level flow from the Gulf transports moisture into
the region.  Areas of heavy rainfall may be somewhat more
organized/focused around Tuesday-Wednesday as the upper system
crossing the Southwest approaches and reaches the Plains.  Some
pockets of meaningful rainfall should continue into Thursday but
perhaps with less focus depending on how the energy from the
Southwest system weakens/progresses.  Parts of this area have seen
much above normal precipitation over the past several weeks, which
may increase flooding concerns.  Meanwhile, the guidance signal
appears to be strengthening for a period of enhanced precipitation
over the central Rockies/High Plains during the first part of the
week, from the combination of low level upslope flow and favorable
location relative to the Southwest upper low's track. The trailing
upper trough reaching the Northwest should bring mostly light to
moderate precipitation to the region from about Monday night
onward. Highest elevations could see some snow.  A wavy front and
initial Northern Plains shortwave energy may promote one or more
convective systems that could produce locally heavy rainfall from
the Central Plains/Midwest east-southeastward.  However, there is
still considerable uncertainty over the magnitude and location of
rainfall within this axis.  On Sunday, parts of the Northeast may
see one more episode of mostly light mid-late day rainfall under a
departing upper trough.

Ahead of the Pacific front that moves into the West next week, an
area of highs 10-20F above normal will progress from the Northwest
U.S. into the northern High Plains and eastward near the Canadian
border.  The cooling trend behind the front should bring modestly
below normal highs. Meanwhile moderately below normal highs will
accompany the system initially tracking through the southwestern
states and then weakening as it ejects into the Plains.  Most of
the East will see slightly below normal readings on Sunday
followed by a gradual warming trend to near or slightly above
normal temperatures.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu May 13 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 19 - 23 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian dynamical models are in decent agreement with
regard to today's 6-10 day 500-hPa geopotential height pattern over the CONUS.
However, relative to yesterday's 6-10 day forecast, the ECMWF and Canadian
models have backed off on the negative height anomalies over portions of the
southwestern CONUS and central Rockies. The ECMWF also depicts an amplified
mean trough and negative anomalies for parts of the Northeast. Strong mean
mid-level ridging is favored over the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest, leading
to
large positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending from the Northern Plains
eastward to the Great Lakes, and southward into the Southeast. There is also
uncertainty in the mid-level height pattern over Alaska in today's 6-10 day
forecast. The GEFS predicts an amplified mean trough over the Bering Sea,
while
the ECMWF and Canadian models are forecasting positive 500-hPa height
anomalies, increasing uncertainty in the Aleutians. Near to below normal
500-hPa heights are predicted for much of the Alaska Mainland and Panhandle.

Forecast tools agree well favoring above normal temperatures across much of
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, with the highest probabilities in the
southwestern Mainland and eastern Aleutians, where surface flow is likely to
be
more southerly. Increased mid-level mean troughing and associated below normal
500-hPa geopotential heights favor odds of below normal temperatures for the
Alaska Panhandle, extending into the Pacific Northwest. Odds tilt toward below
normal temperatures across Texas and extreme southern Oklahoma, associated
with
a potential cut-off low pressure system that is expected to slowly move
eastward across the Southern Tier states during the 6-10 day period. Enhanced
probabilities of above normal temperatures across the Northern Plains and
Upper
Midwest extend southeastward to the Tennessee Valley and southwestward to the
Four Corners, associated with above normal mid-level geopotential heights.

Weak overall synoptic forcing and a southward shifted storm track favor below
normal precipitation for the southwestern Alaska Mainland, the Alaska
Peninsula, and northeastern Panhandle. Increased onshore flow favors increased
odds of above normal precipitation in the Pacific Northwest. Below normal
precipitation probabilities extending from northern California across the
Great
Basin and into the northern High Plains are associated with near to above
normal mid-level heights. Upstream mid-level troughing over the Rockies and
mean southerly surface flow over the Great Plains favors enhanced
probabilities
of above normal precipitation over the Central and Southern Plains, with above
normal probabilities extending northward to Canada. Above normal precipitation
probabilities also extend along the Gulf Coast and into Florida, associated
with mean easterly and southeasterly surface flow. Over the Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley, and Northeast, enhanced odds of below normal precipitation are
favored,
underneath mean surface high pressure.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement in the model precipitation and temperature forecasts, offset by
large
differences in the predicted mid-level geopotential height fields in the
models.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 21 - 27 2021

There is good overall agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF models in the
predicted 500-hPa height pattern over the U.S. during the Week-2 period.
However, the models differ in the strength of the positive mid-level height
anomalies over the western CONUS. The ECMWF ensemble also predicts strong
negative 500-hPa height anomalies over the Northeast, whereas the GEFS favors
positive mid-level height anomalies. Near to below normal 500-hPa heights are
predicted over Alaska.

Above normal temperatures are more likely in the Aleutians and much of
Mainland
Alaska, in favor of the reforecast and consolidation tools, along with weak
synoptic forcing. In the Alaska Panhandle, below normal temperatures are
favored, underneath increased a mean mid-level trough and associated below
normal 500-hPa geopotential heights. The mean trough and below normal
temperature probabilities extend southeastward to the Pacific Northwest.
Similar to the 6-10 day period, enhanced odds of above normal temperatures are
favored across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, underneath weak mean
anticyclonic flow from the Northern Plains to the Northeast. Above normal
temperature probabilities also extend southeastward to the Mid-Atlantic and
Tennessee Valley, and southwestward to the southwestern CONUS, following above
normal 500-hPa geopotential heights. Increased southeasterly surface flow
leads
to increased probabilities of above normal temperatures across the Florida
Peninsula. Near to below normal temperatures extending eastward from Texas to
South Carolina are associated with a predicted cut-off low that is expected to
slowly move eastward during the first half of the Week-2 period.

A weakened North Pacific mid-level ridge in the ECMWF ensemble forecast,
relative to yesterday's Week-2 outlook, falls more in line with the GEFS
solution. This favors a southward shift in the storm track across the North
Pacific, leading to below normal precipitation probabilities in the western
Alaska Mainland and the Peninsula. This southward shift also tilts odds toward
above normal precipitation in the Alaska Panhandle, as this is typically a
drier time of year. De-amplified troughing increases odds of below normal
precipitation in the West, compared to yesterday's Week-2 forecast. East of
the
Rockies, mean surface high pressure is predicted to dominate across
Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Upper Ohio Valley, favoring increased odds of
below normal precipitation. Southeasterly and southerly mean surface flow to
the south and west, respectively, of mean surface high pressure in the East
favors elevated odds of above normal precipitation along the Gulf Coast and
across the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley, with enhanced odds (>50%) in
eastern Texas.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble model guidance in the predicted
mid-level height, temperature, and precipitation fields across the forecast
domain.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...Heavy rainfall possible over parts of the Southern Plains into
the Mississippi Valley from early through at least middle of next
week...


...Overview...

An upper-level trough forecast to exit the southern Rockies will
likely open the door for a persistent stream of moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico northward into much of the southern and central
Plains, leading to a threat of significant rainfall for these
areas through the medium-range period.  Locations and magnitude of
heaviest rainfall will likely vary on a day-to-day basis and some
specifics may take until well into the short range to be resolved,
but the model signal for a wet pattern over the central U.S. has
been quite consistent.  Some variation of this pattern could
extend beyond the medium range period based on the latest 8-14 Day
forecast from the Climate Prediction Center.  In addition to this
area of focus, locations from the Midwest eastward into the
Mid-Atlantic may see one or more convective systems aided by a
wavy front and shortwave energy aloft.  An upstream trough
reaching the Northwest will likely bring unsettled weather to that
region but with lighter totals.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Latest model and ensemble solutions generally show good agreement
on the above-mentioned synoptic settings, and have slowed down the
east/northeastward progression of the upper trough across the
central U.S. midweek next week.  The GFS continues to depict a
broader trough configuration in contrast with the more compact
configuration depicted by the ECMWF and CMC.  A slight preference
was given to the ECMWF/EC mean solutions.  A consensus of these
models yielded a stationary boundary extending across the
mid-section of the country toward the Mid-Atlantic region.  The
boundary appears to weaken with time by midweek as it begins to
lift northward as a warm front.  Nevertheless, convection appears
to remain most active south of this boundary over the southern
Plains into the latter part of next week.

Over the Pacific Northwest, an upper trough from the Pacific is
forecast to approach the region by next Wednesday to Thursday,
thereby introducing higher degrees of uncertainty although the
associated precipitation amounts appear to be modest.  The latest
(12Z) ECMWF now depicts a much amplified trough digging into the
West Coast during this period.  Another feature of note is the
potential for trough fracture or cut-off low formation over New
England midweek next week.  The GFS is more progressive as opposed
to the deeper solution of ECMWF and the most aggressive CMC
solution.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  This yielded a
solution close to WPC continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The overall forecast is consistent in highlighting the potential
for a multi-day wet pattern over the central U.S., most likely
over parts of the southern Plains into the Mississippi Valley, as
persistent low level flow from the Gulf transports moisture into
the region.  Areas of heavy rainfall may be somewhat more
organized/focused around Tuesday-Wednesday as the upper system
crossing the Southwest approaches and reaches the Plains.  Some
pockets of meaningful rainfall should continue into Thursday but
perhaps with less focus depending on how the energy from the
Southwest system weakens/progresses.  Parts of this area have seen
much above normal precipitation over the past several weeks, which
may increase flooding concerns.  Meanwhile, the guidance signal
appears to be strengthening for a period of enhanced precipitation
over the central Rockies/High Plains during the first part of the
week, from the combination of low level upslope flow and favorable
location relative to the Southwest upper low's track. The trailing
upper trough reaching the Northwest should bring mostly light to
moderate precipitation to the region from about Monday night
onward. Highest elevations could see some snow.  A wavy front and
initial Northern Plains shortwave energy may promote one or more
convective systems that could produce locally heavy rainfall from
the Central Plains/Midwest east-southeastward.  However, there is
still considerable uncertainty over the magnitude and location of
rainfall within this axis.  On Sunday, parts of the Northeast may
see one more episode of mostly light mid-late day rainfall under a
departing upper trough.

Ahead of the Pacific front that moves into the West next week, an
area of highs 10-20F above normal will progress from the Northwest
U.S. into the northern High Plains and eastward near the Canadian
border.  The cooling trend behind the front should bring modestly
below normal highs. Meanwhile moderately below normal highs will
accompany the system initially tracking through the southwestern
states and then weakening as it ejects into the Plains.  Most of
the East will see slightly below normal readings on Sunday
followed by a gradual warming trend to near or slightly above
normal temperatures.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0235 PM CDT Thu May 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

Guidance has trended upward slightly in terms of longer lasting,
more widespread 15 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds
across portions of the Lower Colorado River Basin tomorrow
afternoon. These breezy conditions will coincide with 15-20% RH and
overspread fuels receptive to wildfire spread, prompting the
addition of an Elevation delineation.

In addition, a couple dry strikes are possible across portions of
northern California (north of the Sacramento Valley) into southern
Oregon tomorrow afternoon. These storms are expected to develop atop
a 2-3 km deep sub-cloud layer amidst 0.5-0.6 inch precipitable water
values, with near record-dry fuels in spots. However, much of the
region is also experiencing green-up, and the storms are also
expected to be slow moving, suggesting that some areas may see
accumulating rainfall, precluding the addition of an isolated dry
thunderstorm area. However, lightning-based ignitions are possible
wherever a dry strike may occur within a more receptive fuel bed.

Isolated thunderstorms are also possible across portions of far
eastern North Dakota into northwest Minnesota. These storms are
expected to be wet overall (precluding the addition of an isolated
dry thunderstorm area), but will occur atop record dry, critically
receptive fuels. As such, any strikes that manage to occur well away
from storm cores may pose a risk for ignitions among finer or
coarser receptive fuels.

...Synopsis...
Weak lee cyclogenesis is expected across Nevada on Friday as a weak
mid-level shortwave trough approaches the Sierra. In response, some
downslope flow is expected in the lee of the Sierra and some gusty
winds are possible across portions of Arizona. Elevated fire weather
conditions are possible, but are forecast to be too localized to
warrant an elevated delineation at this time.

...Scattered and locally heavy showers and thunderstorms are
expected for the Central Plains over the next few days...

...Below normal temperatures are forecast east of the Rockies
while the western third of the country is very warm...

A wavy frontal boundary will help focus showers and thunderstorms
Friday and Saturday from parts of the Central Rockies into the
Central Plains and Midwest. Best chance for organized, locally
heavy, rainfall will be across parts of the Central Plains into
the mid-Mississippi Valley this weekend. Locally strong to severe
thunderstorms are also possible across parts of the Plains. Return
flow out of the Gulf of Mexico will increase rain and storm
chances across the southern Plains by the weekend as well.
Elsewhere, a cold front will keep rain chances in the forecast for
parts of southern and eastern Florida, while much of the West and
East should be mostly dry through the short range.

Temperatures east of the Continental Divide should remain near or
below normal underneath of a cool high pressure system, with some
chilly morning lows prompting freeze warnings and frost advisories
for parts of the central Appalachians and Great Lakes. Meanwhile,
much above normal temperatures will prevail across the west, with
temperatures in the upper 80s to 90s across the Great Basin and
near 100F in parts of the Desert Southwest.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1248 AM CDT Fri May 14 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to amplify over the West today and
potentially develop into a closed upper low over northern CA by
Saturday morning. In response to this feature, a weak surface low is
forecast to develop over southern NV.

...Northern CA into southern OR...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms will be possible across
portions of northern CA into southern OR this afternoon and evening,
as the upper trough moves southeastward and amplifies over the
region. Relatively dry/well-mixed subcloud layers and low PW will
limit the potential for wetting rainfall. With fuels running dry
across the region, an isolated dry-thunderstorm area has been added
to cover the threat for lightning-based ignitions.

...Southwest...
In response to the approaching upper system and developing surface
low, a modest increase in southwesterly surface winds is expected
over portions of the Southwest. Elevated fire weather conditions
will be possible across portions of the lower CO River basin, where
sustained winds of greater than 15 mph are possible concurrent with
minimum RH values of 10-20%.

...Eastern ND into northern MN...
Scattered thunderstorms are again expected this afternoon from
eastern ND into northwest MN. While low-level moisture will remain
relatively limited, an increase in PW (compared to Thursday) and
slow storm motions should result in generally wet thunderstorms.
However, with very dry fuels over the region, there may be a nonzero
threat of lightning-based ignitions with strikes that occur away
from the heavier precipitation cores.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1249 AM CDT Fri May 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper low forecast to be centered over northern CA Saturday
morning is expected to move slowly southeastward across central into
southern CA through the period. A broad, weak surface low extending
from southern NV toward the Four Corners vicinity is forecast to
move little through the day.

...Southwest...
Southwesterly surface winds will increase on Saturday across the
Southwest as the upper low gradually approaches the region through
the day. Elevated conditions are expected this afternoon into the
early evening across portions of the lower CO River basin and
vicinity, as sustained winds increase to 15-20 mph (with higher
gusts) and RH values drop below 15%. Some locally critical
conditions will be possible where winds are locally stronger, but
the overall threat appears too limited for an upgrade at this time.

...Northern California...
At least isolated thunderstorm development is possible across
northern CA Saturday afternoon, in conjunction with the upper low.
Gradually increasing moisture will result in somewhat greater
rainfall potential compared to D1/Friday, so no isolated
dry-thunderstorm area has been included at this time. However, the
risk for lightning ignitions will be nonzero where dry fuels are
available, and highlights may eventually be needed depending on
guidance trends and observed rainfall (if any) from D1/Friday.

...Heavy rain Threat for the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley next week...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of reasonably well clustered larger scale guidance
of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS, 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean/Canadian
along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Smaller scale
system differences and convective rainfall focus details are much
less certain. System differences increase more significantly
mid-later next week, especially with the GFS digging much less
upper troughing down over the West than the ECMWF/Canadian. Leaned
toward the more run to run consistent GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means
that similarly develop a moderately deep upper trough over the
West at these long time frames. Latest 00 UTC models and ensembles
tend to maintain these aforementioned guidance differences.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A favored model and ensemble composite solution indicates that
deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return into an
emerging and slow moving south-central U.S. frontal system next
week. This will occur in downstream response to the slow ejection
and passage of a southern stream upper-level trough/low energies
forecast to exit the southern Rockies. Expect a multi-day period
with a threat of significant rainfall along with periods of
increased instability and strong to severe convection. Locations
and magnitude of heaviest rainfall will likely vary on a
day-to-day basis and some specifics may take until well into the
short range to be resolved, but the guidance signal for a wet
pattern over the south-central U.S. has been consistent.
Meanwhile, the Midwest eastward into the Mid-Atlantic may see one
or more convective systems aided by a wavy front and uncertain
northern shortwave energy aloft to focus moisture and instability.
Well south, late period moisture/vorticity influx underneath a
building Southeast upper ridge may support some organized heavy
downpours over southern Florida.

The favored GEFS/ECMWF ensemble mean solution over the West
mid-later next week would support mainly moderate precipitation
from the Pacific Northwest out across the north-central
Intermountain West/Rockies to include some mountain snows. Ahead
of the Pacific front that moves into the West next week, lead
maximum temperatures 10-20F above normal will also progress from
the Northwest U.S. eastward though the northern Rockies/Plains. A
cooling trend behind the front may bring 5-10F below normal
temperatures.

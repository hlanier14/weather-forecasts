..Bentley.. 02/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1152 PM CST Tue Feb 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will become much more focused along favored
terrain areas of central New Mexico southward into far west Texas.
A shallow Arctic airmass will very slowly migrate westward into
eastern New Mexico and vicinity while remaining entrenched across
much of the remainder of the country, mitigating fire-weather risks
in most areas.  Additionally, a continued onshore flow pattern and
recent rainfall will mitigate fire-weather concerns across the West.

...Central New Mexico southward through west Texas...
Models indicate a limited spatial area just west of the Arctic
frontal zone where breezy/dry conditions will develop during peak
heating hours.  Localized areas of 15-20 mph westerly surface winds
will become common during that time as RH values fall into the
12-20% range.  Dry fuels in this area will contribute to potential
fire spread.  An elevated fire-weather delineation is in place to
address this threat.

...Arctic air forecast to set multiple cold temperature records
this weekend across the Plains and MS Valley but should gradually
moderate by early to middle of next week...

...Stormy pattern with multiple winter precipitation events...

Models and ensembles are in general agreement that a large dome of
arctic air will surge south across central U.S. into the weekend
as the center of a polar vortex slides eastward across the Great
Lakes.  Models have continued to make further adjustments to
important shortwave energies that rotate around the vortex.  Both
the 06z GFS and 12z Tue/00z Wed ECMWF models have come into better
agreement with each other as shortwave energy emerges from the
southern Rockies onto the southern Plains on Sunday, resulting in
an area of likely snow in northwest Texas across central to
western OK and KS. As this system ejects to the northeast on Mon
15 Feb., the area of heavy snow northwest of low extends across
mid MS Valley to the Great Lakes.  Further southeast, significant
mixed sleet and freezing rain area expected from the lower MS
Valley to the TN Valley, central Appalachians, and Piedmont of
NC/VA/Mid Atlantic. On Tue 16 Feb, the parent low moves across the
Great Lakes into Canada, with cold advection producing lake effect
snow in MI and northwest PA/western NY.  The low weakens, but not
before producing a round of snow in northern NY/northern New
England with potential for a change over to sleet/freezing
rain/rain in southern New England/southeast New York before the
system departs.
Widespread moderate rain is expected further south in the
southeast to the coastal mid Atlantic states.

Confluent flow in the west results in a series of progressive 700
mb waves that produce rounds of snow in the terrain, starting on
Day 4 Sat/early Sun from the WA/OR Cascades into the ranges of
northern CA and northern Great Basin. On Day 5, the first wave
crosses NM/southern CO, bringing snow to the mountains there
before the wave exits on the Plains.  The next Pacific northwest
disturbances brings snow back to the WA/OR Cascades.  On Monday
the water vapor transport onshore and inland combines with a wave
to produce snow starting with the WA/OR Cascades and continuing to
the ranges of ID to western WY and northern UT. On Tuesday 16 Feb,
the mid-upper level northwest flow brings moisture and
light-moderate snows from the northern to central Rockies and
Great Basin.

With the arctic high pressure system in the Plains, many cold
temperature records will be likely down the Plains and into the
lower to mid MS Valley this weekend to early next week.  Record
lows/low maxima should be most numerous on Sunday before the
airmass gradually moderates next week.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a blend of
the 12Z-00z ECMWF/00z EC Ensemble mean, and the 06Z GFS/GEFS Mean.
The large scale pattern looks similar across most models/ensembles
with a reamplifying 500 mb ridge off the west coast and persistent
central US upper trough, and ridge off the southeast coast.
The 00z Canadian deamplified the ridge off the west coast and
became a progressive outlier with systems across the country, so
was not included in the blend.

...Significant ice storm will continue tonight and Thursday from
the Mid-Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley...

...Heavy snow possible across the Pacific Northwest beginning on
Thursday and may extend into the lowlands of Washington and
Oregon...

...Bitter arctic air to remain entrenched across the central U.S.
through the rest of this week while slowing expanding southward...

A very cold and active weather pattern is set to continue across
the country to end the first full week of February, with a
plethora of winter weather hazards. First, the combination of a
stationary front stretching from the Southern Plains northeastward
into the Tennessee Valley and a strong arctic high pressure system
to the north will lead to a threat of significant freezing
rain/icing in between. Across portions of Arkansas eastward into
Tennessee and Kentucky, total ice accretion is likely to exceed a
quarter inch, while amounts in excess of half an inch are possible
in some locations. This amount of ice will likely lead to
hazardous travel conditions, power outages, and scattered tree
damage, and Ice Storm Warnings are in effect for these areas.
Accumulating freezing rain is also possible across central Texas
through early Thursday, and some ice amounts over a tenth of an
inch are forecast. Northeast of the freezing rain axis, a couple
of rounds of light snow are expected from portions of the Ohio
Valley and Central Appalachians to the Mid-Atlantic through
Friday, and generally 2 to 6 inches of additional snow is forecast
across the northern portions of the Mid-Atlantic region. Freezing
rain is possible Friday across parts of the Central Appalachians
and into parts of Virginia and northern North Carolina as well.
Meanwhile on the warm side of the system throughout the Southeast,
showers and thunderstorms could lead to an inch or two of rain
through Friday, with locally higher amounts around the central
Gulf Coast region.

Impactful winter weather is also a possibility across the Pacific
Northwest beginning on Thursday. A low pressure system is forecast
to enter southern Oregon Thursday evening while simultaneously
interacting with very cold air draining into the region. This
combination may lead to not only heavy snow across the typical
mountainous locations, but in the lowlands as well. Snowfall
accumulation will be possible in both Portland and Seattle, but
exact amounts are uncertain at this time. Freezing rain could also
be a threat in lower elevations of northwestern Oregon in
particular. Winter Storm Watches have been posted across the area.
Another round of wintry weather is again possible there by Friday
and Saturday. Snow and mixed precipitation is expected to spread
across much of the Great Basin and into the Rockies as well.

Meanwhile, the arctic airmass located over the central U.S. is not
leaving anytime soon and is actually forecast to slowly expand
over the next few days. High temperatures 20 to 40 degrees below
average will cover a widespread area from nearly the entire Great
Plains to the Great Lakes again on Thursday. By Friday these cold
temperatures could ooze southward to the Gulf Coast and as far
east as the Lower Mississippi Valley. Temperatures will also make
a nosedive across the Northwest, where several daily low records
could fall. Wind Chill Advisories and Wind Chill Warnings remain
in effect and stretch from Montana to northern Wisconsin. Light
wind combined with subzero temperatures could make it feel as cold
as -50 degrees in some spots. This bitter cold can be dangerous
and lead to frostbite in less than 10 minutes. Be sure to plan
ahead and dress appropriately if spending time outdoors.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Wed February 10 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 16 - 20 2021

Todays model solutions are in good agreement in regard to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern across North America and adjacent ocean areas
during the 6-10 day period. Dynamical models forecast a broad long-wave 500=
-
hPa
trough across the CONUS. The manual height blend depicts negative height
anomalies for most of the CONUS. Upstream of this trough, ridging is foreca=
st
over the Northeast Pacific, favoring positive mid-level height anomalies al=
ong
the southern and central West Coast. Positive mid-level height anomalies
extend
northward from the ridge over southwestern Mainland and the Aleutians.
Positive
500-hPa height anomalies are also forecast along the Atlantic Coast,
associated
with slightly more amplified subtropical ridging in the western Atlantic,
compared to yesterday's 6-10 day forecast.

Probabilities for below-normal temperatures are enhanced across much of the
CONUS, consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Todays forecast
depicts 80% probabilities of below-normal temperatures over most of the
Central
and Southern Great Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley. Conversely,
above-normal temperature probabilities are increased for the Florida
Peninsula,
extending northward to extreme southern North Carolina, associated with mea=
n
return flow to the west of the Atlantic ridge. Despite the positive 500-hPa
height anomalies forecast over much of Alaska, strong easterly flow favors
increased near to below-normal temperature probabilities across most of the
Mainland and the Panhandle. A slight tilt toward increased above-normal
temperature probabilities is highlighted across the eastern Aleutians and
Alaska Peninsula, as an upstream weakness in the mean ridging over the Nort=
h
Pacific is forecast to promote increased southerly mid-level flow over thes=
e
areas.

A mean frontal boundary is favored to set up across the eastern CONUS,
increasing probabilities of above-normal precipitation across the eastern U=
.S.
A continued active storm track is favored across much of the northwestern
CONUS, coinciding with enhanced above-normal precipitation probabilities in
the
Pacific Northwest. Below-normal precipitation probabilities are increased o=
ver
parts of the southwestern CONUS on the eastern periphery of the Northeast
Pacific ridge. Elevated below-normal precipitation chances are also favored=
 in
the Northern Plains, underneath mean surface high pressure. Across Alaska,
most
forecast tools are favoring near to below-normal precipitation probabilitie=
s
due to prolonged influence of the ridge over the Pacific. However, with the
weakness in the 500-hPa height field over the Bering Sea, odds tilt toward
above-normal precipitation near the Alaska Peninsula.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the forecast tools and high confidence regarding
below-normal temperatures across most of the CONUS. High confidence is offs=
et
slightly by increasing uncertainty with regard to the precipitation forecas=
t,
mainly over the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 18 - 24 2021

A continuation of a similar synoptic pattern is forecast during Week-2 acro=
ss
North America. Troughing is favored over much of the central CONUS, with
ridging persisting over the Northeast Pacific that extends closer to the We=
st
Coast of the CONUS, compared to the 6-10 day period. Todays manual 500-hPa
height blend for Week-2 depicts below-normal geopotential heights across th=
e
northern half of the CONUS and most of Alaska. However, near to above-norma=
l
heights are forecast for much of the West Coast, extending to the Southwest
and
eastward along the southern tier states.

Predicted broad, long-wave troughing favors enhanced probabilities of near =
to
below-normal temperatures for most of the CONUS, with the highest chances
across the Central Rockies, Central and Southern Plains, and Middle
Mississippi
Valley. Above-normal temperature probabilities are increased over the Flori=
da
Peninsula, with return flow expected to the west of increased ridging over =
the
western Atlantic. Uncertainty exists between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble
guidance with respect to the strength of this ridge, which will impact the
location and strength of the mean frontal boundary across the Southeast. A
trend toward colder temperatures is forecast for much of Mainland Alaska an=
d
the Panhandle, associated with below-normal 500-hPa heights and mean easter=
ly
surface flow.

Probabilities of above-normal precipitation remain slightly increased from =
the
Mississippi Valley to the Northeast, ahead of the mean long-wave trough ove=
r
the CONUS. Below-normal precipitation probabilities are increased over much=
 of
the southwestern CONUS due to increased ridging. Probabilities of below-nor=
mal
precipitation extend across the Great Plains, with mean surface high pressu=
re
favored to dominate throughout much of the period. Odds also tilt toward
below-normal precipitation along the Gulf Coast, influenced by increasing
ridging over the western Atlantic throughout the Week-2 period. Increased
above-normal precipitation probabilities are favored across the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies, associated with an active storm track along
the
northeast periphery of the Pacific ridge. Below-normal precipitation is lik=
ely
for northern Mainland Alaska, with mean easterly flow and a southward-
displaced
storm track across the state. A slight tilt toward increased above-normal
precipitation is favored across the Aleutians, southern Mainland, and the
Panhandle, along the storm track.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement on a continued amplified pattern, offset by increasing uncertaint=
y
in
the precipitation forecast over the eastern CONUS and the evolution of the
long-wave pattern throughout the Week-2 period.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

ywgWM5OZvz-$

FOR THURSDAY FEBRUARY 18 - WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 24: Heading into the start of
week-2, there is good agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means
featuring an amplified trough centered over the Great Plains, with negative
height departures overspreading the majority of the CONUS. This mid-level
feature continues to be the focal point for hazardous weather concerns, as =
it
maintains increased chances for hazardously cold temperatures during
mid-February. However, consistent with recent trends in the guidance, this
anomalous troughing looks to deamplify during week-2, as models continue to
signal a broad scale pattern change with the development of subtropical
ridging
over the southern tier of the CONUS. This is anticipated to help moderate
temperatures for many areas over the CONUS that are likely to be affected b=
y
the anomalous cold earlier in the outlook period. Farther west, both the GE=
FS
and ECMWF week-2 mean 500-hPa height fields favor anomalous ridging over th=
e
northern Pacific with anomalous troughing prevailing across the higher
latitudes of North America. This predicted pattern is conducive for enhance=
d
onshore flow to increase the potential for heavy precipitation for parts of
western North America and the Pacific Northwest.



This morning's ensemble guidance depicts a broad area of surface high press=
ure
and anomalous cold temperatures mainly across the central CONUS with the
largest negative temperature departures (8 to 12 degrees C) favored across =
the
Southern Plains by the start of week-2. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools remain in good agreement showing a large coverage of elevated chances
(>40%) that minimum temperatures fall below the 15th percentile from the Hi=
gh
Plains to the Ohio Valley. Higher probabilities (>60%) continue to be focus=
ed
over the Middle Mississippi Valley with at least a 20% chance that overnigh=
t
temperatures fall below the bottom 2nd percentile of the climatological
distribution, suggesting the possibility of record breaking lows in the reg=
ion
during the first few days of the period.  Thus, the moderate and high risk
regions of much below normal temperatures are maintained for Feb 18 to 19. =
By
day 10 (Feb 20), the 0z and 6z GEFS depicts much of the surface high pressu=
re
to begin shifting eastward into the Atlantic, which is expected to set up a
return flow pattern and bring warmer temperatures across the Great Plains a=
nd
Mississippi Valley by the middle of the period. Aloft, anomalous troughing =
is
expected to weaken and lift out over the northeastern CONUS with the axis o=
f
the coldest temperatures following the trough during this time. As a result=
,
the slight risk of much below normal temperatures remains posted through Fe=
b
20
for most of the CONUS east of the Rockies.



With a frontal boundary expected to push deep into the Gulf of Mexico by ea=
rly
week-2, the potential exists for surface low to develop along the front and
track northeast. Several of the most recent deterministic runs of the GFS a=
nd
ECMWF support this development but vary on its track and timing early in th=
e
period. Ensemble guidance favors increased precipitation amounts throughout
the
eastern CONUS associated with this low, however reforecast tools are less
supportive of precipitation amounts exceeding hazards criteria, and no heav=
y
precipitation hazards are issued at this time. However, with anomalous cold
air
likely to be in place, increased snowfall is possible to the northwest of a=
ny
low that develops over the eastern U.S. A slight risk of heavy snow is issu=
ed
for Feb 18 to 20 from the Central Appalachians and the Ohio Valley to New
England as several ensemble members of the GEFS favor the low track across =
the
Northeast.



Across the Pacific Northwest, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favor enhan=
ced
onshore flow and increased chances for above-normal precipitation during
week-2. Although reforecast guidance indicates at least a 20% chance for
precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile, totals are not
expected to exceed hazards criteria for the region. However, the combinatio=
n
of
increased moisture and below-normal temperatures tied to mid-level troughin=
g
predicted in the region supports an elevated risk of heavy snow mainly acro=
ss
the Cascades and a corresponding hazard is issued for Feb 18-22. Determinis=
tic
solutions suggest locally heavy daily snowfall amounts may exceed 24 inches=
 in
the highest elevations. Additionally, strong surface pressure gradients are
evident in the ensemble guidance, and reforecast tools maintain at least a =
20%
chance for sustained winds to exceed the 85th percentile. However, sustaine=
d
wind values remain below hazardous thresholds, and no wind related hazards =
are
issued.



Anomalous mid-level troughing and below-normal temperatures continues to be
favored over Alaska throughout week-2. With northerly flow expected to prev=
ail
across the northern half of the Mainland, there is good agreement in the
reforecast tools indicating at least a 20% chance minimum temperatures fall
below the 15th percentile and below -40 degrees F across the Brooks Range a=
nd
the North Slope. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted =
for
the entirety of week-2. Farther south, guidance also supports increased sto=
rm
activity in the Gulf of Alaska to bring increased precipitation and high
elevation snow over parts of the coastal Mainland and the Panhandle. Howeve=
r,
precipitation amounts are not anticipated to be hazardous at this time.

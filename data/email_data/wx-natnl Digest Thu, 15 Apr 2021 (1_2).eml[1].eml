Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1158 AM CDT Wed Apr 14 2021

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST ARIZONA INTO NORTHWEST
NEW MEXICO...

The overall forecast remains on track with no changes. Critical fire
weather conditions are likely across the lower Colorado River Basin
with strong winds and low humidity. Dry conditions across the
southeast will support elevated fire weather conditions through the
afternoon. Dry offshore winds in the lee of the cascades may also
support locally elevated fire weather potential through the day
though fuels remain mostly below critical values. See the previous
discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 04/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0215 AM CDT Wed Apr 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughs and associated surface lows/lee troughs are
expected to propagate across the Interior West and to the lee of the
Appalachians along the East Coast today, promoting favorable
wildfire-spread conditions across portions of the Lower Colorado
River Valley and Central Savannah River area. Across the Southwest
U.S., wildfire-spread concerns are greatest in the low-terrain
areas, where fuels are most receptive to fire spread.

...Lower Colorado River Valley...
A belt of 60+ kt mid-level flow is expected to overspread the Four
Corners region by afternoon peak heating, when boundary-layer mixing
is projected to be strongest. The optimal timing of the
overspreading mid-level winds and associated downward momentum
transport within the dry boundary layer suggests that widespread 20+
mph sustained southwesterly surface winds are likely across much of
the Southwest in tandem with 10-20% RH. Critical highlights have
been introduced where 25+ mph sustained winds and 10-15% RH are
likely to overlap for at least a few hours, with at least locally
Critical conditions possible through the remainder of the Elevated
area. Brief, localized Extremely Critical meteorological conditions
are also possible close to the Kaibab Plateau towards the Black Mesa
and Chuska Mountains.

...Portions of the Southeast...
Afternoon boundary-layer mixing across portions of eastern Georgia
into South Carolina is expected to foster 25-35% surface RH values,
while a passing surface lee trough will encourage 10-15 mph
sustained southwesterly winds (perhaps with higher gusts). Since the
favorable overlapping surface winds/RH are expected to overspread
dry fuels across the region, Elevated fire weather highlights have
been maintained across the region.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 14 2021

SYNOPSIS: Model guidance for Week-2 shows mid-level low pressure initially
over
eastern North America lifting northward with time into the high latitudes,
resulting in some concern for a late season frost or freeze early in the
period
across the Central and Eastern U.S. Warm and dry conditions tied to mid-level
high pressure are forecast across the western U.S., although some guidance is
starting to show a possible transition to mid-level low pressure over the
northeastern Pacific which could lead to a wetter pattern for the Pacific
Northwest and Northern California. Mid-level high pressure is forecast over
the
Bering Sea.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures accompanied by a possible late
season frost or freeze for portions of the central and eastern U.S., Thu-Sun,
Apr. 22-25.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 17 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 21:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!uQyVUku4Myf3VOIiXQVxnGdJGW6zjp-4pa9obPjETt9SIzcDc8qWRqWZ-ITJEMGYVGaHBeQB$

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 22 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 28: Model guidance consistently
features a longwave trough centered over Ontario at the beginning of the
forecast period. Differences emerge to its south, with the 0Z and 6Z GEFS
having an extension of the anomalous trough across the eastern U.S., while the
0Z ECMWF ensemble hangs the trough back across the Great Basin. The net result
is a moderating pattern with time across the Central and Eastern CONUS, with
timing differences between individual cold shots. As a result, a broad slight
risk of much below-normal temperatures is indicated from the Corn Belt and
Great Lakes southward through the Mid-Atlantic and much of the Southeast
during
the 22nd through 25th. The highlighted region is a confluence of: reforecast
guidance indicating at least a 20% chance of daily overnight lows falling
within the bottom 15% of climatology, falling below 40 degrees F, and areas
where emerging vegetation is reported as currently susceptible to a frost or
freeze. A moderate risk for much below-normal temperatures was considered for
the Tennessee Valley on the 22nd but is omitted despite support from
reforecast
guidance due to a limited chance at subfreezing temperatures and the event not
being highlighted prior to Week-2 by the Weather Prediction Center. The
typical
last freeze for this region is during the first 10 days of April, so having a
frost during mid to late April is not terribly atypical.



As noted above with the ECMWF having more energy over the West early in the
period, there is some potential for heavy rainfall as this trough slides east.
Heavy rain risk would be concentrated across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southeast in such a scenario, which could be concerning given antecedent
rainfall, elevated river levels, and high soil moisture across parts of the
South. With limited support from other guidance, and marginal rainfall signals
in the ECMWF during Week-2, no hazard is indicated at this time.



Upstream of the troughing, mid-level ridging is anticipated across the West to
help drive above-normal temperatures for areas west of the Rockies during
Week-2. This translates to daily highs likely ranging from the mid-90s across
the Desert Southwest to mid-70s across lower elevations of the Northern Great
Basin. If this pattern were during Summer, heat concerns would exist, but the
aforementioned highs are not considered hazardous given climatological
temperatures continue to slowly creep upward. Of note for the West is today's
GEFS runs have been trying to quickly dampen this ridge and build troughing
over the northeastern Pacific. This troughing even results in some increased
signals in atmospheric river guidance across Northern California, although the
ECMWF is not on board. Given the novel solution, it will be monitored in
subsequent forecasts for continuity before considering any heavy precipitation
hazards.



Week-2 mean guidance consistently forecasts anomalous ridging anchored over
the
Bering Sea. As a result, relatively warm and dry conditions are forecast
across
Alaska. The warm pattern is likely to accelerate snow melt and increase
flooding concerns as the region transitions into river break up season.

...Heavy Rainfall Threat for Florida...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period will generally be dominated by periods of
longwave troughing or quasi-zonal flow across much of the central
and eastern U.S. with embedded shortwaves, with a persistent upper
ridge over the West Coast of the U.S. and Canada. Overall this
pattern appeared well clustered in the model guidance, bolstering
forecast confidence in the synoptic scale pattern, but differences
in location and timing of shortwaves remained. One example of this
was across the central U.S. around Sunday, with deterministic
models showing shortwave energy around the Middle Mississippi
Valley on average, but the 00Z UKMET appeared too far northeast
with the feature, having it over the Great Lakes. But a mainly
deterministic model blend of the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF and CMC was
able to be used for the first part of the medium range period
through around Monday. Then, differences in the potency of a
possible shortwave rounding the western side of the main trough
arise around Tuesday/Wednesday, as well as the possibility of
energy separating off from an upper low in the Pacific and
entering the western U.S. then. The CMC was most aggressive with
these features, with the GFS runs weaker and the ECMWF in between.
Favored the 06Z GEFS and 00Z EC ensemble means by then to minimize
the individual model differences. Overall this produced good
continuity with previous WPC forecasts.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf and Florida this weekend
and next week will be the focus for several rounds of potentially
heavy rainfall as upper impulses induce a series of moisture- and
instability-focusing waves. The greatest risk area should shift
from the central/eastern Gulf Coast Saturday to particularly
northern and central Florida early next week. Portions of this
area have seen more than double normal April rainfall, so this
additional rainfall could worsen or initiate flooding. A windy
lead coastal storm is forecast to exit New England waters this
weekend. Then precipitation will be possible near another frontal
system dropping south and eastward through the central and eastern
U.S. for the first half of next week.

Farther west, the Southern/Central Rockies can expect moderate to
heavy snow Saturday with a lead impulse. Then, as the back end of
the next frontal system passes through, the Northern/Central
Rockies could see at least moderate snow Sunday and Monday.
Supporting the snow chances will be colder than normal
temperatures surging across the central U.S., with periods of
maximum temperatures 10 to 25 degrees below average. Meanwhile,
warmer than average temperatures are expected for the West Coast
underneath the persistent ridging.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed April 14 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 20 - 24 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa pattern
across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period.
Dynamical models forecast a  closed 500-hPa low south of the Aleutians and
anomalous ridging over the western CONUS, extending northwest along western
coastal Canada and over Alaska. Downstream of this ridging, a large-scale
trough is predicted over the central and eastern CONUS. Above normal heights
are forecast over Alaska and the western CONUS, while below normal heights are
predicted underneath the mean trough over most of the eastern  two thirds of
CONUS

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across most of Alaska
and the western CONUS, associated with above normal heights. Mean troughing
predicted over the central and eastern CONUS favors below normal temperatures
for most of the rest of the CONUS. However, above normal heights over the
Florida Peninsula increase chances of above normal temperatures consistent
with
the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

Predicted above normal heights favor below normal precipitation for most of
Alaska. Enhanced ridging over the western CONUS leads to elevated chances of
near to below normal precipitation over the western CONUS, extending eastward
to the Northern Great Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great
Lakes. Increased odds of above normal precipitation are indicated across the
Northeast, Middle Atlantic states, Southern Plains and the southeastern CONUS,
underneath predicted mean troughing.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset by increasing uncertainty in
regards to the precipitation forecast over the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 22 - 28 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is generally forecast to
deamplify and shift eastward compared to the 6-10 day period. A weakening
500-hPa ridge is forecast across the western half CONUS with near to above
normal heights, while a trough is forecast over the eastern half CONUS with
near to below normal heights. Above normal heights are forecast across Alaska.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across parts of
Mainland Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle associated with above normal
heights,
while forecast troughing and surface low pressure lead to increased chances of
below normal temperatures across parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska.
Ridging
favors above normal temperatures across the western CONUS. Elevated chances of
near to below normal temperatures are forecast across most of the remainder of
the CONUS associated with mean troughing.

There are elevated chances of below normal precipitation across Alaska due to
predicted above normal heights. Slightly anomalous ridging across the western
CONUS elevates chances of near to below normal precipitation over much of the
western and central CONUS. Above normal precipitation is favored over the
Northwest related to potential storm systems and consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool. Above normal precipitation is favored for much of
the eastern CONUS, due to the mean troughing and near to below normal heights
during the period.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty in regards to the temperature and precipitation
forecast
over the CONUS.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

...Heavy Rainfall Threat for Florida...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period will generally be dominated by periods of
longwave troughing or quasi-zonal flow across much of the central
and eastern U.S. with embedded shortwaves, with a persistent upper
ridge over the West Coast of the U.S. and Canada. Overall this
pattern appeared well clustered in the model guidance, bolstering
forecast confidence in the synoptic scale pattern, but differences
in location and timing of shortwaves remained. One example of this
was across the central U.S. around Sunday, with deterministic
models showing shortwave energy around the Middle Mississippi
Valley on average, but the 00Z UKMET appeared too far northeast
with the feature, having it over the Great Lakes. But a mainly
deterministic model blend of the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF and CMC was
able to be used for the first part of the medium range period
through around Monday. Then, differences in the potency of a
possible shortwave rounding the western side of the main trough
arise around Tuesday/Wednesday, as well as the possibility of
energy separating off from an upper low in the Pacific and
entering the western U.S. then. The CMC was most aggressive with
these features, with the GFS runs weaker and the ECMWF in between.
Favored the 06Z GEFS and 00Z EC ensemble means by then to minimize
the individual model differences. Overall this produced good
continuity with previous WPC forecasts.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf and Florida this weekend
and next week will be the focus for several rounds of potentially
heavy rainfall as upper impulses induce a series of moisture- and
instability-focusing waves. The greatest risk area should shift
from the central/eastern Gulf Coast Saturday to particularly
northern and central Florida early next week. Portions of this
area have seen more than double normal April rainfall, so this
additional rainfall could worsen or initiate flooding. A windy
lead coastal storm is forecast to exit New England waters this
weekend. Then precipitation will be possible near another frontal
system dropping south and eastward through the central and eastern
U.S. for the first half of next week.

Farther west, the Southern/Central Rockies can expect moderate to
heavy snow Saturday with a lead impulse. Then, as the back end of
the next frontal system passes through, the Northern/Central
Rockies could see at least moderate snow Sunday and Monday.
Supporting the snow chances will be colder than normal
temperatures surging across the central U.S., with periods of
maximum temperatures 10 to 25 degrees below average. Meanwhile,
warmer than average temperatures are expected for the West Coast
underneath the persistent ridging.

No changes to the forecast have been made, see the previous
discussion.

..Lyons.. 04/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0216 AM CDT Wed Apr 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will begin to move offshore into the Atlantic as
a second trough aloft ejects into the Plains states tomorrow. Cooler
air will surge southeastward across the eastern U.S. as surface high
pressure ushers in, while dry and breezy conditions take shape
across the Southwest due to downslope flow and surface lee-troughing
present across the southern High Plains.

...Portions of the Lower Colorado River Valley...
60+ kt mid-level flow will overspread Arizona and New Mexico as the
mid-level trough ejects into the Plains states. A deep, dry boundary
layer will induce downward mixing/momentum transport to encourage
widespread 25+ mph sustained westerly surface winds. These stronger
winds will overlap with 10-20% RH for several hours during the
afternoon, warranting the introduction of Critical highlights. A
broader region of Elevated surface conditions will also be present
across the Southwest, however, at least locally Critical conditions
will also be possible throughout the Elevated area.

...Appreciable snow develops over the Central Rockies into the
Central High Plains Thursday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Western/Central Gulf Coast; there is a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall over the Central Gulf Coast...

...Critical Fire Weather conditions are expected across portions
of the Four Corners region...

An upper-level low over the Great Basin will produce snow over the
Central Rockies and the Central High Plains through Friday
evening.  Travel may be difficult with blowing and heavy snow over
the roadway.

A quasi-stationary front near the Gulf Coast States will intersect
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, producing showers and
thunderstorms across parts of the Southern Plains/Central Gulf
Coast through Friday evening.  The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Central Gulf Coast and
Southern Plains through Thursday morning. These storms' main
hazards are frequent lightning, severe wind gusts, hail, and an
isolated tornado through Thursday morning.  Additionally, some of
the storms will produce heavy rain.  The WPC has issued a Moderate
Risk of excessive rainfall associated with these storms through
Thursday morning.  The rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding, with some significant flooding possible.  Furthermore,
many streams may flood, affecting larger rivers.

A storm associated with a second upper-level low over the Great
Lakes will slowly move eastward to the Northeast Coast by Friday
evening.  The system will produce rain and snow over parts of the
Upper Midwest and rain over parts of the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic.  The rain will end over the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday
evening.  Overnight Thursday, snow will develop over higher
elevations across the Northeast as the rain and snow continue into
Friday evening.

Over parts of the Southwest/Four Corners region, dry and windy
weather will make for Elevated to Critical fire weather conditions
through Friday morning.   Red Flag warnings are in effect for
portions of the Four Corners states.

...Multi-day Heavy Rainfall Threat for Florida...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the very well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC
GFS/GEFS mean, the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models in a pattern with above normal
predictability days 3-7. This solution maintains good WPC
continuity and is in overall line with later 00 UTC guidance.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf of Mexico and Florida
this weekend and next week will be the focus for several rounds of
potentially heavy rainfall as upper impulses induce a series of
moisture and instability-focusing waves. The greatest risk will be
over northern and central Florida. This may be a significant
multi-day event leading to flooding issues.

Generally light precipitation will be possible near another
frontal system dropping south and eastward through the central and
eastern U.S. for the first half of next week. However, the
North-Central Rockies/High Plains could see moderate snow Sunday
and Monday with the frontal surge/upslope. Supporting the snow
chances will be colder than normal temperatures surging across the
central U.S., with periods of maximum temperatures 10 to 25
degrees below average.

Meanwhile upstream, warmer than average temperatures expected for
the West Coast underneath ridging may moderate early to mid next
week as an upper trough and frontal system digs southward over the
region, but precipitation should be minimal.

chances will be colder than normal temperatures surging across the
central U.S., with periods of maximum temperatures 10 to 25
degrees below average.

Meanwhile upstream, warmer than average temperatures expected for
the West Coast underneath ridging may moderate early to mid next
week as an upper trough and frontal system digs southward over the
region, but precipitation should be minimal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0142 AM CDT Thu Apr 15 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN ARIZONA INTO
CENTRAL NEW MEXICO AND FAR WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough is expected to eject into the Plains states
during the day, with a belt of 60+ kt 500 mb flow expected to
overspread a deep, dry boundary layer across portions of the Lower
Colorado River Basin towards the southern High Plains. Rapid surface
low development is expected by afternoon, promoting very dry and
breezy conditions across portions of the Southwest, which will
support rapid wildfire spread.

...Eastern Arizona into New Mexico and Far West Texas...
The combination of boundary-layer mixing/downward momentum transport
of the stronger mid-level flow, and gradient wind given the
deepening surface low, are expected to contribute to widespread 25+
mph sustained westerly surface winds across eastern Arizona into New
Mexico and far west Texas. With widespread 10-20% RH in place
throughout the afternoon, and given dry fuels supporting wildfire
spread, Critical highlights have been maintained. At least Elevated
conditions are also expected farther west across northern portions
of Arizona.

The previous forecast remains valid with no changes, see the prior

..Lyons.. 09/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0119 AM CDT Sat Sep 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
50+ kts of mid-level flow will overspread the Pacific Northwest
while pivoting around an upper ridge across the western U.S. today.
Adequate boundary-layer mixing beneath the stronger mid-level flow
will encourage at least locally dry and breezy conditions across the
Northern and central Rockies into the northern High Plains. The best
chance for Elevated overlapping surface winds/RH would be across
portions of the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming into central/eastern
Montana and perhaps far western North Dakota by mid afternoon. Given
the relatively localized and brief nature of the Elevated
conditions, fire weather highlights were withheld this outlook.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
253 PM EDT Sat Sep 4 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Sep 7 2021 - 12Z Sat Sep 11 2021

19Z Update:  The 12Z guidance is in very good agreement on the
overall pattern through Thursday with good continuity from the
previous forecast.  By the end of the forecast period next
Saturday, the CMC is considerably stronger with the central U.S.
upper ridge building northward, whereas the ECMWF/GFS are
indicating a shortwave trough crossing the Upper Midwest.  There
is still a good deal of uncertainty regarding the potential
development and path of a tropical disturbance over the southern
Gulf of Mexico, with the guidance suggesting at most a weak
surface low associated with it.  The WPC forecast was derived from
a multi-deterministic model blend through early Thursday, followed
by some of the ensemble means for Friday and Saturday.  The
previous discussion follows below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Upper ridging will drift out of the Great Basin early next week
toward the southern Plains as troughing moves into the Pacific
Northwest. Troughing will move into the Northeast Tuesday out of
southern Canada which should exit the East Coast around the end of
next week, steering Hurricane Larry in a more northerly direction
out over the open Atlantic. The pattern is largely quiet and drier
than average after a very active and wet several weeks.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycles, the models and ensembles continued to
show relatively good clustering through the period, with expected
differences that grew with time. Large uncertainty remains
surrounding flow pattern over the northeast Pacific/Gulf of Alaska
region which translates into the West toward the end of the
period. There have been enough run-to-run inconsistencies in all
the models to continue favoring a majority blend towards the
ensemble means (GEFS + ECENS mean) which have been more stable at
a cost of some detail. Overall the 12Z ECMWF was favored over the
GFS, which has been quite varied out of the Pacific.

Over the Southwest, the movement of the upper high southeastward
may allow for an increase in moisture into the lower CO River
basin late next week. Some GFS runs have been more aggressive in
bringing tropical moisture and/or a system into Mexico and across
the border, but continued to favor a drier solution rather than
wetter. In the Gulf, tropical development remains uncertain but
moisture transport northward/northeastward continues to look more
likely into the northern/northeastern Gulf. Please see the NHC
outlooks for more information.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus over the Great Lakes Tuesday as an area of low
pressure deepens over southern Canada. Some moderate to locally
heavy rainfall is possible across Michigan and parts of the Lower
Great Lakes, perhaps into New England on Wednesday as the warm
front lifts northward. Rainfall along the tail-end of the cold
front may be lighter into the Southeast. Increased tropical
moisture into the Gulf by midweek may bring the threat for
moderate to heavy rainfall along the northern/northeastern Gulf
Coast region, but models continue to show significant uncertainty
regarding exact locations, timing, and amounts. Maintained a
modest signal pending short term trends with the system.
Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially in the West to the Northern Rockies ahead of the
incoming Pacific trough. Temperatures 5-15 degrees above normal
are possible as the area of warmth moves into the southern/central
Plains late next week. Temperatures in the Great Lakes/Northeast
will be near to a bit below normal thanks to generally northwest
flow behind the cold front.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
253 PM EDT Sat Sep 4 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Sep 7 2021 - 12Z Sat Sep 11 2021

19Z Update:  The 12Z guidance is in very good agreement on the
overall pattern through Thursday with good continuity from the
previous forecast.  By the end of the forecast period next
Saturday, the CMC is considerably stronger with the central U.S.
upper ridge building northward, whereas the ECMWF/GFS are
indicating a shortwave trough crossing the Upper Midwest.  There
is still a good deal of uncertainty regarding the potential
development and path of a tropical disturbance over the southern
Gulf of Mexico, with the guidance suggesting at most a weak
surface low associated with it.  The WPC forecast was derived from
a multi-deterministic model blend through early Thursday, followed
by some of the ensemble means for Friday and Saturday.  The
previous discussion follows below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Upper ridging will drift out of the Great Basin early next week
toward the southern Plains as troughing moves into the Pacific
Northwest. Troughing will move into the Northeast Tuesday out of
southern Canada which should exit the East Coast around the end of
next week, steering Hurricane Larry in a more northerly direction
out over the open Atlantic. The pattern is largely quiet and drier
than average after a very active and wet several weeks.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycles, the models and ensembles continued to
show relatively good clustering through the period, with expected
differences that grew with time. Large uncertainty remains
surrounding flow pattern over the northeast Pacific/Gulf of Alaska
region which translates into the West toward the end of the
period. There have been enough run-to-run inconsistencies in all
the models to continue favoring a majority blend towards the
ensemble means (GEFS + ECENS mean) which have been more stable at
a cost of some detail. Overall the 12Z ECMWF was favored over the
GFS, which has been quite varied out of the Pacific.

Over the Southwest, the movement of the upper high southeastward
may allow for an increase in moisture into the lower CO River
basin late next week. Some GFS runs have been more aggressive in
bringing tropical moisture and/or a system into Mexico and across
the border, but continued to favor a drier solution rather than
wetter. In the Gulf, tropical development remains uncertain but
moisture transport northward/northeastward continues to look more
likely into the northern/northeastern Gulf. Please see the NHC
outlooks for more information.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus over the Great Lakes Tuesday as an area of low
pressure deepens over southern Canada. Some moderate to locally
heavy rainfall is possible across Michigan and parts of the Lower
Great Lakes, perhaps into New England on Wednesday as the warm
front lifts northward. Rainfall along the tail-end of the cold
front may be lighter into the Southeast. Increased tropical
moisture into the Gulf by midweek may bring the threat for
moderate to heavy rainfall along the northern/northeastern Gulf
Coast region, but models continue to show significant uncertainty
regarding exact locations, timing, and amounts. Maintained a
modest signal pending short term trends with the system.
Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially in the West to the Northern Rockies ahead of the
incoming Pacific trough. Temperatures 5-15 degrees above normal
are possible as the area of warmth moves into the southern/central
Plains late next week. Temperatures in the Great Lakes/Northeast
will be near to a bit below normal thanks to generally northwest
flow behind the cold front.

...Organized thunderstorms expected to bring heavy rain and areas
of flash flooding tonight and into Sunday from the Southern Plains
to the Ohio & Tennessee Valleys...

...Seasonally cool from the Central Plains to Northeast but hot
and humid across the southern Plains; increasingly hot throughout
the West...

...Occasional showers and storms in the Lower Mississippi Valley;
raging wildfires out West to continue causing poor air quality
along the West Coast and into the Intermountain West...

A frontal system sweeping across the Nation's Heartland is
forecast to cause unsettled weather from the Great Lakes and
Middle Mississippi Valley to the Southern Plains tonight and into
Sunday. Some storms over central Oklahoma, the Ozarks, and
extending up towards the Mississippi-Ohio River confluence could
become severe and/or produce localized areas of flash flooding. In
fact, a Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall is in place for parts
of these areas into early Sunday morning. Locally heavy showers
and storms extend as far west as New Mexico and southeast Arizona.
Localized areas of flash flooding are possible, especially in
eastern New Mexico where Flash Flood Watches are in effect, along
with a small Slight Risk area for Excessive Rainfall, through
tonight. By Sunday, a low pressure system tracking through Ontario
will send its cold front east into the Ohio Valley and farther
south into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley. These
regions can expect hit-or-miss showers and storms to develop with
the heaviest rainfall likely to transpire in the Tennessee Valley
and northern Mississippi and Alabama. Wet weather is also a good
bet in the Northeast late Sunday and early Monday morning, but
once the front exits to the east, drier conditions should return
the second half of Labor Day.

Temperature-wise, the West continues to heat up as a building
ridge of high pressure becomes centered over Nevada and central
California on Labor Day. Beneath this intensifying ridge aloft,
stifling heat will overtake much of the West Coast with the
hottest conditions focused in central California and the Great
Basin. Excessive Heat Watches have been posted for parts of the
Mojave Desert where high temperatures soaring into the 110s are
likely starting Labor Day and continuing into Tuesday. Heat
Advisories are also in effect in the San Joaquin Valley for Labor
Day as well. The heat across the West spills into the northern
High Plains by Labor Day where high temps look to range between
10-15 degrees above normal. Meanwhile, sultry conditions continue
throughout south Texas and into the Lower Mississippi Valley this
afternoon and into Sunday. The aforementioned cold front described
above will help cool the South-Central U.S. to more seasonal
levels by Labor Day.

Elsewhere, a quasi-stationary front lingering near the northern
Gulf Coast and over central Florida begins to dissipate by Labor
Day. Eventually, the cold front to the north will approach and
ignite additional showers and storms near the central Gulf Coast
on Labor Day. This means daily rounds of pop-up showers and storms
each afternoon, some of which could contain heavy downpours. One
more day of scattered showers and storms are on tap in southern
New Mexico and into the Texas Panhandle on Sunday but should
decrease in coverage and intensity by Labor Day. Lastly, Air
Quality Alerts remain in effect across parts of the Pacific
Northwest and California due to ongoing bouts with smoke from
ongoing wildfires.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat September 04 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Northern Montana...
Minor adjustments have been made to the eastern edge of the Elevated
area across portions of northern Montana. High-res guidance has
trended toward deeper vertical mixing becoming established slightly
farther west than the initial delineation. Strong west/northwesterly
winds, low surface humidity, and dry fuels will support elevated
fire weather potential for several hours through the afternoon. See
the previous discussion for additional information.

..Lyons.. 09/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CDT Sat Sep 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level anticyclone/ridging will prevail across the western U.S.
tomorrow/Sunday, with 50-70 kts of 500 mb flow overspreading the
northern Rockies along the periphery of the upper ridge. The
presence of a relatively deep, mixed boundary layer by tomorrow
afternoon will encourage widespread 15-20 mph sustained westerly
surface winds amid 15-20% RH to develop across much of central
Montana into the Snake River Plain in Idaho, the Harney Basin in
southeast Oregon, and into the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming.
Elevated highlights have been added to portions of central and
Northern Montana, where upper support will be present for a
favorable, multi-hour surface winds/RH overlap, as also supported by
the latest high-resolution ensemble model guidance.

...Overview...

Strong upper ridging will weaken as it drifts out of the Four
Corners region midweek into the southern Plains as troughing
gradually moves into the Pacific Northwest. Troughing in the Great
Lakes will move into/through the Northeast later in the week,
helping to keep Hurricane Larry out over the open Atlantic. The
pattern is a rather dry one, with generally near to above normal
temperatures over much of the lower 48.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The guidance continues to struggle with the flow out of the
Pacific, with no clear consensus among the deterministic models.
With heights lowering Wednesday, the disparate solutions grew
farther apart thereafter, translating across the CONUS and
southern Canada into next weekend. Questions remain as to how much
troughing is left to slowly move east just off northern CA vs how
much northern troughing may shear eastward through southern
Canada, ultimately slipping into the backside of the eastern
troughing if quick enough. Ensemble means generally followed their
deterministic parent models but were a bit closer to each other
(GEFS and ECMWF EPS) so that a trend toward that blend was
preferred by the end of the period. To start, a deterministic
blend sufficed for the first two days of the period, with a messy
re-weighting in between. Confidence was lower than normal over the
northern tier due to the inconsistent model signal (yet fairly
consistent broader ensemble agreement). This is no surprise given
the trend toward quasi-zonal flow vs amplified flow.

Over the Southwest, the movement of the upper high southeastward
may allow for an increase in moisture into the lower CO River
basin later in the week. NHC is monitoring the potential for
development off the Mexican coast that may try to lift northward,
perhaps spreading moisture into the Southwest next weekend. Some
GFS runs have been more aggressive in bringing significant
rainfall to parts of AZ/SoCal, but continued to favor a drier
solution rather than wetter until confidence increases. The daily
17Z NHC-WPC tropical coordination call will refine the surface
progs and consequentially the QPF.

In the Gulf, tropical development remains uncertain but moisture
transport northward/northeastward continues to look more likely
into the northern/northeastern Gulf. Maintained a modest QPF
signal into the FL Panhandle and southeastern GA. Please see the
NHC outlooks for more information.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus along and ahead of a cold front from the
Northeast to the Southeast before it exits/dissipates. Amounts
will generally be light except over the northeastern Gulf where
tropical moisture may support modest to perhaps heavier amounts.
Daily showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to
the south of the boundary. Some moisture will work back through
the Southwest around the upper high as it drifts southeastward,
focused over inland CA into the Great Basin and parts of the
Desert Southwest. This may lift northward into the northern
Rockies by later in the week into the weekend, ahead of another
Pacific front.

Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially in the interior West to the Northern Rockies ahead of
the incoming Pacific trough Wed-Thu. Temperatures 5-15 degrees
above normal are possible as the area of warmth moves into the
southern/central Plains later in the week/weekend. Temperatures in
the Great Lakes/Northeast will be near to a bit below normal via
northwest flow behind the cold front this week, perhaps moderating
a bit next weekend as the surface high approaches.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0133 AM CDT Sun Sep 05 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will persist across the western U.S. as a mid-level
impulse, characterized by a 50+ kt 500 mb jet streak, crests the
upper ridge over the northern Rockies today. The strongest flow
aloft will overspread portions of central/northern Montana,
supporting widespread 15+ mph sustained westerly flow amid 15-20%
RH, warranting the maintenance of Elevated highlights. Otherwise,
locally dry and breezy conditions are likely across terrain-favoring
areas of the Interior West (as shown by the latest high-resolution
guidance consensus). At the moment, the higher terrain/lee of the
southern Cascades in Oregon, the Snake River Plain in southern
Idaho, and the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming are the most likely
regions to experience brief bouts of 15-20 mph sustained winds
overlapping 15-20% RH.

0150 AM CDT Sun Sep 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will remain in place across the western U.S.
tomorrow/Monday, with a mid-level trough amplifying while cresting
the ridge and ejecting into the northern Plains states. 60+ kts of
mid-level flow will overspread much of the northern Rockies, with
intensifying surface lee troughing likely over the northern High
Plains behind a southward-moving cold front. The net result will be
widespread 15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds overlapping
with 15-25% RH across much of the northern and central Rockies into
the northern High Plains, addressed by a fairly large Elevated
delineation given forecast fuel ERCs at or above 80%. At least
locally Critical conditions will be possible across much of the
Elevated area. However, the lack of a more favorable, longer-lasting
wind/RH overlap precludes Critical highlights this outlook.

...Occasional showers and storms from the mid-South to the the
Northeast while raging wildfires continues out West causing poor
air quality downstream...

...Seasonally cool from the Central Plains to Northeast but hot
and humid across the southern Plains and Southeast; increasingly
hot throughout the West...

An upper-level trough dipping into the Great Lakes will help push
a sluggish cold front over the mid-section of the country faster
towards the east.  Some of the thunderstorms ahead of this front
could be quite strong across the mid-Mississippi Valley where
heavy downpours from these thunderstorms can result in localized
areas of flash flooding early this morning.  The front should then
continue to move steadily across the Northeast and the
Mid-Atlantic states on Labor Day, with its trailing portion
dipping across the Deep South.  Scattered thunderstorms can be
expected to move into the Deep South, the Appalachians and the
Northeast today as well as today.  By Labor Day, the front will
likely bring isolated to scattered thunderstorms across the
Mid-Atlantic while scattered thunderstorms continue across the
Deep South.  New England should see the thunderstorms ready to
exit the region early on Labor before cooler and drier air arrives
behind the cold front.  However, a reinforcing cold front will
spread scattered showers and some thunderstorms from the Great
Lakes into northern New England later on Labor Day.  Fine and
pleasant weather will prevail from the northern/central Plains
eastward to the Ohio Valley today and Labor Day.  But another
upper trough from central Canada will help develop a low pressure
system over the northern Plains on Labor Day, bringing the next
round of showers and thunderstorms into the upper Midwest later on
Labor Day, moving into the Great Lakes Tuesday morning.

Temperature-wise, the West continues to heat up as a building
ridge of high pressure becomes centered over Nevada and central
California on Labor Day. Beneath this intensifying ridge aloft,
afternoon heat will envelop much of the West Coast with the
hottest conditions focused in central California and the Great
Basin, although temperatures will cool down quite a bit during the
night.  Excessive Heat Watches remain posted for much of the
Mojave Desert where high temperatures soaring into the 110s are
likely starting Labor Day and continuing into Tuesday. Heat
Advisories are also in effect in the San Joaquin Valley for Labor
Day as well. The heat across the West is expected to spread into
the northern High Plains by Labor Day where high temps look to
range between 10-15 degrees above normal.  Meanwhile, sultry
conditions continue throughout south Texas and into the Lower
Mississippi Valley this afternoon and into Labor Day.  The
aforementioned cold front described above will help cool the
South-Central U.S. to more seasonal levels by Tuesday.

Elsewhere, a quasi-stationary front lingering near the northern
Gulf Coast and over central Florida begins to dissipate by Labor
Day. Eventually, the cold front to the north will approach and
ignite additional showers and storms near the central Gulf Coast
on Labor Day. This means daily rounds of pop-up showers and storms
each afternoon, some of which could contain heavy downpours. One
more day of scattered showers and storms are on tap in southern
New Mexico and into the Texas Panhandle on Sunday but should
decrease in coverage and intensity by Labor Day. Lastly, Air
Quality Alerts remain in effect across parts of the Pacific
Northwest and California due to ongoing bouts with smoke from
ongoing wildfires.

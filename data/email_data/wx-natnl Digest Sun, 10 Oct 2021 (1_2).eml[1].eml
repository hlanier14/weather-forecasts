Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1123 AM CDT Sat Oct 09 2021

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

Expanded the elevated area slightly farther north in Colorado where
conditions are already approaching elevated with relative humidity
in the 25 to 35 percent range and winds 15 to 20 mph. RH is expected
to drop into the teens in this region later this afternoon.
Otherwise, no changes were made.

..Bentley.. 10/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Sat Oct 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level trough is forecast to move from the western Great
Basin this morning and into the Four Corners region through tonight.
This will maintain a broad corridor of vigorous
southwesterly/westerly mid-level flow -- near the base of the trough
-- from the Southwest to the central/southern Plains. At the
surface, lee troughing is forecast to strengthen across the central
Plains through this afternoon while a cold front gradually shifts
southward across southeast Colorado and into the Oklahoma/Texas
Panhandles.

...Central/Southern Plains...
Strong/gusty southwesterly winds (westerly winds over Colorado) are
expected to develop around midday as strong surface heating promotes
efficient vertical mixing to the surface of the aforementioned
enhanced winds aloft. Sustained surface winds of 20-30 mph are
likely (with stronger gusts) with winds peaking during the mid/late
afternoon as minimum RH values dip to near 15-20%. Despite these
meteorologically critical fire weather conditions, fuels across much
of this area remain just below critical status, which precludes a
Critical fire weather area. Locally critical fire weather conditions
are most likely over southeast Colorado, far southwest Kansas, and
western portions of the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles, where the most
favorable combination of surface wind/RH and receptive fuels is
expected.

Near critical meteorological conditions are also expected farther
south into southeast New Mexico. However, fuels across this area are
even less favorable to large fire spread (ERCs below the 60th
percentile), which should generally keep any fire weather threat
localized.

...Montana...
A few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions are expected
this afternoon across portions of north-central Montana as sustained
westerly surface winds near 15 mph overlap RH values of 15-20% and
receptive fuels. At this time, the brief/spotty nature of the threat
precludes introducing an Elevated fire weather area.

...First significant winter storm of the season for parts of the
central and northern Rockies continuing into the middle of next
week...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across portions of
the southern/central Plains Tuesday into Wednesday...

18Z Update: Excellent deterministic model agreement exists for the
middle of the week owing to the rather amplified pattern in place,
even on smaller shortwave features for Tuesday and Wednesday.
Even by next Friday, above normal model agreement is noted,
although more significant differences become apparent across the
northeast Pacific with the next trough approaching the coast.  The
12Z CMC is displaced west with the trough axis and more amplified
with the low west of British Columbia compared to the model
consensus, and stronger with a downstream ridge over the Pacific
Northwest by next Saturday.  The GFS is noted as a more
progressive solution by the end of the forecast period across the
eastern U.S. with the cold front, and slightly ahead of its GEFS
ensemble mean.  A well clustered GFS/ECMWF/UKMET blend was used as
a starting point for Tuesday through Thursday, and then
ECMWF/GFS/ECENS/GEFS for Friday and Saturday.  The previous
discussion follows below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Behind a Great Lakes system that rapidly weakens as the supporting
dynamics flow around a Gulf of Mexico/Eastern U.S. upper ridge, a
Southwest/southern Great Basin upper low will track northeastward
through the northern Plains and into Canada.  This upper low will
support strong low pressure expected to progress from the central
Rockies through the northern Plains during Tuesday-Thursday,
bringing significant mountain snow to parts of the Rockies as well
as areas of heavy rainfall to portions of the northern Plains. The
trailing cold front may also serve as a focus for locally heavy
and strong to severe convection over the southern half of the
Plains. The amplified upper pattern will bring a pronounced
temperature contrast with well below normal readings over the West
and multiple warm days over the East.  Features should become a
little more progressive by next weekend as an upper trough over
the northeastern Pacific helps to build a western ridge that in
turn will encourage an eastward displacement of the mid-late week
trough.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

At least in terms of the track and timing of the ejecting upper
low, the ECMWF mean continued to provide the most reasonable
individual solution relative to the full array of 12Z/18Z
guidance.  GFS runs have continued to be a bit on the fast side of
the spread (especially late Tuesday into Wednesday) while the 12Z
ECMWF leans to the slow side.  From about late Wednesday onward,
latest guidance including the new 00Z GFS/UKMET/CMC reinforce the
idea of somewhat faster progression than the 12Z ECMWF.  The new
00Z ECMWF has indeed adjusted a bit faster.  Employing a 12Z/18Z
model blend provided the desired intermediate timing while
providing more detail than the ECMWF mean at the surface.
Guidance agrees fairly well that weak shortwave energy arriving
from the Pacific by Wednesday will drop into the western U.S. mean
trough and likely promote some waviness along the trailing front
over the southern half of the Plains late in the week.  An added
complication after midweek will be what happens with the energy
aloft and moisture associated with a tropical system that is
likely to develop in the eastern Pacific (high formation chance in
the next two days per the latest Tropical Weather Outlook from the
National Hurricane Center).  There is general agreement on a
corridor for this energy/moisture to travel between the Gulf of
Mexico ridge and western U.S. trough but there are still
significant track and timing differences for the expected tropical
system.  CMC runs are particularly fast with it.

Toward the end of the period the primary issues are how quickly
height falls reach into the Pacific Northwest/western Canada ahead
of a northeastern Pacific trough and progression of the remaining
upper trough across the central U.S.  The 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means
are quite similar and provide reasonable support for the 18Z
GFS/12Z ECMWF timing of the upper trough reaching the east-central
U.S. by Saturday.  The 12Z GFS was somewhat faster while multiple
CMC runs have been slower than consensus.  The new 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted slower, closer to the 00Z CMC.  Meanwhile GFS runs thus
far have been more eager than most other guidance to bring height
falls into western North America.  These considerations led to
adjusting the early-period operational model blend toward
two-thirds total ensemble weight and more 12Z ECMWF than 18Z GEFS
for the rest by day 7 Saturday.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The cold storm system developing over the Interior West/Rockies on
Tuesday and then tracking northeastward will lower snow levels in
the mountains with potential for heavy snow accumulations in the
higher terrain of the northern-central Rockies, specifically from
Colorado through Wyoming into far southern Montana.  This would be
the first significant winter storm of the season for this area.
Away from the mountains, an axis of heavy rainfall is possible
around and to the north of the surface low.  Some mixing of snow
may not be out of the question during the colder overnight hours.
A fairly broad area of strong/gusty winds will also progress from
the Interior West/Rockies into the Plains Tuesday through
Thursday.  Across the central and southern Plains, moderate to
locally heavy rainfall is possible and the Storm Prediction Center
is monitoring a threat for severe weather on Tuesday and/or
Wednesday depending on exact timing of the front that will extend
from the northern Plains low. Around mid-late week there continues
to be a potential for eastern Pacific tropical moisture to stream
northeastward and interact with the front to produce areas of
heavy rainfall over parts of Texas and possibly extending
northeastward.  However the combined uncertainties over timing of
the front, wave details, and timing/track of the likely tropical
system keep confidence fairly low for resolving important
specifics of location and magnitude of heaviest rainfall.  The
cold front and accompanying rainfall should extend farther into
the East by next weekend.  Elsewhere, the Pacific Northwest may
see one or more episodes of mostly light precipitation, first from
weak Pacific energy that continues into the West and then flow on
the leading edge of a Northeast Pacific upper trough.  The Great
Lakes and vicinity may see some rainfall on Tuesday from the
weakening system initially over the region.

The West will see a broad area of highs 15-30F below normal
through midweek followed by gradual moderation toward more
single-digit anomalies by Saturday.  Morning lows will be less
extreme but there will still be multiple days with lows of 10-20F
below normal.  On the other hand the East will be quite warm
through late week.  At least the northern half of the region will
see highs of 10F or more above normal on one or more days while a
much broader area will see plus 10-20F or so anomalies for lows.
Numerous record warm lows will be possible from the western Gulf
Coast northeastward.  Eventual progression of the Plains cold
front should bring a cooling trend from west to east by late
Friday/Saturday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun October 03 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0243 PM CDT Sat Oct 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

Expanded the elevated area east in Texas based on the eastward
extent of the dryline in the latest model guidance. Otherwise, the
forecast remains on track.

..Bentley.. 10/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Sat Oct 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level trough -- over the Four Corners region at the
start of Day 2/Sunday -- is expected to move across the
central/southern Plains through the remainder of the day. Meanwhile,
another mid-level trough is forecast to deepen as it moves southward
across the Pacific Northwest late Day 2/Sunday. At the surface, a
deepening lee cyclone over portions of western North Texas is
forecast to move northeastward into Missouri through the overnight.

...Southern Plains...
Critical meteorological fire weather conditions are likely by midday
Day 2/Sunday as enhanced mid-level flow near the base of the
aforementioned trough mixes to the surface. While several hours of
sustained westerly surface winds of 25-30 mph (stronger gusts)
overlapping critical RH values are expected, fuels across this area
remain mostly unfavorable to large-scale fire spread. Nevertheless,
the potential for higher-end critical conditions will likely yield
at least elevated fire weather concerns.

...California...
Gusty northerly surface winds are forecast to develop late Day
2/Sunday night as the aforementioned trough over the Pacific
Northwest begins to impinge on the area. While locally elevated fire
weather conditions are likely, overnight RH recoveries are currently
forecast to be sufficient to preclude introducing an Elevated fire
weather area. The fire weather threat is forecast to increase early
Day 3/Monday as RH values drop and the strong surface winds persist.
Please see the Day 3/Monday fire weather outlook for more
information.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
344 PM EDT Sat Oct 09 2021

Valid 00Z Sun Oct 10 2021 - 00Z Tue Oct 12 2021

...A pair of storm systems tracking through the Nation's Heartland
to generate severe weather and excessive rainfall from the
Southern and Northern Plains to the Great Lakes...

...September-like heat to continue across much of the eastern half
of the Lower 48; potential for tropical development off the
Carolina Coast tonight and into Sunday...

...Amplifying upper trough to inject some of the coldest air of
the season into the West early next week; heavy mountain snow and
much below normal temperatures likely...

An increasingly amplified weather pattern will cause considerably
cooler temperatures in the West to rub shoulders with a more late
summer-like air-mass in the East, concocting a myriad of hazardous
weather conditions into next week. To start, a storm system in the
Northern Plains will be responsible for producing severe weather
from the Dakotas to the northern Great Lakes this evening. There
is also a flash flood threat in parts of the Dakotas and northwest
Minnesota, leading to the issuance of a Slight Risk for Excessive
Rainfall today. A trailing frontal boundary extending into the
southern High Plains and corresponding upper level disturbance
aloft is set to produce spotty showers over parts of the region,
as well as mountain snow in the southern Rockies. By Sunday, this
upper level disturbance will strengthen over New Mexico allowing
for a a threat for severe weather to transpire over the Southern
Plains. The Storm Prediction Center has an Enhanced Risk for
severe storms in central Oklahoma and far northern Texas. The
storm system further strengthens and tracks northeast into the
Midwest on Monday, bringing along with it the threat for severe
storms from the mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes.

The abnormally warm temperatures throughout much of the East,
making it feel as if the calendar is still closer to Labor Day
rather than Halloween for some, is attributed to a strong upper
level ridge positioned over eastern Canada and a bridging of the
ridge axis over the South Central U.S.. High temperatures this
afternoon soared into the 90s in the South Central U.S. with some
locations making a run at the century mark. In addition, Red Flag
Warnings were issued across parts of the central to southern High
Plains due to favorable fire weather conditions this afternoon.
Numerous daily record warm minimum temperatures are anticipated
tomorrow in the Midwest but considerably warmer than normal
minimum temps will also be observed along the East Coast. High
temps are forecast to reach the 80s in the lower Great Lakes on
Sunday with 80s also on tap again on Monday in the Great Lakes and
parts of the Mid-Atlantic. Much of the South will not only see
highs in the 80s (some 90s mixed in) both Sunday and Monday, but
dew points ranging between 60-70 degrees will make for slightly
higher heat indices. Lastly, eyes are on the Carolina coast as the
National Hurricane Center has designated an area of low pressure
with a 50% chance of development over the next two days. No matter
its classification, expect rainy and gusty conditions along the
North Carolina Outer Banks this evening and into Sunday.

Conversely, a frontal system tracking into the Pacific Northwest
this evening is associated with a deepening upper trough diving
south through British Columbia. This storm's cold front is set to
usher in the coldest air of the season to date in the western
third of the country by Monday. In wake for the cold frontal
passage, high winds will ensue from the Great Valley of California
to the Desert Southwest. High Wind Watches have been issued in
advance due to the heightened risk for hazardous wind gusts.
Freeze Watches have also been posted for the western Nevada Basin.
As the front crosses the northern Rockies, plummeting snow levels
give way to periods of snow breaking out Sunday evening. By
Monday, as the trough continues to strengthen, so will the
evolving frontal system in the West, leading to heavy snow for the
many mountain ranges in the Intermountain West. Latest snowfall
forecast indicate anywhere from 6 to 12 inches (locally higher
amounts possible) may accumulate in the northern Rockies,
including ranges such as the Absarokas, Teton, Wind River, and Big
Horns. This upper trough becomes quite intense by early Tuesday,
setting the stage for copious amounts of snow in parts of the
Rockies and a potential severe weather outbreak in the southern
and central Great Plains.

...Strong northern Plains storm to bring heavy rainfall to the
region on Wednesday along with some High Plains snow...

...Heavy rain threat over parts of the southern Plains
Wednesday-Thursday...

...Overview...

Guidance continues to show a very active pattern over the central
U.S. mid-late week.  A strong storm system tracking northeastward
from Nebraska/South Dakota into Canada will bring significant
precipitation to the northern Plains and vicinity, while incoming
Pacific shortwave energy and a flow of eastern Pacific tropical
moisture/energy are likely to interact with the trailing front to
produce areas of heavy rainfall over the southern Plains.  The
amplified pattern consisting of mean troughing aloft over the
west-central U.S. and a ridge from the Gulf of Mexico into the
eastern U.S. will lead to a pronounced temperature contrast with
much below normal readings over the West and unseasonable warmth
over the East.  By the weekend precipitation coverage/intensity
over the lower 48 will steadily decrease and temperatures will
moderate as an eastern Pacific upper trough encourages a ridge to
build into the West, pushing the western/central U.S. trough into
the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Latest models and ensemble means are fairly well clustered for the
strong storm tracking northeastward from Nebraska/South Dakota
early Wednesday onward, at least with respect to typical errors
for three or four days out in time.  Some GFS runs over recent
days may have been a bit fast/east but overall trends from other
guidance have been gradually deeper, toward a depth that the GFS
advertised with earlier lead time.  00Z models maintain good
continuity and agreement for depth and track.

Meanwhile agreement is improving for the Pacific shortwave energy
entering the West by early Wednesday and emerging into the Plains
by Friday, though some modest spread is still noted late in the
week.  On the other hand models continue to show more spread and
variability than desired for the specifics of an eastern Pacific
tropical system currently expected to form later today per the
latest Tropical Weather Outlook from the National Hurricane
Center.  There has been some narrowing of the envelope for the
track of this system (northeastward progression as it passes
southeast of the southern tip of Baja California) but the CMC is
the persistent fast extreme and the 00Z UKMET is fairly fast as
well.  The 12Z ECMWF was not far from recent GFS runs but now the
new 00Z ECMWF has trended faster.  The precise timing of this
system will be important for resolving the effects over the
southern Plains.  The depiction on the manual forecast maintains a
solution reflecting yesterday's WPC-NHC coordination.

Beyond early Friday the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their ensemble means
(plus the 12Z CMC aside from its slower eastern U.S. wave that
went away in the new 00Z run) provide reasonable agreement in
principle as the pattern adjusts to a trough-ridge-trough
configuration, favoring a model/mean blend to tone down smaller
scale shortwave uncertainties by days 6-7.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The strong storm tracking northeastward across the northern Plains
Wednesday into early Thursday will bring an area of rainfall that
should be heaviest over the Dakotas, along with possibly some
meaningful snow over parts of the northern High Plains, and
strong/gusty winds.  Parts of the southern Plains will see the
potential for heavy rainfall around Wednesday-Thursday due to
approaching western U.S. shortwave energy and eastern Pacific
tropical moisture/shortwave energy interacting with the trailing
front over the region.  The general signal for this event has
persisted over the past couple days but the uncertainty regarding
the timing of the Pacific tropical system keeps confidence lower
than desired for resolving the finer details at this time.  Some
of this moisture may continue into the eastern U.S. late week into
the weekend as the front becomes more progressive but rainfall
totals should be less extreme.

Flow on the eastern fringe of Pacific mean troughing aloft will
bring periods of light to perhaps moderate precipitation to the
northern Pacific Northwest through the period.  Light rain and
high elevation snow may extend from the Northwest down into the
central Rockies with the upper shortwave crossing the West during
Wednesday-Thursday.

The West will see a broad area of highs 15-30F below normal
through at least Thursday followed by steady moderation toward
mostly single-digit anomalies with only pockets of colder readings
during the weekend.  Morning lows will be less extreme but there
will still be multiple days with lows of 10-20F below normal.  A
few daily records for lows/cold highs will be possible.  Meanwhile
at least the northern two-thirds of the East will see highs of
10-20F above normal mid-late week with some cooling that starts
over the Mississippi Valley.  A much broader area will see plus
10-20F or so anomalies for lows.  Numerous record warm lows will
be possible from the western Gulf Coast or Lower Mississippi
Valley northward/northeastward.  Progression of the Plains cold
front into the East should bring a cooling trend during the
weekend with highs dropping to near or slightly below normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0211 AM CDT Sun Oct 10 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-/upper-level trough over the Four Corners region early this
morning will move into the Plains this afternoon and deepen.
Coincident with this, a strengthening mid-/upper-level jet will
carve out a new trough along the Pacific coast late tonight into
early Monday morning.

At the surface, an advancing cold front, stretched from central
Minnesota south-southwestward into northwest Oklahoma and the Texas
Panhandle at the start of the forecast period, will stall across
portions of Oklahoma late morning into early afternoon, roughly
along the I-44 corridor. At the same time, robust westerly downslope
flow to the south of this cold front will contribute to a strong
dryline push into the southern Texas Panhandle by mid-afternoon. The
surface low at the intersection of the dryline-cold front
intersection will deepen during the afternoon as it moves out of the
Texas Panhandle and into southwest Oklahoma. The circulation around
the deepening low will aid the dryline push into Texas.

... Southern New Mexico into the southern Plains ...

Several hours of sustained surface winds nearing 30 mph, with
stronger gusts, will occur across the region. Coincident with this,
relative humidity will fall below 15-20% in the presence of strong
diurnal heating and a deeply mixed boundary layer. Despite critical,
or even high-end critical, meteorological conditions, fuels appear
unfavorable for large-scale fire spread. The result will be several
hours of at least elevated to locally critical fire conditions. The
eastward extent of the dryline push into Texas will determine the
eastward extent of the fire weather potential. Thus, additional
refinements to the eastward delineation of the elevated area may
need to be refined with the next forecast update.

... Northern California ...

Surface winds will increase and become gusty across northern
California overnight Sunday into Monday due to the strengthening jet
digging into the area. Although winds will increase overnight,
relative humidity should remain high enough to warrant widespread
elevated or critical fire concerns under normal conditions until
later Monday morning. However, given extremely receptive fuels and
the potential for the relative humidity to fall earlier than
expected, an elevated area has been introduced.

0213 AM CDT Sun Oct 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF
CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
On Monday, a strong mid-/upper-level Pacific jet will dig south
across California, increasing to over 100 knots at 500-millibars.
This jet will carve out a deep trough across the western United
States, with an eventual closed 500-millibar low developing across
northern Arizona by early Tuesday morning.

As this jet digs and strengthens, a surface low will deepen across
southern Nevada late Monday evening before lifting northeast into
Utah by Tuesday morning. A strong surface high across the northeast
Pacific will contribute to an increased surface pressure gradient
across California to the west of the deepening low. The resultant
dry, northerly flow will combine with intense heating supporting a
deeply mixed boundary layer and downward momentum transfer of the
mid-level jet. The result will be surface winds approaching 30 mph,
with local gusts over 40 mph possible -- stronger and gustier than
would otherwise be expected, given the surface pressure gradient.

Relative humidity on Monday will fall into the teens across the
region, with a delayed (if any) overnight recovery occurring Monday
night. Therefore, with extremely receptive fuels in place owing to
the long-term drought, the addition of the strong, gusty winds
described above will result in elevated and critical fire weather
conditions throughout the Central Valley on Monday into Tuesday
morning.

...A pair of storm systems tracking through the Nation's Heartland
to generate severe weather and excessive rainfall from the
Southern and Northern Plains to the Great Lakes...

...September-like heat to continue across much of the eastern half
of the Lower 48; potential for tropical development off the
Carolina Coast tonight and into Sunday...

...Amplifying upper trough to inject some of the coldest air of
the season into the West early next week; heavy mountain snow and
much below normal temperatures likely...

An increasingly active weather pattern continues to take shape
across U.S. mainland as a couple of strong upper-level troughs are
forecast to force their way eastward through the western U.S.
against the slow-moving regime near the East Coast.  The first
upper trough is responsible for the formation a pair of low
pressure systems across the mid-section of the country.  The
system moving across the northern Plains this morning is
responsible for triggering severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Dakotas into Minnesota.  This low will head into southern Canada
by tonight with the threat of severe weather quickly diminishing
over the upper Midwest.  In the wake of this system, another low
pressure system is forecast to form over the southern Plains
today, where a threat for severe weather will rapidly transpire
tonight over the southern Plains.  The Storm Prediction Center is
indicating an Moderate Risk for severe storms across central
Oklahoma for tonight.  The low pressure system will continue to
develop and track into the Great Lakes by Tuesday morning with the
threat of severe thunderstorms spreading further up the
mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes Monday into early
Tuesday.

Along the East Coast, the National Hurricane Center continues to
monitor a low pressure system forming near a stalled front just of
the North Carolina coast.  This system showed signs of acquiring
some tropical characteristics early this morning.  However, the
main upper-level support is forecast to lift northeastward away
from the system during the next couple of days.  Some heavy rain
and gusty conditions can be expected along the North Carolina
coastal areas and may skirt the Virginia eastern shores this
morning before edging out to sea later today.  Some showers are
possible to extend further north into southern New England on
Monday as the associated frontal system will remain slow to exit
the East Coast.

Meanwhile, a frontal system tracking into the Pacific Northwest
this evening is associated with a deepening upper trough diving
south through British Columbia. The associated cold front is set
to usher in the coldest air of the season to date in the western
third of the country by Monday. In wake for the cold frontal
passage, high winds will ensue from the Great Valley of California
to the Desert Southwest. High Wind Watches have been issued in
advance due to the heightened risk for hazardous wind gusts.
Freeze Watches have also been posted for the western Nevada Basin.
As the front crosses the northern Rockies, plummeting snow levels
give way to periods of snow breaking out Sunday evening. By
Monday, as the trough continues to strengthen, so will the
evolving frontal system in the West, leading to heavy snow for the
many mountain ranges in the Intermountain West. Latest snowfall
forecast indicate anywhere from 6 to 12 inches (locally higher
amounts possible) may accumulate in the northern Rockies,
including ranges such as the Absarokas, Teton, Wind River, and Big
Horns. This upper trough becomes quite intense by early Tuesday,
setting the stage for copious amounts of snow in parts of the
Rockies and a potential severe weather outbreak in the southern
and central Great Plains.

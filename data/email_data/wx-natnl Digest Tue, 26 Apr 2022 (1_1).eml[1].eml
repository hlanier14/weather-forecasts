Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1221 AM CDT Mon Apr 25 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to be low today across the CONUS.
A surface cold front will continue to shift east/southeast across
the upper OH river valley and towards the northwest Gulf Coast
today. Behind this front, cooler temperatures will continue to
overspread the southern Plains and the mid-MS river valley. To the
west across the High Plains, surface high pressure will continue to
build in the wake of the mid-level trough currently passing over the
central Rockies per early-morning water vapor imagery. This surface
regime will place the strongest pressure-gradient winds over the
upper MS river valley and generally away from the southern to
central High Plains where RH values below 15% are expected and fuels
are most receptive. Localized elevated concerns are possible across
parts of central NE and southwest OK where 10-15 mph winds may
overlap with RH values between 20-25%, but the potential for
persistent, widespread elevated conditions appears low.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 25 2022

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure across the south-central CONUS a=
t
the beginning of the period supports much above normal temperatures across =
the
Central and Southern Plains, where combined with an increased potential for
high winds, could exacerbate ongoing drought conditions and enhance wildfir=
e
risk across this part of the country during week-2. Surface low formation
favored over the Great Plains increases the risk for heavy precipitation
across
portions of the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys early in the period=
.
Over Alaska, prevailing southerly, onshore flow favored is anticipated to
bring
above-normal temperatures and precipitation throughout many portions of the
Mainland, which may lead to localized flooding during the ongoing ice river
breakup season across the state.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures across parts of the Central a=
nd
Southern Plains, Tue-Wed, May 3-4.

Slight risk of high winds across the Great Plains, Tue-Thu, May 3-5.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Great Plains,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Tue-Thu, May 3-5.

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures across portions of western an=
d
central Mainland Alaska, Tue-Mon, May 3-9.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 28 - MONDAY MAY 02:

FOR TUESDAY MAY 03 - MONDAY MAY 09: Towards the end of week-1, there is goo=
d
agreement among the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensembles favoring a gradual
deamplification of the 500-hPa height pattern over the CONUS, with the GEFS
being particularly more muted by the start of the week-2 period. By the mid=
dle
of next week, the past several runs of the GEFS continue to favor the
development of anomalous mid-level troughing to promote the advection of co=
ld
air over the Midwest tied to strengthening positive height departures upstr=
eam
over southwestern Canada and the higher elevations of western CONUS. Howeve=
r,
the ECMWF and Canadian ensembles remain comparatively weaker with this
mid-level disturbance, instead maintaining a more zonal mid-level pattern a=
nd
warmer mean temperature solution east of the Rockies through the end of nex=
t
week. These differences are reflected in the reforecast tools as the GEFS
indicates increased chances (>20%) of minimum temperatures falling below th=
e
15th percentile and below 40 degrees over the Northern Plains,
Upper-Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes by the middle of the period, wher=
e
the ECMWF reforecast tool is virtually absent of this cold signal during th=
is
time. While below-normal temperatures are favored over the north-central an=
d
northeastern CONUS during the period, no corresponding cold temperature
hazards
are posted due to insufficient confidence that nightime temperatures will
exceed hazard criteria and in consideration of higher sun angles and warmer
climatology during early May.



Late in week-1, the Weather Prediction Center's (WPCs) day 7 temperature
forecasts show a large coverage of positive temperature departures over the
southwestern CONUS with anomalies exceeding double digits over parts of the
Rockies and Central and Southern High Plains. Much of this anomalous warmth
looks to persist into week-2, where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tool=
s
show at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile and 90 degrees F (95 Deg F in Texas). The ECMWF is more robust w=
ith
this signal (>40% probabilities) likely tied to stronger ridging favored al=
oft
early in the period. Despite actual temperatures not potentially posing a
health hazard, the greater hazard concern is the continued likelihood of
worsening drought conditions and enhanced wildfire risk throughout the regi=
on,
thus a slight risk of much above-normal temperatures is issued for the Cent=
ral
and Southern Plains for May 3-4. Given continued support in the ensemble an=
d
deterministic guidance for strong pressure gradients in the region, a sligh=
t
risk of high winds is also issued (May 3-5) throughout much of the Great
Plains
where the ECMWF reforecast tool shows a broad region with at least a 20%
chance
of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20mph.



Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favor surface low formation over the Grea=
t
Plains early in the period, but are variable in regards to the strength and
evolution of this surface feature. Uncalibrated GEFS guidance depicts a dee=
per
low with a storm track traversing the Great Lakes by day 9 (May 4), with so=
me
of the higher precipitation totals focused across the Middle and Upper
Mississippi Valley. While the ECMWF is comparatively weaker and slower with
the
low, both uncalibrated and calibrated reforecast guidance generally favor a
more southerly solution of the heavy precipitation potential, depicting the
largest signals for 3-day accumulations exceeding an inch across the Middle
and
Lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys. To address these differences=
 in
the guidance, a fairly broad slight risk area of heavy precipitation is iss=
ued
over the region for May 3-5. A flooding possible hazard is also posted for
many
areas surrounding the Red River of the North where there is ongoing snow me=
lt
and flooding, and above-average precipitation favored during the next two
weeks
is likely to worsen already saturated ground conditions over the region.
Areas
along the Red River are forecast to approach record flood stage during week=
-1.



Over Alaska, there is good model agreement favoring mid-level troughing ove=
r
the Aleutians and the Gulf of Alaska where the prevailing southerly flow is
expected to keep much of the Mainland on the warm and wet side during the
period. As many rivers are experiencing their seasonal ice break up during
early May, the favored warmer than normal temperatures may accelerate snow =
and
ice melt and raises concern for river flooding and ice jams during the peri=
od,
prompting a slight risk of much above-normal temperatures over the western
Mainland.  This is supported by both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools wh=
ich
depict increased chances for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile
throughout the period. Across the southeast interior, significant snowmelt =
is
anticipated this week, which may trigger localized flooding particularly fo=
r
low lying areas where drainage remains frozen. Of note, Fairbanks has
registered the 4th largest snow depth on record to date. For precipitation,
reforecast tools also show increased chances for 3-day precipitation amount=
s
also exceeding the 85th percentile across the Southeast associated with the
forecast onshore flow, however actual totals are not expected to reach haza=
rd
thresholds resulting in no corresponding hazards.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
254 PM EDT Mon Apr 25 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 28 2022 - 12Z Mon May 2 2022

19Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in above average
agreement across the continental U.S. through Friday, with the
best agreement noted with the closed low off the Northeast U.S.
coast, and the shortwave exiting the Rockies and crossing the
Plains for the end of the week.  By early Saturday, the 12Z CMC is
much less amplified with the shortwave reaching the Pacific
Northwest, and the prior 00Z run is preferred over the 12Z run.
The UKMET has now trended closer to the consensus and not as far
north with the surface low across the north-central U.S. for this
weekend.  There has been a slight westward trend and increase in
the axis of heaviest QPF across the Dakotas compared to the
overnight issuance, with some potential for a change to snow
across western portions of the Dakotas before the event ends, so
this is something that will continue to be monitored closely.  The
previous forecast discussion is appended below for reference.
/Hamrick
------------------------

...Overview...

A mean trough axis initially near the West Coast as the medium
range period begins Thursday will push eastward through the rest
of this week, potentially forming a closed upper low over the
north-central U.S. over the weekend. A surface low is likely to
consolidate in conjunction with the trough/low, spreading rain to
much of the central U.S. while snow is forecast on the backside of
the low across the northern Rockies with some chance of wintry
weather spreading into the northern High Plains as well, although
the details of precipitation amounts and placement remain
uncertain at this point. Meanwhile, surface and upper lows will
move slowly away from the Northeast over the weekend after
spreading some light to moderate rain and snow across the area for
the latter part of the week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a slow-moving
low pressure system (both in the upper levels and at the surface)
over the Canadian Maritimes through the weekend. There is also
good agreement on the broad ridge over the central U.S. Thursday
narrowing and becoming suppressed Friday into the weekend as
western troughing comes in, though with various details on
embedded shortwaves tracking through the overall ridge pattern.
The more uncertain part of the forecast lies in the upper trough
over the western U.S. Thursday pushing eastward with time. Recent
model guidance is in somewhat better agreement than a day or so
ago though, with a general consensus for shortwave energy to
consolidate within the trough and form an upper low by the weekend
in the north-central CONUS. There are still some differences
particularly with the latitudinal position of the upper low. With
the 12/18Z cycle, it appeared the the 12Z GFS was a bit south of
consensus by around Saturday so preferred the 18Z GFS instead that
was better clustered, but some newer 00Z guidance (particularly
the CMC) came in farther south. Similar north-south spread was
seen with the surface low positions through the weekend, with even
more divergence in position by Monday depending on how the upper
low may lift and/or weaken. Upstream of these features, models are
even less agreeable with the pattern--the ECMWF and CMC runs have
shown a strong shortwave somewhere in the Northwest by early
Sunday whereas GFS runs have been weaker with that energy, and the
ECMWF/CMC are also quite strong with possibly a larger closed low
in the eastern Pacific by Monday with the GFS runs showing a
different pattern.

The WPC forecast was based on a multi-model blend of deterministic
12/18Z guidance favoring the ECMWF early in the period, gradually
transitioning to a blend including the ensemble means
(particularly the EC mean) as spread and uncertainty increased
considerably. The results were pretty similar to the previous
forecast through Sunday.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The northeastern U.S. could receive multiple rounds of
precipitation through much of the week as the upper level and
surface lows pivot and linger over the area. Periods of
precipitation should generally be light to moderate; amounts will
add up over time but still are not expected to be too hazardous.
Higher elevations of New England may see snow during the night but
mixing with rain during the day. Some rain is likely in the
central U.S. on Thursday, which should increase in coverage and
amounts Friday over northern/central parts of the Plains as the
main upper trough exits the Rockies and consolidates a low
pressure system in the central U.S. Conditions will likely be cold
enough for snow in the northern Rockies on the backside of the
surface low, and there is once again some threat of wintry
precipitation spreading into the northern High Plains as well. In
portions of the Dakotas, precipitation may begin as rain and
transition to mixed precipitation or snow. However, the exact
details of these threats may not be determined for a few more days
given continued model uncertainty. By the weekend, the current
expectation is that rain will spread into the East and could
linger over the southern Plains as the front there may stall.

The northeastern quadrant of the U.S. can expect cooler than
normal temperatures by around 10-15 degrees on Thursday with a few
daily record lows possible, but temperatures there should
gradually moderate closer to normal by the weekend and early next
week. But below average temperatures especially in terms of highs
will be reinforced with the incoming trough/low across the
north-central U.S., with highs potentially around 15-25F below
normal through much of the medium range period. Meanwhile the Four
Corners states to the central/southern High Plains will see warmer
than normal temperatures especially Thursday and Friday before the
upper ridge promoting the warmth is suppressed over the weekend.
Slightly above normal temperatures should then stretch across much
of the southern tier.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon April 25 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 01 - 05 2022

The major longwave features during the 6-10 day period are forecast to be a
continuation of positive 500-hPa height anomalies at the higher latitudes o=
f
the Northern Hemisphere and anomalous troughing extending from Alaska
southward
to near the West Coast. A negative Arctic Oscillation (AO) is likely to
persist
through the beginning of May. Temperature tools are generally consistent wi=
th
a
composite derived from a negative AO during La Nina. Above-normal temperatu=
res
are favored for much of the western CONUS and across the southern tier of t=
he
CONUS, along and south of the 40th parallel. The largest probabilities of
above
normal temperatures are forecast for the southern Great Plains and Southeas=
t
where maximum temperature anomalies are likely to be 5 to 10 degrees F abov=
e
normal on days 6 and 7. Conversely, anomalous cold is forecast to be greate=
st
in magnitude across the north-central CONUS where below-normal temperatures
are
favored. Probabilities for below normal temperatures are slightly elevated =
for
the Pacific Northwest, northern California, and parts of New England, based=
 on
a consensus of temperature tools and continuity from the previous day.

On days 6 and 7 (May 1-2), a low pressure system and trailing front are
forecast to progress eastward from the Mississippi Valley to the East Coast=
.
Later in the 6-10 day period, the upstream 500-hPa trough is expected to
promote the development of another low pressure system across the central
CONUS. These low pressure systems support increased probabilities of
above-normal precipitation throughout the central and eastern CONUS. Enhanc=
ed
onshore flow, associated with a 500-hPa trough, favors above-normal
precipitation across the Pacific Northwest, northern California, and the
northern Rockies.  Below-normal precipitation is most likely across the
central
to southern Rockies and parts of the Southwest which are expected to be awa=
y
from the prevailing storm track.

Enhanced onshore flow elevates probabilities for above normal precipitation
over the Alaska Panhandle and southern Mainland Alaska. Below normal 500-hP=
a
heights along with periods of precipitation favor below-normal temperatures
for
the Alaska Panhandle and parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska. Despite
below-normal 500-hPa heights throughout Alaska, reforecast temperature tool=
s
are in good agreement for increased probabilities of above-normal temperatu=
res
across western and northern Mainland Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the tools and an amplified longwave pattern at the hig=
her
latitudes of North America.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 03 - 09 2022

The GFS and ECMWF ensemble means are in good agreement and depict short
wavelengths in the longwave pattern which is typical for early May. These
model
solutions, for the 7-day period, feature a 500-hPa trough over the
northeastern
Pacific and a persistent trough near the East Coast. Along and to the west =
of
this trough axis, below-normal temperatures are favored for parts of the
Northeast, Corn Belt, Great Lakes, and Middle to Upper Mississippi Valley. =
Due
to the absence of any predicted cold air advection and above normal 500-hPa
heights, increased probabilities for above-normal temperatures are forecast
from the Southwest and southern Great Plains eastward to areas near the Gul=
f
Coast. Predicted periods of precipitation and increased likelihood of enhan=
ced
cloudiness with onshore flow slightly favor below normal temperatures acros=
s
the Pacific Northwest.

An amplified 500-hPa trough upstream over the northeastern Pacific is likel=
y
to
promote multiple low pressure systems tracking across the central and easte=
rn
CONUS, favoring near to above-normal precipitation for these areas. However=
,
probabilities for above-normal precipitation are tempered due to uncertaint=
y
in
the exact tracks of the low pressure systems. Due to persistent onshore flo=
w,
above-normal precipitation is also favored for the Pacific Northwest, north=
ern
Rockies, and parts of northern California. Precipitation tools are in good
agreement for elevated probabilities for below normal precipitation across =
the
Four Corners region but the Desert Southwest was not included due to its dr=
y
climatology.

The 500-hPa height pattern over the northern Pacific and Alaska is quite
persistent from the 6-10 to 8-14 day period. Therefore, the temperature and
precipitation outlooks are similar. The enhanced onshore flow is likely to
promote a relatively wet pattern for much of Alaska during early May.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the precipitation tools offset by more uncertainty later in
week-2 as ensemble spread increases.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

...There is a Marginal Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts

on Tuesday...

...There is a Marginal Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts
across parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and southern/eastern
Texas through Tuesday morning and over parts of extreme southern
Texas on Wednesday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees below average over parts
of the Upper Midwest...

A front extending from the Lower Great Lakes southwestward to the
Central/Western Gulf Coast will move off the East Coast by
Wednesday. The boundary will destabilize the atmosphere from the
Lower Great Lakes to the Central/Western Gulf Coast. Therefore,
the SPC has issued a Marginal Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and southern/eastern Texas
through Tuesday morning.

The showers and thunderstorms will produce heavy rain along the
associated front on Monday evening. Therefore, the WPC has issued
a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms
along the front through over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley
and southern/eastern Texas through Tuesday morning. The associated
heavy rain will create localized areas of flash flooding,
affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.

In contrast, high pressure over Central Canada will funnel cold
air over the Upper Midwest, producing temperatures 10 to 25
degrees below average. The temperatures will begin to moderate on
Tuesday. Along with the cold, light snow lingers over parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes through Tuesday
evening. On Wednesday, light snow showers move to the Lower Great
Lakes.

The showers and thunderstorms will move southern Mid-Atlantic to
the Central Gulf Coast on Tuesday. As a result, the threat of
severe thunderstorms moves to the region as well as the SPC has
issued a Marginal Risk over the southern Mid-Atlantic.

Meanwhile, a front over the Pacific Northwest will move inland to
the Northern Rockies/Great Basin by Wednesday afternoon. The
system will produce rain and the highest elevation snow over parts
of the Northwest, extending into the Northern Rockies through
Tuesday. The rain and higher elevation snow will be diurnally
driven over the area on Wednesday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE NORTHERN TEXAS PANHANDLE INTO
WESTERN KANSAS...

Added a Critical delineation for portions of the northern Texas
Panhandle into western Kansas. Winds are expected to be 20 to 25 mph
across this region with relative humidity in the upper teens. Some
guidance suggests relative humidity below 15 percent during the late
afternoon. However, even if relative humidity stays in the upper
teens, extremely dry fuels are still present across the area and
thus, the Critical area seems justified.

..Bentley.. 04/25/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0122 AM CDT Mon Apr 25 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will increase on Tuesday for portions of the
southern to central High Plains as a dry return flow regime becomes
established. Zonal flow is expected to increase over the central
Rockies through the day Tuesday, resulting in a deepening lee trough
across the central High Plains. Despite strengthening southerly
flow, moisture return is expected to be minimal after Monday's
frontal intrusion to the northwestern Gulf Coast. Consequently,
dry/windy conditions are expected that will support increasing fire
weather concerns across the Plains.

...Southern to Central High Plains...
Upper-level ridging will likely yield mostly clear skies across the
Plains on Tuesday. The diurnal warming of an antecedent dry air mass
will support deep boundary-layer mixing and widespread RH reductions
to 20-25% by mid to late afternoon. Sustained pressure-gradient
winds near 20 mph will likely see frequent gusts to 25-35 mph from
west TX into southern NE. Ensemble consensus suggests that a broad
swath of elevated conditions is likely, but drier members hint that
critical conditions are possible across northeast NM and the OK/TX
Panhandles into western KS where RH may fall below 15%. Regardless,
fire weather concerns are expected given receptive fuels (ERC values
above the 90th percentile) across most of the region. A Critical
risk area and an expansion of the Elevated risk may be warranted if
guidance continues to trend towards the drier solutions.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
441 PM EDT Mon Apr 25 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 28 2022 - 12Z Mon May 02 2022

19Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in above average
agreement across the continental U.S. through Friday, with the
best agreement noted with the closed low off the Northeast U.S.
coast, and the shortwave exiting the Rockies and crossing the
Plains for the end of the week.  By early Saturday, the 12Z CMC is
much less amplified with the shortwave reaching the Pacific
Northwest, and the prior 00Z run is preferred over the 12Z run.
The UKMET has now trended closer to the consensus and not as far
north with the surface low across the north-central U.S. for this
weekend.  There has been a slight westward trend and increase in
the axis of heaviest QPF across the Dakotas compared to the
overnight issuance, with some potential for a change to snow
across western portions of the Dakotas before the event ends, so
this is something that will continue to be monitored closely.  The
previous forecast discussion is appended below for reference.
/Hamrick
------------------------

...Overview...

A mean trough axis initially near the West Coast as the medium
range period begins Thursday will push eastward through the rest
of this week, potentially forming a closed upper low over the
north-central U.S. over the weekend. A surface low is likely to
consolidate in conjunction with the trough/low, spreading rain to
much of the central U.S. while snow is forecast on the backside of
the low across the northern Rockies with some chance of wintry
weather spreading into the northern High Plains as well, although
the details of precipitation amounts and placement remain
uncertain at this point. Meanwhile, surface and upper lows will
move slowly away from the Northeast over the weekend after
spreading some light to moderate rain and snow across the area for
the latter part of the week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a slow-moving
low pressure system (both in the upper levels and at the surface)
over the Canadian Maritimes through the weekend. There is also
good agreement on the broad ridge over the central U.S. Thursday
narrowing and becoming suppressed Friday into the weekend as
western troughing comes in, though with various details on
embedded shortwaves tracking through the overall ridge pattern.
The more uncertain part of the forecast lies in the upper trough
over the western U.S. Thursday pushing eastward with time. Recent
model guidance is in somewhat better agreement than a day or so
ago though, with a general consensus for shortwave energy to
consolidate within the trough and form an upper low by the weekend
in the north-central CONUS. There are still some differences
particularly with the latitudinal position of the upper low. With
the 12/18Z cycle, it appeared the the 12Z GFS was a bit south of
consensus by around Saturday so preferred the 18Z GFS instead that
was better clustered, but some newer 00Z guidance (particularly
the CMC) came in farther south. Similar north-south spread was
seen with the surface low positions through the weekend, with even
more divergence in position by Monday depending on how the upper
low may lift and/or weaken. Upstream of these features, models are
even less agreeable with the pattern--the ECMWF and CMC runs have
shown a strong shortwave somewhere in the Northwest by early
Sunday whereas GFS runs have been weaker with that energy, and the
ECMWF/CMC are also quite strong with possibly a larger closed low
in the eastern Pacific by Monday with the GFS runs showing a
different pattern.

The WPC forecast was based on a multi-model blend of deterministic
12/18Z guidance favoring the ECMWF early in the period, gradually
transitioning to a blend including the ensemble means
(particularly the EC mean) as spread and uncertainty increased
considerably. The results were pretty similar to the previous
forecast through Sunday.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The northeastern U.S. could receive multiple rounds of
precipitation through much of the week as the upper level and
surface lows pivot and linger over the area. Periods of
precipitation should generally be light to moderate; amounts will
add up over time but still are not expected to be too hazardous.
Higher elevations of New England may see snow during the night but
mixing with rain during the day. Some rain is likely in the
central U.S. on Thursday, which should increase in coverage and
amounts Friday over northern/central parts of the Plains as the
main upper trough exits the Rockies and consolidates a low
pressure system in the central U.S. Conditions will likely be cold
enough for snow in the northern Rockies on the backside of the
surface low, and there is once again some threat of wintry
precipitation spreading into the northern High Plains as well. In
portions of the Dakotas, precipitation may begin as rain and
transition to mixed precipitation or snow. However, the exact
details of these threats may not be determined for a few more days
given continued model uncertainty. By the weekend, the current
expectation is that rain will spread into the East and could
linger over the southern Plains as the front there may stall.

The northeastern quadrant of the U.S. can expect cooler than
normal temperatures by around 10-15 degrees on Thursday with a few
daily record lows possible, but temperatures there should
gradually moderate closer to normal by the weekend and early next
week. But below average temperatures especially in terms of highs
will be reinforced with the incoming trough/low across the
north-central U.S., with highs potentially around 15-25F below
normal through much of the medium range period. Meanwhile the Four
Corners states to the central/southern High Plains will see warmer
than normal temperatures especially Thursday and Friday before the
upper ridge promoting the warmth is suppressed over the weekend.
Slightly above normal temperatures should then stretch across much
of the southern tier.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
441 PM EDT Mon Apr 25 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 28 2022 - 12Z Mon May 02 2022

19Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in above average
agreement across the continental U.S. through Friday, with the
best agreement noted with the closed low off the Northeast U.S.
coast, and the shortwave exiting the Rockies and crossing the
Plains for the end of the week.  By early Saturday, the 12Z CMC is
much less amplified with the shortwave reaching the Pacific
Northwest, and the prior 00Z run is preferred over the 12Z run.
The UKMET has now trended closer to the consensus and not as far
north with the surface low across the north-central U.S. for this
weekend.  There has been a slight westward trend and increase in
the axis of heaviest QPF across the Dakotas compared to the
overnight issuance, with some potential for a change to snow
across western portions of the Dakotas before the event ends, so
this is something that will continue to be monitored closely.  The
previous forecast discussion is appended below for reference.
/Hamrick
------------------------

...Overview...

A mean trough axis initially near the West Coast as the medium
range period begins Thursday will push eastward through the rest
of this week, potentially forming a closed upper low over the
north-central U.S. over the weekend. A surface low is likely to
consolidate in conjunction with the trough/low, spreading rain to
much of the central U.S. while snow is forecast on the backside of
the low across the northern Rockies with some chance of wintry
weather spreading into the northern High Plains as well, although
the details of precipitation amounts and placement remain
uncertain at this point. Meanwhile, surface and upper lows will
move slowly away from the Northeast over the weekend after
spreading some light to moderate rain and snow across the area for
the latter part of the week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a slow-moving
low pressure system (both in the upper levels and at the surface)
over the Canadian Maritimes through the weekend. There is also
good agreement on the broad ridge over the central U.S. Thursday
narrowing and becoming suppressed Friday into the weekend as
western troughing comes in, though with various details on
embedded shortwaves tracking through the overall ridge pattern.
The more uncertain part of the forecast lies in the upper trough
over the western U.S. Thursday pushing eastward with time. Recent
model guidance is in somewhat better agreement than a day or so
ago though, with a general consensus for shortwave energy to
consolidate within the trough and form an upper low by the weekend
in the north-central CONUS. There are still some differences
particularly with the latitudinal position of the upper low. With
the 12/18Z cycle, it appeared the the 12Z GFS was a bit south of
consensus by around Saturday so preferred the 18Z GFS instead that
was better clustered, but some newer 00Z guidance (particularly
the CMC) came in farther south. Similar north-south spread was
seen with the surface low positions through the weekend, with even
more divergence in position by Monday depending on how the upper
low may lift and/or weaken. Upstream of these features, models are
even less agreeable with the pattern--the ECMWF and CMC runs have
shown a strong shortwave somewhere in the Northwest by early
Sunday whereas GFS runs have been weaker with that energy, and the
ECMWF/CMC are also quite strong with possibly a larger closed low
in the eastern Pacific by Monday with the GFS runs showing a
different pattern.

The WPC forecast was based on a multi-model blend of deterministic
12/18Z guidance favoring the ECMWF early in the period, gradually
transitioning to a blend including the ensemble means
(particularly the EC mean) as spread and uncertainty increased
considerably. The results were pretty similar to the previous
forecast through Sunday.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The northeastern U.S. could receive multiple rounds of
precipitation through much of the week as the upper level and
surface lows pivot and linger over the area. Periods of
precipitation should generally be light to moderate; amounts will
add up over time but still are not expected to be too hazardous.
Higher elevations of New England may see snow during the night but
mixing with rain during the day. Some rain is likely in the
central U.S. on Thursday, which should increase in coverage and
amounts Friday over northern/central parts of the Plains as the
main upper trough exits the Rockies and consolidates a low
pressure system in the central U.S. Conditions will likely be cold
enough for snow in the northern Rockies on the backside of the
surface low, and there is once again some threat of wintry
precipitation spreading into the northern High Plains as well. In
portions of the Dakotas, precipitation may begin as rain and
transition to mixed precipitation or snow. However, the exact
details of these threats may not be determined for a few more days
given continued model uncertainty. By the weekend, the current
expectation is that rain will spread into the East and could
linger over the southern Plains as the front there may stall.

The northeastern quadrant of the U.S. can expect cooler than
normal temperatures by around 10-15 degrees on Thursday with a few
daily record lows possible, but temperatures there should
gradually moderate closer to normal by the weekend and early next
week. But below average temperatures especially in terms of highs
will be reinforced with the incoming trough/low across the
north-central U.S., with highs potentially around 15-25F below
normal through much of the medium range period. Meanwhile the Four
Corners states to the central/southern High Plains will see warmer
than normal temperatures especially Thursday and Friday before the
upper ridge promoting the warmth is suppressed over the weekend.
Slightly above normal temperatures should then stretch across much
of the southern tier.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE NORTHERN TEXAS PANHANDLE INTO
PARTS OF WESTERN KANSAS...

...Synopsis...
A large-scale ridge and modest midlevel westerly flow will cross the
Rockies, while surface high pressure moves eastward from the central
Plains into the Middle MS Valley. As a result, dry/breezy southerly
return flow will become established across the central and southern
High Plains -- where critically dry fuels exist.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
Southerly return flow will strengthen across the central and
southern High Plains, though boundary-layer moisture will generally
remain limited. Downslope warming/drying combined with diurnal
heating of a dry antecedent airmass will result in 15-20 percent
minimum RH. The warm/dry boundary-layer conditions coupled with
20-30 mph sustained southerly surface winds (gusts upwards of 40
mph) will support enhanced fire-weather conditions. The best overlap
of strong/gusty surface winds and low RH will develop from the
northern TX Panhandle northeastward into parts of western KS --
where Critical highlights remain in place. Very dry fuels (90th+
percentile ERCs) across this region will further exacerbate the
wildfire-spread threat.

Farther west, enhanced fire-weather conditions will also be possible
in the San Luis Valley, however, these conditions are too localized
for highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Tue Apr 26 2022

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
A deamplifying shortwave trough and enhanced west-southwesterly flow
aloft will overspread the Southwest, encouraging the development of
a diffuse dryline over eastern NM.

...Southwest...
Above average temperatures across the Southwest (behind the dryline)
will favor deep boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced
west-southwesterly flow aloft. As a result, minimum RH will drop
into the single digits to lower/middle teens amid sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph. These conditions,
combined with modestly receptive fuels across the region will lead
to elevated fire-weather conditions across portions of eastern AZ
into western NM. Any localized critical conditions that develop
should be confined to terrain-favored areas -- precluding the
introduction of Critical highlights.

While enhanced fire-weather conditions may briefly develop over
parts of northern NM into southern CO (particularly the San Luis
Valley), the localized nature of these conditions coupled with light
rainfall casts uncertainty on the overall fire-weather threat.
Therefore, no highlights have been added here, though trends will be
monitored.

Extended Forecast Discussion

259 AM EDT Tue Apr 26 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 29 2022 - 12Z Tue May 03 2022

...Overview...

An upper trough with its axis over the Intermountain West as the
medium range period begins Friday will push eastward into the
north-central U.S. through the weekend as it forms a closed upper
low. A surface low is likely to consolidate in conjunction with
the trough/low, spreading rain to much of the central U.S. while
snow is forecast on the backside of the low across the northern
Rockies with some chance of wintry weather spreading into the
northern High Plains as well, although the details of
precipitation amounts and placement remain uncertain at this
point. Meanwhile, surface and upper lows will move slowly away
from the Northeast over the weekend after spreading some light to
moderate rain and snow across the area for the latter part of the
week. Periodic unsettled weather is expected in the West as a
series of upper troughs and frontal systems move through.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a low pressure
system (both in the upper levels and at the surface) moving slowly
over the Canadian Maritimes through the weekend. Additionally,
models have generally converged on a solution with a trough
initially across the Intermountain West developing into a closed
low as it moves over the central/northern Plains and Midwest over
the weekend, but with still some slight wiggles in latitudinal
position. The associated surface low track is fairly agreeable as
well, with the ECMWF perhaps on the western side and GFS runs on
the southeastern side of the spread in terms of the 12/18Z cycle,
but within typical medium range spread. The newer 00Z ECWMF and
GFS show good clustering with the low through at least Sunday.
There is also better consensus in recent guidance for the upper
low to weaken and lift into Canada early next week. The early part
of the WPC forecast was based mainly on a blend of the 18Z GFS and
12Z ECMWF and UKMET.

Upstream, most guidance has an additional trough/low approaching
and entering the Northwest over the weekend. The major outlier
with this feature was the 12Z CMC, which has a much weaker
shortwave and thus by around Sunday-Monday produces a pattern
rather out of phase with other guidance, with strong ridging in
the West. The newer 00Z CMC came in closer to consensus with this
feature. But deterministic models as well as ensemble members show
differences in handling that shortwave Monday and beyond as well
as what could be strong energy coming in behind it. Thus the WPC
forecast phased in the ensemble means by the latter part of the
forecast period given the differences, particularly favoring the
12Z EC and CMC ensemble means that were pretty agreeable with a
slightly slower trough in the West compared to the GEFS mean.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The surface low pressure system will spread precipitation across
much of the central U.S. late this week that should spread into
the East over the weekend. Precipitation totals are likely to be
enhanced across northern/central parts of the Plains near the
consolidating surface low. Conditions will likely be cold enough
for snow in the northern Rockies on the backside of the low, and
there is once again some threat of wintry precipitation spreading
into the northern High Plains as well. In portions of the Dakotas,
precipitation may begin as rain and transition to mixed
precipitation or snow, though details of these threats remain
somewhat uncertain. Additionally, rain could become heavy to
locally excessive from parts of the Plains into the
Mississippi/Ohio Valleys for the latter part of this week.
Precipitation chances are expected to spread eastward into early
next week as the low slowly moves east, but linger in the central
U.S. as well as the front there may stall. Elsewhere, rounds of
light to moderate precipitation (snow in the higher elevations and
rain in the lower elevations) are forecast across the Northwest as
a series of fronts cross the region along with upper-level energy.
The Northeast could see lingering precipitation late this week
before the coastal surface low and upper low pull away.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and cooler than
average in the southern tier. The northeastern quadrant of the
country can expect below average temperatures by 5-15F on Friday
but moderating near normal by early next week. Highs will remain
colder than normal by around 15-25F across the north-central U.S.
underneath upper troughing. Meanwhile, the central/southern High
Plains should see warmer than normal temperatures by up to 20F on
Friday before the upper ridge promoting the warmth is suppressed
over the weekend. Slightly above normal temperatures should then
stretch across much of the southern tier.

259 AM EDT Tue Apr 26 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 29 2022 - 12Z Tue May 03 2022

...Overview...

An upper trough with its axis over the Intermountain West as the
medium range period begins Friday will push eastward into the
north-central U.S. through the weekend as it forms a closed upper
low. A surface low is likely to consolidate in conjunction with
the trough/low, spreading rain to much of the central U.S. while
snow is forecast on the backside of the low across the northern
Rockies with some chance of wintry weather spreading into the
northern High Plains as well, although the details of
precipitation amounts and placement remain uncertain at this
point. Meanwhile, surface and upper lows will move slowly away
from the Northeast over the weekend after spreading some light to
moderate rain and snow across the area for the latter part of the
week. Periodic unsettled weather is expected in the West as a
series of upper troughs and frontal systems move through.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a low pressure
system (both in the upper levels and at the surface) moving slowly
over the Canadian Maritimes through the weekend. Additionally,
models have generally converged on a solution with a trough
initially across the Intermountain West developing into a closed
low as it moves over the central/northern Plains and Midwest over
the weekend, but with still some slight wiggles in latitudinal
position. The associated surface low track is fairly agreeable as
well, with the ECMWF perhaps on the western side and GFS runs on
the southeastern side of the spread in terms of the 12/18Z cycle,
but within typical medium range spread. The newer 00Z ECWMF and
GFS show good clustering with the low through at least Sunday.
There is also better consensus in recent guidance for the upper
low to weaken and lift into Canada early next week. The early part
of the WPC forecast was based mainly on a blend of the 18Z GFS and
12Z ECMWF and UKMET.

Upstream, most guidance has an additional trough/low approaching
and entering the Northwest over the weekend. The major outlier
with this feature was the 12Z CMC, which has a much weaker
shortwave and thus by around Sunday-Monday produces a pattern
rather out of phase with other guidance, with strong ridging in
the West. The newer 00Z CMC came in closer to consensus with this
feature. But deterministic models as well as ensemble members show
differences in handling that shortwave Monday and beyond as well
as what could be strong energy coming in behind it. Thus the WPC
forecast phased in the ensemble means by the latter part of the
forecast period given the differences, particularly favoring the
12Z EC and CMC ensemble means that were pretty agreeable with a
slightly slower trough in the West compared to the GEFS mean.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The surface low pressure system will spread precipitation across
much of the central U.S. late this week that should spread into
the East over the weekend. Precipitation totals are likely to be
enhanced across northern/central parts of the Plains near the
consolidating surface low. Conditions will likely be cold enough
for snow in the northern Rockies on the backside of the low, and
there is once again some threat of wintry precipitation spreading
into the northern High Plains as well. In portions of the Dakotas,
precipitation may begin as rain and transition to mixed
precipitation or snow, though details of these threats remain
somewhat uncertain. Additionally, rain could become heavy to
locally excessive from parts of the Plains into the
Mississippi/Ohio Valleys for the latter part of this week.
Precipitation chances are expected to spread eastward into early
next week as the low slowly moves east, but linger in the central
U.S. as well as the front there may stall. Elsewhere, rounds of
light to moderate precipitation (snow in the higher elevations and
rain in the lower elevations) are forecast across the Northwest as
a series of fronts cross the region along with upper-level energy.
The Northeast could see lingering precipitation late this week
before the coastal surface low and upper low pull away.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and cooler than
average in the southern tier. The northeastern quadrant of the
country can expect below average temperatures by 5-15F on Friday
but moderating near normal by early next week. Highs will remain
colder than normal by around 15-25F across the north-central U.S.
underneath upper troughing. Meanwhile, the central/southern High
Plains should see warmer than normal temperatures by up to 20F on
Friday before the upper ridge promoting the warmth is suppressed
over the weekend. Slightly above normal temperatures should then
stretch across much of the southern tier.

...Showers and thunderstorms expected along the East Coast and
South Texas today near a progressing cold front...

...Developing low pressure system to impact New England with rain
and higher elevation snow beginning tonight...

...Well below average temperatures forecast between the northern
Plains and Northeast over the next several days...

Unsettled weather is forecast to continue sliding eastward today
along a cold front currently stretching from the Interior
Northeast to the central Gulf Coast and South Texas. The cold
front is expected to reach off the East Coast by Tuesday night,
but linger near far southern Texas. As it does so, a few
developing thunderstorms could turn severe across the Southeast
and southern Mid-Atlantic. The Storm Prediction center has issued
a Marginal Risk (level 1/5) of severe thunderstorms from portions
of southeast Virginia to east-central Georgia. Thunderstorms here
may produce isolated damaging wind gusts and some hail into early
this evening. Slow-moving thunderstorms may also lead to isolated
instances of flash flooding throughout far southern Texas, where a
Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of excessive rainfall is in effect.

By tonight, an area of low pressure forming along the
aforementioned cold front is forecast to strengthen and swing
northeast toward coastal New England. Areas of light-to-moderate
rainfall will impact parts of southern New England into early
Wednesday morning as a result. The low pressure system is then
expected to reduce forward motion and occlude near the Gulf of
Maine, while continuing to strengthen as a closed upper-level low
approaches from the west. Widespread showers will overspread
northern New England, with rain changing to snow across the higher
terrain and parts of northern Maine. The greatest snowfall amounts
through Thursday (up to around 4 inches) is most likely to occur
across northern Maine.

Elsewhere, relatively light precipitation will be found across the
northern Great Basin and northern Rockies today as a weak cold
front traverses the region. For the central U.S., active weather
returns along a stationary front on Wednesday with the threat of
isolated severe thunderstorms and flash floods. A Marginal Risk of
severe weather exists from western Kansas to the southern High
Plains, where damaging wind gusts and large hail are the primary
severe threats. A few instances of flash flooding cannot be ruled
out farther northeast from eastern Kansas to far western Missouri
as slow-moving thunderstorms develop over the region Wednesday
night. The isolated threat of flash flooding will also linger into
Thursday across similar areas due unsettled weather remaining near
the meandering frontal boundary extending across the
Mid-Mississippi Valley into the central Plains.

Temperatures through Thursday will remain below average across the
northern Plains, Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast as the
previously mentioned low pressure system near Maine and strong
high pressure building into the Upper Great Lakes provides
continuous chilly northwest winds. Highs will struggle to reach
above freezing today from northern North Dakota to the U.P. of
Michigan. This equates to around 25 degrees below average. A few
daily low temperature records could fall across the Midwest and
Great Lakes both this morning and Wednesday morning. Meanwhile,
low temperatures into the 30s and upper 20s will create
frost/freeze concerns throughout the Midwest, Mid-Mississippi
Valley, and central Plains today. The frost/freeze threat will
gradually shift eastward on Wednesday and Thursday, spreading into
the Ohio Valley and northern Mid-Atlantic. Conversely, above
average temperatures will hang on for one more day across the
southern Mid-Atlantic ahead of the approaching cold front. Warm
temperatures underneath a building upper-level ridge will spread
from the Southwest to the central Plains by midweek, where highs
could reach into 80s and low 90s.

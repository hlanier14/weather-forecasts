Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1028 AM CST Thu Jan 06 2022

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 01/06/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CST Thu Jan 06 2022/

...Synopsis...
Strong mid-level flow will begin to slowly lift away from the
central CONUS through the forecast period as troughing over the Ohio
valley shifts eastward and subtropical ridging strengthens across
the Southwest. At the surface, Arctic high pressure in the wake of
the cold front accelerating toward the GOM will bring much colder
temperatures to central and southern parts of the country. The cold
and stable conditions at the surface should result in very little
overlap with strong winds despite dry conditions. As such, fire
weather concerns appear very low through the forecast period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1247 PM CST Thu Jan 06 2022

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track. Locally elevated conditions are most
probable in portions of east-central New Mexico.

..Wendt.. 01/06/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CST Thu Jan 06 2022/

...Synopsis...
The general flow pattern aloft across the CONUS will remain active
with troughing over the East followed by shortwave ridging and a
secondary trough across the West. The shortwave ridge will undergo
amplification through the day as it shifts over the Southwest and
southern High Plains. The surface high is forecast to move east
allowing westerly surface flow to develop across the southern High
Plains later in the afternoon. The cold, but dry airmass may support
a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions as
temperatures begin to recover.

...Southern High Plains...
As low-level pressure gradients begin to pickup with the eastward
shift of the surface high pressure over the Southeastern US,
west/southwesterly winds will increase off of the higher terrain
across portions of eastern NM and into the western TX Panhandle.
Hampered somewhat by the northward retreating mid-level flow,
surface winds will likely struggle to reach near 15 mph. The airmass
across the Plains should warm fairly quickly despite the burst of
Arctic air following the cold front several days prior. Fuels remain
very dry, and surface humidity values of 15-25% appear plausible by
late afternoon given downslope drying and warming of the already dry
airmass. A few hours of locally elevated fire weather potential may
develop where winds can reach near 15 mph. However, confidence in
the spatial coverage of this is low.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
152 PM EST Thu Jan 06 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Jan 09 2022 - 12Z Thu Jan 13 2022

...General Pattern Overview...

An amplified upper flow regime will prevail from the weekend into
early next week with a ridge over parts of the western U.S. north
into Canada and a deep upper trough crossing the eastern half of
the country.  Guidance has been suggesting that a developing split
flow pattern from the eastern Pacific into the West will decrease
predictability of forecast details--including leading energy that
may reach over or near the Southwest in the form of a
trough/embedded low, upstream Pacific energy, and northern stream
impulses carried along into cyclonic flow that may linger over the
eastern U.S.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

For the most part guidance has remained consistent and agreeable
with the deep upper trough crossing the East along with the
leading cold front expected to clear most of the East Coast by
early Sunday.  The same is true for the upper ridge building into
the West Sunday-Monday.  Models and ensembles continue to vary for
the specifics of splitting Pacific energy early next week.  Latest
trends seem to be favoring a moderately south and slow upper low
scenario, with this feature still near Baja California into day 6
Wednesday (making Wed's 12Z ECMWF look like an open/fast extreme).
 The upper low/trough may finally get kicked out by Thursday as
additional Pacific energy approaches.  However this latter energy
has considerable uncertainty with a lot of model/ensemble spread
and the overall means showing another ridge building over the West
Coast at that time.  Guidance also diverges for shortwave details
within the progressive northern stream flow from the Pacific,
around/through the western U.S./Canada ridge, and east-southeast
through Canada and the lower 48.  Confidence in any specific
solution is minimal.

The updated forecast used an operational model blend for the first
half of the period and then incorporated some 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF
mean input.  This approach reflected consensus early in the period
and then the most common ideas later on while becoming
conservative with specifics given the increasing guidance spread.

...Hazards/Sensible Weather Highlights...

Rain and thunderstorms likely to be in progress ahead of a Great
Lakes to Southern Plains cold front as of early Sunday should
continue to spread eastward during the day and into Sunday night.
Expect the highest rainfall totals to be over portions of the
South/Tennessee Valley/southern Mid-Atlantic, where some heavier
activity may be possible.  Localized flooding could be within the
realm of possibility where the most intense rainfall coincides
with areas that have seen well above average precipitation
recently.  Amounts will be lighter over the northern half of the
East.  Areas from the upper Great Lakes to the Northeast could see
wintry weather, with the best snowfall prospects over Michigan and
northern New York as a result of lake effect snow.  Freezing rain
and/or sleet may be among the hazards over and near parts of the
northern half of the Appalachians for a time as moisture overruns
cold air at the surface.  Elsewhere the main areas of
precipitation should be over the Pacific Northwest as one or more
systems brush the region as they weaken, and over the Southwest
into Southern Plains in association with the upper low/trough
currently forecast to be around the Southwest/Baja California into
midweek.  Coverage and amounts for this latter area will depend on
uncertain details for the upper system.

The next blast of arctic air will make its presence known across
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest by Sunday in the wake of the
strong cold front with temperatures 10-25F below normal.  The cold
weather will eventually reach the East Coast in modified form by
Tuesday, bringing highs down to 10-25F or so below normal from the
Mid-Atlantic through New England for one of the coldest days of
the season thus far.  It should still be rather mild across the
South ahead of the front on Sunday followed by a colder trend.
The central U.S. will see a pronounced warming trend next week
with expanding coverage of max/min temperatures 10-20F above
normal Tuesday onward with some locally warmer readings possible
on some days.  Expect most of the West to see temperatures within
10F on either side of normal through the period.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Pacific Northwest through Friday morning...
...Heavy Snow for the Central Appalachians and the Northeast Coast
on Monday; Heavy Snow for the Cascades/Northern Rockies...
...Heavy lake effect snow for the area around the east coast of
Lake Michigan...
...Temperatures will be 20 to 30 degrees below average over the
Northern/Central Plains and Upper /Middle Mississippi Valley...

On Thursday evening, a wave of low pressure over the Southeast
will move northeastward off the Mid-Atlantic Coast by Friday
morning.  The system will produce heavy snow from parts of the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys into the Central Appalachians overnight
Thursday into early Friday morning.  The low moves northeastward
just off the Northeast Coast on Friday before moving into the
Canadian Maritimes by Friday evening.  The storm will produce
heavy snow along the New England Coast on Friday morning into late
afternoon.  The combination of snow and ice may cause hazardous
road conditions through Friday morning in this region.

Furthermore, upper-level energy and cold air moving over Lake
Michigan will produce heavy lake effect snow along most of Lake
Michigan's east coast, ending overnight Friday.  The snow will
result in reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions.

Meanwhile, a plume of moisture off the Pacific and upper-level
energy will produce rain and higher elevation snow over the
Pacific Northwest and snow into the Northern Rockies.  The rain
will be heavy at times.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Pacific Northwest
through Friday morning.  The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable through Friday morning.  The
excessive rainfall threat ends on Friday over the Northwest.
However, heavy snow will also develop over the highest elevations
of the Cascades and the Northern Rockies ending by Saturday
morning, with much lighter snow falling after then.

Moreover, cold high pressure over the Northern Plains will move
southeastward to the Mid-Atlantic by Saturday.  The associated
clear skies and calm winds will allow the temperatures to become
20 to 30 degrees below average over the Northern/Central Plains
and Upper /Middle Mississippi Valley.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
321 PM EST Thu Jan 06 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Jan 09 2022 - 12Z Thu Jan 13 2022

...General Pattern Overview...

An amplified upper flow regime will prevail from the weekend into
early next week with a ridge over parts of the western U.S. north
into Canada and a deep upper trough crossing the eastern half of
the country.  Guidance has been suggesting that a developing split
flow pattern from the eastern Pacific into the West will decrease
predictability of forecast details--including leading energy that
may reach over or near the Southwest in the form of a
trough/embedded low, upstream Pacific energy, and northern stream
impulses carried along into cyclonic flow that may linger over the
eastern U.S.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

For the most part guidance has remained consistent and agreeable
with the deep upper trough crossing the East along with the
leading cold front expected to clear most of the East Coast by
early Sunday.  The same is true for the upper ridge building into
the West Sunday-Monday.  Models and ensembles continue to vary for
the specifics of splitting Pacific energy early next week.  Latest
trends seem to be favoring a moderately south and slow upper low
scenario, with this feature still near Baja California into day 6
Wednesday (making Wed's 12Z ECMWF look like an open/fast extreme).
 The upper low/trough may finally get kicked out by Thursday as
additional Pacific energy approaches.  However this latter energy
has considerable uncertainty with a lot of model/ensemble spread
and the overall means showing another ridge building over the West
Coast at that time.  Guidance also diverges for shortwave details
within the progressive northern stream flow from the Pacific,
around/through the western U.S./Canada ridge, and east-southeast
through Canada and the lower 48.  Confidence in any specific
solution is minimal.

The updated forecast used an operational model blend for the first
half of the period and then incorporated some 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF
mean input.  This approach reflected consensus early in the period
and then the most common ideas later on while becoming
conservative with specifics given the increasing guidance spread.

...Hazards/Sensible Weather Highlights...

Rain and thunderstorms likely to be in progress ahead of a Great
Lakes to Southern Plains cold front as of early Sunday should
continue to spread eastward during the day and into Sunday night.
Expect the highest rainfall totals to be over portions of the
South/Tennessee Valley/southern Mid-Atlantic, where some heavier
activity may be possible.  Localized flooding could be within the
realm of possibility where the most intense rainfall coincides
with areas that have seen well above average precipitation
recently.  Amounts will be lighter over the northern half of the
East.  Areas from the upper Great Lakes to the Northeast could see
wintry weather, with the best snowfall prospects over Michigan and
northern New York as a result of lake effect snow.  Freezing rain
and/or sleet may be among the hazards over and near parts of the
northern half of the Appalachians for a time as moisture overruns
cold air at the surface.  Elsewhere the main areas of
precipitation should be over the Pacific Northwest as one or more
systems brush the region as they weaken, and over the Southwest
into Southern Plains in association with the upper low/trough
currently forecast to be around the Southwest/Baja California into
midweek.  Coverage and amounts for this latter area will depend on
uncertain details for the upper system.

The next blast of arctic air will make its presence known across
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest by Sunday in the wake of the
strong cold front with temperatures 10-25F below normal.  The cold
weather will eventually reach the East Coast in modified form by
Tuesday, bringing highs down to 10-25F or so below normal from the
Mid-Atlantic through New England for one of the coldest days of
the season thus far.  It should still be rather mild across the
South ahead of the front on Sunday followed by a colder trend.
The central U.S. will see a pronounced warming trend next week
with expanding coverage of max/min temperatures 10-20F above
normal Tuesday onward with some locally warmer readings possible
on some days.  Expect most of the West to see temperatures within
10F on either side of normal through the period.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 AM EST Fri Jan 07 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Jan 10 2022 - 12Z Fri Jan 14 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin on Monday with an amplified
upper flow pattern with a trough stemming southward from a deep
upper low over east-central Canada and ridging across the western
U.S. and Canada. A split flow pattern is likely to develop across
the eastern Pacific and West, as a southern stream low drops
southward just west of California through the early part of the
workweek. Meanwhile in the East, the pattern may deamplify
somewhat but rounds of shortwave energy will likely track through
the broader trough axis.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Reasonably good predictability exists early in the period as model
guidance has remained consistent and agreeable with the deep upper
trough across the East and ridging across the West. Guidance from
the 12Z/18Z (yesterday) cycle also agrees fairly well with the
existence of energy dropping southward through the Pacific and
forming a closed southern southern stream upper low, with
generally similar timing to the previous forecast cycle with it
migrating slowly and staying west of Baja California through early
Wednesday. The incoming 00Z model guidance also shows a similar
idea, though the 00Z CMC has the low staying open for longer. The
upper low/trough may finally get kicked out by Thursday as
additional Pacific energy approaches. However, the evolution of
this energy and additional narrow ridging coming in behind remain
uncertain with quite a bit of ensemble spread, though the recent
GEFS and EC ensemble means do show hints of this shortwave energy
now. At this point, the 12Z ECMWF and CMC and the 18Z GFS (rather
than the 12Z GFS) seemed to have the best agreement with these
features, but with low confidence. Additionally, northern stream
impulses moving through the mean cyclonic flow in the East show
some differences in strength and position especially during the
second half of the week.

Thus for the WPC medium range forecast, used a blend of the
deterministic 12Z ECMWF/CMC and 18Z GFS for the early part of the
period, then phased in some 18Z GEFS and 00Z EC ensemble mean
gradually to about 40% (60% operational models) by the end of the
period. This served to minimize individual forecast differences
but maintain some strength of systems, and provided good
continuity with the previous forecast on days 3-6.

...Weather Highlights...

Drier conditions are likely over much of the contiguous U.S. for
the early part of next workweek as large surface highs influence
the Intermountain West to the central U.S. behind a cold front.
Showers could linger over Florida on Monday as the front passes
through, while generally westerly flow causes lake effect snow
downwind of the Great Lakes especially on Monday, but with the
possibility for additional rounds as the week progresses. The
Pacific Northwest should see periods of precipitation as fronts
approach the area, with higher totals over typical upslope areas
of the Olympics and Cascades. Then moisture may spread ahead of
the upper low in the eastern Pacific into the Southwest.
Precipitation totals are expected to be light in the Southwest,
but could increase into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley by Wednesday and Thursday as the low tracks eastward and
also draws moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. However, confidence
in the details of rainfall amounts is somewhat low and will likely
be refined in future forecast updates.

The next round of arctic air will be in place across the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest on Monday, with temperatures of 10-25F
below normal and maximum temperatures staying below 0F in some
areas. By Tuesday this chilly air will spread into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic in modified form, with high temperatures
10-30F below average for one of the coldest days of the season
thus far. Then, te central U.S. will see a pronounced warming
trend next week with expanding coverage of max/min temperatures
10-20F above normal Tuesday onward with some locally warmer
readings possible on some days. Expect most of the West to see
temperatures within 10F on either side of normal through the
period.

...Quick hitting Nor'easter to bring disruptive snowfall to parts
of the Northeast and New England today...

...Heavy mountain snow and gusty winds to impact the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies to end the workweek...

...Dangerously cold temperatures located throughout the Northern
Plains and Midwest this morning to briefly retreat on Saturday,
before the next surge of arctic air enters the region on Sunday...

An area of low pressure currently off the Mid-Atlantic coastline
is forecast to zip northeastward today and exit into the Canadian
Maritimes by tonight. Snowfall will quickly come to an end early
this morning over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with
moderate-to-heavy snow remaining a possibility into the afternoon
hours across coastal New England. Total snowfall amounts of 4 to 8
inches are expected over eastern Connecticut, Rhode Island,
eastern Massachusetts, and coastal sections of Maine. Locally
higher amounts are possible under narrow intense bands of snow,
which can also create dangerous travel conditions. Winter Storm
Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories are in effect. Immediately
behind this system, cold and blustery conditions are expected
throughout the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. With the
Great Lakes still mostly free of ice, scattered lake effect snow
bands are likely to form and extend into the Interior Northeast
through tonight.

After a stretch of very active and wintry weather across the
Northwest, one final surge of moisture is forecast to impact the
region this morning while also dumping heavy mountain snow across
the Northern Rockies. Additional snowfall amounts up to 1-2 feet
are possible throughout the high terrain, which will exacerbate
the already growing concerns for avalanches. Winter Storm and
Avalanche Warnings are in effect. Additionally, as a cold front
traverses the region, gusty winds up to 60 mph are expected
throughout the Northwest, Northern Great Basin, and Northern
Rockies today. These potent wind gusts could lead to blowing and
drifting snow over parts of northwestern Montana, where Blizzard
Warnings are in effect. The weather pattern should drastically
quiet down by Saturday across this part of the Nation.

Otherwise, a bitterly cold airmass is centered over the
north-central U.S. this morning as subzero temperatures are felt
as far south as central Illinois. Combined with a light breeze,
widespread wind chill values across the Northern Plains and
Midwest are in the minus 20s as residents start off their Friday.
As a strong area of high pressure slides to the East Coast on
Saturday, it will usher in warm southerly winds to the Central
U.S. on Saturday. This will help return temperatures to slightly
above average. However, this brief warm up will be short-lived as
another arctic cold front surges southward across the Northern
Plains Saturday afternoon and enters the Midwest by Sunday
morning. Light rain showers and pockets of freezing rain/drizzle
are possible along and ahead of this cold front. The best chances
for light freezing rain exist from the Mid-Mississippi Valley and
Midwest on Saturday to the northern Mid-Atlantic by Sunday
morning. Farther south, the aforementioned cold front may spark
scattered thunderstorms over the Lower Mississippi Valley as it
clashes with a warm and moist airmass flowing out of the Gulf of
Mexico. A few thunderstorms could turn severe over southeast
Texas, with isolated tornadoes and damaging wind gusts the main
concern. A few areas of heavy rain may also produce isolated
flooding concerns throughout the Mid-South on Saturday as
precipitation falls over areas that have already experienced a wet
start to the year.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CST Fri Jan 07 2022

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude midlevel trough and accompanying speed maximum will
advance east-southeastward from the Pacific Northwest toward the
northern Rockies and adjacent Plains during the Day 1 period. Along
the southern periphery of the midlevel speed maximum, enhanced
downslope flow will favor lee troughing along the central and
southern High Plains -- where modest boundary-layer warming and
drying will occur during the afternoon.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
Westerly surface winds will strengthen this afternoon across parts
of the central and southern High Plains in response to the
sharpening lee trough. Downslope-related warming and drying combined
with diurnal heating will support minimum RH values of 15-25 percent
from the Colorado Front Range southward through east-central New
Mexico. The best overlap of low RH and breezy westerly surface winds
will likely occur across terrain-favored areas of southern Colorado
and east-central New Mexico, where a few hours of locally elevated
fire-weather conditions will be possible. Presently, these
conditions appear too localized to introduce highlights, though
trends will be monitored.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0209 AM CST Fri Jan 07 2022

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad large-scale troughing will persist across the western CONUS,
with enhanced west-southwesterly downslope flow supporting the
maintenance of a lee trough across the central and southern High
Plains. An embedded midlevel speed maximum will track
east-southeastward through the base of the large-scale trough,
resulting in the development of a surface low over the southern High
Plains. South of the surface low, breezy surface winds will overlap
dry boundary-layer conditions, yielding a few hours of elevated
fire-weather conditions across the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
West-southwesterly surface winds will gradually strengthen across
the southern High Plains in response to the developing surface low
over the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles. Here, downslope warming and
drying combined with diurnal heating will support RH values of 15-25
percent with 20-25 mph west-southwesterly surface winds. These
meteorological conditions combined with seasonably dry fuels will
favor a few hours of elevated fire-weather conditions during the
afternoon hours.

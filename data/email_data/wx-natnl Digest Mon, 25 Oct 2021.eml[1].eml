Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Sun Oct 24 2021

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

No changes have been made to the Elevated area. Late-morning surface
observations show sustained winds approaching 20 mph from
east-central NM into the TX South Plains, with RH values dropping to
20-25%. Further warming/drying will result in elevated fire-weather
conditions for a few hours this afternoon, though winds will tend to
decrease with time from west to east as the primary midlevel
shortwave trough and surface low move away from the region. See the
previous discussion below for more information.

..Dean.. 10/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0114 AM CDT Sun Oct 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface low/dryline will move
eastward across the central CONUS today as a more pronounced upper
trough deepens across the West. Behind the dryline bulge, 15 mph
west-southwesterly surface winds coinciding with 15-20% RH are
expected for at least a few hours during the afternoon. Given
multiple preceding days of dry and windy conditions, with no
appreciable rainfall accumulations, finer fuels should be primed
enough to support some grass-fire spread, warranting the
continuation of Elevated highlights across parts of the southern
High Plains.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0115 AM CDT Sun Oct 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
Rapid intensification of surface lee-troughing is expected across
much of the High Plains as a potent mid-level trough traverses the
interior West and impinges on the Plains states tomorrow. 15-20 mph
sustained southerly surface winds amid 15-25% RH are likely across
portions of the Colorado Front Range and points southward during the
afternoon. Elevated highlights have been added where the most
favorable surface wind/RH overlap is expected to occur, and where
finer fuels will be most receptive to wildfire spread.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/runoff threat from the
Midwest/Southeast Thursday to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into next
weekend...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

As one deep cyclone exits the Northeast to start the period on
Wednesday, the next one will be spinning up over the southern
Plains, keeping the weather pattern quite active across the
eastern half of the nation into next weekend. Guidance continues
to trend less progressive and more amplified with this system as
it tracks from the Southern Plains into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
by next weekend. The latest models actually now show much better
agreement on the evolution/track of this system overall,
bolstering forecast confidence, with a possible southern stream
closed low and deep associated surface low. Lingering
uncertainties remain in the details however, especially late
period. The ECMWF/ECMWF ensembles continues to be slightly
south/less progressive than the rest of the global guidance, but
the trend has been to the south so the ECMWF is not unreasonable.
Well upstream, a favorable shortwave and upper jet pattern back
into the Pacific Northwest mid-late week will foster another
multi-day threat for heavy rain/mountain snows for the Northwest.
Guidance shows reasonable agreement with this setup, though timing
and strength differences arise once the system moves inland across
the northern Rockies and into the northern Plains next weekend.

Accordingly overall, a blend of the ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean
along with WPC continuity and the National Blend of Models was
primarily used to produce the WPC product suite.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The bulk of the rainfall on the backside of the low exiting the
Northeast should push offshore Wednesday, but some lingering
wrapback activity will remain possible across New England.

The biggest weather threat during the medium range period will be
with a deep low pressure system working across the central to
eastern U.S. later this week that is slated to slowly lift into
the Northeast into next weekend. Ample Gulf of Mexico moisture
ahead of this system will present a protracted rainfall/convective
focus with widespread moderate to locally heavy rains possible.
The Storm Prediction Center also is highlighting the potential for
severe weather across the central Gulf Coast. Closed upper low
development and a slowed frontal system progression will allow
rainfall to expand into the Ohio Valley/Appalachians then
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into next weekend as aided by Atlantic
moisture feed. Repeat/duration activity and favored terrain lift
will focus the runoff threat.

Out West, shortwave energies progressing entering the Northwest
mid to late this week will direct a plume of moisture to support
another round of heavy rain/mountain snows to mainly parts of the
Pacific Northwest, but also farther inland across the northern
Rockies. Conditions should finally dry out by next weekend as
upper ridging works into the region.

Extended Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Wed Oct 27 2021 - 12Z Sun Oct 31 2021

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/runoff threat from the
Midwest/Southeast Thursday to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into next
weekend...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

As one deep cyclone exits the Northeast to start the period on
Wednesday, the next one will be spinning up over the southern
Plains, keeping the weather pattern quite active across the
eastern half of the nation into next weekend. Guidance continues
to trend less progressive and more amplified with this system as
it tracks from the Southern Plains into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
by next weekend. The latest models actually now show much better
agreement on the evolution/track of this system overall,
bolstering forecast confidence, with a possible southern stream
closed low and deep associated surface low. Lingering
uncertainties remain in the details however, especially late
period. The ECMWF/ECMWF ensembles continues to be slightly
south/less progressive than the rest of the global guidance, but
the trend has been to the south so the ECMWF is not unreasonable.
Well upstream, a favorable shortwave and upper jet pattern back
into the Pacific Northwest mid-late week will foster another
multi-day threat for heavy rain/mountain snows for the Northwest.
Guidance shows reasonable agreement with this setup, though timing
and strength differences arise once the system moves inland across
the northern Rockies and into the northern Plains next weekend.

Accordingly overall, a blend of the ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean
along with WPC continuity and the National Blend of Models was
primarily used to produce the WPC product suite.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The bulk of the rainfall on the backside of the low exiting the
Northeast should push offshore Wednesday, but some lingering
wrapback activity will remain possible across New England.

The biggest weather threat during the medium range period will be
with a deep low pressure system working across the central to
eastern U.S. later this week that is slated to slowly lift into

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun October 24 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
20071014 - 20081004 - 20051025 - 19631107 - 19841010

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
406 PM EDT Sun Oct 24 2021

Valid 00Z Mon Oct 25 2021 - 00Z Wed Oct 27 2021

...There is a High Risk of excessive rainfall over the Sierra
Nevada Mountains and a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over
the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys through Monday morning...

...Heavy snow for the Sierra Nevada Mountains...

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Middle/Lower Mississippi and Ohio Valleys through Monday
morning...

A strong storm just west of the Pacific Northwest Coast will
impact the West Coast over the next several days.  Strong onshore
flow will stream moisture into Northern/Central California,
producing heavy rain and snow over parts of California. Therefore,
the WPC has issued a High Risk of excessive rainfall over the
Sierra Nevada Mountains through Monday morning.  Significant and
potentially life-threatening flash flooding flash is expected with
the storm. Some areas that normally do not experience flash
flooding will flood. Heavy snow is also forecast for the Sierra
Nevada Mountains through late Monday afternoon.  The excessive
rainfall threat lessens to a Slight Risk over parts of the Sierra
Nevada Mountains with a Marginal Risk over other parts of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains and parts of the Southern California Coast
from Monday into Tuesday morning.  The excessive rainfall threat
ends on Tuesday for California.

Moreover, rain and highest elevation snow will develop over parts
of the Pacific Northwest into the Northern Intermountain Region
and continue into Monday. On Monday, after the front passes, the
snow levels will lower over the Northwest portion of the country.
On Tuesday, rain and higher elevation snow move into the Rockies,
with rain developing over parts of the Northern/Central High
Plains by Tuesday evening.

Meanwhile, an area of low pressure over the Central Plains and
associated front will interact with moisture flowing northward
over the Plains/Mississippi Valley to produce showers and
thunderstorms over the region through Monday afternoon, with some
storms becoming severe.  Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Middle/Lower
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys through Monday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Furthermore,
there is a 10% or greater probability of EF2-EF5 tornadoes over
parts of the region and a 10% or greater probability of wind gust
of 65 knots or greater.  Additionally, there is a 10% or greater
probability of two-inch or great hail over parts of northeastern
Missouri through Monday morning. However, the severe thunderstorm
threat is not the only threat over the Midwest.  Heavy rain will
develop along the front, therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate
Risk of excessive rainfall with the rain and thunderstorms over
parts of the Ohio Valley through Monday Morning. The associated
heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash flooding.
Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger
rivers.

As the system moves eastward, the risk of severe thunderstorms
weakens slightly to a Slight Risk over parts of the Mid-Atlantic
and the Central/Southern Appalachians on Monday.  Also, rain will
develop over parts of the Great Lakes Sunday evening into Monday.
The rain moves into parts of the Northeast early on Monday.  On
Tuesday morning, the area of low pressure moves to the northern
Mid-Atlantic Coast and off the New England Coast by Tuesday
evening. Overnight Monday into Tuesday, the low aids in streaming
moisture into the Northeast, producing heavy rain. Therefore, the
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with the rain.
The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of
flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the
most vulnerable starting on Tuesday and going through Tuesday
night.

Lastly, the front associated with the Pacific Northwest system
moves out of the Rockies and onto the Plains by Tuesday evening.
The system will produce rain and thunderstorms over the Plains on
Tuesday evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 AM CDT Mon Oct 25 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
Surface lee-troughing will intensify across the High Plains as a
well-defined mid-level trough impinges on the central CONUS today.
Initially dry southerly flow will dominate the southern into central
High Plains. Latest guidance consensus depicts 15 mph sustained
southerly winds overlapping with 15-20% RH across far southeast
Colorado into northeast New Mexico and western portions of the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles. With fine (grass-based) fuels anticipated
to be at least modestly receptive to fire spread, Elevated
highlights have been maintained. Locally Critical conditions may
also briefly occur over terrain-favoring areas in northeast New
Mexico by afternoon peak heating.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/runoff threat from the
Midwest/Southeast Thursday to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into next
weekend...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A deep cyclone lifting from the Mississippi Valley to the
Northeast this weekend will keep much of the medium range quite
active. The guidance with this system continues to show good
agreement on the large scale evolution/track, increasing
confidence a bit, but do offer some uncertainties in the details,
which may take until the short range to resolve. A general model
blend seemed a good starting point for this system, maintaining
good continuity with the previous shift. This system may threaten
October low pressure records across parts of the mid-Mississippi
to Ohio Valley.

Elsewhere, the last couple of model runs show the next trough
moving towards the West Coast by the middle of this week may split
sending a northern stream shortwave across the northern Rockies
and northern Plains into next weekend. The guidance has trended
more north and stronger with this system suggesting the Northeast
U.S. low may eventually get wrapped up into this system late
period. The last few model runs hint at a possible southern stream
upper low near California next Sat-Mon, but the ensembles offer
plenty of uncertainty on whether this feature even exists at all.

This cycle of the WPC medium range progs used a blend of the
deterministic models days 3-4 transitioning towards and almost
equal weighting of the GFS/ECMWF with the GEFS/ECENS means by day
7. This helps to mitigate the late period differences.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The biggest weather threat during the medium range period will be
the deep low pressure system working across the eastern third of
the U.S. later this week into next weekend bringing widespread
moderate to locally heavy rains. Closed upper low development and
a slowed frontal system progression will allow rainfall to expand
across the Ohio Valley/Appalachians/Southeast later this week then
the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into next weekend as aided by a
sustained Atlantic moisture feed. Repeat/duration activity and
favored orographic lift should focus a possible flood/runoff
threat for parts of the central Appalachians.

Out West, shortwave energy progressing towards the West Coast will
direct a plume of moisture to support another round of heavy
rain/mountain snows to mainly parts of the Pacific Northwest, but
also farther inland across the northern Rockies on Thursday into
Friday. Conditions should finally dry out by next weekend though
as upper ridging builds over the region.

For temperatures, the Midwest/South to the East Coast should
remain near or more likely below normal through much of the period
underneath cloudy and unstable skies. Humidity levels though
should allow overnight mins to be more above normal. Behind this,
upper ridging shifts across the central U.S. bringing a period of
above normal (+5-10F) days before the next shortwave moderates
temperatures back towards or even below normal. Out West,
temperatures should generally stay within a few degrees on either
side of normal.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST COLORADO AND
SOUTHWEST KANSAS INTO THE OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS PANHANDLES...

...Synopsis...
A surface low will rapidly deepen across the central High Plains as
a highly amplified mid-level trough ejects into the central U.S.
tomorrow/Tuesday. A narrow but focused corridor of very dry and
windy conditions are expected behind a sharpening dryline across the
central and southern High Plains, where multiple preceding days of
dry conditions should have sufficiently cured fine fuels to support
grass-fire spread. 15-25 mph sustained southerly flow amid 15-20% RH
behind the dryline warranted the introduction of Elevated highlights
across much of the central into southern High Plains. In addition,
Critical highlights were introduced to parts of southeast Colorado,
southwest Kansas, and the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles, where the
latest guidance consensus depicts widespread sustained 20-25 mph
southerly winds. However, multiple guidance members suggest much of
west Texas to northeast Colorado/northwest Kansas may also
experience overlapping Critical winds/RH, and the current Critical
highlights may need to be expanded farther north and south pending
continued favorable trends and consistency among guidance members.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over the Sierra
Nevada Mountains and coastal New England...

...Heavy snow for the Sierra Nevada Mountains...

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central/Southern Plains on Tuesday; there's a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms for much of the Mid-Atlantic today...

Heavy rain and snow is forecast to continue impacting the West
coast as a powerful low pressure system churns its way through the
West over the next day or so. Heavy rain is still likely across
lowland parts of the Sierra Mountains and Pacific Northwest, as
this atmospheric river event begins to wind down. Between 1-3
inches of rainfall is possible over the central California portion
of the Sierra, with isolated higher amounts possible. A Slight
Risk of Flash Flooding is in effect due to the terrain involvement
as well as already saturated soils from the recent precipitation.
Heavy snow is also expected over the higher elevations of the
central California Sierra, where between 1-2 feet with isolated
higher amounts, are possible today. Many of the highest Rocky
Mountain peaks will pick up several inches of snow today as the
cold front moves through the region. A cool Pacific air mass will
settle over the West over the next couple of days as high pressure
builds across the region.

Meanwhile, rain and scattered thunderstorms are forecast to spread
into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast out ahead of a low pressure
system currently gliding across the Midwest. A Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms was issued by the Storm Prediction Center
over much of the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Ohio Valley for
today due to increased instability across the region. Damaging
wind gusts appear to be the main concern associated with this
severe weather threat, but a brief tornado or two are also
possible in eastern Ohio/western West Virginia. Rainfall will
focus the most over southern/coastal New England over the next two
days leading to a Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall leading to
Flash Flooding for this area, particularly on Tuesday when this
rain event will have entered its second day. Rainfall totals are
forecast to be between 1-3 inches, with higher amounts possible
along coastal Massachusetts. Temperatures will rise into the 70s
and 80s across much of the East Coast before dropping behind the
cold frontal passage on Tuesday.

Temperatures are expected to climb to above average highs today
along the foothills of the Rockies today as the deep upper trough
associated with the potent Pacific system pulls warm southern air
as far north as Montana. As the Pacific system emerges from the
Rockies on Tuesday, it will bring with it an influx of moisture
and instability to the Southern/Central Plains. This will lead to
scattered thunderstorms and the threat of severe weather. An
Enhanced Risk of Severe Thunderstorms is in effect for a swath
stretching from northern Texas to southern Kansas where a dry line
may setup. An MCS may develop toward Tuesday evening in this area
while this environment may also be conducive to supercells and
large hail greater than 2 inches possible.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1117 AM CDT Wed Apr 07 2021

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...

The previous forecast remains generally on track. One notable change
was the introduction of an elevated risk area across the central
Dakotas. To the west/northwest of the cloud shield, humidity values
are falling into the 30-40% range with winds between 10-20 mph noted
along the edge of the cloud shield. Humidity should continue to
decline to 20-25% as clouds remain just to the east for most of the
day, and recent ensemble guidance has shown higher probabilities for
sustained 15+ mph winds (which is supported by recent obs).

Elsewhere, only minor adjustments were needed based on trends in
observations and morning guidance. See the discussion below for
additional details.

..Moore.. 04/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0218 AM CDT Wed Apr 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will slow its progression today as it reaches
the Lower Missouri Valley. In the Northwest, an upper-level trough
will reach portions of the Northern Rockies. At the surface a cold
front will continue southward through Texas to near the Gulf coast
with the deepening of the Midwest cyclone. Another cyclone is
forecast to develop in the lee of the Canadian Rockies.

...New Mexico into western Texas...
With the surface low continuing to become further removed from the
region during the day, the potential for widespread critical fire
weather will be low. However, a very deep boundary layer will
develop by afternoon and mix strong winds to the surface across
portions of central New Mexico. Here, RH of 5-15% will overlap with
20 mph surface winds. In southern New Mexico, the RH could be even
lower, though winds will be lighter with the mid-level jet to the
north. Farther east into Texas, RH will be 10-25% with winds
generally in the 15-20 mph range. Locally elevated conditions could
occur as far east as portions of central Texas. Stronger winds will
be displaced to the north, however, and fuels are less receptive
that far east.

...North-central Montana...
15-25% RH is possible during the afternoon in the lee of the
Rockies. Winds could approach 20 mph in some locations as the
surface low deepens across the Canadian border. The spatial extent
of the dry/windy conditions will not be overly large, but recent
large fire activity suggests there is enough concern for elevated
highlights.

...Central North Dakota...
The deepening surface low in western/central Iowa will drive
enhanced northeasterly winds across portions of eastern and central
North Dakota. Mid and upper-level clouds will likely be present. A
narrow region of 20-25% RH is possible along the back edge of the
cloud shield. Given recent fire activity, fine fuels will carry
fire. Confidence in the duration of 15-20 mph winds is too low for
highlights, but locally elevated conditions do appear possible.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and means continue to show a blocky pattern covering
portions of North America into the Atlantic, with upper ridging
likely from eastern Canada through southern Greenland while a
couple of upper lows/surface systems head into the Great Lakes and
another upper low meanders near the Canadian Maritimes. Farther
west, as ridging builds into western Canada (consistent with
teleconnections relative to the eastern Canada/southern Greenland
ridge as well as the Pacific trough to the west) solutions
continue to diverge by early-mid week for possible western U.S.
troughing.

During the weekend there is good agreement in principle that a
compact Midwest into Great Lakes shortwave/upper low will promote
fairly strong and concentrated surface low development from the
Mississippi Valley into Great Lakes. There is still some spread
for track though. The front anchored by this low should continue
across the East with embedded low pressure continuing over the
western Atlantic. After this, a majority of guidance including the
ensemble means would have a larger scale shortwave reaching into
western North America by early Saturday, leading to an upper low
that crosses the northern tier states and eventually reaches the
Great Lakes by next Tuesday. The corresponding surface low would
bring another frontal system across the lower 48 during the
weekend and the first half of next week. Both upper lows exhibit
some sensitivity in terms of whether they stay in the Great Lakes
region or some/all of their energy may get carried farther
eastward by more progressive mean flow to the south. Some recent
GFS/CMC runs have tended to be the solutions exhibiting the latter
idea while their ensemble means have been holding back closer to
the ECMWF.  On the other hand, the means could be lagging the
models in their depiction of the Canadian Maritimes upper low.
Confidence is low for precise movement of this low, with the
GFS/CMC actually bringing it back to or near New England by next
Wednesday versus remaining guidance that is farther east.

As for the western troughing, teleconnections relative to the
strong positive height anomalies over or just east of eastern
Canada continue to support the more modest depictions of the
GEFS/ECMWF/CMC means versus the deeper trough and embedded closed
low scenario that the GFS has been showing over the past couple
days and now joined by the 00Z CMC.

A general model blend served as a solid starting point for days
3-5 where large scale agreement is good. Thereafter, trended
towards the means while still incorporating about a third of the
ECMWF which seemed best in line with the ensembles. This approach
maintains excellent continuity with previous WPC continuity.
Uncertainty, especially past day 5 is low to average at best given
the possibility for pattern change should the guidance start
clustering towards any of the current minority ideas.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

During the weekend expect the strengthening Mississippi Valley
into Great Lakes system and its associated fronts to focus areas
of moderate to heavy rainfall over portions of the eastern U.S.
Heaviest rain should be over and near the central and eastern Gulf
Coast, with a severe weather threat too as highlighted by the
Storm Prediction Center convective outlook for Saturday from the
Florida Panhandle into central Georgia. Significant rain could
also be possible closer to the upper/surface low in the Upper
Great Lakes depending on training within any rain bands. The next
system emerging from the West will bring mostly light rain/higher
elevation snow to northern parts of that region and then some
rain/thunderstorms to the eastern half of the country but in most
cases with lighter amounts than expected for the preceding system.
Some more organized rains could also focus north of a trailing
frontal boundary from the Southern Plains to lower Mississippi
Valley/Gulf Coast. There is increased potential for another round
of moderate to heavy rainfall across parts of the central Gulf
Coast by next Tuesday-Wednesday. Some of the precipitation could
be in the form of snow over parts of the extreme northern tier
from late weekend into next week. During the early to middle part
of next week the combination of cyclonic flow aloft and low level
upslope flow could produce some precipitation over the
central/south-central Rockies, though with considerable
uncertainty over coverage and amounts.

Warm flow ahead of the developing storm tracking into the Great
Lakes this weekend will bring widespread lows of 10-20F or so
above normal over the East Saturday-Sunday and plus 10-25F
anomalies for highs in a more focused area from the Great
Lakes/Upper Ohio Valley into New England on Saturday. Temperatures
will drop to within a few degrees on either side of normal behind
this system's cold front. The next system initially coming into
western North America will spread below normal highs (minus 5-15F
anomalies) across the Northwest/northern Rockies during the
weekend and then into the central/east-central U.S. Monday into
Wednesday. Southern parts of the West will remain above normal
through the period and an upper ridge approaching from the Pacific
may expand coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs over
northern California and the Northwest early-mid week.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 07 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is anticipated to bring below normal
temperatures and potentially hazardous cold over many parts of the central =
and
southeastern lower 48. A surface low may form over the Northeast at the
beginning of the period, remaining throughout much of week-2, as well as a
stalled frontal boundary across the eastern lower 48, which could support
heavy
rainfall across the Gulf states. Mid-level high pressure forecast over west=
ern
North America is expected to promote unseasonably warm temperatures for the
western contiguous U.S., and a moderation of temperatures across much of
Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures over much of the central and
southeastern CONUS, Thu-Tue, Apr 15-20.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley
and the Southeast, Thu-Sat, Apr 15-17.

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 15 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 21: There continues to be relativel=
y
good agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble mean 500-hPa height
anomalies during week-2, with strong negative height departures over the
eastern half of North America. The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means indicate
positive mid-level height anomalies across the western half of North Americ=
a,
with the ECMWF anomalies being noticeably higher than the GEFS. As mid-leve=
l
shortwave troughing shifts across the eastern CONUS, cold air is anticipate=
d
to
spill southward from central Canada into the central CONUS at the beginning=
 of
the period, with the anomalous cold shifting southeastward by the middle of
the
period. With strong positive height departures continuing to be predicted b=
y
both models over the higher latitudes of eastern Canada, the overall mean
mid-level height pattern resembles the negative North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO) phase, which typically favors below-normal temperatures and above-nor=
mal
precipitation across many portions of the central and eastern CONUS during
April. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is highlighted over
much
of the central and southeastern CONUS, Apr 15 to 20, relatively similar to =
the
risk highlighted yesterday. This hazard region covers a broad area where th=
e
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and below freezing over =
the
Great Plains and Midwest early in the period, as well as parts of the South=
ern
Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southeas=
t,
where temperatures may fall below the lowest 15th percentile and 40 Deg F.
These areas further south are included in the risk due to the heightened
concern for near freezing temperature impacts to vulnerable emerging spring
vegetation. This anomalous cold signal is stronger in the ECMWF reforecast
tool
compared to the GEFS, with probabilities exceeding 30 to 40% for some of th=
e
highlighted risk areas of reaching the aforementioned thresholds.



Upstream, anomalous ridging continues to be favored by both the GEFS and EC=
MWF
across western North America, which is expected to promote unseasonably war=
m
temperatures for portions of the western CONUS. The ECMWF ensemble mean
indicates greater positive mid-level height departures compared to the GEFS
ensemble mean, similar to yesterday. However, the positive mid-level height
anomalies across the West are greater in today's outlook compared to yester=
day
in both models. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools both indicate at least =
a
20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 to =
95
Deg F. However, temperatures are not anticipated to reach triple digits,
precluding a much above normal temperature hazard from being posted at the
time. These anomalous warm temperatures could increase evapotranspiration,
which could worsen soil moisture conditions. This would especially be of
concern for areas currently experiencing severe drought.



Although there is good agreement between the multi-model ensembles with the
mid-level pattern aloft, there continues to be significant differences
regarding the potential for heavy precipitation between the models across t=
he
southern tier of the CONUS. Similar to yesterday, the ECMWF reforecast tool
indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding t=
he
85th percentile and one inch along the Gulf Coast. The GEFS reforecast tool
remains lackluster with this potential. Despite these model differences, th=
e
development of a stalled frontal boundary is possible early in the period, =
and
both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict mean surface low pressure and
southerly flow across the Gulf of Mexico to support enhanced precipitation
over
the southern U.S. Thus, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is maintained =
for
the Gulf States for Apr 15 to 17, as above-normal precipitation across the
Southeast is also historically consistent with the negative phase of the NA=
O
during April.



Across the Alaska region a transition from negative to positive mid-level
height departures are anticipated by the beginning of week-2. Although this
pattern change and the accompanying warmer temperatures are anticipated to
help
bring an end to cold spell forecast for much of the state during early Apri=
l,
all eyes are focused on any anomalous warm pattern that develops following =
the
predicted cold pattern over Alaska which may lead to accelerated snow and i=
ce
melt and increase the risk of localized flooding during river ice breakup
season. Based on the latest guidance, the greatest likelihood for above-nor=
mal
temperatures during week-2 now is across the northern Mainland. However,
temperatures in northern Alaska are expected to remain well below freezing
during week-2, and climatologically, river ice breakup in this region
typically
begins later in May.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 PM CDT Wed Apr 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

The elevated risk area across the Southwest has been expanded based
on recent trends in guidance and receptive fuels. Although
confidence in widespread critical conditions remains low due to a
somewhat unfavorable synoptic pattern, southern to central NM should
see the highest potential for periods of sustained winds over 20
mph. A critical risk area may be introduced if confidence continues
to increase in the wind forecast.

...Northern Plains...
Strong winds are expected behind a cold front that will begin
pushing southeastward across MT and into the western Dakotas through
the late afternoon and evening hours. Post-frontal humidity should
remain high enough to mitigate widespread fire weather concerns,
though localized elevated fire weather conditions are possible. The
lowest humidity will generally be ahead of the front across the
Dakotas where winds are expected to remain around 10-15 mph.

...Central High Plains...
Breezy northwesterly winds between 15-20 mph are expected across the
CO/NE/KS tri-state region. Downslope trajectories emanating from the
northern Rockies, along with clear skies, should allow for RH to
fall into the 15-25% range. Elevated, to locally critical,
meteorological conditions appear possible. However, MRMS estimates
show swaths of 0.1+ inch precipitation across this region over the
past 24 hours, which may have mitigated fuel readiness to some
degree. As a result, the fire weather threat will be conditional on
local fuel status. An elevated risk area may be needed in subsequent
updates if future reports suggest fuels are receptive despite the
recent rainfall.

..Moore.. 04/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0219 AM CDT Wed Apr 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will continue to pivot northward into the
upper Great Lakes region on Thursday. A trough upstream in the
northern Rockies will slide southeastward into the central Rockies
by the end of the forecast period. Moderate mid-level westerly winds
will exist across a broad swath of the southwestern U.S. At the
surface, a large surface trough will extend from the Midwestern low
westward to the Continental Divide. A cold front will begin to move
into the Great Basin with high pressure increasing across the
Pacific Northwest.

...Southwest into the Trans-Pecos...
Deep boundary-layer mixing will bring enhanced winds to the surface.
Most areas will see 15-20 mph, though a few areas of 20+ may occur.
RH will fall to 5-15%. Elevated fire weather is expected during the
afternoon. The lack of stronger flow aloft and a relatively weak
surface pressure pattern should keep critical conditions localized.

...Southern into eastern Utah...
A shortwave trough will approach from the northwest, though the
stronger winds associated with it will likely be displaced farther
northward during peak heating. Similarly, the front and increasing
surface pressure gradient will also not occur until the
evening/overnight. However, locally elevated to near critical
conditions are at least possible in these areas where fuels have
sufficiently cured.

...Santa Barbara/Ventura County Mountains...
High pressure off the West Coast will drive northerly winds into the
Transverse Ranges. 20-25 mph winds are possible in the higher
terrain with RH falling as low as 10-20% into Thursday evening. Lack
of precipitation over the past two weeks has allowed fuels to cure
with ERCs reaching above normal and relatively high for this time of
year. The locally elevated risk should remain confined to the higher
terrain.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and means continue to show a blocky pattern covering
portions of North America into the Atlantic, with upper ridging
likely from eastern Canada through southern Greenland while a
couple of upper lows/surface systems head into the Great Lakes and
another upper low meanders near the Canadian Maritimes. Farther
west, as ridging builds into western Canada (consistent with
teleconnections relative to the eastern Canada/southern Greenland
ridge as well as the Pacific trough to the west) solutions
continue to diverge by early-mid week for possible western U.S.
troughing.

During the weekend there is good agreement in principle that a
compact Midwest into Great Lakes shortwave/upper low will promote
fairly strong and concentrated surface low development from the
Mississippi Valley into Great Lakes. There is still some spread
for track though. The front anchored by this low should continue
across the East with embedded low pressure continuing over the
western Atlantic. After this, a majority of guidance including the
ensemble means would have a larger scale shortwave reaching into
western North America by early Saturday, leading to an upper low
that crosses the northern tier states and eventually reaches the
Great Lakes by next Tuesday. The corresponding surface low would
bring another frontal system across the lower 48 during the
weekend and the first half of next week. Both upper lows exhibit
some sensitivity in terms of whether they stay in the Great Lakes
region or some/all of their energy may get carried farther
eastward by more progressive mean flow to the south. Some recent
GFS/CMC runs have tended to be the solutions exhibiting the latter
idea while their ensemble means have been holding back closer to
the ECMWF.  On the other hand, the means could be lagging the
models in their depiction of the Canadian Maritimes upper low.
Confidence is low for precise movement of this low, with the
GFS/CMC actually bringing it back to or near New England by next
Wednesday versus remaining guidance that is farther east.

As for the western troughing, teleconnections relative to the
strong positive height anomalies over or just east of eastern
Canada continue to support the more modest depictions of the
GEFS/ECMWF/CMC means versus the deeper trough and embedded closed
low scenario that the GFS has been showing over the past couple
days and now joined by the 00Z CMC.

A general model blend served as a solid starting point for days
3-5 where large scale agreement is good. Thereafter, trended
towards the means while still incorporating about a third of the
ECMWF which seemed best in line with the ensembles. This approach
maintains excellent continuity with previous WPC continuity.
Uncertainty, especially past day 5 is low to average at best given
the possibility for pattern change should the guidance start
clustering towards any of the current minority ideas.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

During the weekend expect the strengthening Mississippi Valley
into Great Lakes system and its associated fronts to focus areas
of moderate to heavy rainfall over portions of the eastern U.S.
Heaviest rain should be over and near the central and eastern Gulf
Coast, with a severe weather threat too as highlighted by the
Storm Prediction Center convective outlook for Saturday from the
Florida Panhandle into central Georgia. Significant rain could
also be possible closer to the upper/surface low in the Upper
Great Lakes depending on training within any rain bands. The next
system emerging from the West will bring mostly light rain/higher
elevation snow to northern parts of that region and then some
rain/thunderstorms to the eastern half of the country but in most
cases with lighter amounts than expected for the preceding system.
Some more organized rains could also focus north of a trailing
frontal boundary from the Southern Plains to lower Mississippi
Valley/Gulf Coast. There is increased potential for another round
of moderate to heavy rainfall across parts of the central Gulf
Coast by next Tuesday-Wednesday. Some of the precipitation could
be in the form of snow over parts of the extreme northern tier
from late weekend into next week. During the early to middle part
of next week the combination of cyclonic flow aloft and low level
upslope flow could produce some precipitation over the
central/south-central Rockies, though with considerable
uncertainty over coverage and amounts.

Warm flow ahead of the developing storm tracking into the Great
Lakes this weekend will bring widespread lows of 10-20F or so
above normal over the East Saturday-Sunday and plus 10-25F
anomalies for highs in a more focused area from the Great
Lakes/Upper Ohio Valley into New England on Saturday. Temperatures
will drop to within a few degrees on either side of normal behind
this system's cold front. The next system initially coming into
western North America will spread below normal highs (minus 5-15F
anomalies) across the Northwest/northern Rockies during the
weekend and then into the central/east-central U.S. Monday into
Wednesday. Southern parts of the West will remain above normal
through the period and an upper ridge approaching from the Pacific
may expand coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs over
northern California and the Northwest early-mid week.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 13 - 17 2021

There is good agreement among the forecast guidance in the predicted 500-hP=
a
height and surface mean sea level pressure patterns across North America fo=
r
6-10 day period. Models agree well in predicting positive mid-level height
anomalies across much of Alaska and the northwestern CONUS. Negative 500-hP=
a
height anomalies are favored over most of the remainder of the CONUS,
associated with a broad mean trough, with heights becoming near-normal alon=
g
the Gulf Coast and northern New England.

Dynamical models favor below-normal temperatures over southern Mainland Ala=
ska
due to a southerly storm track. Above normal temperatures are favored over
parts of northeastern Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, and much of th=
e
western CONUS underneath above-normal 500-hPa heights and sinking air aloft=
.
Colder air in Canada is also expected to drop southward into the central CO=
NUS
to as far south as Texas, increasing probabilities of below-normal
temperatures
across the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley, with the highest probabilit=
y
over 70% over the parts of the Central Plains. Over the Northeast, above-
normal
temperatures are favored, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.
Above-normal temperatures are favored through the early half of the 6-10 da=
y
period across parts of the Southeast, but anomalies will begin to diminish
later in the period.

With mean mid-level troughing and a southerly storm track across Alaska,
above-normal precipitation is favored across most of the state. Below norma=
l
precipitation is favored over the West Coast, Great Basin, Northern Rockies=
,
and eastward across the Northern Plains to the Midwest, associated with
surface
high pressure that is expected to dominate through much of the period. At t=
he
base and ahead of the mean trough over the eastern CONUS, above-normal
precipitation is favored for the Southern Plains, Gulf Coast, and Eastern
Seaboard.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 15 - 21 2021

The 500-hPa geopotential height pattern across North America during Week-2
indicates a progression of the pattern from the 6-10 day period. Today's mo=
del
solutions agree well with above-normal mid-level heights predicted across a=
ll
of Alaska and most of the western CONUS. Over most of the eastern CONUS,
below-normal 500-hPa heights are favored, associated with an amplified mean
trough.

Similar to the 6-10 day period, a southern storm track across Alaska enhanc=
es
probabilities of below-normal temperatures across parts of the southwestern
Mainland. However, predominant southerly flow over the Alaska Panhandle and
southeasterly flow over northeastern Mainland Alaska enhance probabilities =
of
near to above-normal temperatures over these regions. Above-normal
temperatures
are favored in the western third of the CONUS, underneath positive mid-leve=
l
height anomalies and sinking air aloft. An amplified mean trough over the
eastern CONUS and surface high pressure on its western periphery favor
enhanced
odds of below-normal temperatures from the Great Plains to much of the East
Coast. However, above-normal temperatures in Maine and the southern Florida
Peninsula are likely consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Mean surface low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska favors below-normal
precipitation in its wake over parts of southwestern Mainland Alaska and th=
e
Aleutians. Near to above normal precipitation is favored for parts of
northeastern Mainland Alaska consistent with the consolidation forecast too=
l.
High pressure aloft and above-normal 500-hPa heights favor below-normal
precipitation across the western CONUS, Northern and Central Plains, and
eastward to much of the Mississippi Valley and parts of the Ohio Valley. At
the
base and ahead of the amplified mean mid-level trough over the eastern CONU=
S,
above-normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Southern High Plains
and
much of the Eastern Seaboard.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=

of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement in the modeled temperature and precipitation fields across
North
America, offset by some uncertainty in the mid-level height pattern over th=
e
North Pacific and southern Alaska.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

...Heavy rain and the potential for severe thunderstorms are
expected for portions of the central and eastern U.S. through
Friday...

...Snow is likely in the Cascades and Northern Rockies as frontal
systems pass through tonight through Friday...

...Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather remain in place in
and around New Mexico...

...Seasonably warm temperatures forecast for portions of the
Midwest and Northeast as well as the Southern Plains...

A surface low pressure system over the central U.S. is forecast to
continue to move slowly to the northeast through the Middle/Upper
Mississippi Valley over the next couple of days, sweeping a cold
front slowly eastward across the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley
and toward the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys. Widespread moderate to
heavy rain along with severe thunderstorms are likely with this
system ahead of the cold front. The Storm Prediction Center has
issued a Slight to Enhanced Risk of severe weather for tornado,
wind, and hail threats centered over the Lower Mississippi Valley
through tonight. Some locations in that region could also receive
a couple inches of rain, and, given the wet ground conditions
there, there is a Marginal Risk of localized flooding and flash
flooding through tomorrow morning. As the cold front pushes slowly
eastward, portions of the central Midwest and Southeast will see
increasing chances of rain and severe storms on Thursday, with a
broad Marginal Risk for severe weather in place. Thunderstorm
chances will continue ahead of the cold front further into the
Southeast through Friday. Rain and thunderstorms are also likely
farther north of the low across the Upper Midwest southeast to the
Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas where draping stationary fronts reside
through the next few days.

On Friday, severe thunderstorms are forecast again for the
Southern Plains and Southeast ahead of a dryline across central
Texas and warm front extending east through the Lower Mississippi
Valley. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of
severe weather for portions of Texas east to the Lower Mississippi
Valley. Heavy rain is also possible across the Lower Mississippi
Valley as well, with a Slight Risk of Flooding Friday night.

In the northwestern U.S., upper-level energy and frontal systems
are expected to move through tonight into Thursday, which will
produce cooler than normal temperatures there as well as wintry
precipitation chances. Snow totals should be highest in the
Washington Cascades, which are forecast to see over a foot of snow
through tonight with additional snow forecast for Friday. The
Northern Rockies in Idaho and Montana can expect up to 6 inches of
snow in higher elevations through Friday morning. Lighter snow
amounts are possible in Wyoming on Friday behind the cold front as
it continues eastward.

In the Southwest and Southern High Plains, warm temperatures are
forecast along with gusty winds and low relative humidity values,
and this combination will lead to the potential for continued
dangerous fire weather conditions. The Storm Prediction Center has
outlined a Critical Risk of fire weather for portions of New
Mexico through tonight, with an Elevated Risk for portions of
eastern Arizona, much of New Mexico, and southwestern Texas
Thursday.

In general, most of the contiguous U.S. should see above normal
temperatures over the next few days, with the exceptions being the
Northwest (as mentioned) and central portions of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley underneath the upper low. The Great Lakes
region can expect high temperatures to be around 15 to 25 degrees
above normal today, and a few daily records could be set. The
Desert Southwest and southern Texas will experience temperatures
in the 90s and nearing 100 degrees over the next few days.

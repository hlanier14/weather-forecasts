Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Sat Apr 23 2022

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN PLAINS...

No changes were made to the ongoing outlook. Critical meteorological
conditions will likely extend east of the elevated area across
Minnesota and Iowa, but this area received wetting rain this
morning. Therefore, the fire weather threat should be minimal east
of the elevated area.

..Bentley.. 04/23/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0103 AM CDT Sat Apr 23 2022/

...Synopsis...
A deep-layer trough positioned over central/northern Rockies and
central/northern High Plains will shift east throughout the day into
portions of northern Great Plains. A strong 80-100 kt mid-level jet
positioned along the southeastern flank of the trough will parallel
the aforementioned progression, with the core of the jet moving from
the central Plains into the Great Lakes region. At the surface, a
dry line will shift east into the southern/central Plains throughout
the afternoon and early evening.

...Central/Southern Plains...
Diurnal heating and associated boundary layer mixing of strong
mid-level flow west of the dry line (mainly across the southern
Plains) will result in strong westerly/southwesterly sustained
surface winds of 20-30 mph, gusting to 35-40+ mph, amid RH values
into the teens. These conditions will promote several hours of
critical fire-weather conditions amid dry/receptive fuels.

Farther north, most guidance suggests the dry line will extend
northeast along a narrow corridor from portions of central Kansas
into eastern Nebraska and possibly as far as southeast South Dakota
and northwest Iowa, situated between an advancing cold front to the
west and a warm/moist airmass to the east. This would result in a
few hours of elevated to near critical fire-weather conditions amid
fuels that remain conducive to large-fire spread. Given uncertainty
in the coverage/intensity of the eastward dry line protrusion and
coverage of overnight/morning wetting rain potential, the previous
elevated/critical delineations have been maintained and will be
subject to refinements in the next outlook update.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Sat Apr 23 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Apr 26 2022 - 12Z Sat Apr 30 2022

...Overview...

An upper trough digging into the northern tier and toward the
Midwest/Ohio Valley will steadily push a cold front through the
Eastern Seaboard where generally modest rainfall is expected on
Tuesday.  Modest cyclogenesis forecast to occur near/east of New
England will likely promote lingering precipitation for the
Northeast as the week progresses.  Meanwhile, mean troughing is
likely in the West with multiple shortwaves tracking through,
bringing periods of precipitation while ridging in between will
spread warm temperatures from the Southwest to southern/central
Plains by late week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance has remained consistent with better than average
agreement for the above-mentioned pattern at least through Day
5/6.  The GFS and GEFS continues to show a tendency for a faster
exit of the low off to the east of New England later next week
than the ECMWF and CMC.  The same tendency generally applies to
the mean trough in the West.
A shortwave reaching the Northwest around Tuesday should continue
onward across the Canadian Rockies, possibly forming a compact
upper low over Albert midweek with the GFS being the most
prominent and fastest with this feature.  This faster eastward
progression of the upper low in the GFS promotes earlier
cyclogenesis to occur over the central Plains toward the upper
Midwest late week than in the ECMWF and CMC solutions.

Given the relatively typical model biases as discussed above, the
WPC medium-range forecasts were based on a multi-model consensus
of 40% from the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, 40% from the 06Z GFS/GEFS,
and 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  Only on large weight toward
the ensemble means was applied to mitigate the higher uncertainty
on Day 7.  The results were very compatible with the previous
forecast package.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The cold front moving across the Eastern Seaboard as the period
begins on Tuesday will promote rain and possibly thunderstorms
along it.  Its reasonably fast progression should keep rainfall
amounts in the light to moderate range. Then as surface low
pressure consolidates and pivots around the upper low,
precipitation will remain in the forecast across the Northeast
through the end of the workweek.  There is some potential for
higher elevations of New England to receive snow with this
precipitation activity.  Precipitation do not appear to be
particularly heavy at this time but will be monitored due to its
lingering tendency.  Meanwhile in the West, unsettled weather is
likely as shortwave energy moves through the mean trough south of
a closed upper low positioned off British Columbia through
Thursday. Guidance has continued to indicate an episode of rain
and high elevation snow Tuesday-Wednesday from the Pacific
Northwest to the northern Rockies associated with the shortwave
energy, which will be followed by another episode late week in the
same general vicinity as the main trough/upper low pushes onshore.
 By Friday, a general expansion of rain is forecast for the
northern to central Plains spreading toward the Midwest and the
Ohio Valley into Saturday as a low pressure system is forecast to
develop over the central Plains.  The fast GFS solution is not
preferred at this point.  Meanwhile, some form of wintry
precipitation is forecast for the northern High Plains into North
Dakota on Friday.

The core of post-frontal cold air is forecast in the
Dakotas/Midwest on Tuesday and spreading into the Great Lakes
region by Wednesday-Thursday, with temperatures 10-25F below
average.  As the cold front sweeps across the East, temperatures
will transition from warmer than normal on Tuesday to below normal
midweek, though with some temperature moderation.  The Northwest
should see near to slightly below average temperatures, but by
late week temperatures in the northern Rockies/Plains is forecast
to cool down to much below normal levels especially in terms of
highs with the possibility of more potent troughing aloft.
Meanwhile farther south, ridging in place will spread warmer than
normal temperatures from the Southwest/Four Corners states into
northern and central parts of the Plains, with afternoon
temperatures soaring into the 90s in many areas ahead of the
developing low pressure system.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat April 23 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19600414 - 20040419 - 19660429 - 20010421 - 19800405


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 7 day periods centered on the following dates:
19600413 - 20040421 - 20010423 - 19510425 - 19570418

...Synopsis...
A deep-layer trough over the central CONUS will continue lifting
northeast into the Great Lakes region and into south-central Canada.
Meanwhile, a mid-level ridge will build across the central/northern
Rockies. Mid-level flow between these features should remain quite
marginal, perhaps approaching 40-50 kt. At the surface, a cold front
will weaken and become somewhat diffuse across portions of the
southern/central Plains, while a residual dry airmass remains over
much of the southern High Plains and Southwest. Given the lack of
appreciable flow aloft, and cooler temperatures associated with the
post-frontal airmass, fire-weather concerns should remain low across
the region.

...Blizzard Warnings for the Northern High Plains through Sunday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Plains and Mississippi Valley; there is a Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Southern Plains on Sunday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern Rockies and Southern/Central Plains...

On Saturday, a strong storm over the Northern Plains will move
northeastward into Central Canada by Sunday evening. The
associated front will destabilize the atmosphere over the Plains
and Mississippi Valley. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Northern Plains,
Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley, and the Central/Southern Plains
through Sunday morning. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Similarly, there is a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall over the same region through Sunday
morning.

In contrast, there are Blizzard Warnings over the Northern High
Plains through early Sunday morning. Snow will continue over parts
of the Northern Plains, on Sunday, as the area of snow moves
slowly eastward into the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great
Lakes, yet over a more limited area by Monday evening.

The showers and thunderstorms move eastward as the front moves
eastward on Sunday. However, the threat of severe thunderstorms
reduces to a Marginal Risk extending from the Great Lakes to the
Southern Plains on Sunday. However, the threat of excessive
rainfall increases by two categories on Sunday. Therefore, the WPC
has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms along the front on Sunday into Monday morning over
parts of the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley. The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers.

On Monday, the showers and thunderstorms will move eastward
extending from the Lower Great Lakes to the Southern Plains and
Western/Central Gulf Coast. On Monday, the excessive rainfall
threat reduces to a Marginal Risk over parts of eastern Texas into
the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, snow will linger over
parts of the Northern/Central Rockies from Saturday into Monday
afternoon as upper-level energy lingers over the region.

Furthermore, a front will move onshore over the Pacific Northwest
overnight Sunday and move inland to the Northern Intermountain
Region by Monday afternoon. The system will produce rain and the
highest elevation snow over parts of the Northwest, with rain
extending into the Northern Rockies by Monday.

Moreover, the SPC has issued an Elevated Risk of fire weather over
parts of the Southern Rockies and Southern/Central Plains through
Sunday morning. The fire weather hazard is due to gusty winds, dry
fuels, and low humidity. However, the fire weather risk decreases
over the area on Sunday.

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A deep-layer trough positioned over the northern Great Plains will
shift northeast throughout the day, entering portions of the
southern Canada and the Great Lakes region. A broad jet streak
situated along the southern periphery of this trough will shift east
as well and undergo a weakening trend. Consequently, mid-level flow
over the southern/central Plains will weaken throughout the day and
remain marginally enhanced. At the surface, a cold front will push
through the southern Plains and become somewhat diffuse. Generally
light surface winds will accompany the post-frontal airmass, along
with somewhat cool surface temperatures. These factors should result
in minimal fire-weather concerns for today.

A deep-layer trough positioned over the Great Lakes region will
remain quasi-stationary throughout the day. Meanwhile, a mid-level
trough will enter portions of the Pacific Northwest, while a ridge
builds over the central/northern Rockies. Mid-level flow within
these systems is forecast to remain rather marginal, with a few
transient pockets of enhanced flow developing. At the surface, a
cold front will continue moving through the southern Plains, with
cool temperatures and light winds occurring throughout the
post-frontal dry airmass, resulting in limited fire-weather concerns
on Monday.

303 AM EDT Sun Apr 24 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Apr 27 2022 - 12Z Sun May 01 2022

...Overview...

For the latter half of this week, a surface low consolidating near
New England in conjunction with a slow-moving upper low will cause
precipitation chances to persist over the Northeast. Meanwhile,
mean troughing with multiple shortwaves is likely in the West, and
this trough axis should eventually track eastward by the end of
the week, pushing a broad upper ridge initially over the central
U.S. eastward. The trough will support formation of a central U.S.
surface low and possibly another round of snow in the northern
Rockies/High Plains on its backside, while rain is likely farther
south across the central Plains/Mississippi Valley. The details of
these threats remain quite uncertain at this point, however.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable with the pattern in the
eastern U.S. through the end of the week with the aforementioned
upper low tracking slowly from the Great Lakes to Northeast and
stalling/spinning, with an associated coastal surface low. There
is also reasonably good agreement for general broad ridging behind
in the central U.S., though with some uncertainty in embedded
shortwaves. But models are considerably more varied with their
handling of the western troughing, first with a shortwave/possibly
a compact upper low moving through southwestern to south-central
Canada Wednesday-Thursday and how and when the energy gets
absorbed, and then with the trough's track eastward around Friday
into the weekend. GFS runs had been on the faster side of
consensus through the 12Z run, but fortunately the 18Z GFS slowed
to be more in line with other guidance. However, even by Friday
there are still some differences, with the CMC and ECMWF showing
energy spilling into the Pacific Northwest to prompt the trough to
move around Friday, while the GFS is oriented more inland with the
energy and shows ridging across the Pacific Northwest. Differences
in energy there and elsewhere lead to considerable model and
ensemble member variability with timing of the trough movement
eastward as well as its extent southward, affecting the surface
low position as well. The newer 00Z guidance like the GFS and
ECMWF show a more northern track of the upper and surface lows
over the weekend compared to the 12/18Z cycle used for this
forecast, further indicating the uncertainty.

The WPC forecast was able to use a multi-model deterministic blend
favoring the ECMWF and GFS early in the period, but gradually
adding in GEFS and EC ensemble mean influence to about half by the
latter part of the period as uncertainty in any particular
solution increased. But ensemble mean guidance was certainly
flatter/less amplified than preferred given the ample differences
in the individual ensemble members in a pattern sensitive to
smaller scale shortwaves that may not be handled too well. Thus
future changes to the forecast especially by next weekend may be
considerable as guidance evolves over the next few days.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The northeastern U.S. could receive multiple rounds of
precipitation through much of the week as the upper level and
surface lows pivot and linger over the area. Individual
precipitation events should generally be light to moderate;
amounts will add up over time but still are not expected to be too
hazardous. Higher elevations of New England may see snow with the
precipitation activity. Some rain may begin in the central U.S. as
early as Wednesday near a warm front and surface low, but rain is
likely to increase in coverage and amounts as the week progresses
given better upper-level support and strengthening low pressure
that will eventually push eastward into the weekend. Unsettled
weather should also occur in the western to north-central U.S.,
with amounts increasing from Thursday into Friday and Saturday.
Conditions will likely be cold enough for snow in the northern
Rockies on the backside of the surface low, and there is once
again some threat of wintry precipitation spreading into the
northern High Plains as well. But the details of these threats may
not come into focus for a few more days given considerable model
uncertainty.

Cooler than average temperatures are forecast for the eastern
third of the U.S. Wednesday into Thursday, with the core of the
cold air in the Great Lakes/central Appalachians, with
temperatures 10-20F below normal and the possibility of a few
daily record lows on Wednesday. On the other hand warmer than
normal temperatures should spread from the Southwest/Four Corners
states into southern and central parts of the Plains underneath
upper ridging. By Friday into the weekend, the pattern should
generally shift to cooler than average temperatures in the North
and warmer than average in the South. The northern Plains to
Midwest are forecast to see highs nearing 20F below average, but
lows may be closer to normal. Meanwhile the southern tier should
be around 10F above average.

given better upper-level support and strengthening low pressure
that will eventually push eastward into the weekend. Unsettled
weather should also occur in the western to north-central U.S.,
with amounts increasing from Thursday into Friday and Saturday.
Conditions will likely be cold enough for snow in the northern
Rockies on the backside of the surface low, and there is once
again some threat of wintry precipitation spreading into the
northern High Plains as well. But the details of these threats may
not come into focus for a few more days given considerable model
uncertainty.

Cooler than average temperatures are forecast for the eastern
third of the U.S. Wednesday into Thursday, with the core of the
cold air in the Great Lakes/central Appalachians, with
temperatures 10-20F below normal and the possibility of a few
daily record lows on Wednesday. On the other hand warmer than
normal temperatures should spread from the Southwest/Four Corners
states into southern and central parts of the Plains underneath
upper ridging. By Friday into the weekend, the pattern should
generally shift to cooler than average temperatures in the North
and warmer than average in the South. The northern Plains to
Midwest are forecast to see highs nearing 20F below average, but
lows may be closer to normal. Meanwhile the southern tier should
be around 10F above average.

...Heavy rain and instances of flash flooding likely across parts
of the southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley today...

...Isolated severe thunderstorms may impact areas from the Great
Lakes to the southern Plains through this evening...

...Blizzard conditions to gradually come to an end across parts of
the northern Plains...

A strong spring cold front traversing the center of the Nation
this morning will continue to spawn numerous showers and
thunderstorms through the beginning of the workweek. Thunderstorms
are expected to be more widespread across parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley and southern Plains today, where storms could
contain heavy rainfall rates and track over similar areas into the
evening hours. This will likely lead to instances of flash
flooding from far north-central Texas to northwest Arkansas,
including southeast Oklahoma. Rainfall totals could locally reach
up to 5 inches in this region. In order to highlight the concern,
a Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of Excessive Rainfall has been issued,
along with Flood Watches. Residents within the threat area are
advised avoid driving through flood prone areas and never drive
through flooded roads.

A few thunderstorms along the aforementioned cold front could turn
severe from Michigan to Texas. Potential hazards include frequent
lightning, damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated
tornadoes. The greatest chances for severe thunderstorms today
exists across portions of the Midwest and Lower Michigan, as well
as parts of the southern Plains. The Storm Prediction Center has
issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe thunderstorms for these
areas. By Monday, the cold front and associated rainfall chances
shift south and east, while losing most of its punch. A few
isolated instances of flash flooding may still impact parts of the
central/eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley, with a low
risk of severe thunderstorms as well. Showers and thunderstorms
will stretch along the cold front from the Lower Great Lakes to
the Ohio Valley, where a few damaging wind gusts are not out of
the question. Unsettled weather will then enter parts of the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday as the cold front gradually
slides off the East Coast.

Meanwhile, winter is still hanging on across the northern Plains
as blizzard conditions continue into this afternoon. A powerful
low pressure system will slowly weaken and shift into southwest
Ontario by this evening, with the dangerous combination of heavy
snow and gusty winds coming to an end. Additional snowfall amounts
of 1 to 3 inches are possible across North Dakota this morning,
with blowing snow remaining a concern into the early evening
hours. Blizzard Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories remain in
effect across much of North Dakota, western South Dakota, eastern
Montana, and the northern Nebraska Panhandle.

Elsewhere, lower elevation rain showers and light high elevation
snow is set to return to the Northwest and northern Great Basin on
Monday as an approaching frontal system nears the region. Snow is
also forecast across parts of the central Rockies into early
Monday, with accumulations approaching 8 inches for the tallest
mountain ranges of Colorado.

In regards to temperatures, summer-like warmth will be found
throughout much of the East today while New England and coastal
sections of the Northeast will stay on the cool side thanks to
easterly flow off the chilly Atlantic Ocean. On Monday, highs into
the 70s and 80s will remain over the Ohio Valley and interior
sections of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic before cooler air
arrives behind the cold front on Tuesday. Well below average to
potentially record-breaking cold will remain locked in across the
Northern Plains over the next few days and expand southeastward
into the Midwest early this week, which will likely prompt
frost/freeze concerns. Conversely, an upper-level ridge building
into the Southwest today will allow for above average temperatures
throughout southern California and the Desert Southwest through
Tuesday.

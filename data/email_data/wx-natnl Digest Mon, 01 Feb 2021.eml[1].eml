Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0921 AM CST Sun Jan 31 2021

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed to the ongoing forecast. Somewhat dry (RH
between 20-30%) and breezy conditions are possible across
south-central TX this afternoon. Transient elevated conditions are
possible over areas where fine fuels remain dry, but sustained
and/or widespread elevated conditions do not appear likely.
Otherwise, recent guidance and surface observations continue to show
overall low fire weather potential. See the previous discussion
below for details.

..Moore.. 01/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1241 AM CST Sun Jan 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
Quiescent fire-weather conditions are expected across the CONUS
today.  A longwave trough will become further established across the
eastern CONUS while ridging develops across the Intermountain West.
At the surface, a couple of low pressure areas will approach the
Appalachians and coastal areas of the Carolinas while high pressure
areas reside across the Plains and central Rockies.  The resulting
pattern will produce relatively weak winds in most areas of the
Plains, with recent rainfall and low ERCs mitigating any
fire-weather risk.  Recent precipitation across California and
onshore flow should keep any fire-weather risk to a minimum there.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 AM CST Sun Jan 31 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing outlook are necessary. Guidance continues
to show low potential for fire weather concerns across most of the
CONUS. One area worth monitoring is the southern FL Peninsula where
fuels have remained dry and north winds are forecast to increase to
15-20 mph. Despite the breezy winds, RH values should remain above
40% and light rain over the next 24 hours may alleviate fuel dryness
to some degree. As such, the fire weather potential will be
conditional on minimal rainfall and warmer temperatures/lower RH
than currently expected.

..Moore.. 01/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1241 AM CST Sun Jan 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
The quiescent fire-weather expected on D1/Sun will continue into
D2/Mon.  An eastern CONUS trough/western CONUS ridge will remain in
place throughout the forecast period.  Meanwhile, a coastal low will
organize off the Mid-Atlantic and weak lee troughing organizes
across the High Plains.  Generally weak surface flow will exist
across much of the Plains despite areas of locally dry conditions
(RH values less than 25% during peak heating).  Additionally, a
moist airmass will remain in place across much of California due to
onshore flow.

...Midweek Southwest U.S. system to progress to the
Plains/Midwest/Northeast later week followed by arctic outbreak by
weekend...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

As the deep low gradually weakens and exits New England, the next
system of concern during the medium range period will be over the
Plains where global models continue to show difficulties in the
timing and degree of interaction between an upper trough lifting
and ejecting into the central Plains, and a surge of polar air
mass from central Canada.  There remains noticeable discrepancy
regarding the track and intensity of frontal waves that may form
later next week over the central Plains among the deterministic
solutions from global models.  However, the consensus of this
morning's ensemble means yield a consolidating low pressure system
which is forecast to track across the Great Lakes early on
Friday--a solution that compares well with WPC continuity.
Thereafter, models indicate decent agreement for the low to shear
off to the east across New England as an outbreak of arctic air
from Canada becomes increasingly likely down the Plains by next
weekend.  Elsewhere, the GFS indicates intensification of a
frontal wave across the Southeast and the East Coast late in the
week but this scenario is not supported by its ensemble mean nor
by the ECMWF and the CMC solutions.

The WPC medium range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS, the 13Z NBM, and a
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  More of the
ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7, with the least
contributions from the 06Z GFS and 00Z CMC.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

For the deep cyclone near New England, wintry precipitation inland
should gradually taper off on Wednesday but some areas along or
offshore the coast will continue to experience brisk to strong
winds into Thursday as the cyclone will be slow to depart.

A strong upper trough driving through California Wednesday will
support a period of enhanced moisture/rains and mountain snows,
with activity spreading across the south-central Great
Basin/Rockies into Thursday.  Variance with the extent of digging
still leads to subsequent ejection model differences which grow
downstream along with uncertain stream phasing/central U.S. storm
genesis mid-later next week.  It is expected that as the energy
comes out of the West and Rockies, a deepening low or lows to the
lee of the Rockies will lift toward the Great Lakes late Thursday
to Friday.  Leading warm air advection and moisture return on the
backside of the departing high will allow deepening Gulf moisture
to interact with the favorable dynamics and forcing.  This will
fuel an expanding area of moderate to locally heavier
precipitation across the east-central U.S.  Enhanced wrap-back
snows can be expected near and to the north of the main cyclone
track over the north-central to northeastern U.S., and could dip

...Midweek Southwest U.S. system to progress to the
Plains/Midwest/Northeast later week followed by arctic outbreak by
weekend...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

As the deep low gradually weakens and exits New England, the next
system of concern during the medium range period will be over the
Plains where global models continue to show difficulties in the
timing and degree of interaction between an upper trough lifting
and ejecting into the central Plains, and a surge of polar air
mass from central Canada.  There remains noticeable discrepancy
regarding the track and intensity of frontal waves that may form
later next week over the central Plains among the deterministic
solutions from global models.  However, the consensus of this
morning's ensemble means yield a consolidating low pressure system
which is forecast to track across the Great Lakes early on
Friday--a solution that compares well with WPC continuity.
Thereafter, models indicate decent agreement for the low to shear
off to the east across New England as an outbreak of arctic air
from Canada becomes increasingly likely down the Plains by next
weekend.  Elsewhere, the GFS indicates intensification of a
frontal wave across the Southeast and the East Coast late in the
week but this scenario is not supported by its ensemble mean nor
by the ECMWF and the CMC solutions.

The WPC medium range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS, the 13Z NBM, and a
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  More of the
ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7, with the least
contributions from the 06Z GFS and 00Z CMC.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

For the deep cyclone near New England, wintry precipitation inland
should gradually taper off on Wednesday but some areas along or
offshore the coast will continue to experience brisk to strong
winds into Thursday as the cyclone will be slow to depart.

A strong upper trough driving through California Wednesday will
support a period of enhanced moisture/rains and mountain snows,
with activity spreading across the south-central Great
Basin/Rockies into Thursday.  Variance with the extent of digging
still leads to subsequent ejection model differences which grow
downstream along with uncertain stream phasing/central U.S. storm
genesis mid-later next week.  It is expected that as the energy
comes out of the West and Rockies, a deepening low or lows to the
lee of the Rockies will lift toward the Great Lakes late Thursday
to Friday.  Leading warm air advection and moisture return on the
backside of the departing high will allow deepening Gulf moisture
to interact with the favorable dynamics and forcing.  This will
fuel an expanding area of moderate to locally heavier
precipitation across the east-central U.S.  Enhanced wrap-back
snows can be expected near and to the north of the main cyclone
track over the north-central to northeastern U.S., and could dip
farther south into the Tennessee Valley early on Saturday behind
the system.  However, low support aloft/phasing details remain
uncertain.  Upstream, another batch of wintry precipitation is
forecast to track down across the Northwest and then the northern
and central Rockies late week associated with an arctic front.
With the approach of new digging upper trough energies, lead
ejecting waves and main upper trough amplification back over the
central U.S. next weekend may favor some uncertain modest swaths
of snows from the Midwest/OH Valley to the Appalachians and the
Northeast, including some lake-effect enhancement and focus.

...Major winter storm to produce significant snowfall across the
Northeast tonight and into both Monday and Tuesday...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Northern California and southwest Oregon...

An area of low pressure over the Ohio Valley is responsible for
producing periods of snow in parts of the Lower Great Lakes and
northern Mid-Atlantic. This low pressure system will pass the
baton off to a new coastal storm forming near the Mid-Atlantic
coast tonight. As the storm strengthens overnight and into Monday
morning, bands of heavy snow look to set up over an area
stretching from eastern Pennsylvania and the NYC metro area to
southern New England. The coastal low will then stall just off the
New Jersey coast and drop copious amounts of snow in these areas
through the day Monday and even into Tuesday. The latest forecast
for this long duration winter storm calls for over a foot of snow
across a large portion of eastern Pennsylvania, northern New
Jersey, southern New York, and into southern New England with
totals over in excess of 20 inches in some locations. Gusty winds
will help to reduce visibilities and lead to both blowing and
drifting snow. Treacherous travel conditions are expected
throughout the Northeast as the storm continues to generate
periods of snow that stick around into the day on Tuesday. Snow
will finally begin to taper off for most areas by Tuesday night
with the lone exception being northern New England where snow may
continue into Wednesday morning.

In the West, a Pacific storm system is triggering yet another
atmospheric river event, sending more rainfall and mountain snow
into the Pacific Northwest. A Slight Risk for excessive rainfall
remains in place this evening along the coastal range of northern
California and southwest Oregon. The frontal boundary near the
coast inches its way east on Monday, pushing the axis of
moderate-to-heavy rainfall into western Washington, Oregon, and
northern California. A Marginal Risk for excessive rainfall has
been issued for much of the same areas of northern California and
southwest Oregon on Monday. Plenty of mountain snow is also on tap
from the Shastas on north along the Cascade Range where the
highest elevations could receive accumulations of 1 to 2 feet. By
Tuesday, a new low pressure system associated with an upper level
trough heads towards the Northwest. Showers and mountain snow are
expected to persist across the Northwest with heavy snow falling
in the northern Sierra Nevada where Winter Storm Watches are
currently in effect through Tuesday night. Snow will also arrive
in the mountains of northern Idaho and western Montana Tuesday
night.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST Sun Jan 31 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR FEBRUARY 2021

The updated temperature and precipitation outlooks for February 2021 are based
on the WPC temperature and precipitation forecasts during the first week of
February, the CPC 8-14 day and Week 3-4 outlooks, and the latest monthly
forecasts from the CFS model. Below average sea surface temperatures (SSTs)
across the equatorial central Pacific along with a strong coupling with the
atmosphere represent La Nia conditions. The amplitude of the Madden-Julian
Oscillation (MJO) increased during late January, as it shifted eastward to the
West Pacific. A continued eastward propagation of the MJO would favor
anomalously cold temperatures across parts of the central and eastern U.S.
during February. In addition, residual effects related to the recent Sudden
Stratospheric Warming (SSW) may help to reinforce this MJO cold signal.



Major revisions were needed to the updated February temperature outlook, due
to
higher forecast confidence in a colder pattern for the CONUS. The large
coverage with enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures is due to a
high amplitude longwave pattern favorable for anomalous cold during early to
mid-February. The week-2 ensemble means remain consistent and in excellent
agreement, depicting a high amplitude 500-hPa ridge extending from the North
Pacific poleward over Alaska with a full-latitude trough centered over the
Rockies. This amplified longwave pattern favors intrusions of Arctic Air
shifting south from Canada into the western and north-central CONUS. The
largest probabilities (more than 60 percent) of below normal temperatures are
forecast from the Northern Great Plains to the Upper Mississippi Valley where
anomalous cold is most likely to persist for multiple weeks. MJO composites
would favor an expansion of the anomalous cold to the east, but equal chances
(EC) of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for much of the
East Coast since temperatures are likely to average near to slightly above
normal during the first ten days of the month. Due to large positive
temperature anomalies early in the month, above normal temperatures are
slightly favored for northern New England. Increased probabilities of above
normal temperatures are forecast for parts of the Southeast based on model
guidance from weeks 2 through 4. Despite anomalous cold early in the month, EC
is forecast for much of the Southwest due to signs of a moderation in
temperatures later in the month, typical influences from La Nia, and decadal
trends. The updated February temperature outlook for the CONUS is generally
consistent with a combined La Nia and negative Arctic Oscillation composite.



Above normal precipitation remains favored for a majority of the central and
eastern CONUS which is likely to be downstream of an amplified 500-hPa trough
axis through at least mid-February. Probabilities of above normal
precipitation
are increased from the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys east to the mid-Atlantic due
to the expectation of a thermal gradient and persistent storm track. A
relatively dry (less than 0.25 inch) first week of February and mean 500-hPa
ridging through much of the month elevate probabilities of below normal
precipitation for Florida along with parts of the Gulf Coast. This wet/dry
dipole from the Ohio Valley to Florida is consistent with La Nia, but high
latitude blocking may shift the storm track at times closer to the Gulf Coast.
A consistent wet signal among daily CFS model runs supports an increased
chance
of above normal precipitation from the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi
Valley
west to the Northern and Central Rockies. Expected periods of upslope flow
elevate probabilities of above normal precipitation for the Northern High
Plains.  The updated precipitation outlook is drier for the Pacific Northwest
due to the highly amplified ridge upstream and the absence of predicted
atmospheric river activity after the beginning of the month. Below normal
precipitation remains favored for California along with parts of the Southwest
and Rio Grande Valley based on a consistent dry signal among model guidance at
multiple time scales during February.



Only minor changes were needed for the updated Alaska temperature and
precipitation outlooks. Due to the amplified 500-hPa ridging early in the
month
and likelihood of Arctic Air shifting more southward over the CONUS, a
relatively warmer February outlook is anticipated. However, the location of
the
500-hPa ridge axis early in the month and model consensus continue to support
increased chances of below normal temperatures for southeast Mainland Alaska
and the Alaska Panhandle. Elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation
forecast for these areas of Alaska are consistent with below normal
temperatures being favored. Daily CFS model runs are consistent with increased
chances of above normal precipitation across western Mainland Alaska.





----------- Previous message (from January 21) is shown below ------------



The February 2021 temperature and precipitation outlooks are based on Weeks 3
to 4 forecasts from the CFS and ECMWF models, the North American Multi-Model
Ensemble (NMME), typical influences from the ongoing La Nia, and decadal
trends. Below average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) across the equatorial
Pacific along with a strong coupling with the atmosphere represent La Nia
conditions. Although dynamical models depict a strengthening Madden-Julian
Oscillation (MJ0) during late January into early February, La Nia is likely to
be

the major tropical forcing due to the well-established anomalous enhanced
(suppressed) convection over the Maritime Continent (equatorial Central
Pacific).



Despite high latitude blocking with a persistent negative Arctic Oscillation
(AO), 30-day temperatures since mid-December have averaged above normal for
nearly all of the CONUS. This mild temperature pattern was due in part to
enhanced Pacific flow overspreading the higher latitudes of North America and
cross polar flow generally limited to the Eastern Hemisphere. Week-2 model
guidance (Jan 28-Feb 3) remains consistent that an amplified and full-latitude
500-hPa ridge becomes centered over the Aleutians and extends poleward. The
Week 3-4 ECMWF model indicates this anomalous ridging persisting through at
least early February, which is likely to promote cross polar flow and result
in
below normal temperatures across parts of Alaska. Based on good model
continuity with this feature and support from a number of inputs to the NMME,
below normal temperatures are favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska and the
Alaska Panhandle. Although the source region is expected to become more
favorable for Arctic air to shift south across the western and north-central
CONUS during the next month, the NMME supports equal chances (EC) of below,
near, or above normal temperatures for much of the West and Northern Great
Plains. Sparse snow cover across the Canadian Prairies and Northern Great
Plains may be a limiting factor to anomalously cold temperatures heading into
February. Below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, due to the predicted close proximity
of
anomalous cold during the first half of February and this is also consistent
with La Nia composites.



The largest probabilities (above 50 percent) of above normal temperatures are
forecast from the Rio Grande Valley eastward to the Gulf Coast, based on the
week 3-4 model guidance, calibrated NMME, and La Nia composites. Although a
high latitude block over the Davis Strait and negative phase of the NAO are
forecast to promote periods of below normal temperatures along the East Coast
during the remainder of January, the GFS ensemble members depict a transition
to a neutral or even positive phase of the NAO by the beginning of February.
As
the negative NAO diminishes during the next two weeks, La Nia is expected to
become a more dominant factor which increases probabilities of above normal
temperatures across the Southeast. Above normal temperatures are only slightly
favored for the Northeast, Great Lakes, and Upper Mississippi Valley due to
lower forecast confidence and the potential for a variable temperature pattern
during February. It remains unclear when or even if the recent stratospheric
warming event would influence temperatures across the CONUS and this will be
reassessed for the updated outlook released on January 31.



The precipitation outlook for February is consistent with La Nia composites
and supported by the NMME. Below normal precipitation is most likely across
the
southern tier of the CONUS, while above normal precipitation is favored from
the Pacific Northwest eastward to the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley and
Great Lakes. Elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation, forecast
for
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, are consistent with
below normal temperatures favored for these areas. A majority of inputs to the
NMME support increased probabilities of above normal precipitation across the
Aleutians. Probabilities throughout the forecast domain are tempered due to
large uncertainties during this monthly outlook time range.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1981 and 2010, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

The next monthly outlook...for Mar ... will be issued on Thu Feb 18 2021

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1981-2010 base period.

300 PM EST Sun January 31 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1221 AM CST Mon Feb 01 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Relatively quiescent fire-weather conditions remain likely across
the CONUS today.  In the wake of an appreciably strong cold front
over the northern Gulf of Mexico and coastal storm just off the
Mid-Atlantic, a cool and stable airmass will take hold across many
areas of the central and eastern U.S.  Weak surface troughing along
the lee of the Rockies will encourage a few surface wind gusts to 15
mph across eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle amidst
borderline elevated RH values (15-30%) and low ERCs.  Additionally,
onshore flow across the West and areas of precipitation will
mitigate fire-weather concerns in those areas.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1222 AM CST Mon Feb 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Quiescent larger-scale fire-weather concerns are expected again on
D2/Tue.  A weak lee trough across the High Plains will encourage
localized areas of warming/drying in that area, though the weak
pressure gradient and lack of support for flow aloft will keep
surface winds relatively light.  Additionally, the recent wet
pattern will mitigate fuel readiness in many areas of the West.
Though fuels may be susceptible for fire starts in a few areas of
south Florida, models indicate that RH values will remain above
elevated thresholds in most areas as trajectories maintain an
onshore flow component from the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

...Midweek Southwest U.S. system to progress to the
Plains/Midwest/Northeast later week followed by arctic outbreak by
weekend...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...




...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The low ejection of a stormy lead cyclone into the Canadian
Maritimes will allow some areas along or offshore coastal New
England to have lingering brisk winds into Thursday.

Upper troughing driving through the Southwest/Rockies will produce
a swath of terrain enhanced snows into Thursday. System ejection
into the Plains still offers additional northern stream trough
phasing uncertainties and a complex frontal structure, but suspect
that a deepening low will organize and lift to the Great Lakes
into Friday. Enhanced snows are expected near and to the north of
the main cyclone track from the windy Midwest/Great Lakes to the
Northeast. Meanwhile to the south, leading warm air advection and
return Gulf moisture will combine with favorable dynamics and
forcing to fuel an expanding but progressive area of moderate
rain/convection from the east-central U.S. through the Eastern
Seaboard.

Upstream, expect a swath of heavy terrain snows are forecast from
the Northwest to the north-central Rockies late week with a series
of potent shortwaves that subsequently dig into an
emerging/amplified central U.S. upper trough position this
weekend. This will act to drive a frigid arctic airmass fully
southward through the central then eastern U.S.. Interaction with
a lingering wavy front trailing from the aforementioned lead
system over the East may favor piedmont/coastal rains and inland
snows from the OH Valley/Appalachians to the Northeast.

...Heavy snow from parts of the Mid-Atlantic into New England
through Wednesday morning...

...The heavy rain winds down over parts of Northern California and
the Pacific Northwest...

...Light rain/freezing rain for parts of the I-95 corridor on
Monday and into Coastal Maine on Tuesday...

Low pressure along the Mid-Atlantic Coast will slowly move
northeastward to just off Maine by Wednesday morning.  The system
will produce snow from parts of the Ohio Valley into parts of the
Northeast on Monday morning.  On Monday evening, the snow will
expand into Northern New England and continue over parts of the
Northeast into Wednesday.  Some rain will be along the northern
Mid-Atlantic Coast too.  Areas of rain/freezing rain is possible
along the I-95 corridor from Washington D. C. to Philadelphia on
Monday.  Additionally, rain/freezing rain will develop over parts
of Coastal Maine on Tuesday.  Overnight Monday, the snow will
begin to weaken over the Ohio Valley into parts of the Southern
Appalachians.  However, the snow will linger over the Central
Appalachians into Wednesday morning.

In the meantime, a front approaching the Northwest will move
onshore later Monday and advance eastward to the Northern
Intermountain Region/Northern Rockies to Southern California by
Wednesday.  The system will produce rain and some high elevation
snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest and parts of Northern
California on Monday.  When the front moves onshore overnight
Monday, the snow levels will lower over the region as rain moves
into Central California.  On Tuesday afternoon, snow returns to
California's higher elevations and into parts of the Northern
Intermountain Region by Tuesday evening.  By Wednesday morning,
the snow will move into parts of the Northern Rockies.

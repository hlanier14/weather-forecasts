...Overview...

Guidance continues to show a strong eastern Pacific ridge helping
to keep a broad mean trough across a majority of the lower 48
through Wednesday.  The Pacific ridge will likely drift into the
West by Thursday-Friday, followed by some weakening depending on
very uncertain details of upstream shortwave energy.  Meanwhile
within the lower 48 mean trough, one shortwave will rotate through
the eastern half of the country during the first half of the
period and then another shortwave dropping into the central U.S.
late in the week may reach near the East Coast by early Saturday.
There is a decent signal that this latter shortwave will support a
developing East Coast/western Atlantic storm by next weekend but
with low confidence in details.  The pattern through the period
will generally favor below to well below normal temperatures over
the eastern half of the country and mild temperatures from the
West into the northern/central Plains.  Precipitation coverage and
intensity across the lower 48 will tend to be low aside from an
area of moisture crossing the East on Tuesday and then possibly
over parts of the South and East by the end of the week/next
weekend depending on details of upper flow and surface development.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

At the start of the period, guidance still varies somewhat on the
fine-scale details of initial northern Gulf of Mexico low pressure
quickly tracking into the Atlantic as supporting dynamics shear
out within accelerating flow aloft.  A blend approach maintains
the prevailing theme of the evolution.  Then continuity and
agreement are decent with a Canadian system dropping into the
Great Lakes by late in the week and then weakening.

The rest of the late-period forecast becomes more uncertain as
models and ensembles diverge considerably for eastern
Pacific/western U.S. details.  With some possible influence from
these issues, the evolution over and near the East by late
Friday-Saturday also displays a fair degree of uncertainty.  In
contrast to previous trend, over the past day guidance has trended
stronger with the upper ridge reaching the West late in the week
and increasingly varied with how energy within the shortwave
approaching from the west may separate (as illustrated most simply
by the 12Z and new 00Z ECMWF runs).  By day 7 Saturday the end
result over the West is a chaotic ensemble spaghetti plot with
anything between a shortwave or lingering ridge a possibility.
The 12Z ECMWF mean's shortwave did not have much agreement among
other 12Z/18Z models and means but the new 00Z CMC has come in
with a similar feature and the new ECMWF has a fairly strong
shortwave.  There is a somewhat better suggestion that energy
rounding the ridge may support a wave/front dropping into the
northern tier on Saturday.  The most common theme farther east is
for low pressure to be organizing over the western Atlantic by
early Saturday.  The 18Z/00Z GFS runs are closest to the
relatively higher density of ensemble surface lows at that time
while recent CMC runs have been somewhat in the neighborhood.  The
12Z GFS/ECMWF were on the southwestern edge of the spread.  The
new 00Z ECMWF is closer to the majority cluster in principle.

Based on latest guidance comparisons, the updated forecast
reflected a blend of 12Z/18Z operational models early in the
period and then transitioned toward greater weight of the
GEFS/ECens/CMCens due to the uncertainty of upper details over the
West toward the end of the period and to yield the highest
probability track for western Atlantic low pressure by Saturday.
Manual depiction of this low will likely trend deeper as
confidence in strength and track improves.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The combination of a northern Gulf of Mexico wave quickly moving
into the Atlantic and a cold front crossing the East will spread
an area of precipitation across the East on Tuesday.  Most amounts
will be in the light to moderate range, with some proportion of
the precipitation possibly being in the form of snow from the Ohio
Valley/central Appalachians into the Northeast.  A period of lake
effect snow will be possible behind the front.  A trailing
wave/front may spread areas of light snow from the northern Plains
into the Great Lakes and Northeast from about midweek into the
weekend.  Supporting dynamics could be amplified enough to support
some precipitation farther south as well but with low confidence
over coverage and amounts.  By next Saturday the
coverage/intensity/type of precipitation along the East Coast are
likewise uncertain at this time and will require close monitoring.
 Parts of the High Plains may see light snow on Tuesday.  Much of
the West should be dry during the period.  Some moisture could
eventually reach the Pacific Northwest by next Saturday.

A surge of cold air will initially be over the Upper Mississippi
Valley and Midwest on Tuesday, with some areas seeing temperatures
20-25F below normal from Tuesday into early Wednesday.  This cold
will then spread toward/into the South and East with time,
bringing a day or so of readings that are 10-20F above normal.  By
Friday-Saturday the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast may moderate some
while parts of the Southeast may see highs at least 10F below
normal.  After less extreme cold passes through the
central/southern Plains early in the period, most of the Plains
will see a warming trend with some areas seeing temperatures at
least 10F above normal.  The West will see moderately above normal
temperatures next week with some localized plus 10-15F anomalies
for highs.

...Wintry precipitation along the Mid-Atlantic coast expected to
come to an end later this morning...

...Periods of light snow from the northern Plains to the Great
Lakes...

...Santa Ana winds across portions of California followed by
return of Gulf moisture into southern Texas...

...Arctic chill continues across much of the southern and eastern
U.S. but mild weather returns to the northern/central High
Plains....

The latest round of freezing rain and snow impacting the
Carolinas, southeastern Virginia and into the Delmarva Peninsula
is expected to exit the coast later this morning as the low
pressure system begins to move more rapidly out into the Atlantic.
 An arctic air mass behind this system will keep much of the
southern and eastern U.S. much colder than normal.  A gradual
moderating trend is expected for the next couple of days as the
arctic high pressure system weakens.

The northern tier states will be in the cross-path of low pressure
systems that are forecast to dive southeastward from Alberta,
Canada during the next couple of days.  These clippers will bring
periods of snow followed by reinforcing shots of arctic air into
the northern Plains followed by the Great Lakes region.  In
contrast, mild temperatures are expected to return over the
northern and central High Plains just ahead of the arctic
boundaries.

Farther west, an upper low in the Desert Southwest will generate
unsettled weather for the Four Corners region while Santa Ana
Winds race through southern California. High Wind Warnings have
been posted just north and east of Los Angeles, the central Sierra
Nevada, and the coastal ranges north of San Francisco. An even
larger footprint of Wind Advisories is in effect through Saturday
morning from central California to the southern Great Basin. The
upper low is forecast to produce light snowfall accumulations from
the highest peaks of southern California to the Mogollon Rim of
Arizona and the southern Rockies tonight through Saturday. This
upper low will inch east on Sunday with only a few spotty showers
and some light snowfall accumulations in the higher elevations of
eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. Temperature-wise, the West
remains fairly mild overall with the warmest departures focused
along the West Coast. In the Great Plains, a warm front sliding
east gives way to warming temperatures throughout much of the
region. High temps by Sunday are likely to reach the 50s in the
central Plains, which is roughly 10 to 20 degrees above normal for
late January.

...Wintry precipitation along the Mid-Atlantic coast expected to
come to an end later this morning...

...Periods of light snow from the northern Plains to the Great
Lakes...

...Santa Ana winds across portions of California followed by
return of Gulf moisture into southern Texas...

...Arctic chill continues across much of the southern and eastern
U.S. but mild weather returns to the northern/central High
Plains....

The latest round of freezing rain and snow impacting the
Carolinas, southeastern Virginia and into the Delmarva Peninsula
is expected to exit the coast later this morning as the low
pressure system begins to move more rapidly out into the Atlantic.
 An arctic air mass behind this system will keep much of the
southern and eastern U.S. much colder than normal.  A gradual
moderating trend is expected for the next couple of days as the
arctic high pressure system weakens.

The northern tier states will be in the cross-path of low pressure
systems that are forecast to dive southeastward from Alberta,
Canada during the next couple of days.  These clippers will bring
periods of snow followed by reinforcing shots of arctic air into
the northern Plains toward the Great Lakes region.  In contrast,
mild temperatures are expected to return over the northern and
central High Plains just ahead of the arctic boundaries.

Farther west, an upper low in the Desert Southwest will generate
unsettled weather for the Four Corners region while Santa Ana
Winds race through southern California. High Wind Warnings have
been posted just north and east of Los Angeles, the central Sierra
Nevada, and the coastal ranges north of San Francisco. An even
larger footprint of Wind Advisories is in effect through Saturday
morning from central California to the southern Great Basin. The
upper low is forecast to produce light snowfall accumulations from
the highest peaks of southern California to the Mogollon Rim of
Arizona and the southern Rockies tonight through Saturday. This
upper low will inch east on Sunday with only a few spotty showers
and some light snowfall accumulations in the higher elevations of
eastern Arizona and western New Mexico.  By Sunday night, the
upper low/trough is expected to cross northern Mexico.  Ahead of
the upper system, moisture from the western Gulf of Mexico is
forecast to return across southern Texas Sunday night with
thunderstorms possible by Monday morning as a low pressure wave is
forecast to develop near the southern tip of Texas.

...Well below normal temperatures expected to continue across much
of the central part of the nation into Friday...

...Stormy pattern with wintry precipitation events from coast to
coast and late week heavy rainfall potential across parts of the
East...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

By the end of next week and weekend the models and ensembles are
still advertising a flattening trend for mean flow aloft across
the lower 48. This evolution would bring a drier period and more
moderate temperatures to areas east of the Rockies by the end of
the forecast, while primarily focusing rain/mountain snow from the
northern half of the West Coast into the Rockies. In the meantime,
the prevailing pattern with an amplified mean trough over the
central U.S. will feature upstream western energy digging into the
Plains/northern Mexico by Thursday and then progressing through
the eastern half of the country. The associated low
pressure/frontal system will emerge from the Gulf and continue
northeastward after midweek. With record cold air in place over
the Plains/Mississippi Valley at the end of the short range period
and only gradual moderation expected thereafter, a widespread area
of wintry weather is likely to extend from the Southern Plains
through the Northeast.

The guidance has come into better agreement on the late week
eastern system, though the ECMWF continues to be just a hair
faster and stronger than the GFS/CMC. This results in a little
flatter western-central U.S. flow late in the period from the
ECMWF, while the GFS/CMC continue to suggest some degree of mean
ridging ahead of the next shortwave expected to arrive into the
Pacific Northwest by day 6/Saturday. Of course, even small
differences in the details like this would have more meaningful
impacts to exact areas of heaviest rainfall and/or more
significant winter weather. The WPC progs reflect a blend of the
deterministic solutions early in the period, with some increasing
contributions from the means beyond day 5 to mitigate detail
differences, especially with the next PacNW shortwave next
weekend. This approach maintains good continuity with the previous
shift.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Precipitation over the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley
will be increasing in coverage by the start of the medium range
period, eventually reaching into the East by Thursday and Friday.
Moderate to heavy rainfall is likely from the Gulf Coast through
Tennessee Valley/southern Mid-Atlantic, with a broad area of
winter weather impacts on the northwest/northern side of the
precipitation shield from the ArkLaTex region northeastward into
the Northeast. Also to note, the Storm Prediction Center continues
to mention severe weather potential within the warm sector of this
system, with details to be better resolved over the coming days.

Behind this system, another couple fronts reaching the Northwest
between Thursday and Saturday should bring the potential for
additional focused rainfall along coastal portions of
Washington/Oregon with heavy mountain snows in the
Washington/Oregon Cascades and northern Rockies. Meaningful
rain/high elevation snow may extend into parts of northern
California as well.

In terms of temperatures, widespread record cold at the end of the
short range period should begin moderating somewhat by Wednesday,
though widespread 20-40F below normal is still expected across the
central/southern Plains and the Mississippi Valley into Friday
with some potential for more daily records across southern areas.
Upper ridging should finally allow for some recovery of
temperatures back closer to normal by next weekend across this
region. Given the less extreme anomalies over northern areas to
start with, the moderating trend over the Plains may be sufficient
to yield modestly above normal highs over parts of the Dakotas and
vicinity by next Saturday. Temperatures in the West will be near
to moderately below normal through midweek followed by a warming
trend, especially over the Southwest where highs may reach 5-10F
or so above normal Friday-Sunday. The extreme Southeast/Florida
will be the one area of persistent warmth through early Friday,
with morning lows in particular expected to be well above normal.
However, below normal temperatures should spread across the
Sunshine State by later Friday/Saturday after passage of the front
anchored by the system affecting much of the East.

...Over 150 million Americans are currently under Winter Storm
Warnings, Ice Storm Warnings, Winter Storm Watches, or Winter
Weather Advisories as impactful winter weather takes shape from
coast-to-coast...

...Major winter storm to spread heavy snow and significant ice
accumulations from the Plains to the Northeast...

...Frigid Arctic air and dangerously cold wind chills to persist
in the Heartland into next week...

There are no shortage of winter weather hazards across the Lower
48 over the next couple days. An Arctic high pressure system
supplying sub-freezing temperatures is working in tandem with an
active storm track to generate a large swath of accumulating
snowfall and treacherous ice accumulations. Icy conditions look to
linger around the Mid-Atlantic Sunday morning but should improve
throughout the day. While conditions improve in the Mid-Atlantic,
conditions will deteriorate throughout the day in the southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley as an upper-level trough in
the Southwest spawns a major winter storm over the South Central
U.S. The footprint from this winter storm is so large that parts
of South Texas are under Winter Storm Watches for the first time
in a decade. Periods of snow, falling heavily at times, will be
commons from New Mexico to the Mississippi Valley today with the
heaviest accumulations likely to occur in central Oklahoma and the
Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico. In addition to the snow,
significant ice accumulations are forecast from the Texas coast to
the Tennessee Valley from Sunday afternoon into Monday. The worst
ice-related impacts occur on Monday as a low pressure system
gathers strength in the Gulf of Mexico. The swath of accumulating
ice and snow on Monday is impressive, stretching from south Texas
to the northern Mid-Atlantic. Heavy snow on Monday will also
blanket much of the Lower Mississippi, the Ohio Valley, into the
Northeast. The forecast through early Tuesday morning calls for 8
to 12 inches in central Oklahoma with locally higher amounts
possible. An area of 4 to 8 inches of snow looks to extend from
east Texas and the Ohio Valley to the Northeast. Substantial ice
accumulations of up to a half inch are possible from the Lower
Mississippi Valley to the Tennessee Valley leading to dangerous
travel conditions, numerous power outages, and extensive tree
damage.

Wintry weather is also on tap in the Northwest and Intermountain
West as another Pacific storm system ushers in more Pacific
moisture to these regions. Lighter accumulations are anticipated
in the lower elevations, but the mountainous terrain will receive
the heaviest totals. Through Monday night, the Cascades are likely
to receive the most snowfall with accumulations being measured in
feet in the highest elevations. Snowfall over a foot is likely
from the Bitterroots of Idaho and Tetons of western Wyoming to the
Wasatch and central Rockies. Winter Storm Warnings, Winter Storm
Watches, and Winter Weather Advisories are located across most of
these areas, along with some ongoing Avalanche Warnings that are
in effect through Sunday evening.

The aforementioned Arctic high pressure system looks to maintain a
strong grip over the Nation's Heartland, causing many areas east
of the Rockies and west of the Appalachians to witness dangerous
and record-breaking cold into the first half of the upcoming week.
The north-central U.S. should once again see sub-zero high temps
on Sunday, with single digit highs stretching as far south as the
Texas Panhandle. Low temperatures are forecast to be range between
-20 to -30 degrees across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
Gusty winds throughout much of the Plains and Midwest continue to
foster life-threatening wind chills between -30 to -60 in the
north-central CONUS. Wind Chill Advisories extend as far south as
the Southern Plains and as far east as the Ohio Valley. Hundreds
of daily low maximum and minimum temperatures will be broken with
some February and even all-time low temperature records in
jeopardy. Daily temperature anomalies in the Southern Plains both
Sunday and Monday are likely to range from 25 to 40 degrees below
normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1137 AM CDT Wed Jul 14 2021

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

Morning observations and model guidance have increased confidence in
the potential for fire weather threats for western Wyoming.
Water-vapor imagery shows west/northwest flow over southwest WY,
which will support terrain-augmented winds sustained near 15-20 mph,
gusting up to 30-35 mph. Downslope warming/drying should allow RH
values to fall into the upper teens and low 20s. While these
conditions will likely be localized, very high ERC values in the
region will support a fire weather concern. To the north across
northwest WY, an isolated thunderstorm or two is possible this
afternoon within the higher terrain where lift will be maximized.
While it is still uncertain whether convection will occur, low PWAT
values below 0.6 inches depicted in GOES imagery and forecast
soundings suggest any storms that do develop will likely be dry. An
isolated dry-thunderstorm risk area was introduced to address this
potential.

All other areas remain on track with only minor adjustments needed.
See the discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 07/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1236 AM CDT Wed Jul 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
The shortwave trough in the northern Rockies will continue east into
the northern Plains and upper Great Lakes today. In its wake,
shortwave ridging will develop in the northern Rockies. A subtle
shortwave trough may impact parts of western Nevada, though there is
some differences in the timing of this feature evident in guidance.
Strong heating in the Northwest and northern Great Basin will
promote another thermal pressure trough east of the Cascades and
Sierra.

...Northwest...
Elevated conditions are expected east of the Cascades in Washington.
The thermal pressure trough will combine with a modest increase in
mid-level winds as broad cyclonic flow develops near the coast to
promote 15-20 mph winds. RH is still a bit in question as the
increase in onshore flow will mean some RH recovery will occur.
However, 20-25% is a reasonable estimate for within and immediately
downstream of the Cascade gaps and Columbia Gorge. Farther into the
Columbia Basin, RH may fall as low as near 15%, but winds will also
be weaker.

Locally elevated conditions are also possible east of the Cascades
in Oregon. A slightly diminished surface pressure gradient as
compared to Washington suggests the duration of these conditions may
not be more than an hour or two.

...Northwest Nevada...
Strong heating will induce a thermal surface trough. Surface winds
during the afternoon and early evening will increase to 15-20 mph.
RH of 10-20% is possible. With continued uncertainty as to the
position of the subtle shortwave trough, how widespread
elevated-level wind speeds will be is questionable.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Confidence remains low in seeing adequate dry thunderstorm coverage
for highlights. Wetting storms are expected in the Southwest and
into most of the Great Basin. Weak convective signals exist in parts
of the northern Rockies, but shortwave ridging aloft is expected to
suppress convection in most of the region.

Valid 12Z Sat Jul 17 2021 - 12Z Wed Jul 21 2021

...Western Heatwave with some records from the Great Basin to the
northern Rockies/Plains...

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Out West, potent upper ridge building from the Great Basin to the
northern Rockies/Plains this period will lead to a heatwave across
these regions. Temperatures are forecast to be the 90s and lower
100s at lower elevations this weekend into next week, which may
reach 10-20 degrees above normal. Expect some record values will
be observed. Temperatures in the Southwest will be slightly below
normal due to increased cloud cover and higher rainfall chances.
Showers and storms will be scattered across AZ/NM/southern CO
during the afternoon and early evening.

Downstream under the influence of rejuvenating upper troughing, a
wavy and slow moving front will work across the Plains, MS Valley,
OH Valley, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and settle over the
South/Southeast this period and spread less certain local foci for
convective rainfall. Showers and storms will be scattered to
numerous, with locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms locally
train.  High temperatures are forecast to fall below normal into
early next week due the clouds and showers in the vicinity of the
modestly cooling front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The bulk of guidance seems in good agreement through medium range
time scales in a pattern with overall above normal predictability.
The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from the
best clustered 06 UTC GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and ECMWF
ensembles along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. The 00

...Western Heatwave with some records from the Great Basin to the
northern Rockies/Plains...

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Out West, potent upper ridge building from the Great Basin to the
northern Rockies/Plains this period will lead to a heatwave across
these regions. Temperatures are forecast to be the 90s and lower
100s at lower elevations this weekend into next week, which may
reach 10-20 degrees above normal. Expect some record values will
be observed. Temperatures in the Southwest will be slightly below
normal due to increased cloud cover and higher rainfall chances.
Showers and storms will be scattered across AZ/NM/southern CO
during the afternoon and early evening.

Downstream under the influence of rejuvenating upper troughing, a
wavy and slow moving front will work across the Plains, MS Valley,
OH Valley, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and settle over the
South/Southeast this period and spread less certain local foci for
convective rainfall. Showers and storms will be scattered to
numerous, with locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms locally
train.  High temperatures are forecast to fall below normal into
early next week due the clouds and showers in the vicinity of the
modestly cooling front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The bulk of guidance seems in good agreement through medium range
time scales in a pattern with overall above normal predictability.
The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from the
best clustered 06 UTC GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and ECMWF
ensembles along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. The 00
UTC UKMET was not included in this blend as it seemed a bit

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 14 2021

SYNOPSIS: There continues to be high confidence regarding excessive heat
expanding across the north-central contiguous U.S. during week-1 and
persisting
into week-2, with parts of the Northern Great Plains and Upper Mississippi
Valley possibly experiencing maximum temperatures near or greater than 100 deg
F on multiple days and potentially reaching or exceeding daily records. Some
of
this heat may shift eastward later in the period, with excessive heat signals
increasing along the Eastern Seaboard during the second half of week-2. An
active North American Monsoon circulation is forecast to promote above-normal
precipitation and possible flooding over the Desert Southwest.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Great Plains and
Upper
Mississippi Valley, Thu-Fri, Jul 22-23.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern and Central
Rockies, Northern Great Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley, Thu-Sat, Jul
22-24.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Great Basin, Northern and
Central Rockies, Northern and Central Great Plains, Upper and Middle
Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes, Thu-Wed, Jul 22-28.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the mid-Atlantic and Southeast,
Sun-Wed, Jul 25-28.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across coastal portions of California,
Thu-Mon, Jul 22-26.

Possible flooding for portions of Arizona and New Mexico.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY JULY 17 - WEDNESDAY JULY 21:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!uL5FTh3SVrQzt50Ndkw3unakNDJd6gp8dkqJILKlxWNCp9UYI4_6F1wrZoI8YiMpJMYOANL2$

FOR THURSDAY JULY 22 - WEDNESDAY JULY 28: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles depict amplified ridging returning across the western CONUS during
week-1 with positive mid-level height anomalies building across the
north-central CONUS. By day-8 (July 22), the magnitude of the height anomalies
begin to wane compared to late in week-1, although elevated chances of
excessive heat continue into week-2, with anomalously warm overnight
temperatures also a concern. The greatest potential for excessive heat is
across portions of the Northern Great Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley
where
the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools depict at least a 60% chance of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th climatological percentile early in week-2.
Given the continued excellent model agreement, a high risk for excessive heat
is posted for the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley on July 22-23.
Triple digit temperatures are possible across these highlighted areas, with
some locations potentially challenging daily records. A moderate risk
continues
through July 24, and encompasses a broad area including parts of the Northern
and Central Rockies, Northern Great Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley where
the reforecast tools indicate some of these areas having at least a 40% chance
maximum temperatures exceed the 85th climatological percentile, which
translates to actual temperatures reaching into the 90s deg F across the
highlighted areas. A slight risk for excessive heat continues for all of
week-2
from the Great Basin eastward through the Middle and Upper Mississippi Valley
and Great Lakes.



By the second-half of week-2, the dynamical models depict the mean ridge axis
shifting from the western CONUS to the central CONUS. Although the amplitude
of
the mid-level ridge is forecast to decrease relative to earlier in the period,
the larger wavelength and broadening of the ridge favors an expansion of
positive 500-hPa height anomalies across parts of the eastern CONUS. The GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools depict parts of the mid-Atlantic and Southeast
having at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
climatological percentile and 95 deg F. Of additional concern is the increased
humidity forecast across the region, with heat risk guidance from the GEFS and
ECMWF ensembles indicating elevated probabilities of heat indices greater than
105 deg F across these areas. Due to these emerging heat signals, a slight
risk
for excessive heat is now posted across parts of the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast
for July 25-28.



The predicted placement of the mid-level height maximum across the Rockies
early in the period is expected to promote enhanced monsoonal moisture flow
across portions of the Desert Southwest. Although precipitation amounts in the
model guidance are not supportive of a heavy precipitation hazard due to the
lack of coherency in terms of timing and placement, the localized convective
nature of the precipitation could result in flash flooding across the valleys.
The highest risk remains across parts of Arizona and New Mexico where a
flooding possible hazard remains posted. Flash flooding can occur even in
areas
that do not receive any rain, and be a direct result of runoff from
precipitation upstream.



Surface high pressure remains forecast across the northeastern Pacific, into
parts of the Pacific Northwest, while thermal low pressure is anticipated over
the Great Basin and Desert Southwest during week-2, related to the
aforementioned anomalous ridging predicted. The strong mean pressure gradient
situated over coastal California increases chances for episodic high winds in
the region, where both reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph during the
early
and middle portion of week-2. Therefore, a slight risk of high winds remains
posted across coastal portions of northern and central California for July
22-26. Increased wind speeds could promote the spread of wildfires due to the
ongoing hot and dry conditions.



The slight risk for heavy precipitation posted in previous outlooks across the
Southern Great Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley has been discontinued as
the
associated frontal system is forecast to weaken, with much of the heavy rain
threat now focused in the week-1 period. Although the uncalibrated 0z ECMWF
continues to indicate increased chances of heavy rain across South Texas
lingering into day-8, it is not widespread enough to support a related hazard
given the loss of support from the GEFS and the marginal nature of the threat
to begin with.



A low amplitude mid-level pattern is favored for Alaska during week-2 with
troughing in the Bering Sea favoring increased precipitation chances across
portions of the western Mainland. Precipitation totals over a 3-day period are
forecast to be under an inch for most areas, precluding a related hazard from
being designated. Generally seasonable temperatures are forecast across the
state, with a slight tilt toward above normal temperatures across the eastern
Mainland, and below normal temperatures across the western Mainland.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 PM CDT Wed Jul 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

Recent short and medium range ensemble guidance depict higher
probabilities for convection across southwest MT into northeast ID
for tomorrow afternoon. This stronger signal, combined with forecast
soundings featuring dry boundary layers and PWAT values near 0.5
inches, have increased confidence in the dry thunderstorm potential.
Even if thunderstorms do manage to precipitate, fast storm motions
may limit the wetting rainfall potential. Storm coverage remains
uncertain owing to weak forcing for ascent. However, with seasonally
high ERCs and ongoing fire activity in this region, fire weather
concerns are possible and a dry thunderstorm risk area is
introduced.

Other areas generally remain on track per the previous discussion
(below). The Elevated risk area was expanded to include portions of
north-central NV and far southeast ID where guidance has trended
towards stronger winds compared to previous days. While 15-20 mph
winds are probable, they will likely be confined to a few hours
during the late afternoon. Patchy elevated wind/RH conditions are
possible in north-central MT, but the coverage of such conditions
remains uncertain.

..Moore.. 07/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Wed Jul 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level and surface patterns on Thursday will be similar to
Wednesday. Shortwave ridging aloft will shift slowly east into more
of the northern Plains. Cyclonic flow off the Northwest Coast will
also move more inland. Strong surface heating will again promote a
thermal pressure trough in the lee of the Cascades and the Sierra.
Mid-level moisture may make it farther north into the northern
Rockies as well.

...Cascade Gaps/Columbia Gorge...
With a similar atmospheric pattern in place, elevated conditions are
expected again in the lee of the Washington Cascades. Mid-level
winds will be somewhat more muted, but the surface gradient will be
similar. 15-20 mph winds are expected but will be more closely tied
to the terrain. With the onshore flow, RH recovery is a source of
uncertainty in the forecast. However, 20-25% in the immediate lee of
the terrain and 15-20% farther east is probable.

...Northwest Nevada...
Elevated conditions are anticipated in the lee of the Sierra by late
afternoon into early evening. 15-20 mph winds will coincide with
10-20% RH. Mid-level winds could be stronger than on Wednesday, but
this will again be tied to the timing of another shortwave trough.
Given that uncertainty, elevated highlights will continue to kept
near the terrain.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
With the potential for increased mid-level moisture in the northern
Rockies, there is some possibility that isolated thunderstorms could
develop in southwestern portions of Montana and perhaps adjacent
Idaho. Forecast soundings indicate that the atmospheric profile will
initially be quite dry. Without an obvious forcing mechanism outside
of the terrain, confidence remains low in whether storms will
initiate. Uncertainty in moisture quantity and timing precludes
highlights.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed July 14 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 20 - 24 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a weak ridge over the
southern Aleutians with above normal 500-hPa heights extending to Mainland
Alaska, and a trough over the eastern North Pacific centered near the coast of
western North America. A ridge is predicted over the western and central CONUS
with positive height anomalies extending to the Northern Plains and Great
Lakes. Downstream a positively tilted trough is predicted over the eastern
CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights from parts of the Southern Plains to
the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic region and Northeast.

Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated across eastern Mainland
Alaska underneath predicted above normal heights, while below normal
temperatures are favored for parts of western Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians, consistent with the consolidation tool. Above normal temperatures
are also favored for much of the western CONUS, the Northern Plains, and Great
Lakes due to the persistent ridging. A predicted trough over the eastern
CONUS,
as well as a weakness in the ridge over parts of the Southwest, favors
enhanced
probabilities of near to below normal temperatures from the Southern Rockies,
eastward to the eastern CONUS.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over much of Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians due to forecast westerly surface flow and storm
system
development. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over the Alaska
Panhandle and Northwest eastward to much of the northern CONUS due to positive
height anomalies. The positively tilted trough forecast in the eastern U.S.
supports a more southerly storm track, increasing the likelihood of above
normal precipitation for the Southern Plains and Southeast, except for the
southern Florida Peninsula, where below normal precipitation is favored,
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool. The position of the
predicted 500-hPa ridge and low-level flow is favorable for increased
monsoonal
moisture and above normal precipitation in the Southwest, extending into much
of the Great Basin.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 22 - 28 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to shift eastward and deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. The
temperature probability forecast during the week-2 period is very similar to
the 6-10 day period, with a couple of exceptions. Above normal temperature
probabilities are lower and cover less area in parts of Mainland Alaska due to
increased uncertainty. Near normal temperatures are favored over California
and
above normal temperature probabilities are increased over the Mid-Atlantic
Region due to forecast eastward progression of the mean troughs. The
precipitation probability forecast is also very similar to the 6-10 day
period,
though conditions in the southeastern CONUSare expected to become drier and
near normal precipitation over the Great Lakes.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Heavy rain and potential flooding for parts of the Central U.S.
and the Desert Southwest...

...Heat wave across the western U.S. abates through the end of the
week; some additional hot temperatures possible beginning this
weekend...

...Severe weather possible today over portions of the upper
Midwest, and New England...

The active summertime pattern of mainly afternoon/evening intense
thunderstorms with heavy downpours will continue to make weather
headlines through the middle of the week. This especially holds
true for portions of the Upper Midwest, Central Plains, the Desert
Southwest, and the Florida Peninsula. Through next week, a
sprawling slow moving cold front currently positioned from
northern Colorado into Quebec will meander southward, sparking
thunderstorm development along the way each day. The front
combined with several areas of enhanced lift aloft will support
storms with high rainfall rates over the Upper Mississippi Valley
today, where a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall remains until
tomorrow morning. In addition to the heavy rain threat today, an
Enhanced Risk of severe weather extends from North-Central Iowa
into West-Central Wisconsin through early tomorrow, per the Storm
Prediction Center. Damaging winds are anticipated to be the
primary threat over this area, although large hail and tornadoes
are also possible.

Over the Desert Southwest, monsoon season is in full swing, and
the upcoming week is expected to be no different. As rich monsoon
moisture wraps into the region, afternoon and evening showers are
expected to remain across the Four Corners each day, especially in
southern Arizona and western New Mexico. Given relatively weak
steering winds aloft, many of these storms will likely be slow
moving and result in flash floods for canyons, burn scars, and
other vulnerable areas. A Slight Risk for excessive rainfall is in
effect over Central Arizona and far western New Mexico today, and
Southeast Arizona/Southwest New Mexico tomorrow.

In the temperature department, the ongoing heat wave across much
of the western U.S. is abating across the Southwest as monsoonal
moisture increases, but noteworthy positive anomalies will still
exist across interior portions of the Pacific Northwest and Great
Basin through Thursday. Overnight low temperatures are expected to
be above normal as well and across a greater portion of the
western U.S. compared to the daytime highs. Unfortunately, the
return of triple digit highs are a distinct possibility over
Central Montana beginning Saturday, before spreading into Idaho
later this weekend as high pressure builds over the region.
Accordingly, an Excessive Heat Watch is in effect beginning from
Saturday through Wednesday evening.    Elsewhere, warm and humid
conditions will persist across much of the Eastern U.S. through
the end of the week before cooler weather arrives in time by
Saturday.

...Western Heatwave with some records from the Great Basin to the
northern Rockies/Plains...

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Out West, potent upper ridge building from the Great Basin to the
northern Rockies/Plains this period will lead to a heatwave across
these regions. Temperatures are forecast to be the 90s and lower
100s at lower elevations this weekend into next week, which may
reach 10-20 degrees above normal. Expect some record values will
be observed. Temperatures in the Southwest will be slightly below
normal due to increased cloud cover and higher rainfall chances.
Showers and storms will be scattered across AZ/NM/southern CO
during the afternoon and early evening.

Downstream under the influence of rejuvenating upper troughing, a
wavy and slow moving front will work across the Plains, MS Valley,
OH Valley, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and settle over the
South/Southeast this period and spread less certain local foci for
convective rainfall. Showers and storms will be scattered to
numerous, with locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms locally
train.  High temperatures are forecast to fall below normal into
early next week due the clouds and showers in the vicinity of the
modestly cooling front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The bulk of guidance seems in good agreement through medium range
time scales in a pattern with overall above normal predictability.
The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from the
best clustered 06 UTC GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and ECMWF
ensembles along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. The 00
UTC UKMET was not included in this blend as it seemed a bit
overdone with weekend closed low development over the Great Lakes
given lead-in flow. The favored WPC composite blend generally
maintains good continuity. Latest 12 UTC guidance now also seems
in line with this solution. This includes the 12 UTC UKMET that
has trended toward other guidance.

...Heatwave from the northern Great Basin to the northern
Rockies/northern Plains...

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
A potent upper ridge building from the Great Basin to the northern
Rockies/northern Plains this period will lead to a heatwave across
these regions. Temperatures are forecast to be the 90s and lower
100s at lower elevations this weekend into next week, which are
10-20 degrees above normal. Expect some record values will be
observed.
The above normal area expands east into MN and WI next week as
well. Temperatures in the Southwest will be slightly below normal
due to increased cloud cover and higher rainfall chances. Showers
and storms will be scattered across AZ/NM/southern CO/southern UT
during the afternoon and early evening.  The monsoon season has
been more active than last summer in AZ and the favorable
conditions are forecast to persist across AZ.  The GFS forecasts a
moisture plume from the Gulf of California north into AZ, with
above normal precipitable water values of 1.5-1.75 inches
persisting through Thu 22 July supporting the monsoonal convective
activity.

A wavy and slow moving front will move south down across the
Plains, MS Valley, OH Valley, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and
settle over the South/Southeast this period, with scattered to
numerous showers and thunderstorms, with locally heavier amounts
where thunderstorms locally train.  High temperatures are forecast
to fall below normal into early next week due the clouds and
showers in the vicinity of the modestly cooling front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The bulk of guidance seems in good agreement through early next
week in a pattern with overall above normal predictability, due to
both the large, sprawling anticyclone out west, plus slow movement
of the eastern US upper trough. The WPC medium range product suite
was primarily derived from the best clustered 12 UTC ECMWF/12z
ECMWF ensembles. Minor timing differences exist with the upper
trough in the east and anticyclone out west, but these differences
are less than usually observed days 5-7.  The favored WPC blend
generally maintains good continuity.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0106 AM CDT Thu Jul 15 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will slowly shift eastward through the northern
Rockies this afternoon. In the Northwest, broad cyclonic flow will
move inland. Mid-level moisture will reach as far north as the
Northern Rockies. At the surface, strong heating will promote
thermal pressure trough development in the lee of the Cascades and
the northern Sierra.

...Cascade Gaps/Columbia Gorge...
Westerly surface winds will increase during the day as the thermal
trough deepens. Winds of 15-20 mph are expected, though localized
20-25 mph may occur. RH within the terrain is the most uncertain as
onshore winds may elevated moisture. However, 15-25% appears likely
enough to support fire growth given the dry fuels.

...Northwest Nevada into south-central Idaho...
With the development of cyclonic flow along the West Coast,
mid-level winds are expected to increase as compared to Wednesday.
This, when combined with the surface trough, will drive 15-20 mph
winds across a good portion of the northern Great Basin. RH of
10-20% is expected during the afternoon.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Though synoptic forcing will be weak, mid-level moisture appears
sufficient for isolated thunderstorms from northern Utah into
southwestern Montana. Storm motions will be higher with northern
extent. The greatest risk for lightning ignitions will be from
west-central Utah into southwest Montana and adjacent central Idaho.
In these locations, PWAT of 0.5-0.7 will overlap with fast enough
storm motions to reduce potential for wetting rains.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0206 AM CDT Thu Jul 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level pattern on Friday will remain similar to Thursday
across the West. The trough off the Northwest coast will move closer
to shore and mid-level winds will increase across Washington and
Oregon. Surface troughing in the lee of the Cascades into the Great
Basin develop during the afternoon/evening. The upper ridge centered
on the Continental Divide is expected to build northward into the
northern High Plains and Canadian Prairies.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Though the ridge will intensify during the day, a slight increase in
mid-level moisture should allow convection to develop again in
southwest Montana, northwestern Wyoming, and adjacent Idaho.
Coverage will remain isolated. Storm motions will be similar, and
perhaps slightly quicker, than on Thursday. With continued low
potential for wetting rains, lightning ignitions will be possible in
these areas.

...Lee of Washington Cascades...
Though wind speeds will increase aloft, along with a modest surface
gradient present, a stronger push of marine air will likely keep RH
higher than previous days. Elevated conditions are only expected to
be localized.

Valid 12Z Thu Jul 15 2021 - 12Z Sat Jul 17 2021

...Heavy rain and potential flooding for parts of the Central U.S.
and the Desert Southwest...

...Heat wave across the western U.S. abates through the end of the
week; some additional hot temperatures possible beginning this
weekend...

...Severe weather possible across the Upper Mississippi Valley and
Upper Midwest...

Intense afternoon and evening thunderstorms with heavy downpours
will continue across the Upper Mississippi Valley, Upper Midwest
the Desert Southwest. Over the next few days a sprawling,
slow-moving cold front over the central/north-central U.S. will be
the focus for scattered to widespread thunderstorm development.
The environment over these regions will be conducive for high
rainfall rates. SPC is expected these storms to be strong/severe
over the Upper Mississippi Valley and has this area under an
Enhanced Risk. Damaging winds are anticipated to be the primary
threat over this area, although large hail and tornadoes are also
possible. WPC has much of this same area, including portions of
the Central Plains and Midwest, in a Slight Risk for excessive
rainfall through Friday morning. As the front slowly shifts
eastward, so will the precipitation footprint. The highest amounts
are expected across northern Illinois to Ohio Friday and over the
Mid-Atlantic and southern portions of the Northeast on Saturday.


Monsoon season is in full swing in the Desert Southwest. Moderate
to heavy rainfall has been observed this past week and more is on
the way. Diurnal heating combined with the deep moisture pooled
over the area will trigger afternoon and evening showers,
especially near the Four Corners region. Given relatively weak
steering winds aloft, many of these storms will likely be slow
moving and result in flash floods for canyons, burn scars, and
other vulnerable areas. A Slight Risk for excessive rainfall is in
effect over Central Arizona and far western New Mexico today and a
Marginal Risk area is in effect for eastern Arizona/western New
Mexico Friday and Saturday.

The ongoing heat wave across much of the western U.S. will relax
across the Southwest as monsoonal moisture increases, but
noteworthy positive anomalies will still exist across interior
portions of the Pacific Northwest and Great Basin through today.
Overnight low temperatures are expected to be above normal as well
and across a greater portion of the western U.S. compared to the
daytime highs. Daily maximums may return to the 100s this weekend
for portions of central Montana before spreading westward into
Idaho as high pressure builds. An Excessive Heat Watch is in
effect beginning from Saturday through Wednesday evening.
Elsewhere, warm and humid conditions will persist across much of
the Eastern U.S. through the end of the week before cooler weather
arrives in time by Saturday.

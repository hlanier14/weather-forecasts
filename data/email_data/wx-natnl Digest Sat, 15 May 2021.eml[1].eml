.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1248 AM CDT Fri May 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to amplify over the West today and
potentially develop into a closed upper low over northern CA by
Saturday morning. In response to this feature, a weak surface low is
forecast to develop over southern NV.

...Northern CA into southern OR...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms will be possible across
portions of northern CA into southern OR this afternoon and evening,
as the upper trough moves southeastward and amplifies over the
region. Relatively dry/well-mixed subcloud layers and low PW will
limit the potential for wetting rainfall. With fuels running dry
across the region, an isolated dry-thunderstorm area has been added
to cover the threat for lightning-based ignitions.

...Southwest...
In response to the approaching upper system and developing surface
low, a modest increase in southwesterly surface winds is expected
over portions of the Southwest. Elevated fire weather conditions
will be possible across portions of the lower CO River basin, where
sustained winds of greater than 15 mph are possible concurrent with
minimum RH values of 10-20%.

...Eastern ND into northern MN...
Scattered thunderstorms are again expected this afternoon from
eastern ND into northwest MN. While low-level moisture will remain
relatively limited, an increase in PW (compared to Thursday) and
slow storm motions should result in generally wet thunderstorms.
However, with very dry fuels over the region, there may be a nonzero
threat of lightning-based ignitions with strikes that occur away
from the heavier precipitation cores.

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 141748
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 14 2021

SYNOPSIS: An amplified pattern is forecast across the contiguous U.S. during
week-1 with mid-level low pressure forecast over the West and mid-level high
pressure over the East. This set-up favors enhanced southerly flow into the
south-central states, with the potential for several inches of rainfall
through
day-7. Although the heaviest rainfall is forecast to occur prior to the start
of the week-2 period, increased run-off is likely to result in lingering
flooding concerns across the Lower Mississippi River Valley early in the
period. Mid-level flow over Alaska is predicted to be near normal, decreasing
the chances for widespread hazards over the state.

HAZARDS

Flooding possible for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MAY 17 - FRIDAY MAY 21:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!uLHRsW2EB5zfQ-5rIQaW9jL9Aww8EtL1Gauhyvb7q2wKfI7CTIKo5wSapNMda3WK1KT5CrYh$

FOR SATURDAY MAY 22 - FRIDAY MAY 28: A negatively tilted mid-level trough
situated over the West is forecast to result in increased southerly flow over
portions of the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley during week-1. The Weather
Prediction Center indicates 7-day rainfall totals of 1-5 inches across a large
area of the south-central states. By the time week-2 begins, the rain is
forecast to be winding down across the region, although some lingering
episodes
are still possible early on. The dynamical model guidance from the GEFS and
ECMWF ensemble does not depict rainfall totals exceeding hazards thresholds on
day-8 (May 22) and beyond, and therefore the slight risk of heavy
precipitation
is discontinued. The primary concern will be the enhanced surface runoff due
to
the antecedent heavy precipitation, which may result in ongoing flooding along
the Lower Mississippi River Valley extending into week-2. Observed soil
moisture levels exceed the 90th historical percentile across this region,
which

Anomalously cold temperatures are possible across the Northern Rockies at the
onset of the period, associated with the aforementioned troughing over the
West. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts some areas having at least a 20%
chance
that minimum temperatures drop below the 15th percentile and freezing on May
22, with the GEFS being less robust. Given the marginal nature of the threat,
and with little in the way of impacts expected, a related temperature hazard
is
not posted. The trough is forecast to weaken by the middle of the period
ushering in a warming trend across the West. The GEFS is particularly notable
at expanding ridging and positive height anomalies westward later in week-2,
which may result in heat concerns for portions of the Desert Southwest as the
GEFS reforecast tool depicts a 20% chance maximum temperatures exceed the 85th
percentile and 105 deg F by the end of the period. However, the ECMWF is
slower
with the evolution and as a result, not enough confidence exists to post a
related excessive heat hazard at this time, but trends will continue to be
monitored into next week.



Mid-level ridging is predicted across the eastern CONUS at the beginning of
the
period, which supports anomalously warm temperatures over many areas of the
East. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance
that some areas of the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley, Tennessee Valley, Northeast, and mid-Atlantic experience maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile. However, temperatures are not
anticipated to reach 90 deg F, precluding a related excessive heat risk from
being designated at this time. As associated surface high pressure moves over
the Southwest Atlantic, enhanced easterly flow is possible across the Florida
Peninsula, which may increase rainfall chances, although hazards thresholds
are
unlikely to be reached.



Weak mid-level flow is forecast for Alaska during week-2, limiting concerns
for
widespread hazards based on predefined hazardous threshold criteria. By week-2
the vast majority of river ice should be broken up across Alaska, thus no
temperature concerns are apparent.

...Heavy rain threat for the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley next week...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Latest models and ensembles continue to support the threat of a
multi-day heavy rain event across the south-central U.S. well into
next week.  Subtle changes within the associated upper trough in
recent model runs have generally resulted in a northward shift in
the frontal boundary forecast to slowly lift northward as a warm
front, which in turn resulted in a northward shift in the heavy
rain axis.  The heaviest rains/convection remain generally south
of this front.  The 00Z ECMWF represented the southern-most
guidance regarding the heavy rain axis in contrast with the latest
12Z run which moved the frontal boundary significantly farther to
the north later next week.  The GFS has been faster than the 00Z
ECMWF and has been carrying more energy downstream to extend the
rain axis into the Ohio Valley.  A consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS, together with the 00Z CMC was used to handle
this system.

Toward the latter part of next week, the 12Z ECMWF yesterday
started to depict a much more amplified trough digging into the
West Coast.  The CMC and now the GFS have followed suit into
agreeing with this scenario.  On the other hand, both the ECMWF
and CMC have backed off from forming a closed low over New England
later next week in agreement with the more progressive GFS.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  This yielded a
solution close to WPC continuity but with a northward shift in the
frontal position across the Plains, and a more progressive and
deeper upper trough moving into the West later next week.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A favored model and ensemble composite solution indicates that
deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return into an
emerging and slow moving south-central U.S. frontal system next
week. This will occur in downstream response to the slow ejection
and passage of a southern stream upper-level trough/low energies
forecast to exit the southern Rockies. Expect a multi-day period
with a threat of significant rainfall along with periods of
increased instability and strong to severe convection. Locations
and magnitude of heaviest rainfall will likely vary on a
day-to-day basis and some specifics may take until well into the
short range to be resolved, but the guidance signal for a wet
pattern over the south-central U.S. has been consistent.
Meanwhile, the Midwest eastward into the Mid-Atlantic may see one
or more convective systems aided by a wavy front and uncertain
northern shortwave energy aloft to focus moisture and instability.
Well south, late period moisture/vorticity influx underneath a
building Southeast upper ridge may support some organized heavy
downpours over southern Florida.

The favored GEFS/ECMWF ensemble mean solution over the West
mid-later next week would support mainly moderate precipitation
from the Pacific Northwest out across the north-central
Intermountain West/Rockies to include some mountain snows. Ahead
of the Pacific front that moves into the West next week, lead
maximum temperatures 10-20F above normal will also progress from
the Northwest U.S. eastward though the northern Rockies/Plains
early next week. A cooling trend behind the front may bring 5-10F
below normal temperatures.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri May 14 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 20 - 24 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian dynamical models are in good agreement with
regard to today's 6-10 day 500-hPa geopotential height pattern over the CONUS.
However, a lot of uncertainty among the models in the predicted mid-level
height pattern over Alaska continues, leading to weak 500-hPa height anomalies
state-wide. An amplified, negatively-tilted mid-level trough over the western
CONUS favors below normal 500-hPa heights over the Rockies, extending into the
Southern Plains to the western Gulf Coast. Negative height anomalies are also
favored over eastern Maine, associated with a strong mean mid-level trough
over
the Canadian Maritimes. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies are likely elsewhere
across the CONUS, underneath a mean mid-level ridge centered over the Great
Lakes.

Forecast tools agree well favoring above normal temperatures across much of
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, with the highest probabilities in the
southwestern Mainland and eastern Aleutians, where mean surface flow is likely
to be more southerly. Increased mid-level mean troughing and associated below
normal 500-hPa geopotential heights favor below normal temperatures for the
southeastern Alaska Panhandle, extending into the Pacific Northwest, where
odds
for below normal temperatures are enhanced (>60%). Enhanced probabilities of
above normal temperatures are favored to extend from the Great Plains eastward
to the East Coast, underneath an amplified mean ridge that is expected to
dominate much of the eastern CONUS. Above normal temperature probabilities
diminish to near normal in the south-central CONUS, due to a cut-off low
pressure system early in the period.

Despite model disagreement regarding the mean surface flow pattern over
Alaska,
southerly flow is favored over southern portions of the state, tilting odds
toward above-normal precipitation in Southwest Mainland Alaska and the eastern
Aleutians. Mean surface flow shifts from southerly to east-northeasterly in
western Mainland Alaska, favoring weak odds of below normal precipitation.
Increased onshore flow in the Pacific Northwest leads to probabilities of
above
normal precipitation that extend across the northern Rockies. However, mean
surface flow shifts to northeasterly from the north-central California Coast
eastward to the Front Range of the Rockies, favoring below normal
precipitation. Surface high pressure off the Eastern Seaboard increases
chances
of below normal precipitation for the eastern Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and
Northeast. To the southwest and west of surface high pressure in the East,
southeasterly and southerly mean surface flow enhances odds of above normal
precipitation over Florida and the Great Plains, respectively.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement in the model precipitation and temperature forecasts over the CONUS,
offset by large differences in the predicted mid-level geopotential height
fields over Alaska and the precipitation fields in the Pacific Northwest.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 22 - 28 2021

There is good overall agreement among the models in the predicted 500-hPa
height pattern over the CONUS during the Week-2 period. However, the models
differ in the mid-level height pattern across Alaska, with the GEFS favoring
above normal 500-hPa heights, while the ECMWF and Canadian models continue to
favor near and below normal mid-level heights. Above normal 500-hPa
geopotential heights are favored over CONUS, despite weak mean cyclonic
mid-level flow over the western CONUS, as that region is sandwiched between
ridges over the North Pacific and eastern CONUS.

Due to better agreement between the ECMWF and Canadian models with respect to
the mid-level height pattern over Alaska, mean southerly to southwesterly
surface flow is favored over southern Alaska, increasing odds for above normal
temperatures across the southern Mainland and the Aleutians. Relative mean
mid-level troughing over the West favors probabilities of below normal
temperatures over the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies. Mean
southwesterly mid-level flow leads to increased odds of above normal
temperatures in the Four Corners region. Enhanced probabilities of above
normal
temperatures correspond to the greatest positive 500-hPa anomalies over the
eastern CONUS.

Mean southerly to southwesterly flow over southern Alaska tilts odds toward
above normal precipitation over the Southwest Mainland and eastern Aleutians.
As in the 6-10 day period, mean surface flow over much of the West is not
favorable for any moisture transport, leading to below normal precipitation
probabilities over portions of the Pacific Northwest, central West Coast, and
central and southern Rockies. Mean surface high pressure is expected to
continue from the 6-10 day period into the Week-2 period over the Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast, favoring below normal precipitation. To the south and west of
surface high pressure in the East, and downstream of the mid-level trough over
the West, increased odds for above normal precipitation are favored over the
Central and Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley, extending southeastward to
Florida. Over northern Montana, the potential for a couple of surface low
pressure systems during the Week-2 period tilts odds toward above normal
precipitation.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
generally good agreement among the ensemble model guidance in the predicted
mid-level height, temperature, and precipitation fields across the forecast
domain, despite weak probability fields in several of the precipitation
forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

0229 PM CDT Fri May 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

Expanded the elevated area northwest farther into Nevada based on
latest high resolution guidance. Otherwise, the current forecast
appears on track.

..Bentley.. 05/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CDT Fri May 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper low forecast to be centered over northern CA Saturday
morning is expected to move slowly southeastward across central into
southern CA through the period. A broad, weak surface low extending
from southern NV toward the Four Corners vicinity is forecast to
move little through the day.

...Southwest...
Southwesterly surface winds will increase on Saturday across the
Southwest as the upper low gradually approaches the region through
the day. Elevated conditions are expected this afternoon into the
early evening across portions of the lower CO River basin and
vicinity, as sustained winds increase to 15-20 mph (with higher
gusts) and RH values drop below 15%. Some locally critical
conditions will be possible where winds are locally stronger, but
the overall threat appears too limited for an upgrade at this time.

...Northern California...
At least isolated thunderstorm development is possible across
northern CA Saturday afternoon, in conjunction with the upper low.
Gradually increasing moisture will result in somewhat greater
rainfall potential compared to D1/Friday, so no isolated
dry-thunderstorm area has been included at this time. However, the
risk for lightning ignitions will be nonzero where dry fuels are
available, and highlights may eventually be needed depending on
guidance trends and observed rainfall (if any) from D1/Friday.

...Heavy rain threat for the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley next week...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Latest models and ensembles continue to support the threat of a
multi-day heavy rain event across the south-central U.S. well into
next week.  Subtle changes within the associated upper trough in
recent model runs have generally resulted in a northward shift in
the frontal boundary forecast to slowly lift northward as a warm
front, which in turn resulted in a northward shift in the heavy
rain axis.  The heaviest rains/convection remain generally south
of this front.  The 00Z ECMWF represented the southern-most
guidance regarding the heavy rain axis in contrast with the latest
12Z run which moved the frontal boundary significantly farther to
the north later next week.  The GFS has been faster than the 00Z
ECMWF and has been carrying more energy downstream to extend the
rain axis into the Ohio Valley.  A consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS, together with the 00Z CMC was used to handle
this system.

Toward the latter part of next week, the 12Z ECMWF yesterday
started to depict a much more amplified trough digging into the
West Coast.  The CMC and now the GFS have followed suit into
agreeing with this scenario.  On the other hand, both the ECMWF
and CMC have backed off from forming a closed low over New England
later next week in agreement with the more progressive GFS.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  This yielded a
solution close to WPC continuity but with a northward shift in the
frontal position across the Plains, and a more progressive and
deeper upper trough moving into the West later next week.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A favored model and ensemble composite solution indicates that
deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return into an
emerging and slow moving south-central U.S. frontal system next
week. This will occur in downstream response to the slow ejection
and passage of a southern stream upper-level trough/low energies
forecast to exit the southern Rockies. Expect a multi-day period
with a threat of significant rainfall along with periods of
increased instability and strong to severe convection. Locations
and magnitude of heaviest rainfall will likely vary on a
day-to-day basis and some specifics may take until well into the
short range to be resolved, but the guidance signal for a wet
pattern over the south-central U.S. has been consistent.
Meanwhile, the Midwest eastward into the Mid-Atlantic may see one
or more convective systems aided by a wavy front and uncertain
northern shortwave energy aloft to focus moisture and instability.
Well south, late period moisture/vorticity influx underneath a
building Southeast upper ridge may support some organized heavy
downpours over southern Florida.

The favored GEFS/ECMWF ensemble mean solution over the West
mid-later next week would support mainly moderate precipitation
from the Pacific Northwest out across the north-central
Intermountain West/Rockies to include some mountain snows. Ahead
of the Pacific front that moves into the West next week, lead
maximum temperatures 10-20F above normal will also progress from
the Northwest U.S. eastward though the northern Rockies/Plains
early next week. A cooling trend behind the front may bring 5-10F
below normal temperatures.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central/Southern High Plains Friday night through Saturday...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Great Basin/Southwest Friday and Saturday...

A quasi-stationary front will be the impetus for the spread of
scattered to severe thunderstorms across much of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley over the next couple of days. Showers and
thunderstorms are expected for the Rockies and parts of the Plains
tonight. A new area of surface low pressure will develop along
this boundary, over the foothills of the Rockies, tonight and
begin pulling moisture and warm air into the Plains. This will
lead to destabilization and the Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms for parts of the Central/Southern Plains through
tomorrow. As this system organizes, a warm front will develop and
act as a forcing mechanism/focus for scattered thunderstorm
activity across the Central/Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley
through Saturday before spreading into the Ohio Valley and
Mid-Atlantic by Sunday. Rainfall rates will remain low enough to
not warrant any serious flash flood concerns, despite there being
a likelihood of multiple inches of rain falling over parts of the
Central Central/Southern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley
through Sunday.

Elsewhere, parts of the Southwest and Lower Great Basin are under
a Critical Fire Weather threat through the weekend due to
southwesterly flow leading to dry conditions. Red Flag warnings
are in effect for these areas, as well as Northern California into
southern Oregon where dry isolated thunderstorms may develop. Much
of the Northwest into the Northern Plains as well as New England
will experience a warm-up while the Midwest and
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast go through a bit of a cool spell this
weekend. Temperatures are likely to plunge as low as 25 degrees
below normal for parts of the North Carolina coast this evening.

...Heavy rain threat for the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley next week...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of reasonably well clustered mid-larger scale
guidance of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS, 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean
along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Smaller scale
system differences and convective rainfall focus details remain
much less certain. Latest 00 UTC models and ensembles are overall
in line with this favored composite plan.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return into an
emerging and slow moving south-central U.S. frontal system next
week. This will occur in downstream response to the slow ejection
and passage of a southern stream upper-level trough/low energies
forecast to exit the southern Rockies to lift over the Plains.
Expect a multi-day period with a threat of significant rainfall
along with periods of increased instability and strong to severe
convection. Locations and magnitude of heaviest rainfall will
likely vary on a day-to-day basis and some specifics may take
until well into the short range to be resolved, but the guidance
signal for a wet pattern mainly over the south-central U.S. has
been consistent. Meanwhile over-top, the Midwest eastward may see
one or more convective systems aided by a wavy front and uncertain
northern shortwave energy aloft to focus moisture and instability.
Well south, late period moisture/vorticity underneath a building
Southeast upper ridge may support some heavy downpours for
southern Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. The 12/18 UTC GFS
runs seemed too aggressive developing an organized low, but the 00
UTC run backed off.

Mid-later next week digging of amplified upper troughing over the
West will support widespread moderate precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest through the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies, including some mountain snows. Ahead of the Pacific
front that moves into the West, maximum temperatures 10-20F above
normal will progress from the Northwest U.S. though the northern
Rockies/Plains early next week. A post-frontal cooling trend may
bring 10-20F below normal temperatures into the Intermountain
West.

...Heavy rain threat for the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley next week...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of reasonably well clustered mid-larger scale
guidance of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS, 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean
along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Smaller scale
system differences and convective rainfall focus details remain
much less certain. Latest 00 UTC models and ensembles are overall
in line with this favored composite plan.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return into an
emerging and slow moving south-central U.S. frontal system next
week. This will occur in downstream response to the slow ejection
and passage of a southern stream upper-level trough/low energies
forecast to exit the southern Rockies to lift over the Plains.
Expect a multi-day period with a threat of significant rainfall
along with periods of increased instability and strong to severe
convection. Locations and magnitude of heaviest rainfall will
likely vary on a day-to-day basis and some specifics may take
until well into the short range to be resolved, but the guidance
signal for a wet pattern mainly over the south-central U.S. has
been consistent. Meanwhile over-top, the Midwest eastward may see
one or more convective systems aided by a wavy front and uncertain
northern shortwave energy aloft to focus moisture and instability.
Well south, late period moisture/vorticity underneath a building
Southeast upper ridge may support some heavy downpours for
southern Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. The 12/18 UTC GFS
runs seemed too aggressive developing an organized low, but the 00
UTC run backed off.

Mid-later next week digging of amplified upper troughing over the
West will support widespread moderate precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest through the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies, including some mountain snows. Ahead of the Pacific
front that moves into the West, maximum temperatures 10-20F above
normal will progress from the Northwest U.S. though the northern
Rockies/Plains early next week. A post-frontal cooling trend may
bring 10-20F below normal temperatures into the Intermountain
West.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NV...SOUTHWEST
UT...NORTHWEST AZ...

...Synopsis...
An upper low over northern CA is expected to move slowly
southeastward across central into southern CA today into tonight. A
broad surface low extending from southern NV toward the Four Corners
vicinity is forecast to remain nearly stationary through the day.

...Southwest...
Southwesterly surface winds will increase today across the Southwest
as the upper low gradually approaches the region. Elevated to
critical conditions are expected this afternoon into the early
evening across portions of the lower CO River basin and vicinity, as
sustained winds increase to 15-25 mph (with higher gusts) and RH
values drop into the 5-15% range. A critical area has been added for
portions of southern NV, southwest UT, and northwest AZ, where
confidence is highest in seeing a sufficient duration of critical
conditions. An elevated area has also been added for southeast AZ
into southwest NM, where a separate belt of slightly stronger
low-level flow is forecast to overlap with critically low RH.

There is also some potential for (mostly) dry thunderstorm activity
from far eastern AZ into western NM, though coverage in those areas
could remain quite isolated.

...Northern California...
Scattered thunderstorm development is possible today across northern
CA, in conjunction with the upper low. Gradually increasing moisture
will result in somewhat greater rainfall potential compared to
Friday, so no isolated dry-thunderstorm area has been included.
However, the risk for lightning ignitions will be nonzero where dry
fuels are available.

...Northern ND into northwest MN...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible this afternoon across northern
ND into northwest MN. While some spotty rainfall occurred over
northeast ND on Friday, much of this area remains in long-term
drought. Any thunderstorms today would likely be rather dry, and
there may be some potential for ignitions with any strikes occurring
in an area with available fuels. Confidence is too low to include
any highlights at this time, however.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0125 AM CDT Sat May 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper low forecast to be over southern CA Sunday morning is
expected to move eastward toward the Four Corners region by the end
of the period Monday morning. A surface low initially over the Great
Basin vicinity is expected to weaken, as another weak surface low
develops over the southern High Plains.

...Southwest into west TX...
Another day of elevated to potentially critical conditions is
expected on Sunday across portions of the Southwest, as the upper
low shifts slowly eastward. Modestly enhanced low-level flow will
persist across much of AZ and spread into portions of NM and west TX
by afternoon. Sustained winds of 15-20 mph (locally higher) are
expected concurrent with RH values in the 5-15% range. Confidence
regarding the coverage and duration of critical conditions is too
low for an upgrade at this time.

...Northern ND into northwest MN...
Dry conditions are expected to persist from northern ND into
northwest MN on Sunday, within a region suffering from long-term
drought. Guidance varies with regard to the strength of low-level
flow on Sunday, with some models suggesting sufficient flow to
support the potential for elevated to locally critical conditions,
while other models keep the stronger flow north of the international
border across the southern Canadian Prairies. If confidence
increases in stronger low-level flow across this region for Sunday,
then highlights may need to be added in future updates.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Central/Southern High Plains through Sunday morning...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the Great
Basin/Southwest through Sunday morning...

A quasi-stationary front extends from Middle Mississippi Valley
westward to the Central/Southern High Plains, then into the Great
Basin through Monday morning. Moisture from the Western Gulf of
Mexico will stream northward over the Plains and the Mississippi
Valley that will help produce showers and thunderstorms over parts
of the Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley
through Monday.  Additionally, the showers and thunderstorms will
also develop over parts of the Northern/Central Rockies into the
Great Basin.  The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Central/Southern High Plains on
Saturday.  The main threats from the severe thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few
tornadoes.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy over the Upper Midwest will produce
rain over the area through Saturday night.  On Saturday, rain will
develop over parts of the Great Lakes and the Northeast. On
Sunday, the light rain will expand into parts of the Mid-Atlantic.
 An upper-level low will develop over parts of California on
Saturday into Sunday that will move into parts of the
Southwest/Great Basin overnight Sunday into Monday.  The energy
will produce scattered rain over parts of California.
Additionally, as the upper-level low develops, dry conditions and
gusty winds have led to a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts
of the Great Basin/Southwest through Sunday morning.

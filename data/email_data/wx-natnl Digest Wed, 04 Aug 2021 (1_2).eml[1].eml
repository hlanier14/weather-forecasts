Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1150 AM CDT Tue Aug 03 2021

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

Only minor modifications were made to the IsoDryT area to account
for morning convective-allowing model guidance. Otherwise, the
forecast appears on track. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 08/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1243 AM CDT Tue Aug 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
Another round of isolated thunderstorms is expected across the
Pacific Northwest this afternoon as a pair of weak upper-level
disturbances move into the region. This will pose a threat for at
least a few dry lightning strikes over dry fuels. Localized
wind-driven fire weather concerns are possible across northern
California, but weak winds elsewhere will mitigate additional fire
weather potential.

...Pacific Northwest...
Although drier air has begun filtering into the region, 00z observed
soundings and forecast soundings suggest lingering mid-level
moisture and gradually cooling temperatures aloft will support weak
instability by this afternoon. The general thermodynamic environment
appears similar to the previous 24 hours, which supported a mix of
wet and dry thunderstorms over OR. As such, a similar scenario is
expected today as a pair of weak upper-level shortwave troughs
(noted in water-vapor imagery off the CA and WA coasts) migrate
through the region. In addition to dry lightning strikes,
thunderstorms may produce strong outflow winds (see the Day 1
Convective Outlook for details). Precipitation over the past 48
hours has been sparse enough to maintain dry fuels over the region,
which will support another day of lightning-driven fire weather
concerns.

...Northern California...
Very dry conditions will persist across much of CA and into southern
OR today with RH values in the single digits to teens likely.
Although southwesterly flow aloft will increase somewhat with the
passage of an upper-level wave, the surface response is expected to
be weak with 10-15 mph winds likely across northern CA. Locations
that typically see terrain-enhanced winds will likely see periods of
elevated fire weather conditions, though this threat appears too
limited spatially and temporally to warrant highlights at this time.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
125 PM EDT Tue Aug 03 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Aug 06 2021 - 12Z Tue Aug 10 2021

...Overview...

The pattern switches to troughing in the Northwest and broad
ridging over the central and eastern CONUS through this weekend. A
drier pattern overall is expected with rainfall focused mostly
along the Canadian border, across the Upper Midwest, with some
along the Gulf Coast and into the Southwest. Temperatures will
return to above normal in the East while the Northwest stays below
normal under the trough.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The main features to track among guidance are a shortwave trough
over the northern Great Basin Friday morning that shifts east to
the northern Great Lakes through Sunday night and low pressure
centered over BC/Alberta Friday/Saturday and how a reinforcing
shortwave trough/low interacts with it. There is decent agreement
with these features among global guidance on Friday. The 00Z UKMET
is the slowest with the Great Basin trough, so is was removed from
the blend on Day 4. Regarding the western Canada low, the 00Z
ECMWF has the strongest reinforcing low from the Gulf of Alaska
and maintains that low, shifting it to WA by Sunday/Day 5.
Meanwhile the 06Z/12Z GFS has the most interaction with the Gulf
of Alaska low and the western Canada low with both shearing with
general troughing over the Canadian Prairies by Day 5 that does
extend west to the PacNW. The 00Z CMC is essentially a more
progressive version of the ECMWF.
Given the deterministic differences, and similarities of the 00Z
ECENS/06Z GEFS means, went heavier toward an ensemble mean
solution, particularly for Days 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Stalled frontal boundary along the Carolina Coast dissipates
Friday into Saturday as the responsible upper trough weakens.
Rainfall will shift out of the northern Rockies to the Upper
Midwest and Great Lakes for this weekend ahead of a shortwave
trough south of a main low over BC/Alberta and then lingers into
next week over the same area ahead of the parent trough that
ejects east across the Canadian Prairies. Rainfall could be heavy
at times Saturday night through Monday night over portions of the
Upper Midwest. Monsoon rains persist, but look to be suppressed
south/limited to AZ through the medium range period.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest behind the lead cold front Friday through this
weekend, potentially continuing into next week depending on the
low track from the Gulf of Alaska. Ahead of this lead cold front,
temperatures will be 5 to 12 degrees above normal over the Plains
Friday and this weekend before expanding to the East Coast Monday.
A ridge over the Southeast sets up by Sunday and looks to persist
well into next week bringing an extended heat wave from of the
Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.

extend west to the PacNW. The 00Z CMC is essentially a more
progressive version of the ECMWF.
Given the deterministic differences, and similarities of the 00Z
ECENS/06Z GEFS means, went heavier toward an ensemble mean
solution, particularly for Days 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Stalled frontal boundary along the Carolina Coast dissipates
Friday into Saturday as the responsible upper trough weakens.
Rainfall will shift out of the northern Rockies to the Upper
Midwest and Great Lakes for this weekend ahead of a shortwave
trough south of a main low over BC/Alberta and then lingers into
next week over the same area ahead of the parent trough that
ejects east across the Canadian Prairies. Rainfall could be heavy
at times Saturday night through Monday night over portions of the
Upper Midwest. Monsoon rains persist, but look to be suppressed
south/limited to AZ through the medium range period.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest behind the lead cold front Friday through this
weekend, potentially continuing into next week depending on the
low track from the Gulf of Alaska. Ahead of this lead cold front,
temperatures will be 5 to 12 degrees above normal over the Plains
Friday and this weekend before expanding to the East Coast Monday.
A ridge over the Southeast sets up by Sunday and looks to persist
well into next week bringing an extended heat wave from of the
Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.

300 PM EDT August 03 2021

SYNOPSIS: There continues to be relatively good multi-model agreement
indicating positive mid-level height anomalies for the northwestern and
northeastern lower 48 during week-2. This pattern supports increased chance=
s
for excessive heat across these areas. Enhanced moisture levels across part=
s
of
the eastern contiguous U.S. at the beginning of the period may support heat
index values exceeding 90 Deg F across parts of New England and the
Appalachians and 100 Deg F across portions of the Mid-Atlantic at the
beginning
of the period. The mid-level pattern is anticipated to generally weaken
throughout week-2, with the potential for weak mid-level low pressure formi=
ng
over the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes by the middle of the period. Near to
below
normal heights are predicted for much of mainland Alaska and the Aleutians,
with above normal heights across the Alaska panhandle.

FOR WEDNESDAY AUGUST 11 - TUESDAY AUGUST 17: There is relatively good
agreement
in the 0Z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensemble means indicating positive
mid-level height anomalies over the northwestern and northeastern lower 48
during week-2. This pattern combined with anticipated enhanced moisture acr=
oss
parts of the eastern CONUS increases the likelihood for excessive heat acro=
ss
the northeastern CONUS. A slight risk of excessive heat is posted for parts=
 of
the northeastern CONUS, Aug 11 to 13, where the calibrated GEFS and ECMWF h=
eat
tools indicate at least a 20% chance of heat index values exceeding the 85t=
h
percentile. Given an increased signal for heat in the guidance, a moderate
risk
of excessive heat is posted for parts of the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Centr=
al
Appalachians, and Great Lakes, Aug 11 to 12 where the heat tools show at le=
ast
a 40% chance of heat index values exceeding the 90th percentile. Heat index
values may reach or exceed 90 Deg F across parts of New England, the Great
Lakes, and Appalachians, 95 Deg F across parts of the Ohio Valley, and trip=
le
digits across parts of the Mid-Atlantic. Of additional concern is the
potential
for some of the risk areas having nighttime temperatures in the upper 70s a=
nd
low 80s.



The 0Z GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means show a transition from mid-level
troughing
across the northwestern CONUS to weak mid-level ridging at the beginning of
the
period. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies across the Northwest support abov=
e
normal temperatures across parts of the western third of the CONUS. There i=
s
better agreement today between the raw 0Z GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means
showing
positive maximum temperature anomalies exceeding 10 Deg F across parts of t=
he
Northwest throughout much of week-2. A slight risk of excessive heat is
highlighted for parts of the Pacific Northwest, where both reforecast tools
show at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile and temperatures reaching hazards criteria (90 Deg F across high=
er
elevation areas).



Across the Four Corners region, there continues to be variability within th=
e
models in their depiction of the mid-level ridge placement, with the 500-hP=
a
height peak generally favored across the southern portion of the Four Corne=
rs
region, which would be less conducive to enhanced monsoonal flow and result=
ant
heavy precipitation. As of 11:00am PDT, the National Hurricane Center has a=
  a
30% chance for tropical cyclone formation during the next 5 days  off the
coast
of Southern Mexico. Due to the enhanced phase of the Madden Julian Oscillat=
ion
(MJO), there is an increased potential for tropical cyclone activity  in th=
e
East Pacific during the period which could promote enhanced moisture and
enhanced precipitation for the Four Corners region. Despite the reforecast
tools and raw daily ensemble means not indicating increased chances for
widespread heavy precipitation, there is still a possibility for thundersto=
rm
activity and resulting localized flash flooding, especially if a tropical
cyclone forms and tracks closer to Baja California.



The 0Z GEFS and 0Z ECMWF indicate the possibility of frontal activity along=
 or
near the South Coast of Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle from the beginning =
to
middle of the period. This feature, in addition to potentially southerly mo=
ist
flow associated with surface high pressure over the Gulf of Alaska, may
support
enhanced precipitation across parts of the southwestern Mainland and the
Alaska
Panhandle from the beginning to middle of week-2. The GEFS reforecast tool
shows at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85t=
h
percentile and 1.5 inches across southeastern coastal Mainland Alaska where=
as
the ECMWF reforecast tool is unsupportive of heavy totals . Due to high mod=
el
uncertainty and accumulated totals predicted to not exceed hazards threshol=
ds,
a related precipitation hazard is not posted at this time.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue August 03 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 09 - 13 2021

A major summertime pattern change is likely by early next week as 500-hPa
ridging replaces the amplified trough that is currently located over easter=
n
North America. The ensemble means depict 500-hPa height anomalies of +30 to
+90
meters across the eastern third of the CONUS during the 6-10 day period. Th=
ese
large anomalies are expected to result in the hottest temperatures this sum=
mer
across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast where above normal temperatures are
strongly favored. Although the longwave pattern also supports above normal
temperatures farther to the south across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southeast, probabilities are lower due in part to high soil moisture (above
the
70th percentile). A 500-hPa trough is forecast to shift eastward across the
Northern Rockies from days 6 to 8 which leads to a favored area of near to
below normal temperatures for this region. An amplified ridge, initially
centered over the Northeast Pacific, is forecast to expand eastward next we=
ek
and increase probabilities of above normal temperatures across the Pacific
Northwest.

A shortwave trough is forecast to progress eastward across the Midwest,
elevating probabilities of above normal precipitation from the Great Lakes
south to the Ohio River. Elsewhere, throughout the CONUS, a building
subtropical ridge is expected to generally suppress daily convection which
favors below normal precipitation for most areas. Monsoonal moisture is lik=
ely
to remain below average with the 500-hPa ridge axis displaced to the south.
Any
influence from East Pacific tropical cyclones on precipitation across the
Southwest is not expected until beyond day 10.

The ensemble means are in good agreement and maintain continuity from previ=
ous
model cycles in depicting an amplified trough extending from the Bering Str=
ait
south to the Aleutians and a closed 500-hPa low north of Alaska. This longw=
ave
pattern favors below normal temperatures and above normal precipitation for
nearly all of Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 35% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement on the longwave pattern and temperature tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 11 - 17 2021

An expansive subtropical ridge is forecast to become established over the
CONUS
during mid-August as the 500-hPa trough across the north-central CONUS weak=
ens
early in week-2. Model solutions depict positive 500-hPa anomalies througho=
ut
the entire lower 48 with the largest positive anomalies (+30 to +90 meters)
along both the East and West coasts. This longwave pattern favors above nor=
mal
temperatures for a majority of the CONUS with the largest probabilities (mo=
re
than 60 percent) coinciding with where the ensemble means have the most
anomalous 500-hPa heights.

Due to the large-scale ridging and associated above normal 500-hPa heights,=
 a
relatively dry pattern is expected for much of the lower 48. The most likel=
y
area for above normal precipitation, although only slightly favored, exists
across the Great Lakes, central and eastern Corn Belt, and much of the
Northeast. These areas are forecast to be downstream of a weak 500-hPa trou=
gh
and also periods of convective rainfall could occur with any shortwave trou=
ghs
to the north of the subtropical ridge axis. The largest uncertainty in the
week-2 outlook is how much monsoonal rainfall occurs across the Southwest a=
s
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools differ greatly. Based on the predicted
mean
500-hPa ridge axis just south of the Four Corners region and analog
precipitation tools, near to below normal precipitation is favored for the
Southwest. However, the potential remains for a northward surge of moisture
from the Gulf of California depending on future tracks of any tropical
cyclones
in the East Pacific. The enhanced phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (M=
JO)
is forecast to continue propagating eastward over the Western Hemisphere
during
the next two weeks which is likely to provide a favorable large-scale
environment for tropical cyclone development in the East Pacific and Atlant=
ic
basins.

A dipole of below (above) normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over Mainland
Alaska (Gulf of Alaska) during week-2. Persistent, below normal temperature=
s
are likely to accompany the below normal 500-hPa heights throughout Mainlan=
d
Alaska, while above normal temperatures are more likely for the Alaska
Panhandle. Probabilities of above normal precipitation remain slightly
elevated
for most of Mainland Alaska due to the likelihood of multiple shortwave
troughs
crossing that part of the state.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 35% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the temperature tools offset by large model differences on
precipitation across the Southwest and limited predictability on convective
rainfall at this time range.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Overview...

The pattern switches to troughing in the Northwest and broad
ridging over the central and eastern CONUS through this weekend. A
drier pattern overall is expected with rainfall focused mostly
along the Canadian border, across the Upper Midwest, with some
along the Gulf Coast and into the Southwest. Temperatures will
return to above normal in the East while the Northwest stays below
normal under the trough.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The main features to track among guidance are a shortwave trough
over the northern Great Basin Friday morning that shifts east to
the northern Great Lakes through Sunday night and low pressure
centered over BC/Alberta Friday/Saturday and how a reinforcing
shortwave trough/low interacts with it. There is decent agreement
with these features among global guidance on Friday. The 00Z UKMET
is the slowest with the Great Basin trough, so is was removed from
the blend on Day 4. Regarding the western Canada low, the 00Z
ECMWF has the strongest reinforcing low from the Gulf of Alaska
and maintains that low, shifting it to WA by Sunday/Day 5.
Meanwhile the 06Z/12Z GFS has the most interaction with the Gulf
of Alaska low and the western Canada low with both shearing with
general troughing over the Canadian Prairies by Day 5 that does
extend west to the PacNW. The 00Z CMC is essentially a more
progressive version of the ECMWF.
Given the deterministic differences, and similarities of the 00Z
ECENS/06Z GEFS means, went heavier toward an ensemble mean
solution, particularly for Days 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Stalled frontal boundary along the Carolina Coast dissipates
Friday into Saturday as the responsible upper trough weakens.
Rainfall will shift out of the northern Rockies to the Upper
Midwest and Great Lakes for this weekend ahead of a shortwave
trough south of a main low over BC/Alberta and then lingers into
next week over the same area ahead of the parent trough that
ejects east across the Canadian Prairies. Rainfall could be heavy
at times Saturday night through Monday night over portions of the
Upper Midwest. Monsoon rains persist, but look to be suppressed
south/limited to AZ through the medium range period.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest behind the lead cold front Friday through this
weekend, potentially continuing into next week depending on the
low track from the Gulf of Alaska. Ahead of this lead cold front,
temperatures will be 5 to 12 degrees above normal over the Plains
Friday and this weekend before expanding to the East Coast Monday.
A ridge over the Southeast sets up by Sunday and looks to persist
well into next week bringing an extended heat wave from of the
Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.

...The heavy rain and localized flash flooding threat continues
with Monsoonal showers across the central and southern Rockies
through Wednesday...

..Heavy rain and flooding possible along the central Gulf coast
northeastward across the coastal Southeast and into the eastern
Carolinas...

...Heat returns to the Desert Southwest and Interior Pacific
Northwest while the central Plains to the East Coast see below
normal temperatures...

A mid- to upper-level ridge building from the Southwest into the
Pacific Northwest will continue to spread drier conditions across
the interior sections of the West Coast while shifting the most
active monsoonal showers further eastward into the central and
southern Rockies.  Heavy downpours associated with some of the
thunderstorms could lead to localized flash flooding today and
tomorrow.  This is especially so in areas with recent burn scars
and in regions of steep terrain. A Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall (level 2 of 4) remains in effect through tomorrow morning
for portions of south-central Colorado and northeastern New
Mexico, while a broader Slight Risk (level 1 of 4) is in place for
most of central/western Colorado and northeastern New Mexico.
Another inch of rain on average with locally higher amounts is
forecast. A Slight Risk is also in effect for Wednesday with
another half inch to an inch of rainfall possible over regions
that have already seen heavy rainfall the past few days.

By Thursday morning, the high pressure ridge is forecast to bring
enough stability into the region to suppress the monsoonal
rainfall.  Meanwhile, the drying trend brought by the building
ridge will lead to the return of above average temperatures across
the Desert Southwest northward to the interior Pacific Northwest.
High temperatures in the 110s will be common in the Desert
Southwest Wednesday and Thursday with upper 90s to 100 degrees
forecast for the interior Pacific Northwest on Wednesday. A system
moving east from the Pacific will begin to bring milder temps to
the Pacific Northwest on Thursday. Excessive Heat Warnings have
been issued for the Desert Southwest through Thursday evening and
a Heat Advisory is in effect for eastern Washington and northern
Idaho through Wednesday evening. Fire weather is also a threat as
the dry conditions settle in, with an Elevated Risk of fire
weather in effect from the Storm Prediction Center for portions of
the northern Great Basin on Wednesday. The heat will spread into
the northern Plains and upper Midwest as well where high
temperatures are forecast to reach into the 80s and 90s the next
couple of days.

In the East, a frontal boundary is expected to remain nearly
stationary over the next few days stretching from the Carolinas
southwest across the Gulf Coast and into southern Texas.  This
boundary, enhanced by waves of low pressure, will be the focus for
a continued heavy rain event through the end of the forecast
period bringing an increasing threat of flooding and flash
flooding. A Moderate Risk for excessive rainfall is in effect
through tomorrow morning for the coastal Carolinas for the risk of
rainfall rates of 2-3 inches per hour and rainfall totals locally
over 5 inches. A Slight Risk is in effect for the most of the same
region tomorrow as the threat for the more significant rainfall
rates and totals goes down somewhat in comparison to today, but
any additional rain will enhance or encourage flooding in
locations that have already seen rainfall the past few days.

Elsewhere, below normal temperatures are expected from the Central
Plains to the East Coast, with highs mainly in the 80s. Portions
of the Carolinas under the influence of clouds and precipitation
as well as New England will see highs only in the 70s. The dry
airmass will also allow temperatures to cool off at night, with
lows dipping down into the 60s from north Texas and Oklahoma east
to the Mid-Atlantic and coastal Northeast and the 50s for the
interior Northeast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Tue Aug 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

Expanded the elevated area slightly westward across northern
California where winds of 10 to 15 mph appear likely during the
afternoon hours.

In addition, took most of central Oregon out of the IsoDryT
delineation. The majority of the thunderstorm activity appears to be
in eastern Oregon and farther to the east.

..Bentley.. 08/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Tue Aug 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
A more robust upper-level trough is forecast to begin moving onshore
across the Pacific Northwest through the day Wednesday. This will
bring another day of thunderstorm chances to parts of Oregon and the
northern Rockies, as well as strengthening winds across the northern
Sierra into southern Oregon where conditions have been dry.

...Pacific Northwest...
Forecast soundings continue to suggest sufficient mid-level moisture
will be in place to support weak instability east of the Cascades
and into the northern Rockies (though uncertainty in the western
extent of favorable moisture across central OR is noted). Modest
PWAT values near 0.6 to 0.8 inches and deep, well-mixed boundary
layers will support a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms. Similar
thermodynamic profiles are noted across parts of central ID and into
far southwest MT, but recent wetting rainfall over this region has
likely mitigated fuel readiness to some degree. As such, the
dry-thunderstorm risk area is confined to locations with receptive
fuels and sufficient confidence in thunderstorm potential. Further
refinement to the risk area is possible as confidence in the spatial
coverage of thunderstorms increases and fuels respond to warming
temperatures.

...Northern Sierra into Southern Oregon...
Southwesterly mid-level winds ahead of the main trough axis are
forecast to increase over northern CA into adjacent areas of
northwest NV and southern OR. While sustained winds will likely
remain near 15 mph, deep boundary-layer mixing coincident with the
increasing winds will support frequent gusts up to 20-25 mph
(possibly higher in terrain-favored locations). An increasing
downslope component will maintain dry conditions across the region
as afternoon RH values fall into the upper single digits and low
teens. With dry fuels already in place, elevated fire weather
conditions appear likely as winds increase.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1242 AM CDT Wed Aug 04 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough off the northern California coast is forecast
to begin moving onshore over the next 24 hours. As this occurs, lift
ahead of the wave will support thunderstorm chances east of the OR
Cascades as well as increasing winds near the surface. Although some
precipitation has fallen over OR and adjacent areas of CA, NV, and
ID, fuels generally remain dry and will support another day of fire
weather concerns.

...Eastern Oregon...
PWAT values have decreased over the past 24 hours across the Pacific
Northwest, but cooler temperatures aloft (noted in 00z soundings)
and lingering mid-level moisture are maintaining instability east of
the Cascades. Lift will begin overspreading the region by the late
afternoon, coincident with peak diurnal heating/boundary-layer
mixing. A mix of wet/dry thunderstorms is likely, and will pose a
fire weather concern given the generally dry fuels (outside of where
heavier rain has fallen over the past 24 hours). Thunderstorms are
expected into parts of ID and NV as well, but improving fuel
conditions over these areas precludes an expansion.

...Northern Sierra....
Boundary-layer winds are forecast to increase over northern CA,
western NV, and far southern OR as the main trough begins to move
onshore this afternoon. Although backing winds in the lowest 1-2 km
may limit the propensity of stronger gusts, sustained winds near 15
mph gusting to 20-25 mph are probable. A combination of poor
moisture flux into the region and some degree of downslope
warming/drying will yield RH values in the single digits to low
teens. Recent fuel analyses continue to show very dry fuels in
place, and active fire behavior over the past 24 hours supports this
idea. While elevated fire weather conditions are possible as far
southeast as central NV, the Elevated risk area is maintained over
the northern Sierra and adjacent areas of NV/OR where fuels are more
receptive.

210 AM EDT Wed Aug 04 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Aug 07 2021 - 12Z Wed Aug 11 2021

...Overview...

Troughing will persist in the West and along the Canadian border
next week as upper ridging builds into the East and South. This
favors a drier pattern than in recent weeks with rainfall focused
mostly over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes as systems converge in
the center of the continent and lift northeastward. Mid-summer
heat will return with a vengeance by the middle of next week in
much of the East.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the deterministic models largely paired
well with the ensembles except that the GFS runs were largely
quicker than the consensus. Though there has been a several day
trend of a quicker pace, and the quasi-zonal pattern may support
it, did not favor this quicker solution as many GEFS members were
as slow as the ECMWF (on the slowest end) while the UKMET/Canadian
fell in the middle. Opted to rely more on the ensembles means by
the end of the period in order to compensate for uncertainty in
timing by next Tue/Wed in the west-to-east flow. Favored a bit
higher heights over the Southeast per the GFS/GEFS just over the
5940m threshold.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Rainfall will expand across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes this
weekend ahead of a shortwave trough south of a main low over
BC/Alberta. Some rainfall could be locally heavy over MN into
WI/MI. As the system lifts into southern Ontario/Quebec, rainfall
coverage and intensity may wane a bit before perhaps picking up
again next Tue/Wed along the tail-end of the boundary again over
the Corn Belt into the Great Lakes. In the Southwest, some monsoon
rains may flare up over southeastern AZ as some moisture rides up
the west side of mainland Mexico.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest behind the lead cold front this weekend with a
slow moderation next week. Ahead of this lead cold front,
temperatures will be 5 to 12 degrees above normal over the Plains
this weekend and expanding to the East Coast next week. A ridge
over the Southeast sets up by Sunday and looks to persist well
into next week bringing an extended heat wave over the Lower
Mississippi Valley eastward to the Mid-Atlantic. Temperatures will
climb into the 90s with heat indices into the low 100s as dew
points rise into the 60s and low 70s.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CDT Wed Aug 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA...

...Synopsis...
A cold front attendant to the passage of an upper-level trough will
increase fire weather concerns Thursday afternoon as winds increase
in the lee of the Sierra and thunderstorms develop across the
Pacific Northwest. The timing of the front is currently forecast to
coincide with peak diurnal heating, which will augment the potential
for elevated to critical fire weather conditions.

...Northwest Nevada...
Recent guidance shows reasonably good agreement in the timing and
progression of the cold front across northeast CA into NV Thursday
afternoon. While southerly winds ahead of the front are expected to
increase to around 15 mph, post-frontal westerly flow will likely
see sustained winds near 20 mph (gusting to 25-30 mph) based on
bias-corrected ensemble means. The driest/windiest conditions are
expected across northwest NV, where downslope warming/drying in the
lee of the Sierra will foster RH reductions well into the single
digits, and sustained 20+ mph winds are most likely. Elevated to
critical fire weather conditions are probable across much of central
NV, but ERC values are well below seasonal normal due to recent
rainfall. Further north across central OR, breezy westerly winds are
expected behind the cold front, but RH reductions will likely be
muted due to cloud cover. However, increasing winds may impact any
holdover fires from recent rounds of thunderstorms.

...Pacific Northwest...
Cooling temperatures aloft and lingering mid-level moisture will
support another day of modest instability and thunderstorm chances.
Convection will likely develop along and ahead of the cold front,
though convective coverage is somewhat uncertain. Forecast soundings
suggest that a transition from mostly wet storms over the Cascades
to increasingly dry storms across eastern WA/OR is probable as
boundary-layer mixing increases with eastward extent. Strong to
severe outflow winds are possible from any thunderstorm across
eastern OR to southeast WA (see the Day 2 Convective Outlook for
details). While the western extent of the dry-thunderstorm risk is
somewhat uncertain, fuels across the region generally remain dry and
will support a lightning-driven fire weather concern.

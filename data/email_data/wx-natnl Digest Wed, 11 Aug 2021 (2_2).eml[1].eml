Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 AM CDT Wed Aug 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Little change in the mid-level flow pattern is expected across the
US Day2/Thursday, as a broad trough across the northern CONUS
continues slowly east. Flow across the rest of the country will be
minimal as weak high pressure builds across the Southwest where
monsoonal moisture will continue to move north. Fire weather
concerns are low outside of the risk for isolated dry thunderstorms
across California and portions of the Northwest.

...Sierra and Northwest dry thunder...
As the surge of monsoon moisture associated with the weak upper low
off the pacific coast continues northward, widely scattered
thunderstorms are forecast to develop across the Sierra and higher
terrain of southern Oregon. Regional model soundings show PWAT
values between 0.6 and 0.9 suggesting low precipitation efficiency.
With sufficient buoyancy for charge separation, isolated lightning
strikes appear probable. Given widespread receptive fuels in place,
isolated dry thunderstorms are expected.

..Lyons.. 08/11/2021

...Stifling summer heat to stretch from coast-to-coast across the
Pacific Northwest while sultry conditions persist across the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and the mid-section of the country...

...Daily rounds of strong-to-severe storms across the Great Lakes
and northern Mid-Atlantic...

...Poor air quality due to wildfire smoke continues in the western
and central U.S., monsoon showers and storms to drench parts of
the Southwest, watching Tropical Storm Fred late week...

"The Heat Is On" for much of the U.S. mainland as sweltering
temperatures span from sea to shining sea today and Thursday. Heat
Advisories and some Excessive Heat Warnings have been issued
across much of the nation's mid-section and into parts of the the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Some parts of the I-95 corridor could
reach 100 degrees Thursday afternoon with oppressive heat indices
ranging between 105-110 degrees. Across the Pacific Northwest,
daytime highs are forecast to soar above the century mark with
high temperature departures anywhere from 15 to 25 degrees above
normal. Temperatures on Thursday will even challenge some daily
record highs in the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest. Speaking
of records, numerous record warm lows are expected to be broken
along the West Coast and east of the Mississippi River both
Wednesday and Thursday mornings. Looking further ahead, this heat
wave looks to stick around into Friday before gradually loosening
its grip over these regions this weekend.

The Great Lakes are most at risk for severe storms later today as
hot and humid conditions ahead of an approaching cold front sets
the stage for another round of scattered thunderstorms. An
Enhanced Risk for severe weather is in place over western Michigan
while a Slight Risk envelops Michigan and portions of the Midwest.
Damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes could accompany any
severe thunderstorms.  Meanwhile, scattered thunderstorms can be
expected from the Midwest to the interior sections of the East
Coast including the Northeast, as well as along the Gulf Coast and
into Florida for the next couple of days. Most shower and
thunderstorm activity will develop in the afternoon and linger
into the evening hours each day. Some of these thunderstorms may
contain heavy downpours that could result in localized flash
flooding.

Elsewhere, wildfire smoke continues to plague parts of the West
Coast, the Intermountain West, and High Plains with poor air
quality through Wednesday. Also, monsoon showers and thunderstorms
will be a daily occurrence in the Desert Southwest, helping to
keep the heat at bay. That said, some areas of flash flooding are
possible as well. Farther north, temperatures in the northern
Plains will remain below normal with multiple passages of dry cold
fronts over the next couple days. Lastly, eyes are turning to the
tropics as Tropical Storm Fred begins to approach the U.S. from
the Greater Antilles by the end of the week. Please visit the
National Hurricane Center homepage for the latest forecast
information on Tropical Storm Fred.

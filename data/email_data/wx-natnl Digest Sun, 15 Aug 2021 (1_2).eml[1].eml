Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1102 AM CDT Sat Aug 14 2021

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

The isolated dry thunderstorm areas across portions of the West
Coast and Great Basin were adjusted to reflect where the latest
guidance has the highest coverage of storms over the most receptive
fuels. The latest guidance has considerably reduced storm coverage
across the southern Cascades/northern Sierra, and the removal of
isolated dry thunderstorm highlights was strongly considered.
However, fuels remain critically dry in this area, and very
efficient lightning-induced ignitions and subsequent rapid wildfire
growth have recently been reported. Isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights were maintained across parts of the West Coast to account
for lightning-induced fire efficiency.

Otherwise, much of the previous forecast remains on track for
Elevated dry and breezy conditions across terrain favoring areas of
the Northwest, as well as for dry thunderstorm potential for parts
of the northern Rockies. Please see the previous forecast below for
more details.

..Squitieri.. 08/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0230 AM CDT Sat Aug 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large mid-level anticyclone will remain entrenched across the West
on Saturday as a broad trough moves across the Great Lakes. The flow
around the anticyclone will continue to transport mid-level moisture
northward around its periphery, bringing with it a continued chance
of isolated dry thunderstorms.

... Dry Thunderstorm Areas -- Northern California, Nevada, Idaho,
and Montana ...

Mid-level flow around a large anticyclone centered over the Great
Basin will circulate moisture through the West. Intense diurnal
heating and terrain-induced circulations will combine with this
moisture to support the development of isolated thunderstorms. Warm
temperatures and dry surface conditions will support dry
thunderstorms with little to no accumulating precipitation.

Precipitable water values may be sufficiently high across portions
of Nevada to support a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms. However,
modest northeast flow in the mid-levels may support sufficiently
fast storm motions to limit accumulating precipitation at any one
area.

... Wind/RH Areas -- Central Washington and Southern Idaho ...

Mid-level winds will strengthen during the day in advance of an
approaching mid-level speed maximum lifting northward on the western
periphery of the large anticyclone. Vigorous vertical mixing
stemming from the hot and dry boundary layer will support the
downward momentum transfer of this strengthening flow. The result
will be gusty afternoon winds in the lee of the Cascades and the
Snake River Plain. With relative humidity values in the teens, the
result will be elevated to locally critical fire-weather concerns.

...Heavy Rain Threat with Fred to focus over the
Southeast/South-Central Appalachians early next week...
...Tropical Storm Grace to threaten southern Florida and the
eastern Gulf of Mexico later next week...
...Monsoonal moisture from the Southwest/Great Basin leads into
emerging Heavy Rain Threat over the north-central U.S. mid-later
next week...


...Pattern Overview...

Upper level troughing is forecast to move through the Pacific
Northwest early next week then advance toward the northern Plains
and western Great Lakes later next week, bringing some relief from
the high heat and humidity to portions of the northern tier in a
wet pattern. Meanwhile, focus is on Fred which is forecast by NHC
to re-organize and make landfall as a tropical storm early early
next week into the east-central Gulf Coast and then spread heavy
rainfall inland toward the eastern Tennessee/Ohio Valleys and
especially favored terrain of the south-central Appalachians.
Finally, toward the latter half of next week, attention turns to
T.S. Grace which is forecast to track to southern Florida and
onward into the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of best clustered guidance from the NHC, WPC continuity, the
00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC National Blend of
Models. Nudged blend weights to the ECMWF ensemble mean days 5-7
consistent with slowly growing forecast spread.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Tropical moisture is expected to lift northward across interior
portions of the Southeast and southern Appalachians after Fred
makes landfall, potentially interacting with a stalled frontal
boundary and terrain enhancement. There remains some uncertainty
in the heaviest rainfall axis however across the southern
Appalachians, Deep South, and TN/OH Valleys as some westward
trends in the track as well as intensity issues could affect the
potential rainfall impacts. For Tropical Depression Seven, while
there is much above normal uncertainty in the track/intensity
forecast, the system may approach portions of southern Florida
late next week. Follow the advisories from the NHC on both of
these systems for the latest forecast information.

Elsewhere, monsoonal moisture activity over the Desert
Southwest/Great Basin will again bring a localized flash flood
risk. Moisture should stream northward and northeastward ahead of
the incoming Northwest to north-central U.S. upper trough, with a
potential for moderate to heavy rainfall/convection emerging from
the northern Rockies/high Plains to the north-central Plains and
mid-upper MS Valley mid-later next week, with organized and
enhanced rainfall focusing along a developing frontal system.
Toward the latter half of next week, attention may once again be
drawn to southern Florida where Tropical Storm Grace is forecast
approaching Florida and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 PM CDT Sat Aug 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWESTERN
MONTANA...

The isolated dry thunderstorm area has been maintained over southern
portions of the Cascades/northern Sierra despite the latest guidance
trending towards lesser coverage. Deep-layer ascent should be
greater relative to previous days given the approach of an upper
trough. The critically receptive fuels and recent extreme wildfire
growth/behavior suggests that any strikes that occur will be
associated with very high lightning-induced ignition ratios,
warranting the continuation of isolated dry thunderstorm highlights
across this region.

Some dry and breezy conditions may also occur across portions of the
northern High Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley tomorrow.
However, the lack in guidance consensus depicting more widespread RH
at or under 25% precludes an Elevated delineation at this time.
Locally dry and breezy conditions may also occur in terrain-favoring
areas through the rest of the Interior West given the approach of
the upper trough. Otherwise, the rest of the forecast remains on
track, with only minor modifications made to the Elevated
delineation over the Cascades to account for the latest guidance
consensus. Please see the previous below for more information about
dry and breezy conditions across the Cascades and Northern Rockies.

..Squitieri.. 08/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0231 AM CDT Sat Aug 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
The large western United States anticyclone will persist through the
day on Sunday before beginning to weaken and break down late Sunday
into Monday as a short-wave trough impinges upon the anticyclone.
Farther east, a weak mid-level tough/cyclonic wind shift will move
south through the Plains on the eastern side of the anticyclone.

... Central and Eastern Washington and Western Montana ...

Mid-level heights will flatten on Sunday across the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies as a short-wave trough moves atop the
ridge. Strengthening westerly downsloping winds will result in
relative humidity falling into the low-to-mid teens and winds
gusting in excess of 25-30 miles per hour across portions of
Montana. The result will be critical fire conditions for a few hours
during the afternoon in the plains east of the northern Rockies of
Montana. Surrounding the critical conditions elevated to locally
critical conditions will be possible.

Across central and eastern Washington, relative humidity will be
lower than across Montana, but more uncertainty to the strength and
duration of the winds during the afternoon will preclude the
introduction of critical conditions at this time. This will be
revisited in subsequent forecasts.

... Northern California into Eastern Oregon ...

Another day of terrain-circulation-induced thunderstorms will once
again be possible as the hot, dry boundary layer interacts with
modest mid-level moisture to produce enough instability to support
charge separation. Additionally, increasingly westerly flow in the
cloud-bearing layer may support faster storm motions than in
previous days, contributing to the lack of wetting rains from any
thunderstorm that does develop.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat August 14 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Heavy Rain Threat with Fred to focus over the
Southeast/South-Central Appalachians early next week...
...Tropical Storm Grace to threaten southern Florida and the
eastern Gulf of Mexico later next week...
...Monsoonal moisture from the Southwest/Great Basin leads into
emerging Heavy Rain Threat over the north-central U.S. mid-later
next week...


...Pattern Overview...

Upper level troughing is forecast to move through the Pacific
Northwest early next week then advance toward the northern Plains
and western Great Lakes later next week, bringing some relief from
the high heat and humidity to portions of the northern tier in a
wet pattern. Meanwhile, focus is on Fred which is forecast by NHC
to re-organize and make landfall as a tropical storm early early
next week into the east-central Gulf Coast and then spread heavy
rainfall inland toward the eastern Tennessee/Ohio Valleys and
especially favored terrain of the south-central Appalachians.
Finally, toward the latter half of next week, attention turns to
T.S. Grace which is forecast to track to southern Florida and
onward into the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of best clustered guidance from the NHC, WPC continuity, 06
UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC
National Blend of Models. Nudged blend weights to the GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means days 5-7 consistent with growing forecast spread
and uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Tropical moisture is expected to lift northward across interior
portions of the Southeast and southern Appalachians after Fred
makes landfall, potentially interacting with a stalled frontal
boundary and terrain enhancement. There remains some uncertainty
in the heaviest rainfall axis however across the southern
Appalachians, Deep South, and TN/OH Valleys as some westward
trends in the track as well as intensity issues could affect the
potential rainfall impacts. For Tropical Depression Seven, while
there is much above normal uncertainty in the track/intensity
forecast, the system may approach portions of southern Florida
late next week. Follow the advisories from the NHC on both of
these systems for the latest forecast information.

Elsewhere, monsoonal moisture activity over the Desert
Southwest/Great Basin will again bring a localized flash flood
risk. Moisture should stream northward and northeastward ahead of
the incoming Northwest to north-central U.S. upper trough, with a
potential for moderate to heavy rainfall/convection emerging from
the northern Rockies/high Plains to the north-central Plains and
mid-upper MS Valley mid-later next week, with organized and
enhanced rainfall focusing along a developing frontal system.
Toward the latter half of next week, attention may once again be
drawn to southern Florida where Tropical Storm Grace is forecast
approaching Florida and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

...Heavy Rain Threat with Fred to focus over the
Southeast/South-Central Appalachians early next week...
...Tropical Storm Grace to threaten southern Florida and the
eastern Gulf of Mexico later next week...
...Monsoonal moisture from the Southwest/Great Basin leads into
emerging Heavy Rain Threat over the north-central U.S. mid-later
next week...


...Pattern Overview...

Upper level troughing is forecast to move through the Pacific
Northwest early next week then advance toward the northern Plains
and western Great Lakes later next week, bringing some relief from
the high heat and humidity to portions of the northern tier in a
wet pattern. Meanwhile, focus is on Fred which is forecast by NHC
to re-organize and make landfall as a tropical storm early early
next week into the east-central Gulf Coast and then spread heavy
rainfall inland toward the eastern Tennessee/Ohio Valleys and
especially favored terrain of the south-central Appalachians.
Finally, toward the latter half of next week, attention turns to
T.S. Grace which is forecast to track to southern Florida and
onward into the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of best clustered guidance from the NHC, WPC continuity, 06
UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC
National Blend of Models. Nudged blend weights to the GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means days 5-7 consistent with growing forecast spread
and uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Tropical moisture is expected to lift northward across interior
portions of the Southeast and southern Appalachians after Fred
makes landfall, potentially interacting with a stalled frontal
boundary and terrain enhancement. There remains some uncertainty
in the heaviest rainfall axis however across the southern
Appalachians, Deep South, and TN/OH Valleys as some westward
trends in the track as well as intensity issues could affect the
potential rainfall impacts. For Tropical Depression Seven, while
there is much above normal uncertainty in the track/intensity
forecast, the system may approach portions of southern Florida
late next week. Follow the advisories from the NHC on both of
these systems for the latest forecast information.

Elsewhere, monsoonal moisture activity over the Desert
Southwest/Great Basin will again bring a localized flash flood
risk. Moisture should stream northward and northeastward ahead of
the incoming Northwest to north-central U.S. upper trough, with a
potential for moderate to heavy rainfall/convection emerging from
the northern Rockies/high Plains to the north-central Plains and
mid-upper MS Valley mid-later next week, with organized and
enhanced rainfall focusing along a developing frontal system.
Toward the latter half of next week, attention may once again be
drawn to southern Florida where Tropical Storm Grace is forecast
approaching Florida and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southwest/ Southern Rockies, Southern tip of Florida, and the
Mid-Atlantic through Sunday morning: The Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall continues over parts of the Southeast through Tuesday
morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central High Plains and the Mid-Atlantic through Sunday
morning...

...Excessive Heat Warning and Heat Advisory over parts of the West
Coast...

...Fred will reform and impact parts of Florida with heavy rain as
it moves northwestward...

Multiple features set up to the south of a typical summer jet
stream focused along the northern U.S. and Canada. One area of
concern is the Southwest, as showers and thunderstorms are
forecast as above regular monsoonal moisture continues to flow
into the region. As a result, flash Flood Watches and Flood
Advisories cover the southern half of Arizona, parts of New
Mexico, and Far West Texas through Sunday, with a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall also in place into tonight.

Farther east, a surface cold front will propagate eastward across
the northeastern quadrant of the county today while meandering
over the Plains and Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys through Monday.
As moisture flows into the front, the moisture will provide a
focus for rain and thunderstorms, with flash flooding and possibly
severe weather as threats. Isolated flash floods are possible
across much of the south-central and the southeastern U.S. through
Monday, with broad Marginal Risk areas outlooked for excessive
rainfall. The heavy rain could be enhanced over portions of the
Mid-Atlantic, especially given the wet antecedent conditions.
Scattered flash floods are possible, with the Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall is in place. Some severe storms also could
occur in a few areas along the frontal where the Storm Prediction
Center has Slight Risk areas in place--the Central High Plains and
the Mid-Atlantic.

Meanwhile, the Tropical Depression Fred surface low has been
disrupted due to the storm crossing the high terrain in Cuba. The
mid and upperlevel center of the system will be a trough
through late Saturday night when the systems surface low reforms.
What should once again become Tropical Depression Fred heads
northwestward over the Gulf of Mexico, moving towards the Central
Gulf Coast by Tuesday. Heavy tropical rain could cause scattered
flash flooding over much of Florida through the weekend associated
with the system. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in place
for southern Florida through the weekend, while portions of the
Florida Panhandle are added to the Slight Risk Monday as Fred
approaches.

Heavy rain aside, the ongoing oppressive heat continues to be a
hazard during the short-range period, especially across the West.
Excessive Heat Warnings and some Heat Advisories cover much of the
Pacific Northwest, the Great Basin, and California as temperatures
soar into the 100s. This heat could be record-breaking once again
in terms of both high minimum and maximum temperatures. The heat
is forecast to lessen somewhat, at least in the Seattle and
Portland areas, by Sunday. Still, the interior will remain hot,
and above-average temperatures are expected to spread toward the
Northern Plains to begin next week. In addition to the heat, Air
Quality Alerts are in place for the Northwest and into parts of
the Rockies given smoke from fires and high ozone levels.
Unfortunately, isolated dry thunderstorms and Elevated to Critical
fire conditions remain a threat through at least Sunday as well,
which could worsen the ongoing fire situation in the West.
Meanwhile, temperatures are expected to be warmer than usual today
across the Eastern Seaboard ahead of the cold front, and warm
minimum daily records could be set this morning with high heat
indices again this afternoon. However, by Sunday, temperatures
should be near to below average behind the cold frontal passage.

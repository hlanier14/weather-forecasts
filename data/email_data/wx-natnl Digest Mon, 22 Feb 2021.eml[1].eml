NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1019 AM CST Sun Feb 21 2021

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The current forecast remains valid with no changes.

..Lyons.. 02/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0111 AM CST Sun Feb 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface low are expected to
traverse the Mississippi Valley while surface high pressure and
ridging aloft will prevail from the Rockies westward through the
period. Moist conditions east of the Rockies, along with cool and
dry conditions accompanying the building surface high pressure
across the Inter-mountain West will serve to limit widespread major
wildfire-spread concerns across much of the CONUS. A few small
exceptions would be the southern High Plains and the southern
Transverse/Peninsular Ranges in southern California, where sustained
gradient surface winds may reach 15-20 mph, coincident with 15-25%
RH by afternoon peak heating. Nonetheless, poor fuel receptiveness
to fire spread precludes any fire weather highlights.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
142 PM EST Sun Feb 21 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Feb 24 2021 - 12Z Sun Feb 28 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium range period will begin with a low amplitude mid-upper
trough with a hint of split northern/southern stream flow moving
fairly quickly from the West Wednesday toward the East by Friday.
Then, additional energy comes into the West for late week into the
weekend, deepening a trough there and allowing Gulf of Mexico
moisture return to central/eastern parts of the CONUS.

Model guidance is in generally good agreement with the
overall/longwave pattern, especially for the first part of the
medium range period, but with some differences in the specifics. A
multi-model deterministic blend of guidance was able to be used
for Wednesday/Thursday. Model differences begin to arise with
shortwave energy and the initial trough around Thursday night and
Friday, with how quickly it moves across the East and how it
phases with the large-scale flow. The best clustering seemed to be
around the 00Z ECMWF, with the 00Z UKMET having around the same
positioning albeit weaker, and the parallel (v.16) 06Z GFS was
similar as well. Weighting the aforementioned models seemed like a
good compromise, as the 00Z/06Z GFS runs were more progressive and
the 00Z CMC was much slower with the shortwave. Then by the
weekend, while there is good agreement for renewed upper troughing
for the western half of the U.S., and additional energy dropping
southward into the trough and sharpening it up by Sunday, detail
differences led to more incorporation of the 06Z GEFS mean and 00Z
EC mean by this time frame.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The West can expect rounds of precipitation through the end of the
week, with higher elevations of the Cascades and Northern
Rockies/Bitterroots likely to see the most snow. Snow is also
currently forecast for the Rockies and into the Front Range of
Colorado around Wednesday, but with some uncertainty as to how far
east into lower elevations it spreads. Farther east,  moisture is
expected to increase for the southeastern quadrant of the country,
and a couple of rounds of moderate to potentially heavy rainfall
are possible for the Lower Mississippi Valley into the
Tennessee/Lower Ohio Valleys and Southeast. The axis of the
heavier rainfall as well as total amounts remain in question at
this point. Lighter precipitation farther north across the Midwest
could be in the form of snow.

In terms of temperatures, the initial trough should bring below
normal temperatures by 10-20 degrees across the Rockies and into
the Southern High Plains Wednesday into Thursday. Cooler weather
could then spread across the East Friday after near to above
average temperatures there around midweek. For the weekend, below
temperatures are forecast for portions of the western and central
U.S., with near to slightly above average temperatures across the
East.

Extended Forecast Discussion

142 PM EST Sun Feb 21 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Feb 24 2021 - 12Z Sun Feb 28 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium range period will begin with a low amplitude mid-upper
trough with a hint of split northern/southern stream flow moving
fairly quickly from the West Wednesday toward the East by Friday.
Then, additional energy comes into the West for late week into the
weekend, deepening a trough there and allowing Gulf of Mexico
moisture return to central/eastern parts of the CONUS.

Model guidance is in generally good agreement with the
overall/longwave pattern, especially for the first part of the
medium range period, but with some differences in the specifics. A
multi-model deterministic blend of guidance was able to be used
for Wednesday/Thursday. Model differences begin to arise with
shortwave energy and the initial trough around Thursday night and
Friday, with how quickly it moves across the East and how it
phases with the large-scale flow. The best clustering seemed to be
around the 00Z ECMWF, with the 00Z UKMET having around the same
positioning albeit weaker, and the parallel (v.16) 06Z GFS was
similar as well. Weighting the aforementioned models seemed like a
good compromise, as the 00Z/06Z GFS runs were more progressive and
the 00Z CMC was much slower with the shortwave. Then by the
weekend, while there is good agreement for renewed upper troughing
for the western half of the U.S., and additional energy dropping
southward into the trough and sharpening it up by Sunday, detail
differences led to more incorporation of the 06Z GEFS mean and 00Z
EC mean by this time frame.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The West can expect rounds of precipitation through the end of the
week, with higher elevations of the Cascades and Northern
Rockies/Bitterroots likely to see the most snow. Snow is also
currently forecast for the Rockies and into the Front Range of
Colorado around Wednesday, but with some uncertainty as to how far
east into lower elevations it spreads. Farther east,  moisture is
expected to increase for the southeastern quadrant of the country,
and a couple of rounds of moderate to potentially heavy rainfall
are possible for the Lower Mississippi Valley into the
Tennessee/Lower Ohio Valleys and Southeast. The axis of the
heavier rainfall as well as total amounts remain in question at
this point. Lighter precipitation farther north across the Midwest
could be in the form of snow.

In terms of temperatures, the initial trough should bring below
normal temperatures by 10-20 degrees across the Rockies and into
the Southern High Plains Wednesday into Thursday. Cooler weather
could then spread across the East Friday after near to above
average temperatures there around midweek. For the weekend, below
temperatures are forecast for portions of the western and central
U.S., with near to slightly above average temperatures across the
East.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0113 AM CST Sun Feb 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mainly zonal flow aloft will overspread the southwest CONUS while a
series of mid-level impulses traverse the northwestern to
east-central U.S during the Day 2/Monday period. Widespread surface
high pressure and overall cool conditions are expected to prevail
across the western and central U.S, mitigating significant
wildfire-growth potential. However, dry downslope flow is likely
across the southern High Plains, and a surface pressure gradient
across southern California is expected to continue supporting dry
offshore flow across the southern Transverse/Peninsular Ranges. Both
of these regions have been relatively devoid of meaningful
precipitation accumulations over the past two weeks, and given
multiple days of persistent breezy, dry conditions, some of the
finer fuels may cure enough to support brief, localized
wildfire-spread concerns. Nonetheless, the overall lack of robust
fuel receptiveness precludes fire weather delineations at this time.

...Light snow from parts of the Midwest to the Northeast and
Central Appalachians through Monday...

...Heavy snow over the Cascades into the Northern Rockies...

...Temperatures to moderate across the central U.S....

Low pressure over the Midwest will move eastward to the Canadian
Maritimes by Tuesday evening.  The system will produce snow over
parts of the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley into the Upper Great
Lakes, with rain developing over parts of the Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley.  Rain and snow will spread
eastward into the Lower Great Lakes and Ohio Valley as the snow
ends over parts of the Upper Midwest by Monday morning.  Likewise,
the rain will move into the Tennessee Valley and the Southeast.
Through the day Monday, rain and snow will move across the
Mid-Atlantic and into New England.  Along the rain-snow line,
pockets of light freezing rain will develop over parts of the
Central Appalachians.  In the wake of the system, lake effect snow
will develop downwind from the Great Lakes from Monday evening
into Tuesday.

Meanwhile, onshore flow and upper-level energy will produce heavy
snow in the Cascades and Northern Rockies through Tuesday evening.
Rain will also develop over the Pacific Northwest's
lower-elevations through Tuesday evening, with rain heavy at
times.  High temperatures will continue to moderate over the
Plains and Mississippi Valley.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun February 21 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Potential Heavy Rainfall For Southern U.S. Late This Weekend
and Early Next Week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The synoptic pattern across the CONUS during the period is
expected to feature general troughing over the interior West with
a persistent upper ridge over the southern Gulf of Mexico. The
resulting southwesterly flow in between is likely to return Gulf
moisture over the southern U.S. into portions of the eastern U.S.,
especially by this weekend into early next week. Waves of low
pressure lifting through the flow could provide the focus for some
areas of heavy rainfall over the Southern U.S..

In general, the latest model guidance shows fairly good agreement
through about day 5. An initial quasi-split flow on day 3
/Thursday/ is expected to become predominately troughing over the
Southwest U.S. and downstream ridging anchored over the Gulf of
Mexico and southern Florida. By day 6/7, a more vigorous shortwave
trough dropping down the West Coast is forecast to reach the Four
Corners region. Here, the typical timing/strength biases are seen
where the GFS is much faster/progressive ejecting the shortwave
and its associated low downstream across the CONUS. Meanwhile, the
ECMWF bottles the energy up in the form of a closed low that is
slow to push out into Plains. By day 7, the differences are quite
notable, ranging from the GFS with its shortwave axis over
Oklahoma to the ECMWF over New Mexico. Another Pacific shortwave
approaching the West Coast on day 7 shows similar timing issues as
well. The CMC for the most part was a compromise deterministic
solution though at times its evolution of the Southwest U.S. was
off.

Given these differences, the WPC blend incorporated mostly the 00Z
ECMWF, 18Z GFS, and 00Z CMC on day 3-5 followed by mostly a
ECENS/GEFS blend on day 6-7 to account for the forecast
uncertainty. Forecast confidence was average to above average days
3-5 then lowered to average to slightly below average day 6-7.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest can expected a few rounds of precipitation
late this week into the first part of the weekend, with higher
elevations of the Cascades and Northern Rockies/Bitterroots likely
to see the most snow. As that system drops to the Four Corners
region and then pushes into the Southern Plains, several days of
Gulf moisture interacting with frontal boundaries across the South
could result in multiple waves of precipitation. Details and
totals are less certain but the setup favors potentially heavy
rainfall somewhere from the Arklatex, portions of AL/MS to lower
TN Valley.

Below normal temperatures are forecast predominately across the
Rockies during the period and then in the wake of the late weekend
and early next week system, those below normal readings could
spill into the Plains. Departures of 10F to as much as 20F are
possible. Elsewhere, no significant departures from normal are
forecast during the period.

...Potential Heavy Rainfall For Southern U.S. Late This Weekend
and Early Next Week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The synoptic pattern across the CONUS during the period is
expected to feature general troughing over the interior West with
a persistent upper ridge over the southern Gulf of Mexico. The
resulting southwesterly flow in between is likely to return Gulf
moisture over the southern U.S. into portions of the eastern U.S.,
especially by this weekend into early next week. Waves of low
pressure lifting through the flow could provide the focus for some
areas of heavy rainfall over the Southern U.S..

In general, the latest model guidance shows fairly good agreement
through about day 5. An initial quasi-split flow on day 3
/Thursday/ is expected to become predominately troughing over the
Southwest U.S. and downstream ridging anchored over the Gulf of
Mexico and southern Florida. By day 6/7, a more vigorous shortwave
trough dropping down the West Coast is forecast to reach the Four
Corners region. Here, the typical timing/strength biases are seen
where the GFS is much faster/progressive ejecting the shortwave
and its associated low downstream across the CONUS. Meanwhile, the
ECMWF bottles the energy up in the form of a closed low that is
slow to push out into Plains. By day 7, the differences are quite
notable, ranging from the GFS with its shortwave axis over
Oklahoma to the ECMWF over New Mexico. Another Pacific shortwave
approaching the West Coast on day 7 shows similar timing issues as
well. The CMC for the most part was a compromise deterministic
solution though at times its evolution of the Southwest U.S. was
off.

Given these differences, the WPC blend incorporated mostly the 00Z
ECMWF, 18Z GFS, and 00Z CMC on day 3-5 followed by mostly a
ECENS/GEFS blend on day 6-7 to account for the forecast
uncertainty. Forecast confidence was average to above average days
3-5 then lowered to average to slightly below average day 6-7.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest can expected a few rounds of precipitation
late this week into the first part of the weekend, with higher
elevations of the Cascades and Northern Rockies/Bitterroots likely
to see the most snow. As that system drops to the Four Corners
region and then pushes into the Southern Plains, several days of
Gulf moisture interacting with frontal boundaries across the South
could result in multiple waves of precipitation. Details and
totals are less certain but the setup favors potentially heavy
rainfall somewhere from the Arklatex, portions of AL/MS to lower
TN Valley.

Below normal temperatures are forecast predominately across the
Rockies during the period and then in the wake of the late weekend
and early next week system, those below normal readings could
spill into the Plains. Departures of 10F to as much as 20F are
possible. Elsewhere, no significant departures from normal are
forecast during the period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 AM CST Mon Feb 22 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Multiple mid-level troughs will traverse the northern U.S as upper
ridging builds across the southwest CONUS through the day. Surface
high pressure and overall cooler, moist conditions will prevail
across most of the CONUS, limiting the threat for significant
wildfire growth. Some dry and breezy conditions may accompany
downslope flow along the southern High Plains, as well as with
offshore flow induced by a pressure gradient across southern
California. Nonetheless, fuels across southern California to the
southern High Plains remain poorly receptive to wildfire spread,
with no fire weather highlights added.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 AM CST Mon Feb 22 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Up to 50 kt 500 mb flow will develop across the central/southern U.S
as a mid-level trough begins to develop across the Inter-mountain
West. With a dry boundary layer in place across the southern High
Plains, diurnal heating will encourage downslope flow along the
higher terrain to the lee of the Rockies, promoting very breezy/dry
conditions. Latest guidance consensus depicts eastern New Mexico
into the Texas Panhandle as the most likely area to see 15-20% RH
coinciding with 20+ mph sustained westerly winds. While Elevated to
potentially Critical meteorological conditions are expected by
afternoon peak heating across portions of the southern High Plains,
fuel receptiveness to fire spread remains mediocre, with fire
weather highlights withheld.

...Snow for parts of the Northeast and Central Appalachians
through today...

...Heavy snow over the Cascades and Northern Rockies...

...Central U.S. to warm up as Northwest cools down...

An amplified upper-level trough will traverse the eastern third of
the country today. As a result, a low pressure system will cross
the Midwest and produce light to moderate snow across much of the
Northeast, with locally heavier snow downwind of Lake Ontario and
the higher elevation areas of New England. Generally, a wide swath
of 3-6 inches of snow is possible across the Northeast and Central
Appalachians, while areas downwind of Lake Ontario may see over a
foot of snow. Rain is expected from the Mid-Atlantic down the
eastern seaboard today. Scattered to isolated thunderstorms are
possible across Florida and North Carolina's Outer Banks.
Temperatures are expected to be below average on the backside of
this system across the Midwest and Mississippi Valleys today. As
this system departs another one will sweep across Canada and graze
the Great Lakes tonight, bringing some additional lake effect snow
to the region.

Another upper-level disturbance will impact the Northwest through
Tuesday by producing heavy mountain snow across the Cascades and
Northern Rockies, and potentially heavy rain along the Pacific
Northwest coast and inland areas. Heavy snow is likely to slam the
Northern Cascades, where multiple feet may have fallen by
Wednesday morning. Parts of the Northern Rockies are also likely
receive over a foot of snow. Temperatures across the Great Plains
are generally expected to be above average today as the northwest
system moves across the Rockies. Temperatures will begin falling
below average across the Northwest, on the backside of the
aforementioned frontal system today. This new system will
eventually emerge over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest on
Tuesday before bringing another round of winter weather to the
Great Lakes by midweek.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

Current METAR observations show widespread 20+ mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds ongoing across portions of the southern
High Plains into the central Plains, which are expected to continue
through the day. Clear skies will support boundary-layer mixing
through the afternoon, with minimum RH around 15% by peak heating.
While such conditions would typically necessitate Critical
highlights, fuels remain marginally receptive to fire spread,
precluding an upgrade to Critical.

A couple of dry strikes may accompany high-based storms across
portions of central Colorado this afternoon and evening. However,
recent showers have dampened fuels to a degree across the region,
and given the expected sparse nature of the dry strikes, isolated
dry thunderstorm highlights have been withheld. Otherwise, the rest
of the forecast remains on track. Please see the previous forecast
below for more details on Elevated conditions across parts of the
Great Basin and southern Idaho.

..Squitieri.. 09/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0209 AM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
...TX/OK Panhandles into central Kansas...
A surface low, currently in southwest Kansas early this morning is
forecast to deepen through the day as a weak shortwave trough
traverses the central Rockies. This will tighten the pressure
gradient across the southern Plains with 15 to 20 mph expected
across the TX/OK Panhandles into central Kansas. Some gusts up to 25
mph may be possible in central Kansas. Deep mixing should keep
dewpoints low in this region with relative humidity between 15 and
20 percent during the afternoon. Therefore, despite only moderately
dry fuels (85% ERC), an elevated delineation is warranted.

...Southern Nevada into far northwest Arizona and southwest Utah...
A combination of deep mixing and downslope flow is expected to lead
to dry and breezy conditions across portions of southern Nevada into
southwest Utah and far northwest Arizona with winds around 15 to 20
mph and afternoon relative humidity 8 to 12 percent. Some dry and
breezy conditions may extend farther south and east into northern
Arizona and southern Utah, but monsoon precipitation has brought
significant fuel moisture to much of this region.

...Snake River Plain...
Cyclonic mid-level flow around 30 to 35 mph is forecast to align
parallel to the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho. Deep boundary
layer mixing is expected as temperatures warm into the upper 70s.
This mixing should bring some of this stronger flow to the surface
this afternoon with winds of 15 to 20 mph expected and relative
humidity of 10 to 15 percent.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 PM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains largely on track. Given weak upper
support for a stronger surface wind field, wildfire-spread concerns
will be confined primarily to terrain-favoring areas of the
inter-mountain West. Locally Elevated conditions are likely across
the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho, and in close proximity to
the Great Divide Basin in southern Wyoming. However, the brief and
spatially constrained nature of the favorable overlapping surface
winds/RH precludes fire weather highlights. Similarly, a couple of
dry strikes are possible with initially high-based, isolated
thunderstorms across portions of central into southern Colorado.
However, modest fuel receptiveness and the potentially quick
transition to wetting rains suggest isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights are currently unwarranted.

..Squitieri.. 09/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0209 AM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
Weak high pressure is forecast across much of the Northwest,
Northern Rockies, Great Basin, and central Rockies through the
period. A thermally induced pressure trough will be present across
California as temperatures warm into the upper 90s to near 100 in
the central Valley. Winds are expected to remain light across most
of the western CONUS with moist conditions across much of the East.
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain mostly low on Tuesday
as a result of these weak winds across dry portions of the West.

SYNOPSIS: There is overall good multi-model agreement of mid-level low (high)
pressure across the western  (eastern) lower 48 during week-2, although there
are differences among them regarding the details. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean
indicates the mid-level low (high) pressure across the western (eastern) half
of the contiguous U.S., while the 0Z GEFS ensemble mean favors mid-level low
pressure moving eastward across the northern half of the lower 48 during
week-2. Both these models indicate general weakening of the pattern throughout
the period. The 0Z Canadian ensemble mean is more similar to the 0Z ECMWF
solution, although the pattern remains more amplified. This pattern supports
increasing chances for much below normal temperatures across the northwestern
contiguous U.S. and elevated winds across parts of the Great Plains early in
the period. Further north, surface high pressure is predicted to build across
mainland Alaska which could usher in cold arctic temperatures at the beginning
of week-2, potentially supporting the first notable cold snap of the season.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the western CONUS,
Tue-Wed, Sep 21-23.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Northern and Central Plains,
Tue-Thu, Sep 21-23.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for interior parts of mainland
Alaska, Tue-Wed, Sep 21-22.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of mainland Alaska,
Tue-Thu, Sep 21-23.

FOR THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 16 - MONDAY SEPTEMBER 20:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!sbXTQ1zGH-cvH8CoXzsGhg0CvX0U9AyR-rnHr731IZO0ZsJyrPiwGTZm8aUQJ2bck-atlZ4Q$

FOR TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 21 - MONDAY SEPTEMBER 27: There is relatively good
agreement among the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means depicting
mid-level troughing (ridging) across the western (eastern) North America, with
the GEFS and ECMWF favoring this pattern weakening throughout the period,
while
the Canadian pattern is more amplified. This pattern could support anomalously
cool temperatures sinking southward from western Canada. A slight risk of much
below normal temperatures is highlighted for parts of the western CONUS
(primarily higher elevation areas) Sep 21 to 22 where there is good agreement
between The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicating at least a 20 chance of
minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and 40 Deg F, with
some areas reaching freezing. The GEFS reforecast tool shows the potential for
minimum temperatures exceeding these thresholds extending further eastward to
parts of the  Great Plains, due to favoring mid-level troughing extending
further eastward compared to the ECMWF. Minimum temperatures may linger into
the middle of week-2. Due to significant model differences in the models and
reforecast tools, this hazard is not extended further in time but will be
monitored in the upcoming days. The anomalously cold temperatures may lead to
early season frost and freezes to impact vegetation in the region.



The mid-level troughing across the West may support surface low formation in
the lee of the Rockies at the beginning of the period. This feature combined
with possible surface high building across northwestern CONUS may support
increased surface level pressure gradients and resultant high winds in the lee
of the Rockies. Both the reforecast tools indicate elevated signals for
increased risk of high winds across the central CONUS, although the GEFS
reforecast tool has a weaker signal compared to the ECMWF reforecast tool
regarding high wind speed potential, with the greatest likelihood shifted
slightly further east across the Great Plains compared to the ECMWF. A slight
risk of high winds is posted for parts of the Northern and Central Plains, Sep
21 to 23, based on where the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts at least a 20%
chance of sustained wind speeds exceeding 85th percentile and 25 mph. The
ECMWF
reforecast tool is favored for today's high wind risk area due to its stronger
signal and also because it aligns better with where the surface pressure
gradients would most likely support enhanced wind speeds.



Across Alaska, surface high pressure is anticipated to build across parts of
mainland Alaska which could allow cold arctic air to spill southward into the
state. Both reforecast tools are in good agreement, showing at least a 20%
chance of many parts of mainland Alaska falling to the lowest 15th percentile
and sub-freezing temperatures at the beginning of week-2. A slight risk of
much
below normal temperatures is highlighted for parts of mainland Alaska,
extending from the Alaska Range northward to the Brooks Range. A moderate risk
is posted for interior parts of mainland Alaska, Sep 21 to 22, where the
reforecast tools indicate at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures
reaching hazards criteria. The daily 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean indicates the
potential for anomalies reaching at least 10 Deg F lower than normal in some
highlighted areas, compared to a 30 year climatology (1991-2020). This would
be
the first notable cold snap for parts of mainland Alaska, with temperatures
reaching sub-freezing for the first time of the season.



As of 2pm EDT, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring a surface
disturbance with a 50% chance of  forming into a tropical cyclone during
week-1
near the Bahamas. Recent runs of the deterministic GFS indicate the potential
for this disturbance approaching the Carolinas, but would be well off the East
coast by the beginning of week-2, precluding any inclusion of heavy
precipitation hazards associated with tropical storm activity at this time.
The
NHC also indicates an 80% chance of a tropical wave currently located over the
far eastern tropical Atlantic forming into a tropical cyclone in the next 5
days, although it is too far out in lead time to determine whether there will
be any related hazardous impacts to the CONUS.

...Heavy Rain From Tropical Storm Nicholas May Continue Into
Thursday...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 15Z National Hurricane Center advisory for Tropical Storm
Nicholas shows the system weakening to a remnant low over the
Lower Mississippi Valley by the start of the period early Thursday
and dissipating soon thereafter. Potential exists for associated
moisture to maintain a threat for some heavy rainfall over parts
of the southern tier into Thursday. Check the latest NHC products
for additional information on Nicholas.

Models and means continue to show amplification of the large scale
pattern from late this week to the start of next week, leading to
a more pronounced contrast in weather conditions. An upper trough
reaching the West Coast will bring a period of well below normal
high temperatures to the Northwest along with enhanced rainfall
(and high elevation snow in the northern Cascades). On the other
hand rising heights aloft downstream with ridging becoming more
prominent over the East by next Sunday-Monday will promote an
expanding area of well above normal temperatures from the High
Plains into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast. Flow between the trough
and developing ridge will move along frontal systems between the
northern half of the Plains and New England. Meanwhile guidance
continues to signal potential for an area of low pressure to
develop and track northward off the East Coast. How much if any
rainfall that reaches the East Coast will be very sensitive to the
system's track--which at the moment appears to be just far enough
east to keep most of the moisture offshore except perhaps for far
eastern North Carolina and the southwest corner of New England.

Over the past day guidance has trended much closer together for
the details of the upper trough and leading surface front
extending into the northern U.S. from a strong system initially
over southern Canada. This developing consensus has been perhaps
two-thirds from the past couple ECMWF runs trending noticeably
slower/northward with the front due to a slower/less amplified
depiction of the upper trough and one-third from the GFS trending
faster. Forecasts of the West Coast trough diverge after Saturday
due in part to timing differences over the Aleutians/North
Pacific. Latest GFS runs have been on the fast/amplified side of
the spread while CMC runs have been slowest. GEFS means have been
moderately progressive but not quite to the extent of the GFS
while the 00Z ECMWF mean is slower than its operational run, just
a bit faster than the CMC. Guidance has been shuffling around for
timing over recent days so an intermediate approach seems best.
Consensus track of western Atlantic low pressure has held up
fairly well over the past 24 hours. The 12Z CMC adjusted closer to
recent GFS/ECMWF runs after previously being farther westward.

Based on guidance comparisons the forecast blend started with a
composite of 06Z/00Z models with more GFS/ECMWF weight versus
CMC/UKMET early in the period, followed by a trend toward
two-thirds ensemble means with the remainder more 00Z ECMWF than
06Z GFS.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

It appears fairly likely that moisture from Nicholas may produce
at least a localized heavy rain threat along and inland from the
central/east-central Gulf Coast into Thursday. There is still
considerable uncertainty over how long Nicholas could maintain its
definition, and specifics of weak Gulf flow that could still
interact with a potential convergence boundary near the coast even
if Nicholas dissipates. Continue to monitor the latest NHC
advisory products. Some of this tropical/Gulf moisture may enhance
rainfall over parts of the eastern U.S. but again with low
confidence in the details. Northern tier fronts may focus areas of
rain with locations over the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great
Lakes tending to see the best possibility of some locally moderate
to heavy activity. With greater confidence, expect areas of
moderate to locally heavy rainfall to reach the Pacific Northwest
Friday into the weekend with some snow possible in the highest
elevations of the Washington Cascades. The majority of rainfall
with the possible system off the East Coast should remain offshore
but areas from the Mid-Atlantic into New England should continue
to monitor forecasts closely due to the western periphery of the
moisture shield being very sensitive to exact track.

The cooling trend over the Northwest will bring highs down to
10-15F below normal from Friday onward and with gradual expansion
into the northern Rockies. At the same time the coverage of well
above normal temperatures from the High Plains eastward will
expand by the weekend, with plus 10-15F anomalies late this week
and possibly some plus 15-20F anomalies by Saturday-Monday. For
the five-day period the warmest max temp anomalies should be from
the central High Plains into the Great Lakes while warmest min
temp anomalies should align from the central/north-central Plains
into Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.

FOR TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 21 - MONDAY SEPTEMBER 27: There is relatively good
agreement among the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means depicting
mid-level troughing (ridging) across the western (eastern) North America, with
the GEFS and ECMWF favoring this pattern weakening throughout the period,
while
the Canadian pattern is more amplified. This pattern could support anomalously
cool temperatures sinking southward from western Canada. A slight risk of much
below normal temperatures is highlighted for parts of the western CONUS
(primarily higher elevation areas) Sep 21 to 22 where there is good agreement
between The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicating at least a 20 chance of
minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and 40 Deg F, with
some areas reaching freezing. The GEFS reforecast tool shows the potential for
minimum temperatures exceeding these thresholds extending further eastward to
parts of the  Great Plains, due to favoring mid-level troughing extending
further eastward compared to the ECMWF. Minimum temperatures may linger into
the middle of week-2. Due to significant model differences in the models and
reforecast tools, this hazard is not extended further in time but will be
monitored in the upcoming days. The anomalously cold temperatures may lead to
early season frost and freezes to impact vegetation in the region.



The mid-level troughing across the West may support surface low formation in
the lee of the Rockies at the beginning of the period. This feature combined
with possible surface high building across northwestern CONUS may support
increased surface level pressure gradients and resultant high winds in the lee
of the Rockies. Both the reforecast tools indicate elevated signals for
increased risk of high winds across the central CONUS, although the GEFS
reforecast tool has a weaker signal compared to the ECMWF reforecast tool
regarding high wind speed potential, with the greatest likelihood shifted
slightly further east across the Great Plains compared to the ECMWF. A slight
risk of high winds is posted for parts of the Northern and Central Plains, Sep
21 to 23, based on where the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts at least a 20%
chance of sustained wind speeds exceeding 85th percentile and 25 mph. The
ECMWF
reforecast tool is favored for today's high wind risk area due to its stronger
signal and also because it aligns better with where the surface pressure
gradients would most likely support enhanced wind speeds.



Across Alaska, surface high pressure is anticipated to build across parts of
mainland Alaska which could allow cold arctic air to spill southward into the
state. Both reforecast tools are in good agreement, showing at least a 20%
chance of many parts of mainland Alaska falling to the lowest 15th percentile
and sub-freezing temperatures at the beginning of week-2. A slight risk of
much
below normal temperatures is highlighted for parts of mainland Alaska,
extending from the Alaska Range northward to the Brooks Range. A moderate risk
is posted for interior parts of mainland Alaska, Sep 21 to 22, where the
reforecast tools indicate at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures
reaching hazards criteria. The daily 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean indicates the
potential for anomalies reaching at least 10 Deg F lower than normal in some
highlighted areas, compared to a 30 year climatology (1991-2020). This would
be
the first notable cold snap for parts of mainland Alaska, with temperatures
reaching sub-freezing for the first time of the season.



As of 2pm EDT, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring a surface
disturbance with a 50% chance of  forming into a tropical cyclone during
week-1
near the Bahamas. Recent runs of the deterministic GFS indicate the potential
for this disturbance approaching the Carolinas, but would be well off the East
coast by the beginning of week-2, precluding any inclusion of heavy
precipitation hazards associated with tropical storm activity at this time.
The
NHC also indicates an 80% chance of a tropical wave currently located over the
far eastern tropical Atlantic forming into a tropical cyclone in the next 5
days, although it is too far out in lead time to determine whether there will
be any related hazardous impacts to the CONUS.

...Tropical Storm Nicholas to produce torrential rainfall, strong
winds, and high surf from the Texas coast to southern Louisiana,
with life-threatening storm surge and flooding possible; High Risk
of Excessive Rainfall along the Upper Texas Coast today...

...Severe weather possible from the northern Great Plains to the
Great Lakes and Northeast...

...A hotter than normal mid-September in store across most of the
contiguous U.S.;Excessive Heat Warnings issued in parts of the
Southwest....

Tropical Storm Nicholas continues to track north this afternoon,
just off of the coast of south Texas.  With its current motion
expected to continue, Nicholas is forecast to move onshore along
the coast of central Texas later this evening.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected along portions of the middle Texas coast
beginning this afternoon.  Hurricane conditions are possible by
late this afternoon and there is the danger of life-threatening
storm surge inundation from Port Aransas to San Luis Pass, Texas.
Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Texas and Louisiana
coasts through the middle of the week.  Rainfall amounts totaling
8 to 16 inches, with locally higher amounts, are possible --
potentially resulting in areas of life-threatening flash and urban
flooding.  The Weather Prediction Center continues to highlight
the upper Texas coast with a High Risk for flash flooding through
the remainder of today and the overnight -- indicating that
widespread flash flooding can be expected across this region.

Elsewhere, a slow-moving front currently extends from the northern
Mid-Atlantic states all the way back into the Great Basin.  Low
pressure developing along the boundary is currently supporting
shower and thunderstorm development across portions of the
northern Great Plains and Upper Midwest.  As these storms continue
to develop, scattered strong to severe storms are possible from
eastern South Dakota and southern Minnesota/northern Iowa into
Wisconsin later this afternoon and tonight.  Strong to severe
storms are also possible farther east along the front across
portions of northern Pennsylvania, southern New York, and New
Jersey.  On Tuesday, the area of low pressure over the Midwest
will continue to strengthen as it tracks northeast across the
Upper Great Lakes.  Storms are expected to develop along and ahead
of the low's trailing cold front, with isolated to widely
scattered severe storms possible Tuesday and Tuesday night from
the Great Lakes to the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.

Temperatures will remain above their seasonal averages across much
of the Lower 48 through midweek.  Excessive Heat Warnings remain
in effect through this evening along the lower Colorado River
Basin into southwestern Arizona -- where afternoon temperatures
are once again climbing well above 100F.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon September 13 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 19 - 23 2021

Today's ensemble mean solutions show very good agreement among the models on
the 500-hPa flow pattern over North America. An amplified ridge is forecast
over the Aleutians. A 500-hPa trough stretches from northern Alaska to the
northwest CONUS and mean ridging is favored over much of the remainder of the
CONUS. The 500-hPa height blend features positive height anomalies over the
Aleutians and southwestern Mainland Alaska, negative height anomalies over
most
of the remainder of Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, and the
northwestern
CONUS. Positive height anomalies are favored over much of the remainder of the
CONUS, underneath mean ridging.

Amplified troughing over the Gulf of Alaska favors below-normal temperatures
for much of Alaska and the western CONUS. Predicted 500-hPa ridging forecast
over the southwestern CONUS and most of the eastern CONUS leads to enhanced
chances of above-normal temperatures, with the highest probability (exceeding
90%) over the eastern Midwest and much of the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast.

Along and west of the forecast mean trough axis, northeasterly surface flow is
predicted, increasing odds of below-normal precipitation over of southwestern
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. The forecast trough over the Gulf of Alaska
favors an active storm track and increased onshore flow across much of the
remainder of Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, and portions of the
northwestern CONUS, leading to enhanced odds of above normal precipitation.
Southeast of the predicted trough over the Gulf of Alaska, forecast surface
high pressure increases the likelihood of near to below-normal precipitation
across much of the southwestern CONUS from the High Plains to the West Coast.
Ahead of the predicted trough, several storm systems with trailing frontal
boundaries are forecast to sweep eastward, favoring above-normal precipitation
for much of the eastern half of the U.S. However, below normal precipitation
is
favored over parts of the Northeast, consistent with the consolidation
forecast
tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the ensemble models and tools in depicting a relatively
amplified pattern, offset by increasing uncertainty in the position and
strength of the forecast trough.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 21 - 27 2021

Heading into the Week-2 period, the 500-hPa pattern shows a slight progression
of the 6-10 day mean 500-hPa pattern, though the amplitude of most features is
expected to be lower due to increased uncertainty. Due to the pattern being
very similar to the 6-10 day period, the Week-2 temperature and precipitation
probability forecasts are very similar as well. The potential for tropical
activity during the Week-2 period increases the likelihood of above-normal
precipitation in the Southeast and along the Gulf Coast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 4 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the models and tools, and a relatively amplified and
persistent
pattern across the domain with good day-to-day consistency.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

...Heavy Rain From Tropical Storm Nicholas May Continue Into
Thursday...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 15Z National Hurricane Center advisory for Tropical Storm
Nicholas shows the system weakening to a remnant low over the
Lower Mississippi Valley by the start of the period early Thursday
and dissipating soon thereafter. Potential exists for associated
moisture to maintain a threat for some heavy rainfall over parts
of the southern tier into Thursday. Check the latest NHC products
for additional information on Nicholas.

Models and means continue to show amplification of the large scale
pattern from late this week to the start of next week, leading to
a more pronounced contrast in weather conditions. An upper trough
reaching the West Coast will bring a period of well below normal
high temperatures to the Northwest along with enhanced rainfall
(and high elevation snow in the northern Cascades). On the other
hand rising heights aloft downstream with ridging becoming more
prominent over the East by next Sunday-Monday will promote an
expanding area of well above normal temperatures from the High
Plains into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast. Flow between the trough
and developing ridge will move along frontal systems between the
northern half of the Plains and New England. Meanwhile guidance
continues to signal potential for an area of low pressure to
develop and track northward off the East Coast. How much if any
rainfall that reaches the East Coast will be very sensitive to the
system's track--which at the moment appears to be just far enough
east to keep most of the moisture offshore except perhaps for far
eastern North Carolina and the southwest corner of New England.

Over the past day guidance has trended much closer together for
the details of the upper trough and leading surface front
extending into the northern U.S. from a strong system initially
over southern Canada. This developing consensus has been perhaps
two-thirds from the past couple ECMWF runs trending noticeably
slower/northward with the front due to a slower/less amplified
depiction of the upper trough and one-third from the GFS trending
faster. Forecasts of the West Coast trough diverge after Saturday
due in part to timing differences over the Aleutians/North
Pacific. Latest GFS runs have been on the fast/amplified side of
the spread while CMC runs have been slowest. GEFS means have been
moderately progressive but not quite to the extent of the GFS
while the 00Z ECMWF mean is slower than its operational run, just
a bit faster than the CMC. Guidance has been shuffling around for
timing over recent days so an intermediate approach seems best.
Consensus track of western Atlantic low pressure has held up
fairly well over the past 24 hours. The 12Z CMC adjusted closer to
recent GFS/ECMWF runs after previously being farther westward.

Based on guidance comparisons the forecast blend started with a
composite of 06Z/00Z models with more GFS/ECMWF weight versus
CMC/UKMET early in the period, followed by a trend toward
two-thirds ensemble means with the remainder more 00Z ECMWF than
06Z GFS.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

It appears fairly likely that moisture from Nicholas may produce
at least a localized heavy rain threat along and inland from the
central/east-central Gulf Coast into Thursday. There is still
considerable uncertainty over how long Nicholas could maintain its
definition, and specifics of weak Gulf flow that could still
interact with a potential convergence boundary near the coast even
if Nicholas dissipates. Continue to monitor the latest NHC
advisory products. Some of this tropical/Gulf moisture may enhance
rainfall over parts of the eastern U.S. but again with low
confidence in the details. Northern tier fronts may focus areas of
rain with locations over the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great
Lakes tending to see the best possibility of some locally moderate
to heavy activity. With greater confidence, expect areas of
moderate to locally heavy rainfall to reach the Pacific Northwest
Friday into the weekend with some snow possible in the highest
elevations of the Washington Cascades. The majority of rainfall
with the possible system off the East Coast should remain offshore
but areas from the Mid-Atlantic into New England should continue
to monitor forecasts closely due to the western periphery of the
moisture shield being very sensitive to exact track.

The cooling trend over the Northwest will bring highs down to
10-15F below normal from Friday onward and with gradual expansion
into the northern Rockies. At the same time the coverage of well
above normal temperatures from the High Plains eastward will
expand by the weekend, with plus 10-15F anomalies late this week
and possibly some plus 15-20F anomalies by Saturday-Monday. For
the five-day period the warmest max temp anomalies should be from
the central High Plains into the Great Lakes while warmest min
temp anomalies should align from the central/north-central Plains
into Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Models and means continue to show amplification of the large scale
pattern from late this week to the start of next week, with
amplified troughing building over the West and eventually shifting
into the Central U.S. by next Tuesday while downstream, ridging
builds across the Eastern U.S.. The flow in between will help move
along frontal systems across the Plains and New England. Meanwhile
guidance continues to signal potential for an area of low pressure
to develop and track northward off the East Coast but continues to
show the heaviest rainfall should remain offshore, perhaps well
offshore.

The guidance shows good agreement on this overall pattern for days
3-4 so a general model blend should serve as a good starting
point. After that, uncertainty in timing of the trough axis and
individual shortwave perturbations within the mean trough begin to
arise as it enters the Western U.S. on Sunday and marches eastward
to the Central/Northern Plains by Tuesday. The CMC is slow/west of
the better consensus, while the GFS is a little bit faster (but
still within the general spread). The guidance continues to jump
around for timing run to run so an intermediate approach still
seems best. Based on this assessment, WPC favored an increasing
blend towards the ensemble means days 5-7 with some modest
contributions from the ECMWF and GFS for added flow definition.
This approach maintained good continuity with the previous WPC
forecast for days 3-6.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Remnant moisture of whatever is left of tropical cyclone Nicholas
(if anything) by the start of the medium range period may enhance
rainfall over parts of the eastern U.S., but with low confidence
in the details. Back along the gulf coast, this moisture may also
interact with a potential convergence boundary to produce
additional mainly light to moderate rainfall across parts of
southeast Texas and Louisiana. Localized instances of flooding may
be possible, depending on resulting heavy rain impacts as Nicholas
moves through that region during the short range. Northern tier
fronts may focus areas of rain with locations over the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes tending to see the best
possibility of some locally moderate to heavy activity. With
greater confidence, expect areas of moderate to locally heavy
rainfall should reach the Pacific Northwest Friday into the
weekend with some snow possible in the highest elevations of the
Washington Cascades. The majority of rainfall with the possible
system off the East Coast should remain offshore but areas from
the Mid-Atlantic into New England should continue to monitor
forecasts closely due to the western periphery of the moisture
shield being very sensitive to exact track.

The amplified troughing will promote a cooling trend over the
Northwest will bring highs down to 10-15F below normal from Friday
onward and with gradual expansion into the northern Rockies as
surface high pressure settles in behind the front. Meanwhile,
downstream, expect a warming trending in temperatures from the
southern/central Plains to the Northeast within a building ridge
aloft. Warmest anomalies of possibly +10-20F should shift from the
northern Plains on Saturday into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
Sunday-Monday.

...Synopsis...
Relatively benign fire weather conditions are expected today as
winds are forecast to be light across most of the West with moist
conditions expected across the East. Some locally elevated
conditions may occur in portions of the central Rockies and the
Southwest, but conditions aren't expected to be widespread or strong
enough to warrant an elevated delineation.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0119 AM CDT Tue Sep 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
On Wednesday, a strong area of low pressure is forecast to cross the
Canadian Prairies as moderate to strong mid-level flow traverses the
Canadian Rockies. A cold front will extend from this surface low
along the northern Plains and into the central High Plains.

...Eastern Idaho into Southern Wyoming...
Deep mixing is forecast across much of the Great Basin and central
Rockies Wednesday afternoon. Mid-level flow is expected to
strengthen throughout the day with the stronger flow expanding
southward into the northern Great Basin. Some of this stronger flow
is expected to transfer to the surface in the well-mixed airmass
across the region. Winds of 15 to 20 mph are forecast with relative
humidity dropping into the single digits in some locations.

...Eastern Montana into western North Dakota and far northwest South
Dakota...
Breezy conditions are expected to develop as the pressure gradient
tightens across the northern Plains through the day. Dry westerly
flow behind the cold front is forecast to bring relative humidity of
20 to 30 percent. Farther north, across northeast Montana, winds may
exceed 25 mph, but relative humidity is expected to remain at or
above 30 percent. However, fuels are dry in the area the strong
winds may overcompensate for the higher relative humidity.
Therefore, it seems justifiable to include the elevated delineation
into this area.

...Nicholas to produce torrential rainfall, strong winds, and high
surf from the Upper Texas coast to southern Louisiana, with
life-threatening storm surge and flooding possible; High Risk of
Excessive Rainfall in southwest Louisiana today...

...Severe weather and heavy rainfall possible from the central
High Plains to the Great Lakes and Northeast...

...A hotter than normal mid-September in store across most of the
contiguous U.S....

Nicholas, which briefly reached hurricane status overnight, is
hammering the Upper Texas coast and southern Louisiana with heavy
rainfall, strong winds, and battering surf. Even as the storm
returns to tropical storm status this morning, life threatening
flash and urban flooding remains possible from far eastern Texas
to the central Gulf Coast. A High Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in
place for far southwest Louisiana and along the coastal areas of
the TX/LA border. Meanwhile, the Moderate Risk area extends as far
north as central Louisiana and as far east as New Orleans.
Nicholas' slow movement will lead to a steady barrage of heavy
rain in portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley into Wednesday
where a Moderate Risk for Excessive Rainfall remains in place.
Even as the storm weakens to a Tropical Depression late Wednesday
into early Thursday, heavy showers and thunderstorms will continue
to generate torrential rainfall rates across the Deep South. In
total, over a foot of rainfall is possible in this area with much
of southern and central Louisiana receiving anywhere from 5 to 10
inches for the duration of this storm from far east Texas to the
central Gulf Coast.

Elsewhere, an area of low pressure in the Midwest will work in
tandem with an elongated frontal boundary extending as far east as
the Northeast Coast and a cold front swinging through the Central
Plains to produce strong-to-severe storms today. Locations most at
risk for severe weather are the Great Lakes where a Slight Risk
has been issued for today. By Wednesday the intensifying area of
low pressure reaches Quebec while its trailing cold front
approaches the Northeast. Slight Risks for both severe weather and
Excessive Rainfall have been issued for portions of the Northeast
and Mid-Atlantic for Wednesday. As this frontal system exits off
the East Coast by Thursday morning, a new storm system looks to
gather strength over the Midwest bringing with it yet another
round of showers and potentially severe thunderstorms to the
region.

There are very few signs of autumn across most of the Lower 48 as
temperatures remain above their seasonal averages through midweek.
The hottest conditions compared to normal are forecast to occur in
the Mid-Atlantic and the Southwest. Below normal high temps are
anticipated across the Deep South as thick cloud cover courtesy of
Nicholas keeps high temps as cool as 10 to 15 degrees below
normal. If any region is feeling most like autumn for
mid-September it is the Pacific Northwest where below normal
temperatures will be most common, even into the second half of the
work-week.

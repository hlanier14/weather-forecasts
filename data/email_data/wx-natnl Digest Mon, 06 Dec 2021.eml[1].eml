Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1042 AM CST Sun Dec 05 2021

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

Elevated conditions are ongoing across parts of southeast WY into
adjacent areas of CO and NE. Recent high-res guidance has captured
the progression of an approaching cold front well, but suggests that
2-3 hours of elevated, to briefly critical, fire weather conditions
are probable across northeast CO into northwest KS ahead of the
front. While the duration of this threat remains somewhat uncertain,
these noted trends combined with very dry fuels warrant an expansion
of the Elevated risk area.

Further south, the 12Z AMA sounding and KAMA VAD reveal strong winds
just above the nocturnal inversion. Sounding analysis suggests that
locations with temperatures in the upper 70s to low 80s will likely
see sufficient mixing to realize 30-35 mph gusts at the surface.
With RH values already falling into the 30-40% range and further
reductions expected, periods of critical conditions are possible.
Based on latest visible imagery, temperature trends, and forecast
guidance, this seems most likely within a corridor from the Lubbock,
TX area to southwest OK.

All other forecast concerns outlined in the discussion below remain
valid.

..Moore.. 12/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1242 AM CST Sun Dec 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
The jet stream will become more amplified today as an upper trough
deepens in the northern and central Plains. This will promote a
deepening surface low in the upper Midwest. A cold front will push
southward into the southern Plains by the end of the period. High
pressure will also build into the Great Basin.

...Southern High Plains...
An area of strong westerly surface winds will develop ahead of the
cold front across east-central New Mexico into the Texas South
Plains. Winds will range from 15-20 mph with perhaps locally higher
speeds. RH will fall to 15-20%. Dry fuels will support elevated to
locally critical fire weather.

...Southeastern Colorado...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather is probable as a favorable
pressure gradient sets up perpendicular to the Rockies/Sangre de
Cristo. Westerly winds of 15-25 mph are possible along with RH
nearing 10-15%. Critical conditions are most likely within the
mountain passes.

...Northeastern Colorado...
Briefly elevated conditions are possible immediately behind the cold
front due to some remaining downslope component of the surface
winds. However, RH will increase rapidly behind the front,
precluding highlights.

...Southern California...
Offshore winds will increase modestly through the day, perhaps
peaking during the evening into Monday morning. Upper-level winds
will support a few stronger gusts in the wind-prone terrain areas.
Overall, the scenario shown in model guidance along with pressure
gradient magnitude trends suggest locally elevated conditions
confined to the terrain from Santa Barbara into Los Angeles
Counties. Any critical conditions would be even more localized and
brief.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sun Dec 05 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Dec 08 2021 - 12Z Sun Dec 12 2021

...Some snow is possible on Wednesday for portions of the
Northeast and northern Mid-Atlantic, potentially including the
I-95 corridor...

...Considerable mountain snows are likely across the Cascades,
Sierra Nevada, Intermountain West, and Rockies during the latter
half of next week...

...Overview...

Expect the start of the medium range period on Wednesday to
feature a broad mean trough across much of the lower 48,
supporting an active weather pattern with embedded shortwaves
pushing low pressure/frontal systems across the country. One
system should bring widespread rain to the Southeast on Wednesday
while parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic may see snow. By
Thursday-Friday amplifying energy entering the western side of the
mean trough will develop a more pronounced upper trough over the
West, with the trough likely to progress steadily onward into the
central and eastern U.S. during the weekend. This system will
bring the potential for meaningful precipitation and heavy
mountain snows over the West and then organized precipitation
spreading into the central and eastern U.S. by late week through
the weekend along and ahead of a strong cold front. Guidance is
advertising a change in the pattern around the end of the period
and beyond with the next trough amplifying over the eastern
Pacific.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

During the first half of the period, the overall large scale
pattern remains agreeable among model guidance but embedded
shortwave uncertainties continue to lower confidence in some
important details. The most notable example continues to be with a
shortwave forecast to be over the east-central U.S. early
Wednesday and northern New England/western Atlantic by early
Thursday. Over multiple runs subtle low-predictability detail
differences have led to very different surface solutions for low
pressure that tracks off the East Coast along with associated
coverage/intensity of precipitation and location of the rain-snow
line. Within the broad spread of guidance, recent GFS runs have
been among the slowest and deepest with the midlevel shortwave,
leading to surface low tracks farther west closer to the Northeast
coast compared to consensus. The 00Z/06Z runs were still on the
western side of the spread in spite of some eastward trend
recently, while ensemble trends over the past day show a dramatic
trimming of members on the western side of the envelope. The new
12Z GFS has continued its recent trend of gradual suppression of
the track and moisture shield. The GFS and overall guidance trend
toward a more suppressed/offshore low track is leading to less
precipitation forecast to fall over the northeastern quadrant of
the CONUS overall, though a corresponding colder trend would
support a farther south rain-snow line. Upstream energy reaching
the Northwest and Southwest Wednesday and moving quickly east
thereafter, along with the associated surface reflection, have
also exhibited some detail differences but with less influence on
sensible weather impacts. For this part of the forecast the
preference continues to be with an intermediate solution derived
from a 00Z/06Z model composite.

The general consensus remains fairly good for the upper trough
amplifying into the West by late in the week and continuing
eastward thereafter, but with lingering spread for specifics of
how energy will be distributed within the trough and frontal wave
details. Trends over the past couple days have generally been
somewhat faster but the new 12Z ECMWF has reversed that trend a
bit. Meanwhile CMC runs and some ensemble members have been trying
to pull off some energy into a slower southern stream feature,
with 00Z CMC runs tending to be more extreme versus other
models/means and the 12Z runs adjusting eastward closer to other
guidance. Behind this system, essentially two clusters develop for
the upper trough expected to amplify over the eastern Pacific--the
somewhat faster and more amplified GFS/GEFS mean versus
slower/broader ECMWF/CMC and their ensemble means.  Differences
for these two major features are generally within the realm of
guidance error for the late extended time frame (though understood
to be very important for the character of precipitation over the
Pacific Northwest next weekend), leading to transitioning the
forecast toward a blend of 00Z/06Z GFS and 06Z GEFS runs along
with the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Around midweek wavy fronts over the Southeast and low development
into the western Atlantic will produce rainfall over the Southeast
and spread some moisture into cooler air farther north where
precipitation may fall as snow. Models are still having difficulty
in resolving important subtle details that will determine
precipitation coverage, type, and amounts. Recent trends for a
more more suppressed surface low track are bringing the potential
rain-snow line gradually southward over the Mid-Atlantic but also
lowering the amount of snow that may fall to the north over New
England. Overall the probabilities for significant amounts of snow
have declined in the past day.

As shortwave energy and upper troughing drop southward through the
West, precipitation will spread from the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies Wednesday southward to California into the Great
Basin to Central Rockies Thursday and Friday. Favored terrain in
Arizona could also see some enhanced activity. Generally expect
higher elevation snow and lower elevation rain, with snow levels
likely to decline later in the week as upper troughing amplifies
over the West. Parts of Southern California may see the first
rainfall in over a month. Then as the western upper trough
approaches/pushes into the Plains toward the end of the week,
rainfall may become moderate to heavy over parts of the
east-central U.S. by next Saturday with the aid of strengthening
Gulf inflow ahead of a wavy front. The character of one or more
frontal waves will determine precipitation amounts over the
eastern half of the country and possible winter weather impacts
from the Plains through the Midwest/Great Lakes.

Strong flow ahead of a developing eastern Pacific upper trough may
bring an atmospheric river event into the Pacific Northwest
starting around Friday night or Saturday and continuing through
the weekend. There is still a fair degree of uncertainty over the
progression/southward extent of moisture but this event requires
monitoring due to the potential for some areas to see heavy
precipitation.

Temperatures Wednesday will be about 10-15F above average for the
High Plains, and expect temperatures to trend even warmer across
the central and eventually eastern U.S. as the pattern amplifies.
By Friday temperatures in the Southern Plains and the Lower/Middle
Mississippi Valley should reach 15-25F above normal, with highs
nearing or exceeding 80F in parts of Texas into the Lower
Mississippi Valley, which could approach or reach daily records.
After a chilly start Wednesday, the eastern U.S. will see a
pronounced warming trend as highs 15-25F and lows 15-30F above
normal reach into the eastern U.S. for the weekend. Behind the
front, the West should see a couple days of highs 5-15F below
normal late in the week but this cool air will modify closer to
normal by the time it reaches the Plains. The upcoming change in
the pattern toward the end of the period should return
temperatures to 10-20F above normal across the northern two-thirds
of the Plains by next Sunday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sun Dec 05 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Dec 08 2021 - 12Z Sun Dec 12 2021

...Some snow is possible on Wednesday for portions of the
Northeast and northern Mid-Atlantic, potentially including the
I-95 corridor...

...Considerable mountain snows are likely across the Cascades,
Sierra Nevada, Intermountain West, and Rockies during the latter
half of next week...

...Overview...

Expect the start of the medium range period on Wednesday to
feature a broad mean trough across much of the lower 48,
supporting an active weather pattern with embedded shortwaves
pushing low pressure/frontal systems across the country. One
system should bring widespread rain to the Southeast on Wednesday
while parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic may see snow. By
Thursday-Friday amplifying energy entering the western side of the
mean trough will develop a more pronounced upper trough over the
West, with the trough likely to progress steadily onward into the
central and eastern U.S. during the weekend. This system will
bring the potential for meaningful precipitation and heavy
mountain snows over the West and then organized precipitation
spreading into the central and eastern U.S. by late week through
the weekend along and ahead of a strong cold front. Guidance is
advertising a change in the pattern around the end of the period
and beyond with the next trough amplifying over the eastern
Pacific.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

During the first half of the period, the overall large scale
pattern remains agreeable among model guidance but embedded
shortwave uncertainties continue to lower confidence in some
important details. The most notable example continues to be with a
shortwave forecast to be over the east-central U.S. early
Wednesday and northern New England/western Atlantic by early
Thursday. Over multiple runs subtle low-predictability detail
differences have led to very different surface solutions for low
pressure that tracks off the East Coast along with associated
coverage/intensity of precipitation and location of the rain-snow
line. Within the broad spread of guidance, recent GFS runs have
been among the slowest and deepest with the midlevel shortwave,
leading to surface low tracks farther west closer to the Northeast
coast compared to consensus. The 00Z/06Z runs were still on the
western side of the spread in spite of some eastward trend
recently, while ensemble trends over the past day show a dramatic
trimming of members on the western side of the envelope. The new
12Z GFS has continued its recent trend of gradual suppression of
the track and moisture shield. The GFS and overall guidance trend
toward a more suppressed/offshore low track is leading to less
precipitation forecast to fall over the northeastern quadrant of
the CONUS overall, though a corresponding colder trend would
support a farther south rain-snow line. Upstream energy reaching
the Northwest and Southwest Wednesday and moving quickly east
thereafter, along with the associated surface reflection, have
also exhibited some detail differences but with less influence on
sensible weather impacts. For this part of the forecast the
preference continues to be with an intermediate solution derived
from a 00Z/06Z model composite.

The general consensus remains fairly good for the upper trough

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track based on latest trends in
observations and guidance. Ensemble solutions continue to show
reasonably high probabilities for post-frontal winds between 15-20
mph across central TX Monday. However, the spatial and temporal
overlap of these winds with sufficiently low RH remains uncertain.
Locations across central TX will likely see periods of elevated
conditions, but confidence in the overall threat remains too low for
highlights.

..Moore.. 12/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1244 AM CST Sun Dec 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will move through the Midwest and
Northeast on Monday. In its wake, cold air will be situated within
much of the Plains. Dry post-frontal conditions are possible in
parts of western and central Texas. However, the strongest winds are
expected during the beginning of the day prior to RH minima during
the afternoon. Locally elevated conditions are most likely in parts
of the Texas Low Rolling Plains, where fuels remain modestly dry and
15-20 mph winds could overlap 20-25% RH for a couple of hours.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun December 05 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

East Coast overnight Monday. The system will produce heavy snow
over parts of the Upper Great Lakes through Monday evening. As a
result, High Wind Warnings, Winter Storm Advisories, and Winter
Storm Warnings are up along the Northern Tier through Sunday
night. Rain over the Northeast into the Central Appalachians will
change over to snow Monday afternoon into the evening.  The light
snow will move off the Northeast Coast by Tuesday afternoon. The
snow and wind will result in reduced visibilities and hazardous
driving conditions. This will also be the first widespread heavy
snowfall of the winter season.  In the wake of the storm, lake
effect snow will develop downwind from the Great Lakes.

Meanwhile, moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will start to
pool along the associated front producing rain over parts of the
Great Lakes, Ohio, Middle/Lower Mississippi, and Tennessee Valleys
by Sunday evening. Overnight Sunday, showers and thunderstorms
will develop along and ahead of the front over the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys; some of these thunderstorms
will be severe. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys through Monday morning.  The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Moreover, heavy rain will develop with the showers and
thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Lower Mississippi, Southern
Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys through Monday morning.  The
associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain.

Furthermore, temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average
over parts of the East Coast on Monday.  Overnight Sunday,
upper-level energy and onshore flow will produce a new round of
rain and snow over the Northwest that will expand inland over
parts of the Great Basin and the Northern Rockies. Overnight
Monday, rain will expand into parts of California that will move
southward to Southern California by Tuesday evening and into parts
of the Southwest overnight Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

...Considerable mountain snows are likely across the Cascades,
Sierra Nevada, Intermountain West, and Rockies Thursday into
Friday...

...Overview...

As the medium range period begins Thursday, a broad mean upper
trough causing quasi-zonal flow across much of the country will be
in place, supporting an active weather pattern with embedded
shortwaves pushing low pressure/frontal systems across the
country. The pattern is forecast to amplify late week as energy
entering the western side of the mean trough develops a more
pronounced upper trough over the West, with the trough likely to
progress steadily onward into the central and eastern U.S. during
the weekend. This system will bring the potential for meaningful
precipitation and heavy mountain snows over the West and then
organized precipitation spreading into the central and eastern
U.S. by late week through the weekend along and ahead of a strong
cold front. As that trough exits the U.S. around Monday, broad
ridging should dominate the lower 48 as another eastern Pacific
trough amplifies.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 12/18Z model cycle continues to be in reasonably good
agreement with the overall large-scale pattern described above,
while smaller-scale shortwave uncertainties continue to lower
confidence in the details. Some slight model differences were seen
with amplitude and track of the shortwave energy dropping through
the West Thursday-Friday serving to deepen the trough, while there
is also variety in track and timing of when a southern stream
shortwave west of Baja California Thursday gets absorbed likely on
Friday. The 12Z ECMWF appears to be a bit of an outlier with the
latter, with a eastern position and faster absorption compared to
other guidance and its previous runs, which is likely a cause of
minor differences in the broad western trough Friday (slightly
eastward extent and more of a neutral than positive tilt in the
12Z ECMWF compared to other guidance). Fortunately this does not
cause any significant issues with the surface low pressure
deepening in the lee of the Central Rockies Friday, and the bulk
of model guidance is in overall good agreement with the trough
(and the associated surface cold front ahead of it) tracking
across the central U.S. Saturday and toward the East
Sunday-Monday. Differences with the specifics of how energy will
be distributed within the trough as well as frontal wave
differences remain--though new 00Z guidance shows better
clustering with a surface low in the Great Lakes early Saturday.
By Sunday, the 12Z CMC separates the northern and southern streams
and closes off a mid-upper low in the Lower Mississippi Valley,
which is an outlier at this point but not outside the realm of
possibilities.

By early next week, troughing is forecast to develop in the
eastern Pacific, but models show variations in timing of the
trough pushing southward, which impacts the Pacific Northwest in
particular. GFS runs and to some extent the GEFS means have been
consistent in showing the troughing with more of a southward
extent by Sunday, giving the Northwest southwesterly flow, while
slower troughing in the ECMWF and CMC runs lead to zonal east-west
flow there Sunday. The differences progress into Monday with how
close troughing will be to the coast. Differences for these two
major features are generally within the realm of guidance error
for the late extended time frame (though understood to be very
important for the character of precipitation over the Pacific
Northwest next weekend).

The WPC forecast was based on a blend of the 12/18Z deterministic
guidance early in the period, and phased in the GEFS and EC
ensemble means to about 60% of the blend by the end of the period
to reduce smaller scale model differences.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As the trough deepens in the West, precipitation will spread from
the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies southward to California
into the Great Basin to Central Rockies Thursday and Friday.
Favored terrain in Arizona could also see some enhanced activity.
Generally expect higher elevation snow and lower elevation rain,
with snow levels likely somewhat low as upper troughing amplifies.
Parts of Southern California may see the first rainfall in over a
month. Then as the western upper trough approaches/pushes into the
Plains toward the end of the week, precipitation should track
ahead of a low pressure system and a strong cold front. Some
wintry weather could spread into the Northern Plains and
Midwest/Great Lakes Friday in the cold air north and west of the
low track. Then rainfall may become moderate to heavy over parts
of the east-central U.S. especially by Saturday with the aid of
strengthening Gulf inflow ahead of the strong cold front.
Additionally, heavy precipitation chances are forecast to increase
in the Pacific Northwest starting around Friday night or Saturday
and continuing through the weekend as a potential atmospheric
river event sets up, though uncertainty remains with the
progression/southward extent of moisture, and will continue to be
monitored.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast to be in place in the central U.S. Thursday and Friday,
with highs currently forecast to rise into the 80s in portions of
Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley, which could approach or
set daily records as the temperatures should be 15-30F above
normal. These warm temperatures will push into the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys and Eastern Seaboard on Saturday, while temperatures
moderate to near normal behind. The western U.S. can expect below
average temperatures especially Friday and Saturday, with the
Central Great Basin in particular seeing temperatures 10-20F below
normal. Then, as ridging builds across the lower 48 by early next
week, temperatures should return to 10-20F above normal across the
northern two-thirds of the Plains by next Sunday and Monday.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level trough will move eastward through the Northeast
today. Across much of the central and western U.S., broad cyclonic
flow will develop. At the surface, a cold front will continue
southward through the Plains, reaching the Gulf Coast during the
evening/overnight. Locally elevated fire weather conditions are
possible in parts of the Texas Low Rolling Plains into the Edwards
Plateau. However, overlap of 20-25% RH and 15-20 mph winds appears
it will be less than three hours. No highlights will be added.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CST Mon Dec 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will deepen across the eastern third of the
country while an upper ridge develops over the central/northern
Rockies on Tuesday. Weak lee troughing in the southern High Plains
is possible during the afternoon. Some increase in westerly winds in
eastern New Mexico and western Texas will occur as a result. Between
RH being marginally low (likely 20-25%) and winds being light
(around 15 mph), only locally elevated conditions are expected.

...Gusty winds and lake effect snow to impact the Great Lakes and
Interior Northeast through early Tuesday...

...Strong to severe thunderstorms and heavy rain possible today
across portions of the Southeast and Lower Mississippi Valley...

A vigorous low pressure system currently located over the Upper
Great Lakes will exit the U.S. and enter southeast Canada by this
afternoon. Light-to-moderate snow on the backside of the system
will turn into mostly lake effect showers by this evening as
bitterly cold air rushes over the ice-free Great Lakes. Several
additional inches of snow are likely for localized areas that
typically see impacts from lake effect snow. The arctic airmass
over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest will definitely make
extra layers necessary if venturing outdoors. Low temperatures
below zero and highs only into the single digits are forecast
throughout northern Montana, North Dakota, and northern Minnesota
until Wednesday. Gusty winds will make it feel even colder. In
fact, Wind Chill Advisories are in effect here to highlight the
potential for wind chills to dip as low as 30 below zero. Speaking
of wind gusts, portions of the Interior Northeast will also be
dealing with potentially damaging winds as a potent cold front
pushes through this evening along with scattered showers. High
Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories have been issued from far
northern Pennsylvania to northern Vermont, where winds could gust
over 50 mph. Outside of the aforementioned lake effect snow,
Tuesday should be a much quieter day throughout these regions.

Farther south, the aforementioned cold front extends to the
Southern Plains and is expected to continue racing southeastward
until stalling along the Gulf Coast on Tuesday. A line of showers
and thunderstorms riding this cold front could spawn a few
damaging wind gusts and isolated tornadoes between Alabama and
eastern Texas today. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe weather that includes central
Mississippi, northern Louisiana, and far eastern Texas.
Additionally, heavy rain and a few isolated instances of flooding
cannot be ruled out as well.

By Tuesday night, an approaching upper-level trough is forecast to
enter the Ohio Valley while an area of low pressure begins to
develop along the Carolina coast. As a result, an area of light
snow is expected to stretch from the Ohio Valley to the
Mid-Atlantic into Wednesday morning. There remains large
uncertainty regarding where exactly light snow will fall, but
morning commutes may be impacted nonetheless as this would be the
first accumulating snowfall for many.

For the western U.S., periods of light coastal/lower elevation
rain and mountain snow are forecast to overspread much of the
Northwest and Northern Rockies today before moisture reaches the
Central Rockies and parts of central California on Tuesday. The
next cold front is set to sweep into the Northwest on Tuesday
night and produce more rounds of mostly light precipitation, with
heavier snowfall confined to the far northern Washington Cascades.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Mon Aug 23 2021

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The previous forecast remains valid with no major changes. The
Elevated area across eastern/central Wyoming was expanded slightly
for the latest hi-res guidance. Locally elevated fire weather
conditions will be possible across parts of central Nevada where
wind gusts greater than 15 mph and RH values below 15% may develop
during the day.

..Lyons.. 08/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Mon Aug 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough evident in water vapor imagery this morning over
the Pacific Northwest is forecast to move across the northern
Intermountain West and Rockies today.  An associated belt of
enhanced midlevel west-southwesterly flow (>50 knots) will move
across Montana this afternoon and evening.  In response at the
surface, low pressure will deepen over southeastern Montana through
the day.

...Central/Northeastern Wyoming...
As diurnal heating occurs in the presence of dry airmass, deep and
well-mixed boundary layers will yield critical RH values (<15%).  In
addition, these deep boundary layers will promote downward vertical
mixing of enhanced flow aloft and contribute to sustained afternoon
surface wind speeds approaching 20 mph.  As a result, elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions are likely given the dry
fuels across the region.

...Eastern Wyoming and Adjacent Portions of Southeastern Montana,
Western South Dakota, and Western Nebraska Panhandle...
Modest midlevel moisture in the presence of deep inverted-v profiles
across the region should support enough instability for at least
isolated thunderstorm development.  Given the expected high cloud
bases and dry sub-cloud layer, little precipitation is expected to
reach the ground from these storms, supporting isolated dry
thunderstorm potential.  Furthermore, relatively fast storm motions
and low PW values (around 0.5") should also support the potential
for isolated dry thunderstorms.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain threat Friday into the weekend...


...Overview...

The latest model guidance shows average to above average agreement
for the upper level pattern and trended well from continuity. This
adds forecast confidence to the period. Shortwave troughing over
the Pacific Northwest will gradually extend eastward toward the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest by late this weekend into early
next week, around the north side of a broad mean ridge that
extends from the Atlantic through eastern/southern parts of the
lower 48. Periodic impulses moving through the flow will support
episodes of potentially heavy rainfall across the Upper Midwest
beginning Friday through the weekend. Areas to the south of the
fronts will tend to be humid and very warm to hot with some
diurnally favored showers and thunderstorms.  Possible tropical
development over the northwestern Caribbean and southwestern Gulf
of Mexico may bring some enhanced moisture to the western half of
the Gulf Coast region by Sunday-Monday.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The model guidance has clustered together somewhat for the
expected upper level pattern late this week into early next week,
particularly with the progression and impulses of shortwave
troughs through the Northwest to Upper Midwest. The first wave
looks to arrive late Friday with the deterministic guidance
agreeing well. Perhaps some minor timing differences but all the
models then advertise upstream energy carving out a deeper trough
over the Northwest/Northern Rockies Saturday/Saturday night.
Beyond that, as that wave ejects into the Upper  Midwest, there is
some amplitude and timing issues, with the CMC notably stronger
while the ECMWF a bit flatter/progressive. The 00Z GFS was on the
slower side of the model spread. A consensus approach, favoring
the GFS and ECMWF, were chosen. Another shortwave trough or closed
low will approach the Pacific Northwest early next week with some
of the typical model biases seen. A tropical wave across the
southwest Caribbean will be watched closely by the National
Hurricane Center for possible development this weekend into early
next week as the system is forecast to track into the far western
Gulf. For now, the guidance is reasonably clustered for day 6 and
day 7 with the coordinated position near the model consensus.

Overall, preferences followed an operational model blend early and
then transitioned to a model/mean mix including the 06Z GFS/GEFS
mean and 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean/CMC.  This led to reasonable
continuity in principle while reflecting some adjustments as
reflected in the majority of latest guidance and downplaying
details that have the lowest confidence.

...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A strong heavy rainfall signal exists for portions of the Upper
Midwest / Upper Mississippi River Valley Friday into the weekend
as several impulses move through the area at the nose of a
warm/moist air mass. Multiple episodes and possible training
storms could lead to some significant rainfall totals. Despite
some antecedent dryness to the soils for some parts of the area,
the multiple day event and potential higher end rainfall totals in
a short duration is likely to overcome that and the repeated
nature is likely to become problematic over some areas. Well in
the warm sector across the central/southern parts of the East,
more typical summer-time diurnally-favored convection within the
hot and humid airmass. A front settling into the Mid-Atlantic
during Friday-Sunday may provide some added focus for rainfall,
while upper level impulses could enhance convection over parts of
the South and/or southern Mid-Atlantic.  Expect rainfall to
increase along the western half of the Gulf Coast Sunday-Monday as
possible tropical development reaches the southwestern Gulf of
Mexico.  Daily convection over the southern Rockies and Arizona
may gradually increase in coverage and intensity over the course
of the period.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain threat Friday into the weekend...


...Overview...

The latest model guidance shows average to above average agreement
for the upper level pattern and trended well from continuity. This
adds forecast confidence to the period. Shortwave troughing over
the Pacific Northwest will gradually extend eastward toward the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest by late this weekend into early
next week, around the north side of a broad mean ridge that
extends from the Atlantic through eastern/southern parts of the
lower 48. Periodic impulses moving through the flow will support
episodes of potentially heavy rainfall across the Upper Midwest
beginning Friday through the weekend. Areas to the south of the
fronts will tend to be humid and very warm to hot with some
diurnally favored showers and thunderstorms.  Possible tropical
development over the northwestern Caribbean and southwestern Gulf
of Mexico may bring some enhanced moisture to the western half of
the Gulf Coast region by Sunday-Monday.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The model guidance has clustered together somewhat for the
expected upper level pattern late this week into early next week,
particularly with the progression and impulses of shortwave
troughs through the Northwest to Upper Midwest. The first wave
looks to arrive late Friday with the deterministic guidance
agreeing well. Perhaps some minor timing differences but all the
models then advertise upstream energy carving out a deeper trough
over the Northwest/Northern Rockies Saturday/Saturday night.
Beyond that, as that wave ejects into the Upper  Midwest, there is
some amplitude and timing issues, with the CMC notably stronger
while the ECMWF a bit flatter/progressive. The 00Z GFS was on the
slower side of the model spread. A consensus approach, favoring
the GFS and ECMWF, were chosen. Another shortwave trough or closed
low will approach the Pacific Northwest early next week with some
of the typical model biases seen. A tropical wave across the
southwest Caribbean will be watched closely by the National
Hurricane Center for possible development this weekend into early
next week as the system is forecast to track into the far western
Gulf. For now, the guidance is reasonably clustered for day 6 and
day 7 with the coordinated position near the model consensus.

Overall, preferences followed an operational model blend early and
then transitioned to a model/mean mix including the 06Z GFS/GEFS
mean and 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean/CMC.  This led to reasonable
continuity in principle while reflecting some adjustments as
reflected in the majority of latest guidance and downplaying
details that have the lowest confidence.

...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A strong heavy rainfall signal exists for portions of the Upper
Midwest / Upper Mississippi River Valley Friday into the weekend
as several impulses move through the area at the nose of a
warm/moist air mass. Multiple episodes and possible training
storms could lead to some significant rainfall totals. Despite
some antecedent dryness to the soils for some parts of the area,
the multiple day event and potential higher end rainfall totals in
a short duration is likely to overcome that and the repeated
nature is likely to become problematic over some areas. Well in
the warm sector across the central/southern parts of the East,
more typical summer-time diurnally-favored convection within the
hot and humid airmass. A front settling into the Mid-Atlantic
during Friday-Sunday may provide some added focus for rainfall,
while upper level impulses could enhance convection over parts of
the South and/or southern Mid-Atlantic.  Expect rainfall to
increase along the western half of the Gulf Coast Sunday-Monday as
possible tropical development reaches the southwestern Gulf of
Mexico.  Daily convection over the southern Rockies and Arizona
may gradually increase in coverage and intensity over the course
of the period.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 23 2021

SYNOPSIS: Models favor a fairly weak mid-level pattern heading into early
September, as much of the hazard potential across the U.S. appears to be
driven
by potential tropical cyclone activity during week-2. There are elevated
chances for heavy precipitation across the western Gulf Coast associated with
tropical cyclone formation favored in the Gulf of Mexico. Enhanced monsoonal
moisture and precipitation may result in localized flooding over parts of the
Desert Southwest. Over Alaska, mid-level high pressure is expected to promote
primarily above (below) normal temperatures (precipitation) in the outlook.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the western Gulf of Mexico Coast,
Tue-Thu, Aug 31-Sep 2.

Flooding possible across parts of California, Nevada and Arizona in the Desert
Southwest.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY AUGUST 26 - MONDAY AUGUST 30:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pJxY-3qvO8PDB0rHlJvHBUed2PqocWCbzh7Zw5tw7hMAa0qpBm4TRm_PofBFTem8PuvtS3Ts$

FOR TUESDAY AUGUST 31 - MONDAY SEPTEMBER 06: During late week-1, there is good
agreement among the dynamical models favoring positive 500-hPa height
departures over the Bering Sea shifting eastward into the Gulf of Alaska,
allowing for the development of mid-level troughing over the northwestern
CONUS. This mid-level height pattern transition is anticipated to bring cooler
temperatures and limit excessive heat potential across much of the West Coast
during week-2. Notably, reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and 40 degrees F
supporting the potential for early season frost across the northwestern CONUS.
However, given the novelty of this potential hazard as well as disparities in
the location of anomalous cold in the reforecast tools, this precludes any
corresponding hazard area from being posted at this time.



Downstream, the mid-level pattern is forecast to be fairly deamplified at the
outset of the period, though both the GEFS and ECMWF advertise the development
of anomalous ridging centered over the Great Lakes with positive height
departures overspreading much of the Midwest by the middle of the period. Tied
to this mid-level ridging, anomalously warm temperatures are favored as both
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools highlight a region extending from the
Great
Plains to the Great Lakes with at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile during the middle to latter portion of the
outlook period. However, these tools maintain a low probability of actual
temperatures reaching hazard thresholds. Additionally, the consideration of
decreasing sun angles resulting in a cooler climatology heading into
September,
thus no excessive heat hazard is issued.



Across the tropics, the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) has become much less
organized, while experiencing a sharp decrease in amplitude over the Indian
Ocean during the last several days. Despite this, a convectively coupled
Kelvin
Wave is forecast to traverse the Western Hemisphere during week-1, where
large-scale conditions are expected to remain conducive for continued tropical
cyclone (TC) development in the eastern Pacific and the Atlantic during late
August. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is currently highlighting a region
in the Western Caribbean where an area of low pressure is predicted to
develop,
associated with an enhanced, and northward displaced Central America Gyre
forecast late in week-1. Although there has been good run to run continuity in
the deterministic and ensemble mean solutions depicting closed low formation
in
the Bay of Campeche, there remains uncertainty regarding the details of the
track and intensity of this potential low and whether it reaches the western
Gulf Coast states by the outset of week-2. Uncalibrated ECMWF, GEFS and
Canadian ensembles continue to show enhanced daily precipitation amounts along
the western Gulf coast early in the period, with increased chances for heavy
precipitation indicated in the ECMWF reforecast tool focused over southern
Texas. Thus, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is maintained across the
western Gulf coast from Aug 31 to Sep 2.  Farther north, above-normal rainfall
is favored in both the GEFS and ECMWF across the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley associated with surface low pressure development and
frontal
activity. However, amounts are not anticipated to exceed pre-defined hazard
criteria. The increase in precipitation is expected to benefit moisture
starved
soils where D0 to D4 drought conditions are registered in this part of the
country.



In the eastern Pacific, there is good support in the models and probabilistic
guidance tools for the development of another TC in the wake of Tropical Storm
Marty. As of 11am PDT the NHC is currently eyeing an area of disturbed weather
to the south of Mexico with a 90% chance of formation during the next 5 days.
Both the GEFS and ECMWF are in agreement depicting a deepening low center near
the mouth of the Gulf of California, where combined with a thermal low
forecast
over the Sonoran Desert, is favorable for the initiation of a Gulf Surge event
to advect moisture into the Desert Southwest early in the period. This is
reflected in the reforecast guidance where there is at least a 20% chance of
3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile over the region and
extending into the Great Basin. Although rainfall amounts do not reach hazard
thresholds in these tools, the elevated signals for enhanced rainfall favor
convective episodes in the Desert Southwest during week-2 which may lead to
localized flash flooding. Therefore, a possible flooding hazard is issued in
the outlook.



Over Alaska, the aforementioned mid-level ridging predicted over the Gulf of
Alaska early in the period predominately favors above-normal temperatures and
below-normal precipitation across much of the southern Mainland and Panhandle,
and no hazards are posted for the state during week-2.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon August 23 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 29 - SEP 02, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over
northern
Mainland Alaska and a ridge over the northern Pacific and southern Mainland
Alaska. Slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies extend across most of the
eastern CONUS, while the ECMWF ensemble mean predicts slightly greater
positive
500-hPa height anomalies over the northeastern CONUS relative to the GEFS and
Canadian ensemble means. A weak trough is predicted over the northwestern
CONUS
in most model solutions, with associated slightly below normal mid-level
heights. Anomalous southerly flow and low surface pressure are predicted over
western areas of the Southwest, potentially influenced by tropical activity in
the East Pacific.

Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated over northern Mainland
Alaska, under the predicted trough. Above normal temperatures are likely for
the Aleutians, the south coast of Mainland Alaska, and the northern Panhandle,
under predicted positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Above normal temperatures
are favored across much of the CONUS, due to predicted 500-hPa ridging and
slightly above normal heights forecast over most areas. Probabilities for
above
normal temperatures exceed 60 percent over the eastern Great Lakes Region,
supported by the temperature consolidation tool. Troughing and near to
slightly
below normal heights favor enhanced probabilities of near to below normal
temperatures over the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, and parts of the
Northern Plains. Short term bias corrected temperature forecasts from the GEFS
and Canadian ensembles indicate below normal temperatures are likely along the
Gulf Coast, while bias-corrected model temperature forecasts based on
multi-decadal reforecasts predict likely above normal temperatures for the
region. Near normal temperatures are favored in this region, due to
uncertainty
and increased cloud cover.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over northwestern
Mainland Alaska due to increased potential for storm system development under
a
predicted trough. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over
remaining areas of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, under a predicted
ridge. Below normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the Pacific
Northwest, under anomalous northwesterly flow, and consistent with the
precipitation consolidation forecast tool. Dynamical model precipitation
forecast tools support increased probabilities of above normal precipitation
from the Western and Central Gulf Coast northeastward across most of the
eastern CONUS, along a predicted active storm track, and for parts of the
Northern Plains, supported by the precipitation consolidation tool.
Probabilities for above normal precipitation exceed 50 percent for the western
Gulf Coast region, due to potential impacts of tropical activity.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, offset
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 31 - SEP 06, 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally similar
to the 6-10 day period but de-amplifies overall with increasing uncertainty. A
trough is forecast over parts of western Canada and the Pacific Northwest,
with
slightly negative 500-hPa height anomalies shifted to the west relative to the
6-10 day period forecast. Slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
forecast over the Northern and Central Plains and over much of the eastern
CONUS, except along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, in the week-2 manual blend
of
500-hPa height forecasts. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over
Alaska.

Mid-level troughing forecast to the north of Alaska favors near to below
normal
temperatures for northern Mainland Alaska. Forecast above normal 500-hPa
heights increase chances for above normal temperatures over remaining areas of
Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians, and the Alaska Panhandle. Near to above normal
temperatures are favored across much of the CONUS, under slightly positive
500-hPa anomalies and supported by the temperature consolidation tool. Near to
below normal temperatures are favored for the Pacific Northwest, Northern
Rockies and western areas of the Northern Plains, associated with a weak
mid-level trough over the region. With potential increased cloudiness and near
average heights, near normal temperatures are favored for parts of the
Southwest along the Mexico border, the Rio Grande Valley, and the Gulf Coast
region.

Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of northwestern Mainland
Alaska, due to potential storms. Below normal precipitation is favored for the
Aleutians, southern and eastern Mainland Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle,
under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal precipitation is likely
for much of the Pacific Northwest, as well as the southern Florida Peninsula,
consistent with the precipitation consolidation tool. Although uncertainty
increases in week 2 among dynamical model precipitation tools, near to above
normal precipitation is favored across much of the CONUS. Probabilities for
above normal precipitation are elevated for parts of the Southwest monsoon
region, related to the potential for tropical moisture surges. Above normal
precipitation probabilities are also increased for parts of the Northern
Plains
and Southeast, supported by the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and
20%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on a changing large-scale circulation pattern,
offset by increasing differences among the temperature and precipitation
forecast tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0220 PM CDT Mon Aug 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Southern California into the southern Great Basin...
As a weak Pacific trough advances eastward across the southern Great
Basin, modest mid-level flow will overspread portions of southern
California and Nevada. Enhanced by the increase in westerly flow
aloft and surrounding terrain effects, surface winds across portions
of the southern California deserts and higher terrain may approach
15-20 mph through the day. A very warm and dry airmss in place will
favor humidity values in the teens to single digits. Locally
elevated fire weather conditions may develop where stronger surface
winds can be realized given the presence of dry fuels. Elsewhere,
the previous forecast remains unchanged with minimal fire weather
activity expected.

..Lyons.. 08/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Mon Aug 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
As one potent shortwave trough moves across the northern Plains on
Tuesday, another midlevel trough will approach the West Coast. As a
result, southwesterly flow aloft across the West is forecast to be
rather modest.  At the surface, low pressure is forecast to develop
over the Great Basin, but the pressure gradient will remain weak
across the West.  As a result of these factors, the probability of
sustained surface wind speeds exceeding 20 mph is relatively low for
areas with dry fuels.  The lack of strong winds should limit fire
weather concerns on Tuesday, despite widespread critical RH values
across interior portions of the West.

...Tropical Depression Henri to become post-tropical later today
and track over southern New England this evening; threat for flash
flooding to persist into the overnight hours...

...Dangerous heat forecast across the Lower Mississippi Valley,
with hot and humid weather expanding across much of the central
and eastern United States as well...

...Scattered showers and a few severe thunderstorms possible from
the northern and central Plains into the Midwest...

Tropical Depression Henri continues to drench parts of the
Northeast this afternoon. Areas of heavy showers and thunderstorms
have led to the issuance of several Flash Flood Warnings with
potentially more areas of flash flooding likely to transpire this
evening. WPC maintains a Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of excessive
rainfall between southeast New York and portions of interior New
England. Flood Watches also remain in effect through this evening.
Henri will become a post-tropical storm later this afternoon while
drifting east across southern New England later this evening. By
Tuesday afternoon, all associated hazards with Henri will exit
stage right into the northwest Atlantic Ocean with mostly dry
conditions a "sight for sore eyes" on Wednesday.

Sultry conditions are expected throughout much of the central and
eastern U.S. through midweek as an expansive and relatively strong
ridge of high pressure builds across the south-central part of the
CONUS. As a result, dangerously hot weather is possible over the
Lower Mississippi Valley. Excessive Heat Warnings have been issued
for the Mississippi Delta region, where heat indices look to range
between 110-115F. Heat Advisories extend into eastern Oklahoma and
Kansas, as well as northward into the Middle Mississippi Valley.
Above average temperatures are forecast nearly everywhere east of
the Rockies (lone exception being the northern High Plains) as
highs reach into the upper-80s and 90s for most locations early
this week. While only a handful of daily high temperatures records
are at risk of breaking, a plethora of warm minimum temperature
records could fall thanks to high humidity levels keeping
overnight temperatures very warm. These warm nighttime
temperatures can be particularly dangerous for those without
access to proper air conditioning. Unfortunately, the large dome
of upper level high pressure will continue to deflect cold fronts
attempting to usher in cooler and more refreshing humidity levels
to the north, keeping much of the South and east-central U.S. hot
and muggy into the second half of the week.

Elsewhere, an area of low pressure and its associated frontal
boundaries are forecast to swing across the Northern Plains and
Upper Great Lakes between today and Wednesday morning. Scattered
showers and a few severe thunderstorms are possible throughout the
northern/central Plains and Midwest, with much of the activity on
Tuesday located over the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes. By
Wednesday afternoon, a new wave of low pressure figures to produce
more spotty thunderstorms, some of which could be severe, in the
northern and central High Plains. Farther west, Red Flag Warnings
and Fire Weather Watches for much of Wyoming, southwestern South
Dakota, and northwestern Nebraska due to the combination of gusty
winds and low relative humidity. There are also Air Quality Alerts
in place for parts of the Intermountain West and Pacific Northwest
due to ongoing bouts of wildfire smoke in these areas.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain threat Friday into the weekend...


...Overview...

The latest model guidance shows average to above average agreement
for the upper level pattern and trended well from continuity. This
adds forecast confidence to the period. Shortwave troughing over
the Pacific Northwest will gradually extend eastward toward the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest by late this weekend into early
next week, around the north side of a broad mean ridge that
extends from the Atlantic through eastern/southern parts of the
lower 48. Periodic impulses moving through the flow will support
episodes of potentially heavy rainfall across the Upper Midwest
beginning Friday through the weekend. Areas to the south of the
fronts will tend to be humid and very warm to hot with some
diurnally favored showers and thunderstorms.  Possible tropical
development over the northwestern Caribbean and southwestern Gulf
of Mexico may bring some enhanced moisture to the western half of
the Gulf Coast region by Sunday-Monday.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The model guidance has clustered together somewhat for the
expected upper level pattern late this week into early next week,
particularly with the progression and impulses of shortwave
troughs through the Northwest to Upper Midwest. The first wave
looks to arrive late Friday with the deterministic guidance
agreeing well. Perhaps some minor timing differences but all the
models then advertise upstream energy carving out a deeper trough
over the Northwest/Northern Rockies Saturday/Saturday night.
Beyond that, as that wave ejects into the Upper  Midwest, there is
some amplitude and timing issues, with the CMC notably stronger
while the ECMWF a bit flatter/progressive. The 00Z GFS was on the
slower side of the model spread. A consensus approach, favoring
the GFS and ECMWF, were chosen. Another shortwave trough or closed
low will approach the Pacific Northwest early next week with some
of the typical model biases seen. A tropical wave across the
southwest Caribbean will be watched closely by the National
Hurricane Center for possible development this weekend into early
next week as the system is forecast to track into the far western
Gulf. For now, the guidance is reasonably clustered for day 6 and
day 7 with the coordinated position near the model consensus.

Overall, preferences followed an operational model blend early and
then transitioned to a model/mean mix including the 06Z GFS/GEFS
mean and 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean/CMC.  This led to reasonable
continuity in principle while reflecting some adjustments as
reflected in the majority of latest guidance and downplaying
details that have the lowest confidence.

...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A strong heavy rainfall signal exists for portions of the Upper
Midwest / Upper Mississippi River Valley Friday into the weekend
as several impulses move through the area at the nose of a
warm/moist air mass. Multiple episodes and possible training
storms could lead to some significant rainfall totals. Despite
some antecedent dryness to the soils for some parts of the area,
the multiple day event and potential higher end rainfall totals in
a short duration is likely to overcome that and the repeated
nature is likely to become problematic over some areas. Well in
the warm sector across the central/southern parts of the East,
more typical summer-time diurnally-favored convection within the
hot and humid airmass. A front settling into the Mid-Atlantic
during Friday-Sunday may provide some added focus for rainfall,
while upper level impulses could enhance convection over parts of
the South and/or southern Mid-Atlantic.  Expect rainfall to
increase along the western half of the Gulf Coast Sunday-Monday as
possible tropical development reaches the southwestern Gulf of
Mexico.  Daily convection over the southern Rockies and Arizona
may gradually increase in coverage and intensity over the course
of the period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1251 AM CDT Tue Aug 24 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to translate into
the Canadian prairies through the day, resulting in generally
weakening flow aloft as a broad longwave trough settles over the
West Coast. The loss of upper-level support will limit the potential
for strong winds across much of the West outside of a strip over the
Great Basin and into the central Rockies where modest southwesterly
mid-level flow will linger. However, modest fuel receptiveness
across these areas suggest the potential for serious fire weather
concerns is low.

...Great Basin into the central Rocky Mountains...
Elevated wind/RH conditions appear probable this afternoon as deep
boundary-layer mixing and a nearly uni-directional wind profile
support 15-20 mph sustained winds with frequent gusts up to 25-30
mph. Despite relative humidity reductions into the single digits,
recent fuel reports indicate that fuels dryness is generally near or
just below seasonal averages with ERC values near the 50th
percentile for most locations. This precludes the introduction of
highlights at this time, but a few localized fire weather concerns
may emerge for locations with drier fuels.

...Northeast Wyoming...
Very isolated thunderstorms are possible late this afternoon into
the overnight hours as a stalled cold front begins to shift
northward as a weak warm front. Despite poor moisture recovery in
the lowest 1-2 km, improving mid-level moisture will boost PWAT
values to 0.75-0.8 inches and support a mix of wet and dry
thunderstorms. Modestly dry fuels across the northeastern quadrant
of the state - generally across the High Plains - are noted with
fine fuel moisture near 5%. A low-end dry thunderstorm concern may
evolve across this region, but confidence in the coverage and
propensity for dry thunderstorms is too low to warrant highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0142 AM CDT Tue Aug 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Persistent southwesterly flow over the Great Basin and into the
central Rocky Mountains will maintain breezy conditions and the
potential for meeting elevated wind/RH criteria. Additionally, lift
ahead of a broad upper-level wave will introduce dry thunderstorm
chances to parts of the northern Rockies. Despite these concerns,
fuel conditions are generally not sufficiently receptive to support
widespread fire weather concerns.

...Great Basin into the central Rockies...
A belt of 20-30 mph mid-level flow is forecast to linger over
southeast NV northeastward into central WY. Modest pressure-gradient
winds near 15-20 mph will see frequent gusts up to 25-30 mph as
well-mixed boundary layers diurnally deepen and mix down stronger
flow aloft. RH reductions into the single digits to teens are
likely, so sustaining elevated wind/RH criteria appears probable.
However, ERC values are generally near or below the 50th percentile,
suggesting the overall fire weather concern is low. Fuel trends will
be monitored over the next 24 hours for the need for highlights.

...Southwest Montana...
A combination of weak orographic ascent and broad lift ahead of a
West Coast trough will support isolated showers and thunderstorms
over far southwest MT and adjacent areas of ID/WY Wednesday
afternoon. Forecast soundings show favorable thermodynamic profiles
for dry thunderstorms with PWAT values near 0.5-0.6 inches and well
mixed boundary layers up to 2-3 km. While dry thunderstorms appear
possible, fuels across southwest MT are generally not receptive (ERC
values well below the 50th percentile).

...Upper Midwest heavy rain threat likely to extend into the
weekend...


...Overview...

Latest guidance maintains good continuity and agreement with the
mean pattern, showing the main band of westerlies extending from
the northeastern Pacific through the northern lower 48 and
southern Canada while ridging prevails from the Atlantic through
the eastern/southern U.S.  A series of shortwaves emerging from
western North America and associated surface waves/fronts are
likely to promote a period of heavy rain potential over parts of
the Upper Midwest, extending from the short range period into the
weekend.  Areas south of the fronts will see humid and very warm
to hot weather with some late-day showers and thunderstorms.
Possible tropical development over the northwestern Caribbean and
western Gulf of Mexico may bring enhanced moisture to the western
half of the Gulf Coast region by early next week.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models are still in the process of refining the details across the
northern tier.  Over the past day or so there has been a gradual
trend toward maintaining better definition of a leading
north-central Plains wave that may track northeast through the
Upper Great Lakes into Canada Friday into the weekend, followed by
a stronger system in response to trailing energy that emerges from
the Northwest.  The new 00Z ECMWF dampens out the leading wave
though.  Some timing differences exist with the latter energy but
an average is reasonable considering some of the greater spread
and variability seen in previous days.  Farther upstream a
northeastern Pacific trough/embedded upper low should arrive into
the Northwest U.S. and western Canada by next Tuesday.  Ensemble
means have been fairly consistent with this trough and provide a
good anchor for its forecast.  Recent GFS/ECMWF runs have varied
somewhat faster or slower but with an overall average near the
means.  UKMET runs have persistently strayed out of sync with
consensus, while the 00Z CMC compares better after the 12Z run
became faster than the majority.

A general majority of guidance has been maintaining continuity for
a fairly southward track of possible tropical development
extending from the northwestern Caribbean into the western Gulf of
Mexico.  However there are enough minority solutions showing a
farther northward track over the western Gulf to temper confidence
in the forecast.  Interestingly the 12Z ECMWF jumped to the
northern scenario versus prior runs that were well south (and
maintained in the new 00Z run), and in contrast latest CMC runs
have stayed south after some earlier runs had been farther north.
A number of 12Z CMC ensembles still track north though.  GFS runs
have been consistently south.  Consult the National Hurricane
Center's Tropical Weather Outlooks for the latest information on
this development potential over the coming days.

The updated forecast started with a composite of latest
operational models early in the period.  Deteriorating comparisons
of the 12Z CMC led to its phaseout after mid-period and ECMWF
input switched more toward yesterday's 00Z run due to the 12Z run
straying north of continuity for its western Gulf tropical system.
 The 18Z GFS maintained its contribution through the forecast
while 18Z GEFS/12Z ECens components reached 60 percent total
weight by day 7 Tuesday.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The signal for heavy rainfall persists over portions of the Upper
Midwest from the short range period into the weekend as multiple
impulses move through the area around the northern periphery of a
warm/moist air mass.  Multiple episodes and possible training
storms could lead to significant rainfall totals at some
locations.  Antecedent dryness in parts of the region could
initially blunt the effects of heavy rain but the multi-day nature
of the event and potential higher end rainfall totals in a short
duration are likely to overcome that with runoff issues becoming
problematic over some areas.  Well into the warm sector across the
central/southern parts of the East, more typical summertime
diurnally-favored convection should occur within the hot and humid
air mass.  A front settling into the Mid-Atlantic during
Friday-Sunday may provide some added focus for rainfall, while
upper level impulses could enhance convection over parts of the
South.  A cold front advancing from the Plains should bring a more
organized area of showers/storms into the East by Monday-Tuesday.
Expect rainfall to increase along the western half of the Gulf
Coast Sunday onward as possible tropical development most likely
reaches the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.  A lesser but meaningful
probability still exists for a farther north track that would
bring greater rain/wind effects to the Gulf Coast.  Daily
convection over the southern Rockies and Arizona may gradually
spread westward and become a little heavier over the course of the
period.

Well above normal temperatures will prevail from the Midwest into
the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic through the weekend
with some moderation thereafter as a cold front emerges from the
Plains.  Through early Monday there should be decent coverage of
morning lows up to 10-15F above normal while isolated locations
could reach plus 10F anomalies for highs.  Some daily record warm
lows are possible.  In contrast the northern Rockies/Plains will
be rather cool late this week into the weekend with some locations
seeing one or more days with highs 10-15F below normal.  Highs of
5-10F above normal will spread from the Southwest into California
and parts of Oregon Friday-Sunday.  Then Southern Rockies moisture
reaching the Southwest and the upper trough nearing the Northwest
will support a gradual cooling trend.

...Hot and humid throughout much of the central and eastern United
States, with dangerous heat returning to the Southwest by
Wednesday...

...Scattered showers and a few severe thunderstorms possible from
the northern and central Plains into the Midwest over the next few
days...

Sultry conditions are expected throughout much of the central and
eastern U.S. through at least Thursday as an expansive and
relatively strong ridge of high pressure builds across the
south-central part of the country. As a result, dangerously hot
weather is once again possible over the Lower Mississippi Valley.
Excessive Heat Warnings have been issued for the Mississippi Delta
region, where heat indices look to soar into the 110-115F range.
Heat Advisories extend into eastern sections of the central and
southern Plains, as well as northward into the Middle Mississippi
Valley. Above average temperatures are forecast nearly everywhere
east of the Rockies (the lone exception being the Northern Plains)
as highs reach into the upper-80s and 90s for most locations early
this week. Meanwhile, highs may reach the triple digits across
parts of Kansas and Oklahoma today. While only a handful of daily
high temperatures records are at risk of breaking, a plethora of
warm minimum temperature records could fall thanks to high
humidity levels keeping overnight temperatures very warm. These
warm nighttime temperatures in the 70s can be particularly
dangerous for those without access to proper air conditioning.
Unfortunately, the large dome of upper level high pressure will
continue to deflect cold fronts attempting to usher in a cooler
and more refreshing airmass found to the north, keeping much of
the South and east-central U.S. hot and muggy this last full week
of August. Not to be left out, the Southwest will also begin to
see dangerous heat build back into the forecast by Wednesday as
the aforementioned ridge stretches into the region. Afternoon high
temperatures may reach up to 115F on Wednesday, which has
triggered Excessive Heat Watches to be issued for southwest
California and southern Arizona.

Elsewhere, two separate rounds of showers and storms are set to
impact the north-central United States over the next few days. The
first wave associated with an approaching cold front is already
responsible for a line of severe thunderstorms entering central
Minnesota this morning. These thunderstorms may continue to
progress east-southeast throughout the day today and potentially
produce damaging wind gusts and isolated tornadoes across the
Upper Midwest. A few isolated severe thunderstorms could develop
farther south and into the Central Plains along the cold front as
well. By Wednesday, the same frontal boundary is expected to lift
north as a warm front over the Central Plains as an approaching
upper level trough enters the Northern Rockies. This could spell
more chances for isolated severe storms throughout the northern
and central Plains. While heavy rain could cause localized flash
flooding, much of this section of the country from the northern
High Plains to the Upper Midwest is experiencing severe to
exceptional drought and will likely welcome every drop of rain
that falls. Farther south and east, typical widely scattered
summer thunderstorms are forecast across the Southeast and Gulf
Coast, with the main hazard associated with heavy rain. The slow
movement of these storms could lead to isolated instances of flash
flooding.

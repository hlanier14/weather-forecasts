...Severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall threat on Thursday
over parts of the East Coast...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Florida Peninsula on Thursday...

Correction for date reference in headline

A strong front from the Great Lakes to the Central Gulf Coast
moves eastward off most of the East Coast by Friday morning. The
boundary will produce showers and thunderstorms from the Great
Lakes to the Central Gulf Coast; some of the thunderstorms will be
severe. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms from parts of the Northeast to the Southeast/Central
Gulf Coast through Friday morning. The hazards associated with
these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Moreover, due to the associated heavy rain, the WPC has issued a
Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over two regions; parts of the
Northeast/Northern Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast, through Friday.
The associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain.

On Thursday, snow will develop over parts of the Upper
Mississippi/Upper Great Lakes to parts of the Middle Mississippi
Valley. Overnight Fr Thursday, the light snow will move into parts
of the Ohio Valley, Central Appalachian, and the Lower Great
Lakes. Light rain over parts of New England to the Mid-Atlantic
will end by Friday night. Lake effect snow will develop downwind
from the Lower Great Lakes with upslope flow snow over parts of
the Central Appalachians and Northern New England, ending mainly
by Saturday morning.

Meanwhile, a second front extending from the Northern High Plains
to the Great Basin will move eastward to the Middle Mississippi
Valley and the Southern Plains by Saturday. The system will
produce light snow over parts of the Northern/Central Rockies that
will end by Friday evening. As the boundary moves onto the Plains,
light rain and embedded thunderstorms will develop over parts of
the Plains that will move into parts of the Mississippi Valley by
Saturday morning.

Furthermore, a third front will move onshore over the Pacific
Northwest late Friday afternoon and move inland to the Northern
Rockies by Saturday morning. The front will produce light rain
over parts of the Pacific Northwest Friday evening into Saturday
and light snow over parts of the Cascades on Saturday morning. In
addition, the SPC has issued an Elevated Risk of fire weather over
parts of the Florida Peninsula due to gusty winds, low relative
humidity, and dry fuels on Thursday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 AM CDT Thu Mar 31 2022

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

A minor southward expansion was made to the ongoing Elevated area
over south-central Florida. Latest shortwave IR imagery shows a
substantial hot spot over north-central Miami-Dade County (west of
I-75) -- indicating an ongoing wildfire. While minimum RH will be
quite marginal with southward extent (45-65 percent), breezy
south-southeasterly winds atop very dry fuels will continue to
support elevated fire-weather conditions over inland areas.

Over South Texas, multiple wildfires are evident on shortwave IR
imagery between I-35 and I-37. While minimum afternoon RH of 15-25
percent will support locally elevated conditions today, very light
surface winds preclude the introduction of an Elevated area.

For addition details, see the previous discussion below.

..Weinman.. 03/31/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CDT Thu Mar 31 2022/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move from the Southeast into the
Northeast CONUS today. A strong surface low, currently in the Great
Lakes, will move into eastern Canada by this evening. The pressure
field from this surface low is expansive, and windy conditions are
expected across the entire eastern CONUS today. Most areas will be
plenty moist, which will limit fire weather concerns. However, some
dry conditions are expected across Florida with relative humidity in
the 30 to 40 percent range. In addition, sustained winds of 15 to 18
mph are expected in this same region. Therefore, there is an
elevated fire weather threat across portions of the central Florida
Peninsula this afternoon.

...Showers and thunderstorms to continue into the evening ahead of
a strong cold front moving across the East...

...Snow squalls possible from the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley into
the East tonight and Friday...

...Dry conditions and warming temperatures expected across much of
the West through the end the week...

Showers and thunderstorms developing along and ahead of a strong
cold front may continue to impact portions of the eastern U.S. as
the front pushes across the region this evening.  Some of these
storms may become strong to severe, with damaging winds and a few
tornadoes possible from parts of the Southeast, through the
Mid-Atlantic, and into the Hudson Valley.

Behind the front, a series of upper level disturbances, along with
cold northwesterly to westerly winds, will support rain and snow
showers from the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, into the Northeast and
Mid Atlantic tonight and Friday.  Scattered snow squalls may
develop and move over the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley tonight.
Snow squalls are likely during the day on Friday from the central
Appalachians and lower Great Lakes into interior portions of the
Northeast and Mid Atlantic.  Brief, but intense snowfall within
these squalls can rapidly reduce visibility and lead to dangerous
driving conditions.

Meanwhile, the front is expected to linger across the Florida
Peninsula, supporting additional showers and storms and the
potential for isolated strong to severe storms into the weekend.

Farther west, a frontal boundary is expected to bring rain and
snow from the Rockies into the north-central Plains tonight into
Friday morning, with mostly light accumulations expected.  During
the day on Friday, expect rain showers and thunderstorms from the
northern Plains to Oklahoma and northern Texas.  While widespread
severe weather is not expected, isolated strong to severe storms
may occur across parts of Oklahoma and northern Texas.  A few dry
thunderstorms may develop, which combined with breezy conditions,
may elevate fire weather concerns tomorrow from the Oklahoma and
Texas Panhandle region into west-central Texas.

In the West, a frontal boundary is forecast to produce mainly
light low elevation rain and mountain snow as it moves from the
Pacific Northwest to the northern Rockies late Friday into
Saturday.  Elsewhere across the West, expect dry conditions with
temperatures climbing above average across most areas by the
weekend.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 31 2022

SYNOPSIS: During early week-2, mid-level low (high) pressure forecast is
expected to increase the risk of much below (above) temperatures over the
eastern (southwestern) Contiguous U.S. (CONUS). Surface low pressure is
anticipated over the eastern lower 48 supported by the mid-level low pressu=
re,
which could increase chances for high winds across much of the northeastern
CONUS at the beginning of the period. The mid-level pattern is anticipated =
to
transition to mid-level low (high) pressure across the western (eastern) ha=
lf
of the CONUS by April 11. This pattern supports enhanced risk for much belo=
w
normal temperatures across the northwestern CONUS and possible heavy snow
across higher elevation areas of the Cascades, Northern Plains, and Norther=
n
Rockies during the latter half of week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and the Southeast=
,
Sat, Apr 9.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Great Plains=
,
Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and th=
e
Southeast, Fri-Sun, Apr 8-10.

Slight risk of high winds for the northeastern CONUS, Fri-Sat, Apr 8-9.

Slight risk of much above-normal temperatures for parts of California, Grea=
t
Basin, and the Desert Southwest, Fri-Sun, Apr 8-10.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Pacific
Northwest, Northern Intermountain, and Northern Rockies, Mon-Thu, Apr 11-14=
.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Cascades, Northe=
rn
Rockies, and Northern Plains, Mon-Thu, Apr 11-14.

Slight risk of high winds across the Central and Southern Plains, Central a=
nd
Southern Rockies, and Four Corners region, Apr 8-14.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY APRIL 03 - THURSDAY APRIL 07:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!vG_5oIjKte-CoAzMID8I3fZiTBGm6sKMXPMa2iYXY75QdEcC7m1m5Neq4tDYn=
-Uv3DzIYtWS$

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 08 - THURSDAY APRIL 14: There is good agreement in the
dynamical models continuing to advertise amplified 500-hPa ridging (troughi=
ng)
centered over the western (eastern) CONUS which remains the primary hazard
focus for potential temperature hazards at the beginning of the period. Tie=
d
to
the downstream troughing favored over eastern CONUS, the Weather Prediction
Center=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs (WPC) day 7 surface forecast shows a sur=
face low over the Great
Lakes,
with an accompanying frontal boundary extending as far south as the Gulf of
Mexico and into northern Mexico. As this surface low tracks across the
northeast on day 8 (Apr 8), the 0z GEFS and ECMWF ensembles show the larges=
t
negative temperature departures concentrated over the Tennessee and Ohio
Valleys, Appalachians and the Southeast by late next week and into early ne=
xt
weekend. While the coldest minimum temperatures are expected over the upper
Midwest, reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below 40 degrees F from =
the
Southern Plains to the southeastern CONUS, supporting the continuation of a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures for the region (Apr 8-10).
Today's model ensemble indicates a more amplified mid-level trough across t=
he
eastern CONUS compared to yesterday. This translates to higher probabilitie=
s
(>40%) indicated in the reforecast tools for minimum temperatures meeting
hazard criteria over parts of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys,
Southern Appalachians and the Southeast.  Thus, a moderate risk of much bel=
ow
normal temperatures is posted over the region for Apr 9. The increased
potential for frost and subfreezing temperatures may negatively impact
susceptible spring vegetation that is emerging across the Mississippi, Ohio=
,
and Tennessee Valleys. For precipitation, the heaviest amounts associated w=
ith
this frontal system are favored to be well offshore in the Atlantic with
cooler
and drier conditions expected in the wake of the front over the eastern U.S=
.
However, a slight risk of high winds remains issued for Apr 8 to 9, which
covers a broad area over the northeastern CONUS, where strong northwesterly
850-hPa flow is favored as the mid-level trough deepens in the latest ensem=
ble
guidance by late next week.



Upstream, the amplified mid-level ridging favored early in the period is
expected to promote anomalously warm temperatures for much of the western
CONUS. The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means indicate greater
mid-level positive height departures over a more expansive area compared to
yesterday, translating to increased much above normal temperature signal in
the
reforecast tools. Thus, the slight risk for much above normal temperatures
over
the southwestern CONUS has greater spatial coverage compared to yesterday's
outlook. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools remain quite bullish with this
warm pattern, indicating at least a 60% (20%) percent chance of maximum
daytime
temperatures exceeding the 85th (98th) percentile over much of California, =
and
in parts of the Great Basin and Desert Southwest. The National Blend of Mod=
els
(NBM) also shows an increasing number of stations with temperatures
approaching
record high for both daily maximum and minimum temperatures by the outset o=
f
the period. Although actual maximum temperatures are not likely to reach
excessive heat criteria, the slight risk of much above-normal temperatures
remains posted and is expanded in accordance with the latest guidance relat=
ive
to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlooks. Within the highlighted r=
egion, there is growing
concern for rapid snowmelt in the Sierra Nevada=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs=
 (following the well above
normal temperatures observed over the region this past weekend), and the
worsening of widespread drought conditions registered throughout the West
Coast.



A transition to mid-level troughing (ridging) across the western (eastern)
half
of the CONUS is anticipated by April 11. The mid-level trough axis is
predicted
to be located near the West Coast initially on April 11, and progress eastw=
ard
into the Intermountain West by the middle of the period. This pattern suppo=
rts
a slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the Pacific
Northwest, Northern Intermountain, and Northern Rockies, Apr 11 to 14. Both
reforecast tools are in good agreement indicating at least a 20% chance of
minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and sub-freezing=
.



The mid-level trough across the West also supports enhanced onshore flow to
parts of the northwestern CONUS during the latter half of the period. The
greatest likelihood for precipitation reaching hazardous thresholds is for
heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Cascades, Northern Rockies and
Northern Plains, Apr 11 to 14. A slight risk of heavy snow is posted for th=
ese
areas, where both reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of 3-day
accumulated liquid equivalent exceeding the 85th percentile and half an inc=
h,
with the ECMWF reforecast tools indicating some areas exceeding one inch. T=
he
experimental GEFS snowfall reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance =
for
localized areas receiving liquid equivalent amounts exceeding the 85th
percentile. The 6Z deterministic GFS shows the possibility of localized are=
as
receiving daily snowfall totals exceeding one foot.



There is good multi-model depiction from ensemble means indicating troughin=
g
across the West supporting surface low formation over the Great Plains
accompanied by a front ahead of it over the Mississippi Valley by Apr 11. E=
ven
though guidance does not support rainfall totals reaching hazardous criteri=
a,
wet conditions combined with anticipated snowmelt associated with increasin=
g
chances for above-normal temperatures across the region supports the
continuation of possible flood risk for the Red River of the North.



A broad area extending from the Central and Southern Plains to the Four
Corners
region is highlighted with a slight risk of high winds throughout week-2.
There
are increased chances for high winds on the backside of the surface low
favored
across the eastern CONUS at the beginning of the period, followed by possib=
le
high winds associated with surface low formation across the Great Plains an=
d
Southwest supported by the mid-level trough over the West from the middle t=
o
end of the period. The ECMWF reforecast tool shows at least a 20% chance of
wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph primarily across the
Central and Southern Plains at the beginning of the period, expanding to th=
e
Four Corners region by the end of the period. Increased potential for high
winds combined with prolonged above normal temperatures and dry conditions
favored during week-2 is especially concerning for enhanced wildfire risk,
across the highlighted high wind risk area, where areas are already
experiencing severe drought. The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)
indicates moderate risk of fire potential across many of these areas prior =
to
week-2.



Over Alaska, mid-level troughing across much of the Mainland and Alaska
Panhandle is favored for the week-2 mean pattern. The high wind risk over t=
he
Alaska Panhandle is not included in today's outlook due to weaker high wind
signals in the reforecast tools. Surface low formation is anticipated over =
the
Gulf of Alaska during the period, with greatest precipitation amounts most
likely for southern portions of the Panhandle. Precipitation amounts are no=
t
anticipated to reach hazardous thresholds, as the majority of onshore flow =
is
expected to be further south across Northwestern CONUS.

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 3 2022 - 12Z Thu Apr 7 2022

...Heavy rainfall/convection and runoff threat to focus across the
South next week...
...Pacific Northwest heavy rains and terrain/mountain heavy snow
threat inland to the northern Rockies...

19Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in very good
agreement on the quasi-zonal flow pattern across the continental
U.S. for the Sunday-Monday time period, although the ECMWF is
slightly more amplified with the upper trough over the Midwest on
Monday and the CMC a bit stronger with the shortwave exiting New
England.  By Tuesday and through midweek, the GFS and to a lesser
extent its ensemble mean, are more progressive with the southern
stream shortwave crossing the Gulf Coast region, with a GFS/ECMWF
compromise sufficing as a starting point here with some additional
weighting from the ECENS mean.  By the end of the forecast period
next Thursday, the GFS/GEFS is also more progressive with the main
closed low over the Great Lakes region, with the ECENS serving as
an excellent middle ground solution.  In terms of the QPF
forecast, the axis of heaviest rainfall is slightly farther south
across the Gulf Coast states compared to continuity, with aerial
averages on the order of 1 to 3 inches likely from Louisiana to
Georgia.  The previous forecast discussion follows below. /Hamrick
-----------------

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a blend
of well clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, the 12
UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models along with WPC continuity days 3-7
(Sun-next Thu). Embedded smaller scale system differences and run
to run continuity variances have become less problematic with the
18 UTC GFS/GEFS trending more in line than earlier runs,
especially into later period over the Pacific/Northwest. Newer 00
UTC guidance remains in close alignment. Overall, this seems to
bolster medium range forecast confidence to above normal levels,
albeit with the caveat that the energetic multi-system pattern is
also transitioning to higher amplitude/convective potential over
time that will likely vary the local threat focus.

...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

Highly energetic Pacific flow will work increasingly inland from
the Northwest to the Rockies into early next week. This will act
to transport some deeper moisture in support of an emerging heavy
precipitation focus with rainfall over coastal and favored terrain
of the Pacific Northwest. The pattern also favors periods with
terrain/mountain heavy snows from the Northwest to the northern
Intermountain West/Rockies prior to amplified upper ridge building
slated to build eastward over the West starting midweek.

Downstream progression and systems out from the West and
increasing northern stream phasing potential over time will
combine to support cyclogenesis/frontogenesis over the central and
eastern states next week. There is a growing guidance signal for
development of a building area of enhanced rainfall and some
threat to monitor for some severe convection across the
east-central U.S. (both especially across a more
unstable/convective South) early-mid next week as deeper Gulf
moisture returns and interacts with the complex series of wavy
fronts and a stalled lead front. Accordingly and considering
antecedent rainfall, WPC shows a "slight" risk on the newly
experimental medium range excessive rainfall outlook into Day 5
(ERO linked below). Guidance consensus has improved at longer time
frames with a well developed closed upper low forming over the
north-central U.S. by midweek as the pattern becomes amplified
downstream of the aforementioned building upper ridge over the
West. There is some potential then for some wrapping/overrunning
April snows from the Upper Great Lakes to the northern tier of the
Northeast.

UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models along with WPC continuity days 3-7
(Sun-next Thu). Embedded smaller scale system differences and run
to run continuity variances have become less problematic with the
18 UTC GFS/GEFS trending more in line than earlier runs,
especially into later period over the Pacific/Northwest. Newer 00
UTC guidance remains in close alignment. Overall, this seems to
bolster medium range forecast confidence to above normal levels,
albeit with the caveat that the energetic multi-system pattern is
also transitioning to higher amplitude/convective potential over
time that will likely vary the local threat focus.

...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

Highly energetic Pacific flow will work increasingly inland from
the Northwest to the Rockies into early next week. This will act
to transport some deeper moisture in support of an emerging heavy
precipitation focus with rainfall over coastal and favored terrain
of the Pacific Northwest. The pattern also favors periods with
terrain/mountain heavy snows from the Northwest to the northern
Intermountain West/Rockies prior to amplified upper ridge building
slated to build eastward over the West starting midweek.

Downstream progression and systems out from the West and
increasing northern stream phasing potential over time will
combine to support cyclogenesis/frontogenesis over the central and
eastern states next week. There is a growing guidance signal for
development of a building area of enhanced rainfall and some
threat to monitor for some severe convection across the
east-central U.S. (both especially across a more
unstable/convective South) early-mid next week as deeper Gulf
moisture returns and interacts with the complex series of wavy
fronts and a stalled lead front. Accordingly and considering
antecedent rainfall, WPC shows a "slight" risk on the newly
experimental medium range excessive rainfall outlook into Day 5
(ERO linked below). Guidance consensus has improved at longer time
frames with a well developed closed upper low forming over the
north-central U.S. by midweek as the pattern becomes amplified
downstream of the aforementioned building upper ridge over the
West. There is some potential then for some wrapping/overrunning
April snows from the Upper Great Lakes to the northern tier of the
Northeast.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Thu Mar 31 2022


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR APRIL 2022

The April 2022 Temperature and Precipitation Outlooks are updated consideri=
ng
current Weather Prediction Center (WPC) Outlooks for week 1, Climate
Prediction
Center (CPC) Extended Range and Subseasonal Outlooks, dynamical model guida=
nce
for week 2 and weeks 3-4, current soil moisture conditions, and background
climate states. La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions persist in the tropical=
 Pacific, with the
latest weekly NINO3.4 sea surface temperature departures reaching -0.9 degr=
ees
Celsius. The atmospheric teleconnection pattern remains consistent with tha=
t
expected during April La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa events. Though a Madden Juli=
an Oscillation
(MJO)
event propagated eastward during mid- to late- March, the MJO has decreased=
 in
amplitude this week with recent Real-time Multivariate MJO (RMM) Index valu=
es
residing within the unit circle. RMM forecasts are weak and uncertain into
early April, thus, the MJO did not play a large role in the updated monthly
Outlook. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) index is currently negative which is
expected to bring cooler temperatures to the Eastern US early in the month,
but
the AO is forecast to rapidly shift to neutral in the beginning of April.



The previous mid-month April 2022 Outlook favored enhanced probabilities of
above normal temperatures over the Eastern US, including the Great Lakes,
Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valley Regions. Strong troughing forecast =
for
early April over these regions, related to the negative AO, is expected to
bring cooler temperatures. However, the troughing is expected to subside
quickly given the rapid shift of the AO index toward neutral as indicated b=
y
dynamical model forecasts. Slightly elevated probabilities of above normal
temperatures are favored in the latter half of April in subseasonal dynamic=
al
model forecasts from the ECMWF, CFSv2, JMA, ECCC, and GEFSv12 models. Enhan=
ced
probabilities of above normal temperatures are weakened to Equal-Chances (E=
C)
of above, near, and below normal temperatures in the updated Outlook given =
the
expected cooler early April temperatures and mid- to late- April warmer
temperatures. Recent model guidance from the CFSv2 as well as a strong ridg=
e
over the western US prompted increased probabilities of above normal
temperatures over California. Persistent La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa condition=
s as well as CFSv2
forecasts support strengthening of below normal temperature probabilities o=
ver
the Pacific Northwest. The updated temperature Outlook for Alaska remains
consistent with the mid-month Outlook, but weak circulation forecasts along
with mixed extended range and subseasonal model guidance over Alaska led to
dampening of the probabilities.



WPC Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts (QPF) favor elevated precipitation
amounts in the first week of April stretching from the Gulf States to the
Great
Lakes and Northeast. 6-10 day extended range dynamical model forecasts favo=
r
enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation over the Eastern US
related to the forecasted troughing over the region. This expected early Ap=
ril
rainfall prompted expansion of the area of enhanced above normal precipitat=
ion
probabilities over the Great Lakes relative to the previous mid-month Outlo=
ok
to include the northernmost parts of the Gulf States and Northeast in the
updated Outlook. Wet soil moisture anomalies over parts of the Great Lakes =
and
Ohio Valley further support enlargement of the area of above normal
precipitation. In contrast, subseasonal dynamical model forecasts for the e=
nd
of April are mixed or forecast weak below normal precipitation probabilitie=
s
over the Southeast, while previous monthly dynamical model forecasts from t=
he
North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and Copernicus Climate Change
Service (C3S) favored below normal precipitation. Due to these weak or mixe=
d
signals among the most recent precipitation tools, EC is forecast for the
updated Outlook over the southern parts of the Gulf States and Florida. Rec=
ent
dynamical model forecasts depict amplified troughing developing over the
northern US in week 2, which could bring storminess to the central US in mi=
d-
to late- April. Thus, the area of enhanced above normal precipitation
probabilities are also expanded to include parts of the Mississippi Valley,
while the region of favored below normal precipitation amounts is diminishe=
d
over Nebraska and Kansas, compared to the previous mid-month Outlook. The
updated precipitation Outlook for Alaska remains consistent with the mid-mo=
nth
Outlook, but uncertainty and weak circulation patterns over Alaska led to
dampening of the probabilities.

The April 2022 Temperature and Precipitation Outlooks reflect current activ=
e
La
Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions, the latest statistical and dynamical mode=
l guidance, impacts
from decadal trends, antecedent soil moisture, current and likely snowpack,
and
sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Recent weekly NINO3.4 SST anomalie=
s
reached -1.0 degrees Celsius, and an extratropical response consistent with
April La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa events is anticipated. Impacts from La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa are expected to be
strongest over the Pacific Northwest and parts of Alaska based on correlati=
on
and regression analysis of past La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa events. An emergin=
g Madden Julian
Oscillation (MJO) event is forecast through the end of March but further
evolution of the MJO is uncertain in early April, thus the MJO did not play=
 a
strong role in the April 2022 outlook.



Elevated probabilities of above normal monthly mean April temperatures stre=
tch
from the southern coast of California to the Northeast. Probabilities of ab=
ove
normal temperatures exceed 70% over the Southern High Plains where dynamica=
l
and statistical model guidance agreed and depicted highest confidence.
Elevated
probabilities of below normal temperatures are indicated for the Pacific
Northwest eastward across parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern High
Plains, consistent with dynamical model guidance from the North American
Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), as
well as expected impacts from the active La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa. Snowpack=
 is lower than
average in the Northern Plains, however, dynamical and statistical model
guidance conflicted or favored equal chances (EC) of above and below normal
temperatures over the region stretching from Northern California through pa=
rts
of the Northern Plains, and so EC is depicted for these regions. Dynamical
model guidance supports elevated probability of above normal temperatures o=
ver
the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley. However, surfac=
e
moisture conditions are anomalously wet, thus probabilities of above normal
temperatures are relatively weak (33 to 40 percent). Anomalously warm SST
anomalies and decadal trends tilt the odds toward weak probabilities of abo=
ve
normal temperatures over the Northeast, despite uncertainty in statistical =
and
dynamical model guidance.



Below normal temperatures are forecast for Southern Alaska including parts =
of
the Aleutians reflecting consistent guidance from NMME and C3S, as well as
anomalously cool coastal SSTs and expected impacts from the active La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa.
In
contrast, above normal temperatures are favored over parts of the North Slo=
pe
region of Alaska given positive decadal temperature trends and enhanced
probabilities of above normal temperatures depicted by recent Climate Forec=
ast
System version 2 (CFSv2), NMME, and C3S guidance.



The April 2022 precipitation outlook considers statistical and dynamical
models, antecedent soil moisture conditions, and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa i=
mpacts. Below
normal
precipitation is favored for the Southwest, most of the Plains, and Southea=
st.
The highest probabilities of below normal precipitation (50 to 60 percent) =
are
depicted over New Mexico and parts of western Texas given consistency betwe=
en
NMME and statistical models, and is consistent with the forecasted high
probability of above normal temperatures over the region. Below normal
precipitation in C3S guidance over southern California and parts of the
Southwest tilt the odds toward weak probabilities of below normal
precipitation
(33 to 40 percent) where the NMME shows more uncertainty. Dynamical and
statistical model guidance are at odds over Florida, where statistical mode=
l
guidance favors above normal precipitation owing primarily to decadal trend=
s,
while the NMME, C3S, and CFSv2 favor below normal precipitation. Given mode=
l
consistency, weak odds of below normal precipitation (33 to 40 percent) are
favored over the Southeast. Forecasts are also mixed over the Great Lakes,
though weak probabilities of above normal precipitation are shown in the NM=
ME
and CFSv2, and above normal precipitation is forecast in most of the models=
 in
the C3S. Dynamical model forecasts are supplemented by statistical forecast=
s
based on soil moisture over the Great Lakes, and high anomalous soil moistu=
re
conditions in the upper and lower Great Lakes and Ohio Valley tilt the odds
toward above normal precipitation. Elevated probabilities of above normal
precipitation are forecast for the Pacific Northwest stretching northward i=
nto
the Alaska panhandle, as well as the North Slope of Alaska, consistent with
dynamical model guidance and expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu March 31 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 06 - 10 2022

The ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian models are in good agreement on the 500-hPa
height pattern over North America during the 6-10 day period. Ridging
continues
over the West Coast of the CONUS and expands slightly westward into the
western
Great Plains relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecast. Tr=
oughing continues and
deepens
over the eastern CONUS. The ridge over the Bering Sea is also predicted to
amplify and expand over yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model output.=
 Mean troughing is forecast
downstream of this ridge, across western Mainland Alaska.Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 500mb
manual
blend gives equal weights to the ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian models given the=
ir
agreement on the overall pattern, and reflects the description given above.

In accordance with the amplified west/east ridge/trough pattern forecast fo=
r
the CONUS, above normal temperatures are favored west of the Rocky Mountain=
s,
and below normal temperatures are favored for the Mississippi and Ohio rive=
r
valleys. Some small areas of enhanced above normal temperature probabilitie=
s
linger for the Northeast Coast and the southern half of Florida but are
diminished in size from yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecast as t=
he trough shifts eastward.
The
forecast for Alaska features increased odds of below average temperatures f=
or
most of the state, while near-normal temperatures are favored for south-
central
Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.

The precipitation forecast favors a broad area of below average precipitati=
on
for the western and southern CONUS, with small areas of higher below normal
precipitation probabilities (greater than 50 percent) centered over norther=
n
Nevada and the ArkLaTex region. Elevated chances for above normal
precipitation
linger over the northeastern states and around the Great Lakes. The forecas=
t
for Alaska depicts increased chances of above normal precipitation for most=
 of
the state, with near-normal precipitation favored for the Aleutian Islands =
and
along the northern and western coasts of the Mainland.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement, offset by the onset of changing pattern at end of
forecast period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 08 - 14 2022

Model solutions for the 8-14 day 500-hPa flow show somewhat less consensus
over
the broad-scale pattern than the 6-10 forecast period. There is good agreem=
ent
on a large trough over the North Atlantic, as well as an area of ridging ov=
er
the Bering Sea, although the models disagree over the strength of that ridg=
e.
Similarly, the models all depict a weak trough over the Great Lakes, but th=
e
location and strength of this feature varies from model to model. The manua=
l
blend forecast for 500-hPa heights depicts mostly zonal flow over the CONUS
and
a broad ridge centered over the Bering Sea and extending southward into the
adjacent North Pacific.

The 8-14 day temperature forecast depicts a gradual transition from an
east-west dipole in the 6-10 day forecast associated with amplified meridio=
nal
flow towards a pattern more consistent with zonal flow. Elevated chances of
above average temperatures expand eastward from the southwest CONUS to the
Great Plains while the region of favored below average temperatures shifts
eastward out of the Mississippi valley and into the Appalachian region.
Additionally, increased chances of below average temperatures begin to work
their way into the Pacific Northwest. The entire state of Alaska is favored=
 to
have below-average temperatures in the 8-14 day period.

The precipitation forecast for the period is also consistent with a transit=
ion
to zonal flow, with above-average precipitation favored over the northern
states from the Pacific coast to the Great Lakes, and below-average
precipitation favored for much of the southern CONUS, with a slightly highe=
r
probability of dry conditions over the southeastern US. The precipitation
forecast consolidation favors slightly above normal precipitation for Alask=
a,
so modest probabilities of above-average precipitation are indicated for mo=
st
of the state. Near-normal precipitation is favored for the southern coast o=
f
the Mainland and for the Aleutian Islands, which are situated under or
downstream of the ridge forecast to be in place over the Northern Pacific a=
nd
Bering Sea.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
low agreement among dynamical models, a predicted shift in the large-scale
pattern, and increasing uncertainty in forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Daniel Barandiaran

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0243 PM CDT Thu Mar 31 2022

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

The Elevated area over the southern High Plains was expanded and an
Isolated Dry Thunder area was added over eastern New Mexico into the
western Texas Panhandle and South Plains.

Ahead of a developing surface low, forecast soundings show
sufficient midlevel moisture atop warm/dry boundary-layer conditions
-- supportive of isolated, high-based dry thunderstorms. PW values
will remain at or below 0.60 inches, while quick storm motions near
45 mph will limit rainfall accumulations. These conditions, combined
with very dry fuels (ERCs in the 80th-90th percentile) will support
the risk of a few lightning induced fire ignitions. In addition,
strong/gusty outflow winds could accompany any thunderstorms. While
some recent snowfall over the New Mexico/Texas border may have
temporarily increased fuel moisture, the snow has already melted and
fine fuels will continue to dry out today amid ongoing
severe/extreme drought conditions. Farther east over the eastern TX
Panhandle, greater convective coverage should favor higher rainfall
accumulations and cooler boundary-layer conditions -- generally
limiting the wildfire-spread threat.

For additional details, see the previous discussion below.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1257 AM CDT Thu Mar 31 2022/

...Synopsis...
A weak mid-level trough will cross the central Rockies on Friday. As
a result, a compact lee cyclone will develop and move south along
the High Plains. This will lead to some dry and breezy conditions
from the OK/TX Panhandles southward into portions of West Texas. The
latest guidance shows some critical conditions, especially across
the Texas Panhandle. However, portions of this area are receiving
light rain and snow this morning. This may lead to some questionable
fuel dryness even with all day Thursday for fine fuels to cure.
Therefore, will wait to get a better handle on fuels status before
considering a critical delineation.

Additionally, thunderstorms are forecast to develop somewhere across
the central or eastern Texas Panhandle. These storms will likely be
on the drier side and could pose a threat for fire ignitions.
Considering the aforementioned fuel questions and the relatively
small region with the potential for dry thunderstorms, will not add
a delineation at this time.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1239 AM CDT Fri Apr 01 2022

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected this afternoon across parts of
the southern High Plains, including the potential for isolated dry
thunderstorms. Early-morning water vapor imagery reveals a somewhat
diffuse upper-level disturbance over the central Rockies. This
feature is expected to shift to the east/southeast through the day
and slightly deepen amid modest mid-level cold advection associated
with an approaching cold front (noted in recent 700 mb analyses).
Very modest surface pressure falls are noted across east CO, but lee
cyclogenesis should become more pronounced through the day as the
upper wave ejects into the Plains.

...Southeast NM and southwest TX...
Both surface observations and 00Z soundings show a very dry air mass
in place across southwest TX/southeast NM this morning (dewpoint
values near the 10% percentile for early April). This air mass will
be reinforced by downslope warming/drying via increasing westerly
winds by early afternoon as a dryline tightens to the east across
west TX. Wind speeds between 15-20 mph will be common with frequent
gusts up to 25-30 mph possible. RH values are forecast to fall into
the low to mid teens, which should support widespread elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions. Fuels across the region
remain receptive, denoted by fire activity in recent days, and will
support a widespread fire weather concern. Confidence in the
duration and coverage of this threat diminishes with northward
extent into east-central NM where increasing cloud cover, scattered
showers, and recent precipitation may limit the fire weather
potential (despite higher probability of sustained 20 mph winds).

...West-Central Texas into northwest OK and southwest KS...
Fire weather concerns are also possible to the east of the dryline
this afternoon, but may be more conditional on the quality of
moisture return through the day. Early morning surface obs show
dewpoints in the 50s already in place across south TX. However, the
00Z CRP sounding suggests this moisture resides in a rather shallow
boundary layer. As south to southeasterly winds increase through the
day this moisture will advect northwestward into west-central TX and
parts of western OK. Daytime mixing should mitigate the effects of
this moisture return to a degree, but confidence in exact RH
reductions is somewhat low. Nonetheless, increasing flow near 850 mb
ahead of the approaching wave/deepening trough will support
widespread sustained winds near 20 mph with gusts up to 30-35 mph
possible. Given the strong winds and receptive fuels, fire weather
concerns are expected despite more marginal RH reductions. The
duration of this threat may be limited for the eastern TX Panhandle,
western OK, and southwest KS due to developing showers/thunderstorms
in the mid to late afternoon hours.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
00Z soundings under the upper-level disturbance show cold
temperatures aloft and ample mid-level moisture. This thermodynamic
environment will advect to the east/southeast over the next 24
hours. The combination of cool, moist conditions atop a warm, dry
boundary layer will support sufficient instability for isolated to
scattered thunderstorms this afternoon from eastern NM into the TX
Panhandle. Although the dry sub-cloud layer may be somewhat shallow
(around 2 km deep), fast storm motions may limit rainfall amounts
for any one location and support an isolated dry thunderstorm
threat.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Widespread fire weather potential will generally be limited for
Saturday, though a few localized concerns may materialize across the
southern and central High Plains. The upper-level low currently over
the central Rockies is forecast to quickly shift into the
southeastern CONUS by Saturday. In its wake, weaker zonal flow over
the southern U.S. is expected with surface high pressure across the
Plains. This synoptic pattern will generally favor quiescent
conditions for regions with the driest fuels. Across the northern
Rockies, a progressive shortwave trough will aid in deepening a lee
trough along the northern to central High Plains. Downslope west to
southwesterly winds off the higher terrain will likely yield areas
of elevated wind/RH conditions across parts of eastern WY and
eastern NM. Given weak to modest upper-level support and a stagnant
surface pattern, such conditions will likely be confined to close
proximity of terrain features in areas with marginally receptive
fuels and/or recent precipitation.

Extended Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 04 2022 - 12Z Fri Apr 08 2022

...Heavy rainfall/convection and runoff threat to focus across the
South next week...
...Pacific Northwest heavy rain and terrain/mountain heavy snow
threat inland to the northern Rockies...


...Overview...

The large scale pattern will undergo a dramatic change over the
course of the period, as fairly low-amplitude progressive flow
leading into the start of the period early Monday transitions to a
western ridge/east-central U.S. upper trough with a closed low
currently expected to track from the northern Plains into the
Great Lakes by around Wednesday-Friday.  A strong jet arriving
into the Northwest early in the week will initially focus heavy
precipitation over that part of the country and then the
developing upper trough/associated surface evolution will spread
precipitation across much of the eastern half of the lower 48 with
heaviest totals forecast to be across the South.  The upper ridge
building into the West will bring another episode of unseasonably
warm temperatures to that part of the country.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest models and means offer good agreement with the overall
pattern evolution while exhibiting some typical detail differences
that have medium to low predictability.  Of particular note,
latest GFS runs have been on the southern side of the spread for
the upper low that tracks over the Plains and Midwest late Tuesday
through Wednesday and GFS runs have tended to be more eager to
bring Pacific shortwave energy into the northern part of the
western ridge late in the period (which the new 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted toward).  As the main system of interest reaches the East
late in the week, differences are fairly modest for a days 6-7
forecast with the GFS/GEFS slightly northeast of the ECMWF/CMC and
their means.  A starting point consisting of a 12Z/18Z model blend
early and then a model/ensemble mean blend later on provided a
good intermediate solution with only modest refinements to
continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A strong upper jet pushing into the Northwest early next week will
bring an episode of enhanced coastal/terrain rain and mountain
snow to the Pacific Northwest with significant totals extending
into the northern Rockies.  After this moisture departs, the upper
ridge building into the West will bring dry weather to much of the
region Wednesday-Friday.  Downstream upper trough amplification
and surface low/front evolution will promote active weather over
the central/eastern U.S.  With typical run-to-run refinements and
some spread in the details, there is a persistent signal for heavy
rainfall potential from near the southeastern Plains into the
Southeast during the first half of the week.  This region has the
best overlap of moist Gulf inflow and instability, along with
focus from a couple surface fronts.  The Storm Prediction Center
is also monitoring this system for strong to severe convection,
with more details forthcoming as predictability improves over
future guidance runs.  Other parts of the central/eastern U.S.
could see pockets of locally moderate to heavy rain as well.
Meanwhile some snow could be possible along the northern tier, on
the cold side of the upper low track, as well as into parts of New
England.

The upper ridge building into the West will support another period
of well above normal temperatures across the region by
Wednesday-Friday.  The greatest anomalies for daytime highs should
be from California and southern Oregon into the Great Basin, with
highs 10-20F above normal and some locations reaching 20-25F above
normal.  Some daily records for highs/warm lows will be possible
late in the week.  Ahead of the ridge, cool air under the
amplifying upper trough will bring highs down to 5-15F below
normal over the northern Rockies on Tuesday and progressing into
the east-central U.S. by Friday.  Leading warm/moist flow ahead of
the upper trough/surface system will bring a couple days of above
normal readings (especially for morning lows) to the East around
Wednesday-Thursday.

...Heavy rainfall/convection and runoff threat to focus across the
South next week...
...Pacific Northwest heavy rain and terrain/mountain heavy snow
threat inland to the northern Rockies...


...Overview...

The large scale pattern will undergo a dramatic change over the
course of the period, as fairly low-amplitude progressive flow
leading into the start of the period early Monday transitions to a
western ridge/east-central U.S. upper trough with a closed low
currently expected to track from the northern Plains into the
Great Lakes by around Wednesday-Friday.  A strong jet arriving
into the Northwest early in the week will initially focus heavy
precipitation over that part of the country and then the
developing upper trough/associated surface evolution will spread
precipitation across much of the eastern half of the lower 48 with
heaviest totals forecast to be across the South.  The upper ridge
building into the West will bring another episode of unseasonably
warm temperatures to that part of the country.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest models and means offer good agreement with the overall
pattern evolution while exhibiting some typical detail differences
that have medium to low predictability.  Of particular note,

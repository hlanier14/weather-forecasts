...A strong cold front and accompanying atmospheric river will
bring windy conditions and heavy rains to the Northwest through
the weekend...

...Very warm, windy, and dry conditions will support widespread
elevated to critical fire weather conditions from the Sierra
Nevada to the northern High Plains through Saturday...

...Post-Tropical Cyclone Nicholas is dissipating but will still
bring pockets of locally heavy rain and flash flooding to portions
of the Gulf Coast states this weekend...

A strong cold front and accompanying plume of deep moisture
associated with an atmospheric river will continue to impact the
northwestern U.S. through the weekend.  As the front continues to
slide southwest through the region, heavy precipiation is expected
across western Oregon into northwestern California on Saturday.
This rainfall may produce localized areas of flash flooding.  Burn
scar areas are especially vulnerable to flash flooding and debris
flows.

Ahead of the system, dry, warm, and windy conditions -- supporting
elevated to critical fire weather conditions -- will continue from
the Sierra Nevada northeastward to the northern High Plains on
Saturday.  Red Flag Warnings have been raised for much of the
region that extends from the Sierra Nevada to the western Dakotas.
 Along the northern High Plains, daytime temperatures are forecast
to climb well into the 90s on Saturday -- more than 20 degrees
above normal in some spots.

As the system continue to progress, the warm air is forecast to
shift east on Sunday, with temperatures expected to climb
well-above normal across much of the northern Plains and Midwest.
Showers and storms are expected to develop along the front as it
moves across the northern Plains on Sunday, with some potential
for severe weather across the eastern Dakotas into Minnesota late
in the afternoon into the evening.  Meanwhile behind the front,
below-normal temperatures will spread across the Northwest into
the northern Rockies and Great Basin on Sunday, before spilling
out into the High Plains on Monday.  High elevation snow is
expected for portions of the northern Rockies on Sunday into early
Monday.

Although Post-Tropical Cyclone Nicholas continues to weaken,
plenty of moisture remains in place -- supporting additional
showers and thunderstorms that may produce locally heavy rains
from the central Gulf Coast into the lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys and portions of the Southeast through the
weekend.  Southerly winds ahead of the system that is moving
across the central U.S. will begin to carry some of this moisture
farther to the north -- introducing an increasing change for
showers and thunderstorms into the Ohio Valley by late Sunday.

Tropical Storm Odette, which has developed well off the
Mid-Atlantic Coast is expected to remain well offshore as it
tracks northeast over the coming days.  However, swells generated
by Odette are impacting portions of the Mid-Atlantic coast and are
forecast to spread northward to portions of the Northeast coast
during the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0117 AM CST Fri Feb 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough atop surface high pressure will traverse the
eastern CONUS through the period, bringing about cooler/moister
conditions that are expected to limit significant wildfire spread
conditions across much of the central and eastern CONUS. Some
breezy, occasionally dry conditions may be observed during the
afternoon across portions of the southwest U.S in conjunction with
the approach of another upper trough. However, the lack of receptive
fuels and marginally supportive surface winds/RH precludes any fire
weather highlights.

FXUS21 KWNC 191853
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 19 2021

SYNOPSIS: A quieter weather pattern is forecast for week-2 compared to the
current onslaught of wintry weather across much of the eastern half of the
country. Mid-level high pressure is favored to expand over the East allowing
for a transition to more seasonable temperatures. The expected return flow
around this feature results in enhanced precipitation chances across parts of
the east-central U.S. Mid-level low pressure is forecast over the western
contiguous U.S., resulting in the potential for a limited amount of cold air
to
descend into interior portions of the West.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Great Basin
and Northern and Central Rockies, Sat-Sun, Feb 27-28.

Slight risk for heavy precipitation for portions of the Southern Plains,
Middle
and Lower Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, Sat-Wed, Feb 27-Mar 3.

Slight risk of high winds for the Aleutians and coastal portions of
southwestern Mainland Alaska, Sat-Mon, Feb 27-Mar 1.

Flooding possible for portions of the Southern Plains, Middle and Lower
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY FEBRUARY 22 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 26:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!qZylh4UCgLlDwbLSu8AvM9tAY7xqw5IeF7QGAYzvvlGknVrBgZnahe7h5BZplTxzFSEjhZ4s$

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 27 - FRIDAY MARCH 05: Anomalous troughing is forecast
over the western CONUS early in week-2, coinciding with a slight risk of much
below-normal minimum temperatures over parts of the Great Basin, and the
Northern and Central Rockies for 2/27-2/28. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools
depict at least a 20% chance minimum temperatures fall below the 15th
percentile over much of the highlighted region. Additionally, both the
uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF ensembles indicate minimum temperatures falling at
least 10 deg F below climatology, supporting the slight risk. Some of this
cold
may eventually expand eastward across the Northern and Central Plains and
Upper
Mississippi Valley, but is not expected to be anomalous enough to warrant
including in the hazard area.



Model guidance continues to depict anomalous 500-hPa ridging over the eastern
CONUS as the Arctic Oscillation is forecast to be in a neutral to positive
phase. This favors an end to the cold pattern seen across much of the East in
recent weeks, and leads to increased chances for near to above normal
temperatures. Surface high pressure is forecast to move from the southeastern
CONUS into the western Atlantic by the second half of the period, increasing
southwesterly flow and moisture transport out of the Gulf of Mexico. The ECMWF
reforecast tool depicts a large region of the east-central CONUS having at
least a 20% of 3-day precipitation exceeding the 85th percentile for the
2/27-3/3 period, with the GEFS reforecast tool now showing some of these
enhanced probabilities as well. Uncalibrated guidance from the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles support elevated precipitation chances as shortwave disturbances
eject out of the trough over the west. Therefore a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is posted for 2/27-3/3 for the Southern Plains eastward into the
Middle and Lower Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys. Severe weather
cannot be ruled out, particularly across parts of the Southern Plains and
Lower
Mississippi Valley, where the highest humidity levels are forecast. Antecedent
warm conditions in week-1 are expected to contribute to rapid snow melt, and
exacerbate already high soil moisture levels across the region. Therefore, a
flooding possible hazard is also highlighted given that any additional
precipitation could result in localized flooding.



A transient pattern is forecast to develop across Alaska during week-2 with
the
mean-flow becoming more zonal, and a series of surface lows forecast to move
through the state. This favors increasing precipitation chances, especially
across the southern half of the state. Despite this, none of the tools depict
a
coherent signal for precipitation totals reaching hazards criteria, and
therefore, no related precipitation hazard is posted. High wind speeds are
possible across portions of the Aleutians and coastal southwestern Mainland as
these surface lows pass through, with both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
depicting at least a 20% chance that wind speeds exceed the 90th percentile
early in the forecast period. Deterministic guidance from the 0z and 6z GFS
also supports wind speeds in the 40-50 mph range, and therefore a slight risk
for high winds is highlighted over these areas for 2/27-3/1. Anomalously cool
temperatures are forecast across western parts of the Mainland as offshore
surface flow develops, but current guidance does not depict temperatures
dropping below hazards thresholds, precluding a related temperature hazard for
Alaska.

western U.S. mean troughing in response to
strengthening/amplification of an upper ridge over the
East-Central Pacific.  To the east of the Rockies expect the mean
flow to be nearly zonal, or perhaps slightly west-southwesterly as
upper ridging over the southern Gulf of Mexico/far northwestern
Caribbean strengthens somewhat around midweek.  The pattern will
support active weather over parts of the West (especially the
Pacific Northwest into the Rockies) and likely bring a couple
precipitation-producing systems across the eastern half of the
country.

The greatest model/ensemble discrepancies still involve the
separate bundles of energy dropping into the developing western
mean trough, one that arrives Tuesday-Wednesday and then ejects
eastward thereafter followed by a second that arrives later in the
week.  For the leading feature a guidance average has held up well
over the past day or so as the previously slow/closed CMC has
accelerated a bit in the 00Z run while the 06Z GFS again (like
yesterday) trended slower than the 00Z run to join the ECMWF.  By
early Thursday the 12Z GFS returned to a slightly faster solution
(joined by the UKMET) while the 12Z CMC is still close to the 00Z
ECMWF/06Z GFS.  The 12Z GEFS mean is close to this latter
cluster's timing as well and the new 12Z ECMWF is fairly
consistent.  The timing and shape of this shortwave become
increasingly uncertain as progressive flow carries it across the
central/eastern U.S. late in the week.  Upstream energy arriving
into the West Thursday-Friday has generally been better behaved
over the past day or so but still with some detail/timing
differences.  12Z models arriving thus far hint at slightly slower
timing than some 00Z/06Z guidance but differences are still well
within typical guidance spread/error ranges at that time frame.

To the east of the Rockies, consensus has held up well for the
early week shortwave trough crossing the East and associated
surface low evolution/trailing front.  Upstream northern tier U.S.
and southern Canada flow will bring one frontal system across
northern areas and then one or more trailing waves will anchor the
rest of the front that makes its way through most of the
central/eastern U.S. Tuesday-Thursday.  Guidance shares this
general depiction but has varied with frontal wave details after
Tuesday and confidence is modest given dependence on smaller scale
shortwave details.  The shortwave ejecting from the West after
midweek may form a frontal wave over the southeastern quadrant of
the lower 48 by late Thursday/Friday but again with fairly low
confidence on specifics.

A blend of operational 00Z/06Z runs represented majority ideas
well for the first half of the period, while a composite of varied
00Z ECMWF/CMC and 06Z GFS weights actually compared rather
favorably to the ensemble mean pattern into days 6-7
Thursday-Friday as well.  Thus the latter part of the forecast
required only about 1/3 total input from the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF
means to account for detail uncertainty.  The resulting blend
provided a good middle ground for representing potential
southeastern waviness late in the week, between the operational
runs and ill-defined means.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Over the West expect the highest precipitation totals over the
Pacific Northwest as strong westerly flow aloft and a wavy cold
front support one episode of enhanced rain/mountain snow early in
the week and a northeastern Pacific upper trough/frontal system
bring more precipitation after midweek.  Moderate to heavy snow
over the northern Rockies should continue into the early part of
the week followed by a lighter trend and southeastward
progression.  Snowfall could become heavier again for a time over
or near the Colorado portion of the Rockies after midweek
depending on specifics of ejecting western shortwave energy.  The
moisture shield associated with the late week system may bring
another area of snow to the northern Rockies.

A storm/frontal system crossing the East early in the week will
produce mainly light to moderate precipitation, with some snow
most likely from the northern Mid-Atlantic to New England and rain
to the south.  A few pockets of heavier snowfall could be
possible.  Flow behind the early week system and around the
frontal system right behind it will promote some lake
effect/terrain-enhanced snowfall.  Expect highest snowfall totals
to be over upstate New York, to the lee of Lake Ontario.
Otherwise fronts affecting northern areas to the east of the
Rockies Tuesday-early Thursday should produce relatively
light/scattered precipitation.  Shortwave energy ejecting from the
West may lead to a frontal wave and some heavier precipitation
over parts of the central/eastern U.S. late in the week, along
with snow along the northern fringe of the precip shield.  However
confidence is currently low for resolving the precise
timing/coverage/intensity of this precipitation.

The greatest warm anomalies for temperatures will progress from
west to east across the northern tier states from Monday into
early Thursday.  Most areas should see one or more days with
morning lows 10-20F above normal while such anomalies for highs
may be more confined to the Northern Plains during Monday-Tuesday.
 Meanwhile during mid-late week a push of colder air behind a
front will bring temperatures down to as much as 10-20F or so
below normal from portions of the West through the southern half
of the Plains.  Coldest readings compared to average may be for
highs over the central/southern High Plains on Thursday.  The
Southwest will be moderately above normal early in the week
(perhaps exceeding plus 10F anomalies at some locations Tuesday)
before a cooling trend.  The East will see temperatures oscillate
up to 5-10F or so on either side of normal in response to system
progression.

...Upper Midwest will receive snow and isolated areas
drizzle/freezing drizzle overnight Saturday into Sunday...

...Rain and snow for the Northwest into the Great Basin/Northern
Rockies through Sunday evening.

An upper-level trough/low over the Great Lakes will help produce
light snow over the Great Lakes into the Northeast and the Central
Appalachians through late Saturday night/early Sunday morning.
Meanwhile, low pressure over the Northwest will slowly move
eastward to the Central High Plains by Saturday evening, then move
northeastward to the Upper Great Lakes by Sunday evening.  The
system will produce rain and higher elevation snow over Pacific
Northwest/Northern California, with mainly snow over the Northern
Intermountain Region/Great Basin tonight.  The rain and higher
elevation snow will expand into parts of Central California by
Saturday morning.  The light snow will expand into parts of the
Central Rockies by Saturday evening.  As the storm moves out of
the Rockies, light snow will develop over parts of the
Central/Northern Plains and the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper
Great Lakes overnight Saturday.  On Sunday morning, isolated areas
of drizzle/freezing drizzle will develop over parts of the Central
Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley as light snow continues over
parts of the Upper Midwest. The areas of drizzle/freezing drizzle
will end by Sunday evening.  Light snow will continue over parts
of the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley as rain develops over parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday evening.

Elsewhere, moisture will come onshore over the Northwest ahead of
the next front, which will bring an increase of rain and higher
elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest and snow over parts of
the Northern Rockies on Sunday into Sunday evening.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri February 19 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 25 - MAR 01, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
pattern
across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period.
Dynamical models forecast a 500-hPa trough over the western CONUS. Upstream of
this trough, ridging is forecast over the Alaska Peninsula and southwestern
Mainland Alaska. The manual height blend depicts negative height anomalies
over
the western CONUS and most of  Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.
Positive height anomalies are forecast across the remainder of the eastern
CONUS, the Southern Plains, the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutians.

Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are enhanced across much of
Northern
Mainland Alaska associated with below normal heights. Above normal
temperatures
are favored for the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutians, due to  predicted ridging.
Troughing predicted over the western CONUS favors below normal temperatures
for
that region, extending eastward to the central and southern Plains. Above
normal temperatures are favored for the eastern CONUS along with parts of the
Gulf Coast, underneath predicted above normal heights.

An increased pressure gradient is expected to promote enhanced Pacific flow
across parts of the northwestern CONUS, leading to elevated chances of above
normal precipitation. Farther to the south, surface high pressure and behind
the trough favor drier than normal conditions across California and the
southwestern CONUS, extending eastward to parts of the Southern Plains.
Conversely, above normal precipitation is more likely across the Great Lakes,
the Mississippi Valley, and much of the eastern CONUS, underneath predicted
cyclonic flow. Ridging and associated surface high pressure are expected
farther to the south and east, favoring below normal precipitation for the
Florida Peninsula. Strong ridging across the Aleutians is forecast to push the
storm track further north than normal, resulting in elevated chances of above
normal precipitation across Alaska.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset by increasing uncertainty in
regards to the temperature forecast over the CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 27 - MAR 05, 2021

During the week-2 period, an amplified 500-hPa trough is forecast across the
western CONUS with below normal heights except for the West Coast, where
slightly above normal heights are forecast due to the ridging eastward
progressing. Downstream, ridging is forecast to dominate the eastern CONUS
with
above normal heights.  Across Alaska, the ensemble means depict below normal
heights with low amplitude 500-hPa flow, which is likely a function of
increasing spread among ensemble members.

Forecast below normal heights lead to increased chances of near to below
normal
temperatures across Alaska. Troughing aloft favors below normal temperatures
across the western CONUS extending to the High Plains. Near to above normal
temperatures are more likely for the remainder of the CONUS as a mean ridge
gains strength over the Southeastern CONUS.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across much of Alaska
due to the ridging across the Aleutians to push the storm track. Enhanced
Pacific flow across parts of the northwestern CONUS elevates chances of above
normal precipitation. Downstream of an amplified 500-hPa trough, above normal
precipitation is also favored for much of the eastern CONUS, Mississippi
Valley
and parts of the Southern Plains. However, increased chances of below normal
precipitation are forecast across Florida due to anomalous subtropical
ridging.
Drier than normal conditions are likely for much of the western CONUS along
with the High Plains, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern offset by
increasing
uncertainty in regards to the temperature forecast over the CONUS

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 PM CST Fri Feb 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The lack of receptive fuels will limit the potential for widespread
fire weather conditions across the Southwest. See the previous
discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 02/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0120 AM CST Fri Feb 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure/cooler air, as well as recent widespread
accumulated precipitation, will serve to limit major wildfire spread
potential across much of the eastern CONUS during the Day 2/Saturday
period. Farther west, an upper trough will continue to deepen as it
overspreads the southwest into central CONUS and fosters surface lee
troughing in the southern High Plains through the day. Dry downslope
flow along the lee of the Southern Rockies, and strong, dry gradient
flow across portions of southern California into central and
southern Arizona/New Mexico are expected. Surface sustained winds
may exceed 20 mph across much of the southwest, with several locales
potentially seeing RH drop as low as 15-20% in spots. While such
conditions typically warrant at least an Elevated delineation, the
lack of more receptive fuels to fire spread suggests that fire
weather highlights are not needed at this time.

311 PM EST Fri Feb 19 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 22 2021 - 12Z Fri Feb 26 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Latest guidance continues to show progressive mean flow over the
lower 48 at the start of the week followed by a transition toward
western U.S. mean troughing in response to
strengthening/amplification of an upper ridge over the
East-Central Pacific.  To the east of the Rockies expect the mean
flow to be nearly zonal, or perhaps slightly west-southwesterly as
upper ridging over the southern Gulf of Mexico/far northwestern
Caribbean strengthens somewhat around midweek.  The pattern will
support active weather over parts of the West (especially the
Pacific Northwest into the Rockies) and likely bring a couple
precipitation-producing systems across the eastern half of the
country.

The greatest model/ensemble discrepancies still involve the
separate bundles of energy dropping into the developing western
mean trough, one that arrives Tuesday-Wednesday and then ejects
eastward thereafter followed by a second that arrives later in the
week.  For the leading feature a guidance average has held up well
over the past day or so as the previously slow/closed CMC has
accelerated a bit in the 00Z run while the 06Z GFS again (like
yesterday) trended slower than the 00Z run to join the ECMWF.  By
early Thursday the 12Z GFS returned to a slightly faster solution
(joined by the UKMET) while the 12Z CMC is still close to the 00Z
ECMWF/06Z GFS.  The 12Z GEFS mean is close to this latter
cluster's timing as well and the new 12Z ECMWF is fairly
consistent.  The timing and shape of this shortwave become
increasingly uncertain as progressive flow carries it across the
central/eastern U.S. late in the week.  Upstream energy arriving
into the West Thursday-Friday has generally been better behaved
over the past day or so but still with some detail/timing
differences.  12Z models arriving thus far hint at slightly slower
timing than some 00Z/06Z guidance but differences are still well
within typical guidance spread/error ranges at that time frame.

To the east of the Rockies, consensus has held up well for the
early week shortwave trough crossing the East and associated
surface low evolution/trailing front.  Upstream northern tier U.S.
and southern Canada flow will bring one frontal system across
northern areas and then one or more trailing waves will anchor the
rest of the front that makes its way through most of the
central/eastern U.S. Tuesday-Thursday.  Guidance shares this
general depiction but has varied with frontal wave details after
Tuesday and confidence is modest given dependence on smaller scale
shortwave details.  The shortwave ejecting from the West after
midweek may form a frontal wave over the southeastern quadrant of
the lower 48 by late Thursday/Friday but again with fairly low
confidence on specifics.

A blend of operational 00Z/06Z runs represented majority ideas
well for the first half of the period, while a composite of varied
00Z ECMWF/CMC and 06Z GFS weights actually compared rather
favorably to the ensemble mean pattern into days 6-7
Thursday-Friday as well.  Thus the latter part of the forecast
required only about 1/3 total input from the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF
means to account for detail uncertainty.  The resulting blend
provided a good middle ground for representing potential
southeastern waviness late in the week, between the operational
runs and ill-defined means.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Over the West expect the highest precipitation totals over the
Pacific Northwest as strong westerly flow aloft and a wavy cold
front support one episode of enhanced rain/mountain snow early in
the week and a northeastern Pacific upper trough/frontal system
bring more precipitation after midweek.  Moderate to heavy snow
over the northern Rockies should continue into the early part of
the week followed by a lighter trend and southeastward
progression.  Snowfall could become heavier again for a time over
or near the Colorado portion of the Rockies after midweek
depending on specifics of ejecting western shortwave energy.  The
moisture shield associated with the late week system may bring
another area of snow to the northern Rockies.

A storm/frontal system crossing the East early in the week will
produce mainly light to moderate precipitation, with some snow
most likely from the northern Mid-Atlantic to New England and rain
to the south.  A few pockets of heavier snowfall could be
possible.  Flow behind the early week system and around the
frontal system right behind it will promote some lake
effect/terrain-enhanced snowfall.  Expect highest snowfall totals
to be over upstate New York, to the lee of Lake Ontario.
Otherwise fronts affecting northern areas to the east of the
Rockies Tuesday-early Thursday should produce relatively
light/scattered precipitation.  Shortwave energy ejecting from the
West may lead to a frontal wave and some heavier precipitation
over parts of the central/eastern U.S. late in the week, along
with snow along the northern fringe of the precip shield.  However
confidence is currently low for resolving the precise
timing/coverage/intensity of this precipitation.

The greatest warm anomalies for temperatures will progress from
west to east across the northern tier states from Monday into
early Thursday.  Most areas should see one or more days with
morning lows 10-20F above normal while such anomalies for highs
may be more confined to the Northern Plains during Monday-Tuesday.
 Meanwhile during mid-late week a push of colder air behind a
front will bring temperatures down to as much as 10-20F or so
below normal from portions of the West through the southern half
of the Plains.  Coldest readings compared to average may be for
highs over the central/southern High Plains on Thursday.  The
Southwest will be moderately above normal early in the week
(perhaps exceeding plus 10F anomalies at some locations Tuesday)
before a cooling trend.  The East will see temperatures oscillate
up to 5-10F or so on either side of normal in response to system
progression.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A relatively progressive upper flow pattern will be in place for
the beginning of the week as the eastern U.S. trough departs
across the western Atlantic.  This will be followed by zonal flow
across much of the central and eastern U.S. ahead of an amplifying
western U.S. trough by Wednesday.  A second trough builds in for
the Pacific Northwest by the end of the week.

The 00Z model guidance suite is overall in above average agreement
on the synoptic scale pattern through Wednesday, with a split
upper level flow pattern likely developing.  By Thursday and
beyond, the CMC becomes a little more amplified and progressive
with the northern stream trough building in across the
north-central U.S.  Similar to last night, the 00Z GFS parallel is
strong with the second trough/closed low approaching the Pacific
Northwest by Thursday night, but is competitive elsewhere across
the continental U.S.

For the fronts and pressures forecast, the 18Z GFS parallel was
preferred over the operational 18Z GFS given some timing
differences with the pattern change across the West, with the
parallel version closer in line with the model consensus.  The
GEFS mean did not appear amplified enough with the southern stream
trough over the southeastern U.S., so it was not favored for this
forecast.  A blend of the 12Z ECMWF/18Z parallel GFS/12Z CMC was
used through early Thursday, and then less weighting towards the
CMC by next weekend and more weighting towards the GFS
parallel/ECMWF/EC mean.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Things will be relatively uneventful across most regions of the
nation compared to the extreme winter weather that has been
endured by many locations this past week.  The storm system
crossing the Pacific Northwest and the Rockies is expected to
produce heavy snow for the higher terrain of the central and
northern Rockies by the middle of the week, and will likely affect
much of the Interstate 25 corridor in Colorado.  By the end of the
week, a corridor of light to moderate rainfall will be possible
across portions of the south-central U.S. and extending towards
the southern Appalachians, with perhaps some snow on the northern
edge of the precipitation.  There is still a good deal of model
spread regarding the placement of this QPF axis, so changes in the
forecast going forward are expected.

In the temperature department, the building trough and the passage
of the cold front across the Intermountain West will herald a
change to readings falling to 10-20 degrees below average for the
western High Plains to the Rockies, along not nearly as impressive
as the recent Arctic blast based on our current forecasts.
Temperatures will likely be 10-20 degrees above average ahead of
that same storm system across the northern Plains on Tuesday.  By
the end of the forecast period next Saturday, expect temperatures
to be near to slightly below normal for most of the continental
U.S.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A relatively progressive upper flow pattern will be in place for
the beginning of the week as the eastern U.S. trough departs
across the western Atlantic.  This will be followed by zonal flow
across much of the central and eastern U.S. ahead of an amplifying
western U.S. trough by Wednesday.  A second trough builds in for
the Pacific Northwest by the end of the week.

The 00Z model guidance suite is overall in above average agreement
on the synoptic scale pattern through Wednesday, with a split
upper level flow pattern likely developing.  By Thursday and
beyond, the CMC becomes a little more amplified and progressive
with the northern stream trough building in across the
north-central U.S.  Similar to last night, the 00Z GFS parallel is
strong with the second trough/closed low approaching the Pacific
Northwest by Thursday night, but is competitive elsewhere across
the continental U.S.

For the fronts and pressures forecast, the 18Z GFS parallel was
preferred over the operational 18Z GFS given some timing
differences with the pattern change across the West, with the
parallel version closer in line with the model consensus.  The
GEFS mean did not appear amplified enough with the southern stream
trough over the southeastern U.S., so it was not favored for this
forecast.  A blend of the 12Z ECMWF/18Z parallel GFS/12Z CMC was
used through early Thursday, and then less weighting towards the
CMC by next weekend and more weighting towards the GFS
parallel/ECMWF/EC mean.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will deepen while traversing the southwest CONUS,
with an 80+ knot 500 mb jet streak expected to overspread the Lower
Colorado River Basin into the southern High Plains during the
afternoon hours. The surface mass response will be the development
of a surface cyclone which will eject into the southern High Plains
by early evening. Gradient winds, downslope flow, and downward
momentum transport of the stronger flow aloft via a dry, well-mixed
boundary layer will serve to promote widespread 20+ mph sustained
westerly winds across portions of the lower Colorado River Basin
into the southern High Plains. By afternoon peak heating, several
locales across the Southwest may also see surface RH drop into the
15-20% range. While the surface meteorological conditions are
expected to reach Elevated to potentially Critical criteria
(especially in southern Arizona and New Mexico), fuels poorly
receptive to wildfire spread mitigate the need for fire weather
highlights.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0121 AM CST Sat Feb 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject into the Plains states during the Day
2/Sunday period, with widespread dry northerly low-level flow
expected across much of the southwest CONUS into the southern High
Plains as surface high pressure ushers in from the Great Basin. The
approaching surface high will also support an intensifying surface
pressure gradient across southern California, with dry offshore flow
expected. Elevated to potentially locally Critical conditions may
occur from portions of southern California into the southern High
Plains, mainly during the afternoon. However, mediocre fuel
receptiveness to wildfire spread is expected to limit widespread
significant wildfire growth, precluding the need for wildfire
highlights at this time.

....Lingering areas of light snow over the Great Lakes...

...Snow and isolated areas drizzle/freezing drizzle to spread from
Upper Midwest to Northeast this weekend...

...Temperatures to moderate across the central US...

Troughing across the northeast associated with the departed East
Coast system will continue to produce light snow across the Great
Lakes through Sunday morning. Winter Storm Watches, Warnings and
Advisories are currently in effect for areas downwind of Lakes
Michigan, Eerie and Ontario. Generally, 2-4 inches of snow are
likely for the areas while isolated places may see over 6 inches
of snow.

An upper-level low will emerge from the Rockies to produce wintry
weather from the Northern/Central Plains to the Northeast between
Sunday and Monday. A general area of 2-4 inches of snow are
expected over the Upper Midwest between Sunday and Monday with
locally higher amounts possible. Rain and scattered to isolated
thunderstorms will spread across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southeast in the meantime. This system will spread snow into the
Northeast and Central Appalachians on Monday, as it strengthens
further.

Mountain snow and coastal/low elevation rain will persist across
the Northwest over the next couple of days. The same system that
will eventually bring snow to the Upper Midwest and Northeast will
first produce some snowfall over the Rockies today. Consistent
troughing in the Pacific Northwest will lead to the potential for
heavy snow across the Cascades and Northern Rockies. Snowfall
totals may reach well over a foot for parts of the Northern
Cascades while more modest totals between 6-10 inches maybe more
likely for portions of the Northern Rockies through Sunday.
Temperatures will remain below average for much of the central and
eastern US today before beginning to moderate into the beginning
of next week.

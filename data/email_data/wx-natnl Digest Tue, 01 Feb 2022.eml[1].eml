Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0938 AM CST Mon Jan 31 2022

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWESTERN
NEBRASKA...

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments for
the latest Hi-res guidance. Widespread elevated and critical
conditions are forecast across the northern/central High Plains this
afternoon. The critical area was expanded slightly westward into the
corridor of the strongest winds across eastern WY. Localized
extremely critical conditions may also occur with strong wind gusts
greater than 40 mph across parts of western and central Nebraska.
Widespread elevated conditions are also likely across parts of the
TX/OK Panhandles, though winds should remain weaker. Please see
below for additional information.

..Lyons.. 01/31/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CST Mon Jan 31 2022/

...Synopsis...
A well-defined, progressive mid-level trough will eject into the
northern Plains today, with a belt of 60-80 kt 500 mb flow
overspreading the region by afternoon. At the surface, intense lee
troughing across the Plains states along with boundary-layer mixing
will promote critically dry and windy conditions across parts of the
northern Plains, with dry and occasionally breezy conditions also
likely across parts of the southern High Plains.

...Northern Plains...
By afternoon peak heating, gradient flow associated with the surface
lee trough, along with downward momentum transport of the stronger
flow aloft, will foster widespread 20+ mph sustained westerly
surface winds coinciding with 15-20 percent RH. Given dry fuels
across the region, Critical highlights have been maintained,
particularly where the most favorable surface wind/RH overlap is
expected to last for at least 3 hours.

...Southern High Plains...
Upper support is expected to be weaker compared to points farther
north. Nonetheless, very dry air emanating from the higher terrain
of the southern Rockies, due to downslope flow and some surface lee
troughing, will promote modest conditions for wildfire spread. 15
mph sustained winds may become common across several areas through
the afternoon in addition to 10-20 percent RH, which will overspread
very dry fuels cured by an extreme to exceptional drought.

0136 PM CST Mon Jan 31 2022

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

The previous forecast remains valid with no changes. See below for
the prior discussion.

..Lyons.. 01/31/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CST Mon Jan 31 2022/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level longwave trough will further amplify while ejecting into
the Plains states tomorrow/Tuesday, with cooler air and associated
surface high pressure surging southeastward across the Plains.
Overall cool conditions will limit wildfire-spread concerns across
most of the CONUS. South of a surface cold front, some dry downslope
flow is likely across southeast New Mexico into western Texas, with
RH dipping into the 15-25 percent range by afternoon peak heating.
However, guidance consensus suggests that wind speeds will be too
weak to warrant fire weather highlights this outlook.

FOR TUESDAY FEBRUARY 08 - MONDAY FEBRUARY 14: Prior to week-2, surface high
pressure with anomalously cold temperatures are forecast to affect the
south-central CONUS. On Feb 8 and 9, a slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is posted from the Rio Grande Valley east to the middle and lo=
wer
Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tool=
s
depict minimum temperatures having more than a 20 percent chance of falling
into the lowest 15th percentile of the climatological distribution. During
early February, freezing temperatures are likely to extend as far south as =
the
Texas Hill Country and middle Rio Grande Valley. Later in week-2, models
diverge regarding the magnitude of below normal temperature anomalies, if a=
ny,
to affect the central and eastern CONUS, with the GEFS colder than the ECMW=
F
ensemble mean. Given the better skill recently and the lack of a full latit=
ude
ridge upstream, the milder temperature solution of the ECMWF ensemble mean =
is
preferred.



Ensemble means are in good agreement indicating a broad 500-hPa ridge
persisting over the eastern Pacific and West Coast through the first two we=
eks
of February. Mid-level shortwave troughs, in the northern stream, are forec=
ast
to result in periods of snow across the northern Rockies throughout week-2.
Southwest flow aloft associated with a positively-tilted longwave trough
favors
near to above normal precipitation across the Southern Great Plains,
Southeast,
and Mid-Atlantic during week-2. Given the time of year and residual cold
heading into week-2, there are elevated chances of winter weather from
Oklahoma
east to the Tennessee Valley, southern Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic.
However,
forecast confidence is too low to specify a heavy snow hazard at this time =
due
to the potential for marginal temperatures. Based on good model agreement
indicating a shortwave trough in the southern stream and support from the
uncalibrated ECMWF model, a slight risk of heavy precipitation (more than 1
inch per 24 hours) is posted from the western Gulf Coast and lower Mississi=
ppi
Valley eastward to the Carolinas from Feb 10 to 12.



There is good model agreement and continuity regarding a persistent, longwa=
ve
500-hPa trough over the Aleutians and Bering Sea through early week-2. This
pattern is likely to support a continuation of surface low development near
the
Aleutians or Alaska Peninsula with enhanced onshore flow affecting coastal
southern Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. A slight risk of heavy precipitat=
ion
is posted for parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, Feb =
8
to
10. The reforecast tools show at least 20% chance of 3-day liquid equivalen=
t
totals exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches, locally, for the
highlighted
area. A slight risk of heavy snow is posted for the higher elevations of
southeastern Mainland Alaska although impacts should be minimized due to
snowfall occurring at only the higher elevations. A slight risk of high win=
ds
is also posted for coastal portions of southern Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle, Feb 8 to 10, associated with enhanced onshore flow. The reforeca=
st
tools indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th
percentile and 40 mph in the designated risk area. Beyond the early part of
week-2, ensemble means depict the longwave 500-hPa ridge axis retrograding
westward over the Gulf of Alaska which would likely limit the potential for
hazardous weather.

...Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to Flash Flooding for
parts of the central Texas Gulf Coast today...

...Pacific Northwest system produces moderate to heavy snowfall
for Cascades and Northern Rockies today before spreading light
snow and high winds across the Northern Plains tonight; Critical
Fire Weather Risk for parts of western Nebraska this afternoon...

...A major winter storm is expected to impact much of the central
U.S. beginning Tuesday night and continuing through Wednesday
night...

A closed upper-level low making its way across Texas today is
tapping into Gulf moisture and streaming it northward over a
surface front draped across South Texas. A focused area of heavy
rain and scattered thunderstorms have developed and will continue
to produce locally heavy rainfall rates in parts of southeast
Texas. A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in effect for this
area due to a heightened risk for flash flooding. A couple
additional inches of rainfall are forecast, most notably closer to
the southeast Texas coast. The heaviest rainfall rates will track
over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico come Tuesday morning as
the upper-low weakens and becomes absorbed into the broader flow
to the north. Remnant scattered showers and thunderstorms remain
possible along the central Gulf Coast on Tuesday.

A Pacific storm system that brought periods of snow to parts of
the northern Rockies is racing east this afternoon across the
southern Canadian Prairies. This area of low pressure will deepen
quite a bit as it moves across southern Canada today, leading to
treacherous snow and ice accumulations for parts of the northern
Plains. Winter Storm Warnings have been posted for eastern North
Dakota and northwest Minnesota through Tuesday morning due to the
concerns for potential impacts from blowing snow and icy travel
conditions. Meanwhile, high winds combined with above normal
temperatures and dry conditions have prompted the issuance of a
Critical Risk for fire weather in parts of the central Plains.
High Wind Warnings are also in effect for northern Montana,
southeast Wyoming, the higher elevations of northern Colorado,
western Nebraska, and most of the Dakotas.

Confidence is growing in the formation of a major winter storm
that is set to bring disruptive snow and ice accumulations from
the Rockies and the Heartland to the Great Lakes Tuesday night
into Wednesday. Latest snowfall forecasts suggest up to a foot or
more of snow is possible in the higher elevations of Colorado and
New Mexico. Farther east, highest probabilities for totals
exceeding 4 inches span from eastern Kansas to the Lower Great
Lakes. Where colder subfreezing surface temperatures ensue and
warm southerly flow aloft overruns the Arctic cold front racing
south, an icy mix of sleet and freezing rain is expected to occur.
This includes a swath of the central Plains, the Middle
Mississippi Valley, and into eastern Corn Belt. Places as far
south as North Texas could also receive hazardous ice and snow
accumulations. The threat for heavy snow and treacherous icing
will last into Thursday but uncertainty remains in how long
certain locations stay snow or wintry mix longer, which could
still result in changes to the snowfall and ice accumulation
forecasts. Residents under Winter Storm Watches should continue to
monitor the forecast closely for any additional updates as
significant disruptions to travel (both by air and by ground) are
anticipated in these affected regions Wednesday into Thursday. In
the storm's warm sector, periods of rain are anticipated
throughout much the Mid-South on Wednesday. On the backside of the
winter storm, bitterly cold temperatures will result in the
arrival of some of the coldest temperatures observed so far this
winter for the southern Plains the second half of the week.

...Heavy rainfall likely from the central Gulf Coast through
Tennessee Valley on Thursday, with a significant winter storm from
the Midwest to Great Lakes and interior Northeast...


...Overview...

Expect a positively tilted mean trough aloft to prevail across
much of the CONUS through the medium range period, as strong upper
ridging builds over the eastern Pacific (periodically extending
into parts of the West) while a strong western Atlantic ridge
gradually weakens/moves eastward. The most confident part of the
forecast involves the combination of a Rockies shortwave and
northern stream flow that will drive a potent and wavy cold front
through the eastern U.S. Thursday-Friday, bringing widespread
heavy rain to the South and a potentially significant winter storm
from the Ohio Valley to the interior Northeast. After Friday there
is greater uncertainty over details of additional shortwaves
dropping down the east side of the ridge in the West, and maybe
energy lingering from the first shortwave, plus the influence of
northern stream flow (supporting a series of northern tier waves).
Details of these features and their possible interaction will
determine how much precipitation may fall over parts of the East
from the weekend into the start of next week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

A general blend of 00Z/06Z model guidance provided a good
representation of consensus for days 3-4 Thursday-Friday, with the
only adjustments from continuity being typical run-to-run detail
changes. In this time frame, frontal waves over the East should
consolidate into a single low that ultimately tracks away from New
England while a weak wave and frontal system reach the northern
tier.

After Friday the past 12 hours of GFS runs have trended noticeably
sharper and slower with shortwave energy coming into western North
America, with the GFS continuing to be slower than consensus
(including the GEFS mean) for northern stream flow through the
rest of the period. This difference causes the GFS to be slower
(and in the 06Z run, quite suppressed) with the next northern tier
system and then to lower surface pressures more over the East with
much broader coverage of precipitation. There is some agreement on
low pressure developing off the East Coast by next Monday though.
Meanwhile there is a general signal for incoming western U.S.
energy to drop into a trough/upper low near the western half of
the U.S.-Mexico border, with low confidence in details given the
small scale of the potential upper low. By day 7 Monday the
GEFS/ECMWF means provide a good intermediate solution for a
shortwave that may approach the Pacific Northwest, weaker than the
00Z ECMWF but better defined/slower than some GFS runs. Based on
these considerations, the updated forecast based on guidance
through the 06Z cycle lowered GFS weight starting day 5 Saturday
and increased 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean input so that models and
means had equal weight by day 7 Monday. The new 12Z ECMWF provides
some added intrigue, with partial trends in the GFS direction for
northern stream flow while keeping weekend into Monday shortwave
energy more phased (eliminating the compact closed low dropping
into the Southwest).


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Amplified trough emerging from the Southwest on Thursday and
leading wavy cold front will continue the threat for heavy
rainfall and a significant winter storm to the north into the
Thursday-Friday time period. Ample Gulf moisture streaming
northward ahead of the upper trough and associated surface cold
front will promote widespread moderate to heavy precipitation from
the lower Mississippi Valley into the Northeast. Best chance for
heavy rainfall extends from the central Gulf Coast into Ohio
Valley on Thursday then extending into the southern/central
Appalachians and interior East. The overall pattern continues to
support a threat for excessive rainfall/flash flooding. Although
plenty of uncertainties in the details linger, models seem to be
gravitating toward the idea of the greatest threat being from the
central Gulf Coast into the Tennessee Valley where anomalous
precipitable water values, lift enhanced by favorable upper jet
dynamics, and moderate instability should support several inches
of rainfall across this region.

On there north side of the precipitation shield, the threat for a
significant winter storm into parts of the Ohio Valley/Great
Lakes/interior Northeast will continue from the short range
period. Heavy accumulating snow is likely, while possible
impactful sleet and freezing rain just to the south within the
transition zone between the rain to the south and snow to the
north. Exact amounts of any wintry precipitation remain highly
dependent on the lower-confidence details of ejecting shortwave
energy, frontal waves, and timing of colder temperatures.

Elsewhere, northern tier systems may produce a couple episodes of
light and scattered snowfall. Mostly light rain/mountain snow
should accompany a couple systems brushing the Pacific Northwest
and possibly extending into the northern Rockies. Significant
guidance differences with separate streams of energy aloft lead to
low confidence in the coverage and amounts of precipitation over
the South and East from the weekend into the start of next week.
Some precipitation type issues may come into play depending on how
far north the moisture shield extends.

Areas ahead of the eastern U.S. cold front will see above average
temperatures Thursday-Friday, with plus 10-15F anomalies for highs
and up to plus 20-30F anomalies for morning lows. Arctic high
pressure diving into the central U.S. behind the cold front will
bring very cold temperatures to the Central U.S. and Midwest after
midweek. On Thursday-Friday expect widespread daytime highs (and
slightly less extreme overnight lows) as much as 10-25 degrees
below average with values as much as 30-35 below normal over parts
of Oklahoma/Texas/eastern New Mexico on Thursday. During the
weekend a modified form of this cold air will reach portions of
the East while the southern Plains gradually moderate but remain
well below normal. Meanwhile the pattern will favor above normal
temperatures over the northern Plains Saturday-Monday with some
areas seeing one or more days of plus 10-20F anomalies. The West
Coast states should be near normal into weekend, trending slightly
warmer the rest of the period owing to amplified ridging across
the East Pacific.

30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR FEBRUARY 2022

The updated temperature and precipitation outlooks for February 2022 reflec=
t
recent dynamical model guidance from the GEFS and CFSv2, as well as current
WPC
week 1 outlooks and the CPC week 2 and week 3-4 outlooks. The Madden-Julian
Oscillation (MJO) is currently inactive. However the NCEP GEFS forecasts
indicate possible emerging MJO activity over the Indian Ocean and progressi=
on
across the Maritime Continent into the Western Pacific in the second week o=
f
February. An active MJO over the Maritime Continent could reinforce La Ni=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
impacts. Persistent La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions over the Tropical P=
acific Ocean
continue
to play a role in predicted climate conditions for North America. Short ran=
ge
dynamical model forecasts from the NCEP GEFS predict an increasingly positi=
ve
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the first two weeks of February, impact=
ing
the temperature outlook in week 2. Land surface soil moisture conditions we=
re
also consulted for the updated February outlook.



The temperature outlook for February indicates increased chances of below
normal temperatures for northern areas of the Pacific Northwest and Rocky
Mountains into parts of the Northern Plains and western Great Lakes region,
reflecting WPC temperature outlooks for the first week of the month, as wel=
l
as
a consolidation of GEFS and CFSv2 temperature forecasts for weeks 1 through=
 4.
Possible below normal temperatures for parts of the Northern Tier are
reinforced by the CPC Week 3-4 Outlook, as well as canonical La Ni=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDa impacts.
A
large area of equal chances of above, near and below normal temperatures fo=
r
much of the Central Plains, as far south as northern Texas, is predicted as=
 a
result of forecasts of below normal temperatures in the first week of Febru=
ary
followed by likely above normal temperatures by week 2, and weaker signals
later in the month. Above normal temperatures are favored in the February
Outlook for Central and Southern California and the Southwest, supported by
consolidated dynamical model forecasts indicating increased chances of abov=
e
normal temperatures following likely below normal temperatures at the start=
 of
the month. Above normal temperatures are favored from the Gulf Coast region
northeast to eastern areas of the Midwest and eastward to the Atlantic Coas=
t,
reflecting temperature forecasts for early in the month, potentially
associated
with a positive NAO, and further supported by CFSv2 guidance for February.
Inconsistencies in temperature tools for Alaska lead to most areas being
forecast as equal chances of above, near and below normal temperatures. Abo=
ve
normal temperatures are favored for the North Slope, supported by the CFSv2
February forecast and decadal temperature trends. Below normal temperatures
are
favored for extreme southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle,
consistent with a canonical La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa pattern and the Week 3=
-4 Outlook.



The precipitation outlook for February reflects the latest guidance for the
month of February, with additional weight given to the first week of the mo=
nth
due to greater skill relative to longer leads. The outlook is consistent wi=
th
canonical La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa patterns in most regions with the except=

indication
of equal chances of above and below normal precipitation for much of the Gu=

Coast region, where a consolidation of dynamical model forecasts slightly
favors above normal precipitation, primarily due to precipitation early in =

month, and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts favor below normal. Above norma=
l precipitation is
favored from the Northern Rockies into parts of the Northern Plains,
consistent
with precipitation tools and outlooks for weeks 1 through 4. Above normal
precipitation is favored from parts East Texas northeastward across much of
the
Midwest into western areas of the Northeast, supported by the precipitation
outlooks for the first week of February and in part by the Week 3-4 Outlook=
.
Probabilities for below normal precipitation are increased for much of
California and across the Southwest, consistent with outlooks throughout th=
e
month and CFSv2 forecasts. Below normal precipitation continues to be favor=
ed
for the Florida Peninsula, consistent with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditi=
ons and the Week 3-
4
Outlook. Above normal precipitation is favored for northwestern Mainland
Alaska, while below normal precipitation is slightly favored for the south
coast of Mainland Alaska, supported by CFSv2 forecasts and consistent with =
La
Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions and the Week 3-4 Outlook.



------------------------ Previous Discussion Follows ----------------------=

La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions persist across the equatorial Pacific, =
with persistent
negative SST anomalies in recent weeks over much of the east-central Pacifi=
c
Ocean. Convection continues to be suppressed near the Date Line. Low-level
easterly winds are enhanced over parts of the east-central and eastern
equatorial Pacific Ocean, while upper-level westerly winds are enhanced acr=
oss
most of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The RMM-based Mad=
den
Julian Oscillation (MJO) index indicates MJO conditions have weakened, and
there is no clear MJO signal in most dynamical model forecasts. The ECMWF a=
nd
CFSv2 however forecast a potential reemergence of the active phase of the M=
JO
in the western Pacific in the next couple weeks. Though La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDa is forecasted
to persist into boreal spring, dynamical model forecasts for the next sever=
al
weeks into the beginning of February are inconsistent with a canonical La
Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
pattern. However, given uncertainty in subseasonal variability later in
February, the La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa base state and typical impacts of La=
 Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa are
reflected
in the dynamical model temperature and precipitation forecasts for February
and
play a significant role in the February temperature and precipitation
outlooks.
The February 2022 monthly temperature and precipitation outlooks are based
primarily on dynamical model forecast guidance from the North America
Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and statistical forecast guidance, including th=
e
constructed analog, canonical correlation analysis, and ENSO-OCN tools. Bot=
h
dynamical and statistical models are largely forced by persistent La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
conditions. Although La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions are expected to tr=
ansition to ENSO
neutral conditions in the late spring, February climate conditions are
expected
to be impacted by La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa. In addition, the outlooks for s=
ome areas of the
forecast domain consider current land surface soil moisture and snow cover =
and
nearby ocean surface temperatures.



The February 2022 temperature outlook favors below-normal temperatures for =
the
south coast of Alaska east of the Alaska Peninsula, southeastern Mainland
Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle, supported by dynamical model guidance fro=
m
the NMME, as well as the consolidation of statistical and dynamical
temperature
tools. Below-normal temperatures are also favored for parts of Northern
California, the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, and the northern H=
igh
Plains, consistent with canonical La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts. Statist=
ical guidance and
the
latest CFSv2 dynamical model forecasts suggest the potential for more
extensive
below-normal temperatures into the Northern Plains and Midwest region,
reflecting potential impacts of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa. The potential for=
 larger scale
below-normal temperatures into the Midwest is also associated with the
possible
reemergence of Western Pacific MJO activity. This pattern of large-scale
below-normal temperatures is inconsistent with the consolidated NMME foreca=
st,
as well as the consolidation of both statistical and dynamical model guidan=
ce,
which favor above-normal temperatures for much of the central and eastern
CONUS. The February outlook favors above-normal temperatures across much of
the
southwestern CONUS from Southern California across the Southern and Central
Rockies into the Southern and Central Plains, supported by both NMME dynami=
cal
model forecasts and the consolidation. Above-normal temperatures are favore=
d
for parts of the Lower and Central Mississippi Valley, eastern areas of the
Midwest, and the Eastern Seaboard, primarily supported by dynamical model
forecasts from the NMME. Probabilities of above-normal temperatures are
greatest, exceeding 50 percent, from parts of the Southwest along the Rio
Grande Valley and Gulf Coast to the Florida Peninsula, as well as for much =
of
the Northeast, where dynamical model forecasts are consistent. A large area=
 of
equal chances of below-, near-, and above-normal temperatures is predicted =
for
much of the Northern Plains and western Great Lakes region, where there is
inconsistency among temperature tools.



The February outlook favors above-normal precipitation for northwestern
Mainland Alaska and below-normal precipitation for the south coast of Mainl=
and
Alaska and parts of the northern Alaska Panhandle, supported by dynamical
model
forecasts and consistent with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts. Dynamical m=
odels predict
above-normal precipitation for parts of the Alaska Panhandle early in the
month, resulting in a forecast of equal chances in the February outlook.
Above-normal precipitation is favored for much of the Pacific Northwest
eastward across the Northern Rockies into the northern High Plains, consist=
ent
with most dynamical and statistical model forecasts and canonical La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
impacts. Above-normal precipitation is also likely from the Central
Mississippi
and Ohio Valleys northward across most of the Great Lakes region, following
canonical La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa patterns and the consolidation of precip=
itation forecast
tools. Below-normal precipitation is likely across the southern tier of the
CONUS, including most of the Southwest, parts of the Southern Plains, the G=
ulf
Coast, the southern Atlantic coast, and the Florida Peninsula. The February
precipitation outlook generally reflects canonical precipitation patterns d=
ue
to La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa. Equal chances of below-, near-, and above-norm=
al precipitation is
predicted where there is greater uncertainty among precipitation tools.

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level trough will amplify through the day while
impinging on the central U.S. At the surface, a cold front will
drift southward across the Plains states, accompanied by cold/wintry
conditions. Ahead of the surface cold front/lee trough, downslope
westerly winds will usher in modestly dry air into western Texas
this afternoon. However, overall weaker surface wind speeds preclude
any fire weather highlights.

...Heavy snowfall beginning to exit northern New England by the
start of the medium range period...


...Overview...

A positively tilted and reinforced mean trough aloft should hold
strong across much of the CONUS through the medium range period
(Friday-Tuesday), as strong upper riding builds over both the
western Atlantic and the eastern Pacific (and periodically
extending into parts of the west). On Friday, a shortwave moving
through the Northeast will drive a potent cold front off the East
coast, with potentially heavy wintry precip likely coming to an
end on the north side of this system. Meanwhile, the next
shortwave/possibly brief closed low will weaken as it moves over
the Southern Plains, and combine with energy to the north. This
weekend, uncertainty begins to increase over details of additional
shortwaves dropping down the east side of the ridge in the West
(with some guidance support for a Southwest closed low
Sunday-Tuesday) as well as a series of northern stream shortwaves
which should support a train of northern tier waves into early
next week. Troughing across the East by next Tuesday may induce
low pressure off the East Coast, but most guidance at this time
shows it tracking well enough east for avoid any impacts along the
coast.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

A general blend of 12z/18z model guidance from yesterday provided
a good representation of consensus for days 3-4 Friday-Saturday.
In this time frame, frontal waves along the cold front in the East
should consolidate into a single low that ultimately tracks away
from New England while a weak wave and frontal system reach the
northern tier. There remain some minor north-south differences in
cold frontal placement early Friday, but mostly just the typical
run-to-run model fluctuations. The GFS has been consistent the
past several runs in a little farther southward push of the
front/colder air, which ultimately would bring wintry
precipitation farther south into parts of the Mid-Atlantic on
Friday. The last few runs of the ECMWF (including the new 00z run
for today) has been shifting ever so slightly southward though as
well so even though the GFS seems to be a cold outlier right now,
it cannot be completely ruled out.

By this weekend, the greatest point of uncertainty continues to be
with a shortwave dropping into the Northwest and a potential break
off of southern stream energy ultimately resulting in a closed low
lingering over/near the Southwest. The GFS has been very
consistent with a much stronger/deeper closed low, while the rest
of the guidance supports a little bit more consolidation between
northern/southern stream energy through the Rockies into the
Central Plains. At this point, the GFS is a big outlier, but does
have support from some ensemble members (and older runs of the
ECMWF). WPC prefers the weaker solution as offered by the
deterministic ECMWF/CMC and ensemble means, leaning away from the
much too deep GFS.

For northern stream shortwaves/frontal waves, just mainly minor
timing differences through the weekend easily handled by a general
model blend. One point of concern is evolution/interaction of late
period northern/southern stream energy to induce surface low
development off the East Coast. The 12z/yesterday ECMWF brought
this low much closer to the East Coast than most other guidance,
but the 00z run seems to have trended farther offshore again, and
more inline with the ensemble means. Given the increasing late
period detail differences across the board, the WPC forecast
leaned fairly heavily on the ensemble means.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Troughing into the Ohio Valley/Northeast on Friday and a leading
wavy cold front through the East will continue the threat for
potentially significant snows across mainly northern New England
on Friday. There likely will be a band of moderate to heavy
sleet/freezing rain just to the south of this in the transition
zone as well, with lingering uncertainties on how far south it
extends (possibly into parts of the Mid-Atlantic). Heavy rainfall
across the South at the end of the short range period will mostly
have ended by Friday morning as the better moisture feed gets cut
off from the Gulf. Some lingering, moderately to locally heavy
showers, are still possible across parts of the Southeast along
the cold front.

Elsewhere, northern tier systems may produce a couple episodes of
light and scattered snowfall. Mostly light rain/mountain snow
should accompany a couple systems brushing the Pacific Northwest
and possibly extending into the northern Rockies. Significant
guidance differences with separate streams of energy aloft lead to
low confidence in the coverage and amounts of precipitation over
the South and East from the weekend into the start of next week.
Some precipitation type issues may come into play depending on how
far north the moisture shield extends.

Areas ahead of the eastern U.S. cold front will continue to see
above average (+10-15F) anomalies for highs, with more anomalous
overnight morning lows on Friday. Arctic high pressure settling
across the central U.S. and into the Midwest behind the front will
bring very cold temps to especially parts of the southern Plains
where daytime highs 20-25 degrees below normal are possible.
Points north and east should be slightly less extreme through
still areas of generally -10-20F highs. Temperatures should
moderate and slide eastward this weekend, with many places east of
the Plains back to near normal values by early next week. Upper
ridging trying to build across the northern/central Plains
Monday-Tuesday of next week could bring a period of much above
normal temperatures to this region. The West Coast states should
be near normal into weekend, trending slightly warmer the rest of
the period owing to amplified ridging across the East Pacific.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough will eject into the Plains states
tomorrow/Wednesday, further driving a surface cold front into the
Gulf of Mexico. Behind the cold front, cold/wintry weather is
expected across the central and southern Plains, limiting wildfire
concerns. Strong, dry offshore flow is also expected tomorrow across
southern California. While Critical meteorological surface
conditions are expected to be in place, fuels remain too moist to
support significant wildfire-spread potential, with no fire weather
highlights introduced.

...A major winter storm is expected to impact much of the central
U.S. beginning Tuesday night and continuing through Thursday
morning...

...Frigid arctic air sweeps south across Great Plains beginning
Wednesday...

An amplifying upper trough, currently barreling through the
western U.S., will be the driving force for a dangerous midweek
winter storm across the central part of the country beginning
Tuesday night. This winter storm will bring a variety of winter
weather hazards including heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain.
The upper trough will slow as it makes its way through the CONUS,
meaning that a prolonged event with several rounds of winter
weather will occur through Thursday for portions of the central
U.S. before shifting to the interior Northeast. Heavy snow is
expected over the Southern Rockies and from the south-central
Great Plains through the eastern Great Lakes and Interior
Northeast. Snowfall totals of 6 to 12 inches are expected over
parts of the Southern Rockies and Central Plains to Midwest by
Thursday morning. Locally higher totals are possible, especially
over the higher mountain elevations of the Rockies. A corridor of
heavy ice accumulation (exceeding a quarter of an inch) is likely
from Texas through the Ohio Valley. Winter Storm Watches and
Warnings are in effect for much of the area to be affected by
heavy snow and ice.

Locations impacted by snow and/or ice are expected to have
temperatures remain below freezing, and well below average, for at
least a couple days after the wintry precipitations ends thanks to
the emergence of arctic high pressure, which will descend over the
Great Plains on Wednesday. This high pressure will send very
frigid air down through the Plains between Wednesday and Friday.
High temperatures for many places across the Plains will be
between 15-25 degrees below average during this period. Moderate
to heavy rainfall may develop within the warm sector of this
dynamic system, i.e. from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
Scattered to isolated thunderstorms may develop across the central
Gulf Coast on Wednesday night. Some lingering snow showers are
possible across the Northern Rockies today. The eastern half of
the country will warm up over the next few days before the cold
front associated with the winter storm sweeps through and drops
temperatures again this weekend.

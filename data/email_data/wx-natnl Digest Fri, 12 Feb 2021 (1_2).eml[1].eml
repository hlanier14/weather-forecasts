.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CST Thu Feb 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
A relatively focused, localized area of elevated fire weather will
develop across portions of northeastern New Mexico to the west of a
stationary boundary located across the New Mexico Plains.  Though RH
values will fall to around 10% during peak heating hours, relatively
weak surface flow will exist in the vicinity which should mitigate
the overall risk.  Elsewhere, a cold, stable airmass will reside
across much of the central and eastern U.S. while onshore flow
exists along the West Coast, limiting fire-weather concerns.

...Widespread record cold temperatures over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley into early next week followed by only gradual
moderation...

...Stormy pattern will bring multiple wintry precipitation events
from coast to coast...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensembles maintain a very active synoptic pattern
through the medium range period, with a series of systems digging
into and ejecting from a long-term mean trough aloft anchored over
the contiguous U.S.  These systems will bring episodes of
rain/mountain snow from the Northwest states southeastward
(perhaps low elevation snow early in the period over the
Northwest) and then a general axis of wintry weather from the
southern High Plains through the Northeast.  The southern part of
the winter weather threat area will include sleet/freezing rain,
potentially significant over some areas.  Expect rain farther
southeastward.  In addition to the active pattern, a broad area
across the Plains and Mississippi Valley should see record cold
max/min temperatures Sunday-Tuesday.  Some locations over the
Plains could see one or more days with daytime highs of 30-45F or
so below normal and morning lows only slightly less extreme.  This
very cold air will enhance the winter weather threats.

Latest guidance generally clusters well for individual systems
through the period.  A blend of the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET and 06Z GFS
represented the prevailing majority for the first half of the
forecast and then modest inclusion of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means
accounted for typical late-period detail uncertainty.  The CMC
does not compare well to this majority in multiple respects.  The
largest-scale issue is that it is slower than other guidance with
the southern Canada upper low that should begin opening up as it
tracks just north of Lake Superior on Sunday.  This difference
leads to the CMC being much more suppressed than consensus with
the system that reaches the East by day 5 Tuesday.  Otherwise
there is still some difference in storm structure at that time,
with ECMWF/UKMET runs better developed than the GFS with a wave
that tracks the west of the Appalachians before emphasis shifts to
the wave farther east.  Thus far ECMWF runs have been more
consistent than GFS runs.  Even earlier in the period the 12Z CMC
leans to the northern side of the spread for the weak wave off the
East Coast by the latter half of the weekend.  Meanwhile the 12Z
CMC looks fast compared to other guidance for the shortwave
reaching the Northwest early next week, though the 00Z run did not
appear as extreme.  By the latter half of the period there is good
agreement in principle for the western U.S. shortwave amplifying
into the Plains/northern Mexico while low pressure develops to its
southeast.  The GFS/GEFS are characteristically a bit faster than
the CMC and ECMWF/ECMWF mean.  However the differences are minor
compared to typical spread/errors for days 6-7 forecasts.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Looking at individual systems in sequence, the system off the East
Coast to start Sunday may bring some lingering winter weather to
parts of the Northeast while a trailing wavy front may focus
locally moderate/heavy rainfall over the Southeast.  The next
system should track from the southern Rockies into the Gulf and
then into the eastern U.S. Sunday-Tuesday, accompanied by a broad
area of precipitation.  The greatest winter weather threats will
extend across the southern Rockies, the southern half of the
Plains, and continuing northeastward into the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.  Snow will fall sufficiently far into the
cold air but there will be potential for areas of significant
sleet/freezing rain to the south of the snow area from southern
parts of the Plains northeastward.  Farther south/east rain may be
locally moderate to heavy.

The following system will likely bring a couple waves of
precipitation into the Northwest and northern California during
Sunday-Monday, including the possibility of snow at fairly low
elevations over some areas in the Pacific Northwest.  The moisture
will continue southeastward through the Great Basin and Rockies,
followed by increasing coverage and intensity of precipitation
over the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into much of the
East during Wednesday-Thursday.  As upper ridging from the
Atlantic builds toward southern Florida and the upper trough heads
into the Plains/northern Mexico, combined with a more favorable
surface evolution, the system may feature a stronger flow of
moisture from the Gulf than the preceding system early in the
week.  Therefore the heavy precipitation potential will require
monitoring over the coming days.  As with the previous system,
expect a broad area of winter weather impacts from the Southern
Plains northeastward.  Yet another system should bring
rain/mountain snow to the Northwest after midweek.

There should be potential for many daily records to be broken for
both min and cold high readings over portions of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley from Sunday into Tuesday.  Within this area
there may be one or more days with temperatures of at least 30-45F
below normal.  This event may not be extreme enough for all-time
or monthly records, but could lead to some instances of the
"coldest so late in the season" distinction.  At least for parts
of the Southern Plains (represented by Oklahoma City/Dallas-Ft
Worth) a majority of the coldest events have been from around
mid-December to mid-February.  Although the central U.S. will see
moderating temperatures by mid-late week, this may involve
anomalies recovering to "only" 20-30F below normal.  Some of this
cold air will extend in modified fashion into the Ohio Valley and
vicinity, and at times farther eastward.  Temperatures in the West
will be near to moderately below normal with some variability
associated with system progression.  The extreme Southeast/Florida
will be the one area of persistent warmth, with lows in particular
expected to be well above normal most days.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 PM EST Thu Feb 11 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Feb 14 2021 - 12Z Thu Feb 18 2021

...Widespread record cold temperatures over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley into early next week followed by only gradual
moderation...

...Stormy pattern will bring multiple wintry precipitation events
from coast to coast...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensembles maintain a very active synoptic pattern
through the medium range period, with a series of systems digging
into and ejecting from a long-term mean trough aloft anchored over
the contiguous U.S.  These systems will bring episodes of
rain/mountain snow from the Northwest states southeastward
(perhaps low elevation snow early in the period over the
Northwest) and then a general axis of wintry weather from the
southern High Plains through the Northeast.  The southern part of
the winter weather threat area will include sleet/freezing rain,
potentially significant over some areas.  Expect rain farther
southeastward.  In addition to the active pattern, a broad area
across the Plains and Mississippi Valley should see record cold
max/min temperatures Sunday-Tuesday.  Some locations over the
Plains could see one or more days with daytime highs of 30-45F or
so below normal and morning lows only slightly less extreme.  This
very cold air will enhance the winter weather threats.

Latest guidance generally clusters well for individual systems
through the period.  A blend of the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET and 06Z GFS
represented the prevailing majority for the first half of the
forecast and then modest inclusion of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means
accounted for typical late-period detail uncertainty.  The CMC
does not compare well to this majority in multiple respects.  The
largest-scale issue is that it is slower than other guidance with
the southern Canada upper low that should begin opening up as it
tracks just north of Lake Superior on Sunday.  This difference
leads to the CMC being much more suppressed than consensus with
the system that reaches the East by day 5 Tuesday.  Otherwise
there is still some difference in storm structure at that time,
with ECMWF/UKMET runs better developed than the GFS with a wave
that tracks the west of the Appalachians before emphasis shifts to
the wave farther east.  Thus far ECMWF runs have been more
consistent than GFS runs.  Even earlier in the period the 12Z CMC
leans to the northern side of the spread for the weak wave off the
East Coast by the latter half of the weekend.  Meanwhile the 12Z
CMC looks fast compared to other guidance for the shortwave
reaching the Northwest early next week, though the 00Z run did not
appear as extreme.  By the latter half of the period there is good
agreement in principle for the western U.S. shortwave amplifying
into the Plains/northern Mexico while low pressure develops to its
southeast.  The GFS/GEFS are characteristically a bit faster than
the CMC and ECMWF/ECMWF mean.  However the differences are minor
compared to typical spread/errors for days 6-7 forecasts.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Looking at individual systems in sequence, the system off the East
Coast to start Sunday may bring some lingering winter weather to
parts of the Northeast while a trailing wavy front may focus
locally moderate/heavy rainfall over the Southeast.  The next
system should track from the southern Rockies into the Gulf and
then into the eastern U.S. Sunday-Tuesday, accompanied by a broad
area of precipitation.  The greatest winter weather threats will
extend across the southern Rockies, the southern half of the
Plains, and continuing northeastward into the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.  Snow will fall sufficiently far into the
cold air but there will be potential for areas of significant
sleet/freezing rain to the south of the snow area from southern
parts of the Plains northeastward.  Farther south/east rain may be
locally moderate to heavy.

The following system will likely bring a couple waves of
precipitation into the Northwest and northern California during
Sunday-Monday, including the possibility of snow at fairly low
elevations over some areas in the Pacific Northwest.  The moisture
will continue southeastward through the Great Basin and Rockies,
followed by increasing coverage and intensity of precipitation
over the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into much of the
East during Wednesday-Thursday.  As upper ridging from the
Atlantic builds toward southern Florida and the upper trough heads
into the Plains/northern Mexico, combined with a more favorable
surface evolution, the system may feature a stronger flow of
moisture from the Gulf than the preceding system early in the
week.  Therefore the heavy precipitation potential will require
monitoring over the coming days.  As with the previous system,
expect a broad area of winter weather impacts from the Southern
Plains northeastward.  Yet another system should bring
rain/mountain snow to the Northwest after midweek.

There should be potential for many daily records to be broken for
both min and cold high readings over portions of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley from Sunday into Tuesday.  Within this area
there may be one or more days with temperatures of at least 30-45F
below normal.  This event may not be extreme enough for all-time
or monthly records, but could lead to some instances of the
"coldest so late in the season" distinction.  At least for parts
of the Southern Plains (represented by Oklahoma City/Dallas-Ft
Worth) a majority of the coldest events have been from around
mid-December to mid-February.  Although the central U.S. will see
moderating temperatures by mid-late week, this may involve
anomalies recovering to "only" 20-30F below normal.  Some of this
cold air will extend in modified fashion into the Ohio Valley and
vicinity, and at times farther eastward.  Temperatures in the West
will be near to moderately below normal with some variability
associated with system progression.  The extreme Southeast/Florida
will be the one area of persistent warmth, with lows in particular
expected to be well above normal most days.

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 19 - THURSDAY FEBRUARY 25: Consistent with previous
guidance, the latest GEFS and ECMWF 500-hPa height patterns remain on track
depicting a deep amplified trough to overspread the central CONUS and eleva=
te
chances for much below normal temperatures for many parts of the country
heading into week-2. As this trough is expected to weaken and lift out, bot=
h
models continue to favor the development of ridging across the southern tie=
r
of
the CONUS to help mitigate the risk of hazardous cold temperatures east of =
the
Rockies later in the period. Farther west, both the GEFS and ECMWF week-2 m=
ean
500-hPa height fields continue to favor anomalous ridging over the northern
Pacific, with stronger negative height departures expanding throughout the
higher latitudes of western North America and into the Gulf of Alaska compa=
red
to yesterday's guidance. This recent trend is expected to be more favorable
for
enhanced onshore flow and increase the potential for heavy precipitation fo=
r
parts of western North America and the Pacific Northwest during week-2. Lat=
er
in the week-2 period, models depict the anomalous troughing to dig southwar=
d
into the northwestern CONUS, increasing concerns for hazardous cold over th=
is
part of the country towards the end of February.



By the start of week-2, the 0z and 6z GEFS continue to depict a broad area =
of
surface high pressure and anomalous cold temperatures mainly throughout the
Great Plains. However, these runs now feature a more robust area of mean lo=
w
surface pressure east of the Mississippi, with stronger northerly flow to
advect cold air into the Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys compared t=
o
yesterday's guidance. This is well reflected in the GEFS reforecast tool wh=
ich
shows at least a 40% chance that minimum temperatures fall below the 15th
percentile from the Great Lakes southward to the Gulf of Mexico, with the
highest probabilities (>60%) concentrated to the west and east along the
Mississippi River early in the period. The 0z ECMWF ensemble also favors a
stronger mean low surface pressure over the southeastern U.S to help bring
more
cold air along the Mississippi River, however, the ECMWF reforecast tool
continues to focus much of its higher probabilities (>60%) for minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile further west over the Southe=
rn
Plains and into northern Mexico. To address some of the disparities in the
high
probability coverage in the reforecast tools, a moderate risk region valid
through Feb 20, and a high risk region valid on Feb 19 for much below norma=
l
temperatures have been expanded further east and south compared to yesterda=
y's
outlook. By day 10 (Feb 21), both ensembles favor much of the surface high
pressure to begin shifting eastward, allowing for return flow to bring warm=
er
temperatures across the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley by the middle o=
f
the period. As the axis of the coldest temperatures follows the mid-level
trough lifting out over the Northeast during this time, the slight risk of
much
below normal temperatures remains posted through Feb 21 for most of the CON=
US
east of the Rockies.



Given the better agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF with a surface low
developing across the southeastern U.S. and tracking northeast early in the
period, both ensembles favor increased daily precipitation amounts tied to
this
surface low from the mid-Atlantic to the Northeast on day 8 (Feb 19). Altho=
ugh
reforecast tools remain unsupportive of precipitation exceeding hazardous
thresholds, there are increased chances for heavy snowfall to the northwest=
 of
the low's track with anomalous cold air likely in place. This heavy snow
potential is better evidenced in the latest deterministic and ensemble
guidance, and a slight risk of heavy snow is maintained over the northeaste=
rn
CONUS for Feb 19 to 20. Relative to yesterday's outlook, this slight risk a=
rea
has been expanded to include more of the Great Lakes region to account for
more
westerly solutions of the surface low in today's ensembles. As the surface =
low
is forecast to deepen in the ensembles, high surface winds are possible ove=
r
the northeastern CONUS. Reforecast guidance indicates elevated chances
sustained winds exceed the 85th percentile and 25mph early in the period an=
d a
slight risk of high winds is posted for Feb 19 to 21.



Across the Pacific Northwest, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to
favor enhanced onshore flow and increased chances for above-normal
precipitation during week-2. While both reforecast tools indicate at least =
a
20% chance for precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile
during
week-2, totals are not expected to exceed hazards criteria. However, the
combination of increased moisture and below-normal temperatures tied to
mid-level troughing predicted in the region supports a slight risk of heavy
snow mainly across the Cascades the entirety of week-2. Deterministic
solutions
suggest locally heavy daily snowfall amounts may exceed 24 inches in the
highest elevations. Additionally, strong surface pressure gradients are
evident
in the ensemble guidance, and reforecast tools maintain elevated chances fo=
r
sustained winds to exceed the 85th percentile from the Pacific Northwest in=
to
the Central Plains. However, the sustained wind values remain below hazardo=
us
thresholds, and no wind related hazards are issued.



Anomalous mid-level troughing and below-normal temperatures continues to be
favored over Alaska throughout week-2. With northerly flow expected to prev=
ail
across much of the Mainland, there is good agreement in the reforecast tool=
s
indicating at least a 20% chance for minimum temperatures falling below the
15th percentile for much of the Mainland, with increased chances of minimum
temperatures falling below -40 degrees F across the Brooks Range, North Slo=
pe,
and across the eastern Interior. A slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is posted for the entirety of week-2.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu February 11 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 17 - 21 2021

Todays model solutions are in good agreement in regard to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern across North America and adjacent ocean areas
during the 6-10 day period. Dynamical models forecast a broad long-wave 500=
-
hPa
trough across the CONUS. The manual height blend depicts negative height
anomalies for most of the CONUS. Upstream of this trough, ridging is foreca=
st
over the Northeast Pacific, favoring positive mid-level height anomalies al=
ong
the southern and central West Coast. However, models agree on de-amplified
mean
ridging over the Northeast Pacific and increased troughing over the Gulf of
Alaska, relative to yesterday's 6-10 day solutions, favoring negative mid-
level
height anomalies over most of Alaska. Above-normal mid-level geopotential
heights over the Aleutians are associated with a secondary anomalous 500-hP=
a
height maximum over the north-central Pacific. Positive 500-hPa height
anomalies are also forecast along the Atlantic Coast, associated with mean
subtropical ridging in the western Atlantic.

Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are enhanced across much of the
CONUS, consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Todays forecast
depicts 80% probabilities of below-normal temperatures over most of the
Central
and Southern Great Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley, with a small regio=
n
of
greater than 90% probabilities near the Ark-La-Tex region. Conversely, odds
tilt toward above-normal temperatures in the southern Florida Peninsula,
associated with mean return flow to the west of the Atlantic ridge. Strong
easterly-to-northeasterly flow favors elevated below-normal temperature
probabilities across most of the Alaska Mainland and eastern Aleutians.

A mean frontal boundary is favored to set up across the eastern CONUS,
increasing probabilities of above-normal precipitation across the eastern U=
.S.
A continued active storm track is favored across much of the northwestern
CONUS, coinciding with enhanced above-normal precipitation probabilities in
the
Pacific Northwest. Below-normal precipitation probabilities are increased o=
ver
parts of the southwestern CONUS on the eastern periphery of the Northeast
Pacific ridge. Elevated below-normal precipitation chances are also favored
across the Great Plains, underneath mean surface high pressure. The flip fr=
om
above-normal (yesterday) to below-normal (today) precipitation odds in the
Central Plains is related to the timing of a strong short-wave trough
propagating across that region. This short-wave is expected to amplify over
the
Lower Mississippi Valley early in the period, contributing to the above-nor=
mal
precipitation probabilities in the eastern CONUS. In Alaska, increased onsh=
ore
flow to the east of mean surface low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska favors
above-normal precipitation for the Alaska Panhandle. Below-normal
precipitation
is forecast over the western Mainland and eastern Aleutians, to the northwe=
st
of this surface low pressure.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the forecast tools and high confidence regarding
below-normal temperatures across most of the CONUS. High confidence is offs=
et
slightly by increasing uncertainty with regard to the precipitation forecas=
t,
mainly over the south-central CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 19 - 25 2021

The synoptic pattern forecast over North America during the week-2 period i=
s
similar to the 6-10 day period. Troughing is favored over much of the centr=
al
CONUS, with ridging persisting over the Northeast Pacific that extends clos=
er
to the West Coast of the CONUS, compared to the 6-10 day period. However, t=
he
long-wave pattern across much of North America has de-amplified, relative t=
o
yesterday's Week-2 forecast. Todays manual 500-hPa height blend for Week-2
depicts below-normal geopotential heights across the northern half of the
CONUS
and most of Alaska. Below-normal heights over Alaska are associated with
increased mean troughing over the Gulf of Alaska. Increased above-normal
heights are forecast for the central and southern West Coast, extending to =
the
Southwest and eastward to the western Gulf Coast. Near to above-normal
mid-level heights are predicted in the Southeast.

Predicted broad, long-wave troughing favors elevated probabilities of near =
to
below-normal temperatures for most of the CONUS, with the highest chances
across the Southern Plains and Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. Above-normal
temperature probabilities are slightly favored in the Northern Plains, with
mean flow becoming more zonal throughout the period and seasonal snowpack
remaining well below-normal. Odds also tilt toward above-normal temperature=
s
in
the Southwest and southern California, with increasing positive 500-hPa hei=
ght
anomalies during the Week-2 period. Enhanced probabilities of below-normal
temperatures are favored over much of Alaska, in association with
predominantly
easterly and northeasterly surface flow north and northwest of mean surface
low
pressure in the Gulf of Alaska.

Below-normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced across much of the
southwestern CONUS due to increased positive 500-hPa height anomalies acros=
s
the region. Enhanced probabilities of below-normal precipitation extend
eastward to the Central and Southern Plains, with mean surface high pressur=
e
favored to dominate throughout much of the period. Increased below-normal
precipitation odds are also favored along the Gulf Coast, influenced by the
de-amplification of the long-wave pattern and the mean trough lifting
northward
throughout the Week-2 period. Odds tilt toward above-normal precipitation i=
n
the Northeast, associated with a strong low pressure system exiting the Eas=
t
Coast early in the period. Increased above-normal precipitation probabiliti=
es
are favored across the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, associated w=
ith
increased onshore flow to the southeast of the Gulf of Alaska low pressure.
Above-normal precipitation probabilities extend northwestward to the Alaska
Panhandle. To the north and west of the mean surface low pressure, below-
normal
precipitation is favored for most of the Alaska Mainland.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CST Thu Feb 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
Quiescent fire-weather conditions will continue in most areas
through the D2/Fri forecast period.  An expansive area of high
pressure centered over the northern High Plains will maintain a cold
airmass across much of the central and eastern CONUS.  Meanwhile,
low pressure centered over the Great Basin will maintain an onshore
flow pattern along the West Coast.  A dry airmass will reside across
drought-stricken Arizona and New Mexico, though wind speeds only
reach the 15 mph range and RH values will not fall below 20% in most
areas.  Only locally elevated fire-weather conditions are expected
from southwestern into central New Mexico, although the limited
extent of these conditions precludes any highlights at this time.

...Significant ice storm to develop over the Mid-Atlantic and the
Central Appalachians...

...A series of winter storms will result in widespread snowfall
across the higher terrain and into the lowlands of Washington and
Oregon through Saturday...

...Bitter arctic air to remain entrenched across the central U.S.
and continue expanding south...

Bitterly cold air will engulf the Plains with temperatures 30 to
45 degrees below average.  A quasi-stationary front will remain
along the Gulf Coast and the Southeast through Saturday evening.
Moist air will overrun the front and invade the cold air mass,
aiding in snow development over parts of the Mid-Atlantic into the
Ohio Valley.  Simultaneously, areas of rain/freezing rain will
develop over parts of the southern Mid-Atlantic into the Central
Appalachians on Thursday evening into Friday evening.  Rain with
embedded thunderstorms will develop over the Southeast into parts
of the Western Gulf Coast.  On Friday evening into Saturday
evening, rain/freezing rain will develop over parts of the
Tennessee Valley and continuing over the Central Appalachians into
the southern Mid-Atlantic.  The freezing rain will lead to
hazardous travel conditions, power outages, and scattered tree
damage.

Meanwhile, the arctic air mass located over the Central U.S. will
cover a widespread area from nearly the Great Plains to the Great
Lakes.  Wind Chill Advisories and Wind Chill Warnings remain in
effect and stretch from much of the Northern Plains to the
Midwest. The light wind combined with subzero temperatures could
make it feel as cold as -50 degrees in some northern spots. This
bitter cold can be dangerous and lead to frostbite in less than 10
minutes. Be sure to plan ahead and dress appropriately if spending
time outdoors.

Impactful winter weather is also a possibility across the Pacific
Northwest, lasting through Saturday.  A low-pressure system is
forecast to enter southern Oregon this evening while
simultaneously interacting with very cold air draining into the
region. This combination may lead to heavy snow across the typical
mountainous locations but in the lowlands. Significant snowfall
accumulation will be possible in both Portland and Seattle.
Rain/freezing rain could be another threat in lower elevations of
northwestern Oregon in particular.  Snow and mixed precipitation
are expected to spread across much of the Great Basin and into the
Rockies as well.  This snow will expand onto the Central Plains
into parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley. Lake effect snow will
impact most of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, while upper-level
dynamics will contribute to snow developing across the rest of
Michigan.

...Widespread record cold temperatures over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley into early next week followed by only gradual
moderation...

...Stormy pattern will bring multiple wintry precipitation events
from coast to coast...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensembles maintain a very active synoptic pattern
through the medium range period, with a series of systems digging
into and ejecting from a long-term mean trough aloft anchored over
the contiguous U.S.  These systems will bring episodes of
rain/mountain snow from the Northwest states southeastward
(perhaps low elevation snow early in the period over the
Northwest) and then a general axis of wintry weather from the
southern High Plains through the Northeast.  The southern part of
the winter weather threat area will include sleet/freezing rain,
potentially significant over some areas.  Expect rain farther
southeastward.  In addition to the active pattern, a broad area
across the Plains and Mississippi Valley should see record cold
max/min temperatures Sunday-Tuesday.  Some locations over the
Plains could see one or more days with daytime highs of 30-45F or
so below normal and morning lows only slightly less extreme.  This
very cold air will enhance the winter weather threats.

Latest guidance generally clusters well for individual systems
through the period.  A blend of the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET and 06Z GFS
represented the prevailing majority for the first half of the
forecast and then modest inclusion of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means
accounted for typical late-period detail uncertainty.  The CMC
does not compare well to this majority in multiple respects.  The
largest-scale issue is that it is slower than other guidance with
the southern Canada upper low that should begin opening up as it
tracks just north of Lake Superior on Sunday.  This difference
leads to the CMC being much more suppressed than consensus with
the system that reaches the East by day 5 Tuesday.  Otherwise
there is still some difference in storm structure at that time,
with ECMWF/UKMET runs better developed than the GFS with a wave
that tracks the west of the Appalachians before emphasis shifts to
the wave farther east.  Thus far ECMWF runs have been more
consistent than GFS runs.  Even earlier in the period the 12Z CMC
leans to the northern side of the spread for the weak wave off the
East Coast by the latter half of the weekend.  Meanwhile the 12Z
CMC looks fast compared to other guidance for the shortwave
reaching the Northwest early next week, though the 00Z run did not
appear as extreme.  By the latter half of the period there is good
agreement in principle for the western U.S. shortwave amplifying
into the Plains/northern Mexico while low pressure develops to its
southeast.  The GFS/GEFS are characteristically a bit faster than
the CMC and ECMWF/ECMWF mean.  However the differences are minor
compared to typical spread/errors for days 6-7 forecasts.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Looking at individual systems in sequence, the system off the East
Coast to start Sunday may bring some lingering winter weather to
parts of the Northeast while a trailing wavy front may focus
locally moderate/heavy rainfall over the Southeast.  The next
system should track from the southern Rockies into the Gulf and
then into the eastern U.S. Sunday-Tuesday, accompanied by a broad
area of precipitation.  The greatest winter weather threats will
extend across the southern Rockies, the southern half of the
Plains, and continuing northeastward into the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.  Snow will fall sufficiently far into the
cold air but there will be potential for areas of significant
sleet/freezing rain to the south of the snow area from southern
parts of the Plains northeastward.  Farther south/east rain may be
locally moderate to heavy.

The following system will likely bring a couple waves of
precipitation into the Northwest and northern California during
Sunday-Monday, including the possibility of snow at fairly low
elevations over some areas in the Pacific Northwest.  The moisture
will continue southeastward through the Great Basin and Rockies,
followed by increasing coverage and intensity of precipitation
over the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into much of the
East during Wednesday-Thursday.  As upper ridging from the
Atlantic builds toward southern Florida and the upper trough heads
into the Plains/northern Mexico, combined with a more favorable
surface evolution, the system may feature a stronger flow of
moisture from the Gulf than the preceding system early in the
week.  Therefore the heavy precipitation potential will require
monitoring over the coming days.  As with the previous system,
expect a broad area of winter weather impacts from the Southern
Plains northeastward.  Yet another system should bring
rain/mountain snow to the Northwest after midweek.

There should be potential for many daily records to be broken for
both min and cold high readings over portions of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley from Sunday into Tuesday.  Within this area
there may be one or more days with temperatures of at least 30-45F
below normal.  This event may not be extreme enough for all-time
or monthly records, but could lead to some instances of the
"coldest so late in the season" distinction.  At least for parts
of the Southern Plains (represented by Oklahoma City/Dallas-Ft
Worth) a majority of the coldest events have been from around
mid-December to mid-February.  Although the central U.S. will see
moderating temperatures by mid-late week, this may involve
anomalies recovering to "only" 20-30F below normal.  Some of this
cold air will extend in modified fashion into the Ohio Valley and
vicinity, and at times farther eastward.  Temperatures in the West
will be near to moderately below normal with some variability
associated with system progression.  The extreme Southeast/Florida
will be the one area of persistent warmth, with lows in particular
expected to be well above normal most days.

vicinity, and at times farther eastward.  Temperatures in the West
will be near to moderately below normal with some variability
associated with system progression.  The extreme Southeast/Florida
will be the one area of persistent warmth, with lows in particular
expected to be well above normal most days.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1249 AM CST Fri Feb 12 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
With a 1040+ mb surface high expected to be entrenched in the
northern and central Plains, very cold temperatures east of the
Divide will greatly limit fire weather concerns today. An
upper-level trough will move into the Southwest and bring a Pacific
cold front eastward. Ahead of the front and to the west of the cold
Plains' air, locally elevated conditions are possible in parts of
southern Arizona and New Mexico. Fuels remain dry under drought
conditions, but RH in most areas is unlikely to drop below critical
thresholds given the mid/upper-level clouds expected.

...Widespread record cold temperatures over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley into early next week followed by only gradual
moderation...

...Stormy pattern will bring multiple wintry precipitation events
from coast to coast, with heavy rainfall potential across parts of
the East late next week...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensembles maintain a very active synoptic pattern
through much of the medium range period, with a series of systems
digging into and ejecting from a long-term mean trough aloft
anchored over the contiguous U.S.. These systems will bring
periods of active weather for the Western states, as well as parts
of the Southern Plains to the Northeast. Across the Plains and
into the Mississippi Valley, record cold is likely through at
least mid-week. By late next week, models seem to indicate mean
troughing progressing eastward while upper level ridging tries to
build again over the central part of the country.

The latest guidance does continue to generally cluster well for
individual systems through the period. There are some minor timing
differences with shortwave energy exiting the Northeast around
Tuesday-Wednesday which of course has implications for placement
of a surface low off the coast. A general model blend though gave
a good middle ground solution. Concerning the next shortwave to
drop through the West mid next week, the CMC is more
amplified/slower than the rest of the guidance on this shortwave
as it moves into the Southern Plains, while the GFS/ECMWF and
ensemble means are a bit more progressive. Although, differences
are pretty minor at least compared to typical spread in the day
6-7 time frame.

The blend for this cycle of the WPC medium range forecast used the
deterministic models (GFS/ECMWF/UKMET) for days 3-4, with modest
inclusion of the ensemble means beyond that to account for the
typical late-period detail uncertainty. This helps to maintain
good continuity with the previous shift.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The period starts out with a surface low tracking from the Gulf
into the Eastern U.S. Monday-Tuesday accompanied by a broad area
of precipitation. The greatest winter weather threats will extend
from the lower Mississippi Valley, across the Ohio Valley, and
into the Northeast. Snow will fall sufficiently far into the cold
air, but there will be potential for areas of significant
sleet/freezing rain south of the snow area. Farther south/east
across the Tennessee Valley/Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic, rain
may be locally moderate to heavy at times.

The next system into the Northwest early next week should bring a
couple of waves of precipitation into the Pacific
Northwest/northern California with snow mainly confined to the
mountains. The moisture will continue southeastward through the
Great Basin and the Rockies, followed by increasing coverage and
intensity of precipitation over the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley into the East from Wednesday to Friday. As
upper ridging from the Atlantic builds toward southern Florida and
the upper trough heads into the Plains/northern Mexico, combined
with a more favorable surface evolution, the system may feature a
stronger flow of moisture from the Gulf than the preceding system
early in the week. Therefore the heavy precipitation potential
will require monitoring over the coming days. As with the previous
system, expect a broad area of winter weather impacts from the
Southern Plains northeastward. Yet another system should bring
rain/mountain snow to the Northwest after midweek.

There should be potential for many daily records to be broken for
both min and cold high readings over portions of the Plains and
lower/mid Mississippi Valley into Tuesday with temperatures of at
least 30-45F below normal. Although the central U.S. will see
moderating temperatures by mid-late week, this may involve
anomalies recovering to "only" 20-30F below normal. Some of this
cold air will extend in modified fashion into the Ohio Valley and
vicinity, and at times farther eastward. Temperatures in the West
will be near to moderately below normal with some variability
associated with system progression. The extreme Southeast/Florida
will be the one area of persistent warmth, with lows in particular
expected to be well above normal most days. Though by day
7/Friday, below normal temps may begin to creep into the Sunshine
State.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Another upper-level trough will deepen and approach the Four Corners
on Saturday. Cold air will remain east of the Divide. While some
areas of Southwest may remain dry and marginally breezy, slightly
cooler temperatures than Friday and continued possibility of
mid/high clouds should keep fire concerns low. No fire weather
concerns are expected elsewhere across the country.

...Steadfast dome of Frigid Arctic air to remain entrenched across
the central U.S. and continue expanding south...

...A series of winter storms to result in heavy snow accumulations
from the Northwest to the Midwest this weekend...

...Icy conditions possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley to
the Mid-Atlantic, showers and thunderstorms in the Southeast...

A strong area of high pressure has an icy grip on much of the
northern tier of the Lower 48 as an intrusion of Arctic air races
south into the Southern Plains. Sub-zero high temperatures are on
tap in the northern Rockies and High Plains with some areas seeing
morning lows both Friday and Saturday morning between -20 and -30
degrees. Daily temperature departures in the North Central U.S.
will range between 30 to 40 degrees below normal. In addition,
wind chills remain dangerously cold wind chills between -40 and
-55 degrees refuse to back down across the Northern Plains. Wind
Chill Advisories extend as far south as Oklahoma with wind chills
as low as -10 degrees possible through Saturday. The Pacific
Northwest will also contend with bitterly cold temperatures as
some locations challenge daily record cold max temperatures today.
In fact, much of the central U.S. from the Dakotas to Texas could
witness many broken daily record low max temperatures through the
upcoming weekend.

The expansive dome of sub-freezing temperatures across the
northern tier of the country has laid the foundation for winter
storms to wreak havoc from coast-to-coast not only going into this
weekend, but also into next week. Today, periods of snow will
blanket portions of the Northwest, the Intermountain West, and
Midwest. The heaviest snowfall is anticipated in the Cascades,
Tetons, and Colorado Rockies with accumulations over a foot
possible. While lesser totals would occurs in parts of the
Northwest and central Plains, totals of 3 to 6 inches could lead
to hazardous travel conditions. This has resulted in the issuance
of Winter Weather Advisories in these areas. By Saturday, a
Pacific storm system slamming into the Pacific Northwest generates
heavy snow and ice accumulations from Portland to Seattle. Pacific
moisture out ahead of the storm system reaches the Sierra Nevada,
Great Basin, and Intermountain West where periods of heavy
mountain snow are likely. Travel will be. limited in these areas
into the upcoming weekend both by ground and air

In the East, a quasi-stationary front with waves of low pressure
along them will lead to areas of showers along the Gulf Coast and
in the Southeast. Farther north, precipitation is forecast to fall
in the form snow or a wintry mix over parts of the Mid-Atlantic.
Light ice accumulations in parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley
and the Piedmont of northern North Carolina and southern Virginia
could lead to slick travel conditions this morning. By Saturday, a
more consolidated area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico
directs its rich moisture source northeast towards the
Mid-Atlantic. In the warm sector, scattered showers and
thunderstorms will engulf much of the Southeast. A few
thunderstorms could be severe at times over northern Florida. As
the precipitation shield overruns sub-freezing air at the surface
in the northern Mid-Atlantic, a wintry mix of snow/sleet/freezing
rain will make for potentially treacherous travel conditions
Saturday afternoon. Ice accumulations on the order of a tenth to
as much as a quarter inch of ice are possible through Saturday
evening

...Steadfast dome of Frigid Arctic air to remain entrenched across
the central U.S. and continue expanding south...

...A series of winter storms to result in heavy snow accumulations
from the Northwest to the Midwest this weekend...

...Icy conditions possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley to
the Mid-Atlantic, showers and thunderstorms in the Southeast...

A strong area of high pressure has an icy grip on much of the
northern tier of the Lower 48 as an intrusion of Arctic air races
south into the Southern Plains. Sub-zero high temperatures are on
tap in the northern Rockies and High Plains with some areas seeing
morning lows both Friday and Saturday morning between -20 and -30
degrees. Daily temperature departures in the North Central U.S.
will range between 30 to 40 degrees below normal. In addition,
wind chills remain dangerously cold wind chills between -40 and
-55 degrees refuse to back down across the Northern Plains. Wind
Chill Advisories extend as far south as Oklahoma with wind chills
as low as -10 degrees possible through Saturday. The Pacific
Northwest will also contend with bitterly cold temperatures as
some locations challenge daily record cold max temperatures today.
In fact, much of the central U.S. from the Dakotas to Texas could
witness many broken daily record low max temperatures through the
upcoming weekend.

The expansive dome of sub-freezing temperatures across the
northern tier of the country has laid the foundation for winter
storms to wreak havoc from coast-to-coast not only going into this
weekend, but also into next week. Today, periods of snow will
blanket portions of the Northwest, the Intermountain West, and
Midwest. The heaviest snowfall is anticipated in the Cascades,
Tetons, and Colorado Rockies with accumulations over a foot
possible. While lesser totals would occurs in parts of the
Northwest and central Plains, totals of 3 to 6 inches could lead
to hazardous travel conditions. This has resulted in the issuance
of Winter Weather Advisories in these areas. By Saturday, a
Pacific storm system slamming into the Pacific Northwest generates
heavy snow and ice accumulations from Portland to Seattle. Pacific
moisture out ahead of the storm system reaches the Sierra Nevada,
Great Basin, and Intermountain West where periods of heavy
mountain snow are likely. Hazardous travel conditions by both
ground and air are expected in these areas into the upcoming
weekend.

In the East, a quasi-stationary front with waves of low pressure
along them produces areas of showers along the Gulf Coast and in
the Southeast. Farther north, precipitation is forecast to fall in
the form snow or a wintry mix over parts of the Mid-Atlantic.
Light ice accumulations in parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley
and the Piedmont of northern North Carolina and southern Virginia
could lead to slick travel conditions this morning. By Saturday, a
more consolidated area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico
directs its rich moisture source northeast towards the
Mid-Atlantic. In the warm sector, scattered showers and
thunderstorms will engulf much of the Southeast. A few
thunderstorms could be severe at times over northern Florida. As
the precipitation shield overruns sub-freezing air at the surface
in the northern Mid-Atlantic, a wintry mix of snow/sleet/freezing
rain will make for potentially treacherous travel conditions
Saturday afternoon. Ice accumulations on the order of a tenth to
as much as a quarter inch of ice are possible through Saturday
evening

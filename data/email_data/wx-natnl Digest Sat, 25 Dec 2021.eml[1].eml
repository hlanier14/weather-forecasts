Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1043 AM CST Fri Dec 24 2021

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST
TEXAS...SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO NORTHWEST INTO SOUTHWEST OKLAHOMA...

The Critical area was shifted slightly northwest to include portions
of southeast New Mexico and expanded to the northeast into southwest
Oklahoma. The Elevated area was trimmed a bit on the southeast side
and expanded to the northeast into north-central Oklahoma and
south-central Kansas.

Low-level moisture pushed a bit farther northwest across Texas than
originally expected, with relative humidity percentages at or above
50 percent across northwest Texas. However, a pronounced dry surge
is noted from southwest Texas into southwest Oklahoma, and to a
lesser extent into south-central Kansas, where relative humidity
percentages in the low 20s already exist across portions of the
Critical area. The relative humidity should continue to fall across
this region with continued adiabatic warming this afternoon due to
downsloping winds.

Farther northwest, across the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles into
southwest Kansas, strong winds are already evident with winds in
excess of 30 mph and gusts over 50 mph over portions of the area.
However, relative humidity percentages are in the upper 20s to low
30s and will struggle to fall much lower given high-level
cloudiness, the low sun angle, and shorter daylight hours as
compared to early Spring. As such, considerations for a Critical
area were entertained, but ultimately no area was added. However,
given the strong flow and dry fuels, any fire that does start may
pose greater resistance to control than typically expected in an
Elevated area.

..Marsh.. 12/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CST Fri Dec 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early-morning water vapor imagery shows an upper-level wave digging
southeastward towards southern California. While this feature is
bringing widespread precipitation west of the Rockies, it will also
support a deepening surface low over the central Plains. The
resulting increase in southwesterly winds will drive a fire weather
threat for portions of the southern High Plains where conditions
remain dry and little to no precipitation is expected.

...West Texas...
Surface observations across west/southwest TX and southeast NM show
a pocket of reduced moisture (denoted by dewpoints in the teens and
RH values in the teens to low 20s) from west TX into southeast NM.
While coarser guidance has struggled to assimilate this dry pocket,
recent hi-res solutions seem to capture this feature well and advect
the air mass northeastward across west TX this afternoon. As a
result, latest NBM ensemble guidance has trended towards higher
probabilities of RH values between 15-20%. Although this is still
marginal RH for some locations, the combination of critically dry
fuels (ERC values near or above the 90th percentile) and high
confidence in 20-25 mph sustained winds (gusting to 30-40 mph)
warrant a Critical risk area to delineate the corridor of the
driest/windiest conditions.

Further to the northwest across the TX Panhandle, guidance continues
to show a swath of stronger sustained winds near 30 mph. Confidence
in RH values falling to near critical thresholds remains low due to
recent dewpoint observations in the mid 20s and low ensemble
probabilities for sub-20% RH. Despite this mitigating factor, the
strong winds coupled with receptive fuels will still support a
robust fire weather threat. Conditions will continue to be
monitored, and an expansion of the Critical risk area may be
warranted if observations trend towards drier solutions.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes have been made to the ongoing forecast.

Locally elevated conditions will be possible across much of the
central and southern High Plains. However, confidence in identifying
specific corridors where strong, gusty surface winds will overlap
with sub-20 percent relative humidity is too low to introduce
elevated areas with this forecast. Please see below for additional
meteorological discussion.

..Marsh.. 12/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0207 AM CST Fri Dec 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow will prevail across the central CONUS for Christmas day,
which will allow for westerly downslope winds off the central and
southern Rockies to overspread into the High Plains. While fuels
along the High Plains remain receptive, forecast uncertainty limits
confidence in the location and coverage of any fire weather threats.

...southern High Plains...
Breezy downslope winds between 15-20 mph appear probable across
parts of eastern NM and western TX Saturday afternoon. However,
ensemble guidance and deterministic solutions show notable variance
in the windiest corridors and coverage of 20+ mph winds.
Furthermore, considerable spread is also noted in the RH forecast
with more aggressive solutions hinting at 15-25% RH possible. Given
receptive fuels already in place, an Elevated risk area may be
introduced in subsequent updates once confidence in forecast details
improves.

...Central High Plains/Nebraska...
Fire weather concerns are also possible across northeast CO into
southeast WY and the NE Panhandle. Downslope winds near 20 mph
appear likely per latest ensemble guidance, and drier solutions and
bias-corrected ensemble means suggest RH values near 20% are
possible. With ERCs near seasonal record values, a fire weather
threat may emerge Saturday afternoon. However, cool temperatures
filtering into the region combined with light rain chances early
Saturday introduce enough uncertainty to preclude highlights at this
time.

FOR SATURDAY JANUARY 01 - FRIDAY JANUARY 07: This morning's runs of the ECM=
WF
and GEFS ensemble 500-hPa height forecasts are advertising more of a
progressive pattern by the outset of the New Year. Much of the anomalous
mid-level troughing forecast during week-1 across the north-central CONUS i=
s
favored to shift eastward into the Great Lakes and northeastern CONUS, with
anomalous ridging breaking down across the southeastern CONUS early in the
period. However, there is good agreement between the GEFS and the ECMWF
ensembles that the weakening of this latter feature is temporary, as positi=
ve
mid-level height departures are favored to redevelop throughout the
southeastern CONUS by day 10 (Jan 3). During this time, anomalous mid-level
ridging also looks to become more amplified over the Bering Sea and through=
out
the northern Pacific, with increasing negative height departures overspread=
ing
western North America downstream, consistent with a negative Pacific North
American (PNA) pattern. Given the predicted evolution of the mid-level
pattern,
hazard potential looks to increase across many parts of the West and
north-central CONUS later in week-2.



During the first few days of the period, predominant northwesterly flow and
anomalously cold temperatures are anticipated to be in place across much of
western and north-central CONUS. A moderate risk for much below normal
temperatures remains issued early in the period (Jan 1-2) where reforecast
tools continue to show at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures fallin=
g
below the 15th percentile. Relative to previous guidance, however, both the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools no longer indicate elevated probabilities i=
n
excess of 60% for minimum temperatures meeting this criteria, and the
corresponding high risk region is removed across the northwestern and
north-central CONUS in today's outlook. By day 10 (Jan 3), both reforecast
tools indicate a reduction of the elevated cold signals (>40%) throughout t=
he
region, followed by a reemergence of these signals later in the period like=
ly
tied to the favored re-strengthening of negative height departures across t=
he
West. This supports the designation of the moderate risk for much below nor=
mal
temperatures to also be valid later in week-2 from Jan 5 to Jan 7. A slight
risk of much below normal temperatures remains is posted for the entirety o=
f
week-2 over the western third and north-central CONUS where there is at lea=
st
a
20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below 15th percentile in the
reforecast guidance.



The prevailing mid-level troughing across the West is also expected to supp=
ort
above-normal precipitation over the western half of the CONUS throughout
week-2. Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to favor surface low
formation in the eastern Pacific to provide another period of enhanced and
possibly heavy precipitation over the West Coast during the middle of the
period. Reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitat=
ion
amounts exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 (2) inch(es) over northern
California (Pacific Northwest), supporting a slight risk of heavy
precipitation
for the region from Jan 3 to Jan 7. With anomalously cold air favored to be=
 in
place, the predicted increase in moisture also supports the continuation of=
 a
slight risk of heavy snow over the higher elevations of California and the
Pacific Northwest from Jan 3 to Jan 7. Relative to yesterday, wetter soluti=
ons
are evident in the raw ensembles and reforecast guidance across the Norther=
n
Rockies by the middle of the period, prompting the addition of a slight ris=
k
of
heavy snow over the Bitterroot Mountains (Jan 3-7). Farther south, a slight
risk of heavy snow remains issued over the Four Corners region for the
entirety
of week-2 where reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of 3-day liquid
equivalent accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile throughout the perio=
d.
Additionally, periods of strong surface pressure gradients are indicated by
both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles during week-2 and reforecast tools depict=
 a
broad region with at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th
percentile over the Great Plains and many areas throughout the West. Thus, =
a
slight risk of high winds remains issued for much of the western and centra=
l
CONUS for week-2.



East of the Mississippi, the aforementioned mid-level troughing shifting
eastward early in the period is likely to induce surface low development an=
d
frontal activity tracking across the eastern CONUS. With return flow favore=
d
along the western periphery of surface high pressure over the western
Atlantic,
this increases the potential for heavy precipitation over parts of the Lowe=
r
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio River Valleys, and the Southeast. Here, the=
re
is good agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicating at
least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th
percentile
and 1 inch, supporting a slight risk of heavy precipitation from Jan 1 to J=
an
2. As the surface low is then forecast to track eastward over the Atlantic,
surface high pressure is anticipated to build behind the front across the
East,
with northerly flow focused over the Northeast by Day 10 (Jan 3). The
advection
of anomalous cold air is evident in the reforecast guidance, depicting
increased chances of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile=
 to
support the addition of a slight risk of much below normal temperatures ove=
r
the Northeast from Jan 3 to Jan 5. Increased snowfall appears likely on the
backside of the forecast surface low, however accumulations are not expecte=
d
to
reach hazard thresholds at this time.



Outside of the CONUS, ensemble guidance favors anomalous mid-level troughin=
g
underneath highly amplified ridging over the northern Pacific, with the
possible development of a Kona low to the west of the Hawaiian Islands. Thi=
s
is
expected to promote above-normal precipitation over the central Pacific, wh=

reforecast tools show increased chances of precipitation accumulations
exceeding the 85th percentile over parts of Hawaii throughout the outlook
period. A continuation of above-normal and possibly heavy precipitation ove=
r
the Hawaiian islands may worsen already saturated soils and trigger localiz=

flooding due to antecedent rainfall over the Hawaiian Islands since early
December. Across Alaska, prevailing northwesterly flow on the east side of =
the
ridge axis is expected to keep much of the Alaska Mainland and the Panhandl=

on
the cold side during week-2. Early in the period, both the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles continue to favor the redevelopment of positive mid-level height
departures over the Bering Sea, which would help to promote another period =

158 PM EST Fri Dec 24 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Dec 27 2021 - 12Z Fri Dec 31 2021

...Potential for heavy mountain snow in the West continues through
early next week...

...Bitterly cold temperatures are forecast across portions of the
Northwest to Northern Plains next week...


...Overview...

A rather stagnant pattern is forecast for at least the early part
of the medium range period led by a persistent and highly
amplified northern Pacific ridge/upper high. Downstream, troughing
is expected over the western U.S. as a mid-upper low drifts
eastward over west-central Canada, while shortwaves eject from the
upper trough and are carried along in fast west-southwesterly mean
flow, which will support a series of low pressure systems
developing and tracking over the central and northeastern U.S..
Meanwhile, another upper high moving from the Gulf of Mexico early
week into the Bahamas by midweek will spread ridging and above
normal temperatures to the southeastern quadrant of the country
south of the storm track. By the latter half of the week, model
guidance is indicating the potential for a southern stream upper
low dropping through the eastern Pacific just west of the
California coast.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance shows relatively good agreement with the large
scale pattern of West troughing and Southeast ridging through much
of next week, but with some differences in some smaller scale
details, particularly pertaining to a couple of shortwaves
rotating out of the western U.S. trough. There is good consensus
with an initial shortwave and surface low moving across the Great
Lakes Monday, and model agreement is increasing somewhat for
another shortwave and low there by early Wednesday, with a
somewhat faster moving trailing cold front compared to previous
forecasts. This is in conjunction with a model trend toward less
energy dropping south with a less consolidated/not closed upper
low over southwestern/south-central Canada compared to guidance
from a day or so ago. This aspect of the forecast remains
uncertain given the run-to-run variability. The other main area of
model differences in the 00/06Z cycle is with the possible
southern stream low developing as energy drops south along the
eastern Pacific and West Coast. Generally, model guidance has
trended toward the existence of this feature, though with
differences in the timing of its closing off and with its track.
The 00Z GFS seemed to be an exception at this point in showing a
weak and fast trough Thursday-Friday, with its 06Z and 12Z runs as
well as runs from yesterday indicating a closed low.

For the WPC blend, the 00Z/06Z guidance presented enough agreement
for days 3-4 to warrant a purely deterministic model blend between
the 06Z GFS, 00Z ECMWF, and 00Z CMC. After that, the ensemble
means were introduced and increased as the period progressed to
help mitigate the smaller scale detail differences, which could
take several days to resolve still. Favored the 00Z EC ensemble
mean due to its better representation of a southern stream
trough/low off of California compared to the GEFS means. This
approach provided good continuity with the previous WPC forecast
overall.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Precipitation is likely to continue in the West as the medium
range period begins Monday as shortwave energy rounds the
persistent upper trough and enhances moisture inflow. Multiple
feet of snow are forecast for the Sierra Nevada continuing from
Sunday into Monday, while other terrain areas of California could
also see local enhancement. Additional precipitation should spread
into the Intermountain West as well especially on Monday and
Tuesday, with the Mogollon Rim and portions of the Rockies with
possibly heavy totals. Southern California could see more
precipitation from midweek onward as an upper low may form
offshore, directing another round of moisture into the area.

Generally progressive low pressure systems will spread periodic
precipitation across parts of the central and eastern U.S. through
next week. The best snow chances should be confined to the Great
Lakes and interior Northeast, with rain to the south. The
associated trailing cold front slowly sinking southeastward could
provide a focus for enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley
around Tuesday-Wednesday and toward the Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachians/Southeast by Thursday-Friday of next week,
but with uncertainty remaining regarding the amounts and axis of
the heaviest rain.

Bitterly cold temperatures are likely in parts of the northwestern
and north-central U.S., with daytime highs (and a lesser extent
overnight lows) 20 to nearly 40 degrees below average. Some areas
of North Dakota and Montana may stay below 0F for more than 48
hours Monday-Wednesday before moderating somewhat by Thursday.
Cold temperatures combined with gusty winds could result in
dangerously cold wind chills, especially for parts of the northern
High Plains where wind chill values could dip well below 0F, even
where temperatures are above zero. Temperatures are also expected
to trend colder in the rest of the western U.S., with expanding
coverage of highs 10-25F below normal next week. Increasing
numbers of locations along and just inland from the West Coast
could see daily records for low maximum and minimum temperatures
Monday through Wednesday. Meanwhile, mild to warm weather is
expected across the south-central U.S. and northeastward through
next week. The southern Plains to Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys
will be at the center of the greatest warm temperature anomalies,
especially Monday-Wednesday where many places could be 20 to 30
degrees above normal. Daily record high minimum and maximum
temperatures are likely. Anomalous to record warmth should press
slightly eastward as the week progresses, with well above average
temperatures expected to spread into parts of the Ohio Valley
parts of the East later next week.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 30, 2021 - JAN 03, 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
strong ridging over the northern Pacific is forecast, leading to deep
troughing
downstream across the western CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights
extending
northeastward to the Great Lakes and the Northeast. Anomalous ridging is
likely
farther to the south across parts of the Southern Plains and much of the
southeastern CONUS associated with above-normal 500-hPa heights.

Below normal temperatures are favored over parts of northern and southeaste=
rn
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle due to the influence of relatively cold
surface high pressure over parts of western Canada. Troughing over the west=
ern
and north-central CONUS favors elevated probabilities for below-normal
temperatures over the western CONUS, north-central CONUS, and Great Lakes.
Conversely, ridging over the south-central and southeastern CONUS leads to
increased chances of near to above-normal temperatures from the Southern
Plains
to the Eastern Seaboard.

Above-normal precipitation is likely for Mainland Alaska related to mean
surface westerly flow predicted over the Bering Sea. Mean offshore flow lea=
ds
to increased chances of near to below-normal precipitation across the
Aleutians

...Heavy mountain snow, moderate lowland snow, and rain through
the Holiday Weekend for the West...

...Anomalously warm temperatures continue for most of the central
and eastern U.S., with record highs possible from the Southern
Plains to Mid-Atlantic...

...Scattered rain showers and a wintry mix forecast along a
frontal system moving across the Great Lakes and Northeast...

Heavy mountain snow and rain in the West and record warmth for the
central and eastern U.S. are the focus of the short-term forecast
period (Friday evening through Sunday). In the West, a series of
storm systems will continue to bring heavy mountain snow, moderate
lowland snow, and rain to the West Coast and the Rockies through
the Holiday Weekend. Another foot of snow is likely for the
Cascades in the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevada in California,
with locally higher totals over several feet possible for northern
portions of the Sierra Nevada. Totals of around 6-12 inches, with
locally higher amounts, are also forecast for portions of the
northern and central Rocky Mountains. Widespread Winter Storm
Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories remain in effect for the
mountain ranges across the region due to both the forecast heavy
snow and high winds resulting in blowing snow and dangerous travel
conditions. Meanwhile, cooler air continues to move in across the
Pacific Northwest as a series of cold fronts moves through and an
upper-level trough begins to dig further south over the region.
Widespread highs in the 30s are likely both Saturday and Sunday.
Due to the cooler temperatures, snow levels will continue to lower
to sea level, with snow forecast for both Seattle and Portland.
The greatest chance of accumulation will be for Portland and the
Willamette Valley in Oregon, where 1-6 inches of snow is possible.
Meanwhile, rain showers will continue for the West Coast and
portions of the desert Southwest. A Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall remains in effect through Saturday morning for the
greater San Diego area and surrounding mountain ranges, with a
Marginal Risk for central Arizona. Rain should taper off first for
southern California but rainfall rates of around 0.5 inches per
hour will continue to lead to the threat for flooding across burn
scars in Arizona.

The other major weather story of the weekend will be the continued
much above normal warmth for most of the central and eastern U.S.,
with record-tying and record-breaking high temperatures forecast
from the Southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic. Highs Saturday will
range from the 40s and 50s across the Central Plains, Midwest, and
northern Mid-Atlantic; the 60s and 70s for the Ohio Valley,
southern Mid-Atlantic, and South; and into the 80s for Texas.
Temperatures will cool a bit further east on Sunday while
increasing for the Central and Southern Plains. Winds will also
increase ahead of a cold front across the High Plains on
Sunday.The windy, dry, and continued warm conditions have resulted
in a Critical Risk of fire weather issued by the Storm Prediction
Center for southwest Kansas, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and the
northern Texas Panhandle. One exception to the anomalous warmth
will be in the Northern Plains where frigid Canadian air will
remain in place on the north side of a generally stationary front.
Highs in Montana and North Dakota will be in the single digits and
teens.

Elsewhere, scattered light to moderate rain showers are forecast
along a frontal system moving across the Great Lakes and Northeast
on Saturday. A wintry mix of freezing rain and snow is forecast in
the cooler air on the north side of the front across upstate New
York and New England. A glaze of freezing rain is expected for
Upstate New York and western New England, with accumulations of
around 0.1 inches possible in the Hudson and Connecticut River
Valleys. Snow showers are likely for the higher terrain of western
New England and Maine. A light wintry mix is also forecast on the
backside of the system across the Great Lakes on Sunday. Later in
the day Sunday, snow will begin to increase for the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest as another storm system begins to
strengthen and approach the region. However, heavier totals should
hold off until the overnight.

Valid 12Z Mon Dec 27 2021 - 12Z Fri Dec 31 2021

...Potential for heavy mountain snow in the West continues through
early next week...

...Bitterly cold temperatures are forecast across portions of the
Northwest to Northern Plains next week...


...Overview...

A rather stagnant pattern is forecast for at least the early part
of the medium range period led by a persistent and highly
amplified northern Pacific ridge/upper high. Downstream, troughing
is expected over the western U.S. as a mid-upper low drifts
eastward over west-central Canada, while shortwaves eject from the
upper trough and are carried along in fast west-southwesterly mean
flow, which will support a series of low pressure systems
developing and tracking over the central and northeastern U.S..
Meanwhile, another upper high moving from the Gulf of Mexico early
week into the Bahamas by midweek will spread ridging and above
normal temperatures to the southeastern quadrant of the country
south of the storm track. By the latter half of the week, model
guidance is indicating the potential for a southern stream upper
low dropping through the eastern Pacific just west of the
California coast.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance shows relatively good agreement with the large
scale pattern of West troughing and Southeast ridging through much
of next week, but with some differences in some smaller scale
details, particularly pertaining to a couple of shortwaves
rotating out of the western U.S. trough. There is good consensus
with an initial shortwave and surface low moving across the Great
Lakes Monday, and model agreement is increasing somewhat for
another shortwave and low there by early Wednesday, with a
somewhat faster moving trailing cold front compared to previous
forecasts. This is in conjunction with a model trend toward less
energy dropping south with a less consolidated/not closed upper
low over southwestern/south-central Canada compared to guidance
from a day or so ago. This aspect of the forecast remains
uncertain given the run-to-run variability. The other main area of
model differences in the 00/06Z cycle is with the possible
southern stream low developing as energy drops south along the
eastern Pacific and West Coast. Generally, model guidance has
trended toward the existence of this feature, though with
differences in the timing of its closing off and with its track.
The 00Z GFS seemed to be an exception at this point in showing a
weak and fast trough Thursday-Friday, with its 06Z and 12Z runs as
well as runs from yesterday indicating a closed low.

For the WPC blend, the 00Z/06Z guidance presented enough agreement
for days 3-4 to warrant a purely deterministic model blend between
the 06Z GFS, 00Z ECMWF, and 00Z CMC. After that, the ensemble
means were introduced and increased as the period progressed to
help mitigate the smaller scale detail differences, which could
take several days to resolve still. Favored the 00Z EC ensemble
mean due to its better representation of a southern stream
trough/low off of California compared to the GEFS means. This
approach provided good continuity with the previous WPC forecast
overall.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Precipitation is likely to continue in the West as the medium
range period begins Monday as shortwave energy rounds the
persistent upper trough and enhances moisture inflow. Multiple
feet of snow are forecast for the Sierra Nevada continuing from
Sunday into Monday, while other terrain areas of California could
also see local enhancement. Additional precipitation should spread
into the Intermountain West as well especially on Monday and
Tuesday, with the Mogollon Rim and portions of the Rockies with
possibly heavy totals. Southern California could see more
precipitation from midweek onward as an upper low may form
offshore, directing another round of moisture into the area.

Generally progressive low pressure systems will spread periodic
precipitation across parts of the central and eastern U.S. through
next week. The best snow chances should be confined to the Great
Lakes and interior Northeast, with rain to the south. The
associated trailing cold front slowly sinking southeastward could
provide a focus for enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley
around Tuesday-Wednesday and toward the Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachians/Southeast by Thursday-Friday of next week,
but with uncertainty remaining regarding the amounts and axis of
the heaviest rain.

Bitterly cold temperatures are likely in parts of the northwestern
and north-central U.S., with daytime highs (and a lesser extent
overnight lows) 20 to nearly 40 degrees below average. Some areas
of North Dakota and Montana may stay below 0F for more than 48
hours Monday-Wednesday before moderating somewhat by Thursday.
Cold temperatures combined with gusty winds could result in
dangerously cold wind chills, especially for parts of the northern
High Plains where wind chill values could dip well below 0F, even
where temperatures are above zero. Temperatures are also expected
to trend colder in the rest of the western U.S., with expanding
coverage of highs 10-25F below normal next week. Increasing
numbers of locations along and just inland from the West Coast
could see daily records for low maximum and minimum temperatures
Monday through Wednesday. Meanwhile, mild to warm weather is
expected across the south-central U.S. and northeastward through
next week. The southern Plains to Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys
will be at the center of the greatest warm temperature anomalies,
especially Monday-Wednesday where many places could be 20 to 30
degrees above normal. Daily record high minimum and maximum
temperatures are likely. Anomalous to record warmth should press
slightly eastward as the week progresses, with well above average
temperatures expected to spread into parts of the Ohio Valley
parts of the East later next week.

next week. The best snow chances should be confined to the Great
Lakes and interior Northeast, with rain to the south. The
associated trailing cold front slowly sinking southeastward could
provide a focus for enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley
around Tuesday-Wednesday and toward the Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachians/Southeast by Thursday-Friday of next week,
but with uncertainty remaining regarding the amounts and axis of
the heaviest rain.

Bitterly cold temperatures are likely in parts of the northwestern
and north-central U.S., with daytime highs (and a lesser extent
overnight lows) 20 to nearly 40 degrees below average. Some areas
of North Dakota and Montana may stay below 0F for more than 48
hours Monday-Wednesday before moderating somewhat by Thursday.
Cold temperatures combined with gusty winds could result in
dangerously cold wind chills, especially for parts of the northern
High Plains where wind chill values could dip well below 0F, even
where temperatures are above zero. Temperatures are also expected
to trend colder in the rest of the western U.S., with expanding
coverage of highs 10-25F below normal next week. Increasing
numbers of locations along and just inland from the West Coast
could see daily records for low maximum and minimum temperatures
Monday through Wednesday. Meanwhile, mild to warm weather is
expected across the south-central U.S. and northeastward through
next week. The southern Plains to Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys
will be at the center of the greatest warm temperature anomalies,
especially Monday-Wednesday where many places could be 20 to 30
degrees above normal. Daily record high minimum and maximum
temperatures are likely. Anomalous to record warmth should press
slightly eastward as the week progresses, with well above average
temperatures expected to spread into parts of the Ohio Valley
parts of the East later next week.

402 PM EST Fri Dec 24 2021

Valid 00Z Sat Dec 25 2021 - 00Z Mon Dec 27 2021

...Heavy mountain snow, moderate lowland snow, and rain through
the Holiday Weekend for the West...

...Anomalously warm temperatures continue for most of the central
and eastern U.S., with record highs possible from the Southern
Plains to Mid-Atlantic...

...Scattered rain showers and a wintry mix forecast along a
frontal system moving across the Great Lakes and Northeast...

Heavy mountain snow and rain in the West and record warmth for the
central and eastern U.S. are the focus of the short-term forecast
period (Friday evening through Sunday). In the West, a series of
storm systems will continue to bring heavy mountain snow, moderate
lowland snow, and rain to the West Coast and the Rockies through
the Holiday Weekend. Another foot of snow is likely for the
Cascades in the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevada in California,
with locally higher totals over several feet possible for northern
portions of the Sierra Nevada. Totals of around 6-12 inches, with
locally higher amounts, are also forecast for portions of the
northern and central Rocky Mountains. Widespread Winter Storm
Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories remain in effect for the
mountain ranges across the region due to both the forecast heavy
snow and high winds resulting in blowing snow and dangerous travel
conditions. Meanwhile, cooler air continues to move in across the
Pacific Northwest as a series of cold fronts moves through and an
upper-level trough begins to dig further south over the region.
Widespread highs in the 30s are likely both Saturday and Sunday.
Due to the cooler temperatures, snow levels will continue to lower
to sea level, with snow forecast for both Seattle and Portland.
The greatest chance of accumulation will be for Portland and the
Willamette Valley in Oregon, where 1-6 inches of snow is possible.
Meanwhile, rain showers will continue for the West Coast and
portions of the desert Southwest. A Marginal Risk of Excessive
Rainfall remains in effect through Saturday morning for central
Arizona where rainfall rates of around 0.5 inches per hour will
continue to lead to the threat for flooding across burn scars.

The other major weather story of the weekend will be the continued
much above normal warmth for most of the central and eastern U.S.,
with record-tying and record-breaking high temperatures forecast
from the Southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic. Highs Saturday will
range from the 40s and 50s across the Central Plains, Midwest, and
northern Mid-Atlantic; the 60s and 70s for the Ohio Valley,
southern Mid-Atlantic, and South; and into the 80s for Texas.
Temperatures will cool a bit further east on Sunday while
increasing for the Central and Southern Plains. Winds will also
increase ahead of a cold front across the High Plains on Sunday.
The windy, dry, and continued warm conditions have resulted in a
Critical Risk of fire weather issued by the Storm Prediction
Center for southwest Kansas, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and the
northern Texas Panhandle. One exception to the anomalous warmth
will be in the Northern Plains where frigid Canadian air will
remain in place on the north side of a generally stationary front.
Highs in Montana and North Dakota will be in the single digits and
teens.

Elsewhere, scattered light to moderate rain showers are forecast
along a frontal system moving across the Great Lakes and Northeast
on Saturday. A wintry mix of freezing rain and snow is forecast in
the cooler air on the north side of the front across upstate New
York and New England. A glaze of freezing rain is expected for
Upstate New York and western New England, with accumulations of
around 0.1 inches possible in the Hudson and Connecticut River
Valleys. Snow showers are likely for the higher terrain of western
New England and Maine. A light wintry mix is also forecast on the
backside of the system across the Great Lakes on Sunday. Later in
the day Sunday, snow will begin to increase for the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest as another storm system begins to
strengthen and approach the region. However, heavier totals should
hold off until the overnight.

...Bitterly cold temperatures are forecast across portions of the
Northwest to Northern Plains early next week...


...Overview...

The upper pattern remains relatively unchanged throughout much of
the medium range period led by a persistent and highly amplified
northern Pacific ridge/upper high. Downstream, troughing is
expected over the western U.S. as a mid-upper low drifts eastward
over west-central Canada, and shortwaves eject from the upper
trough and are carried along in fast west-southwesterly mean flow.
This should support a series of low pressure systems tracking over
the central and northeastern U.S.. Meanwhile, another upper high
over the Bahamas will allow for ridging and above normal
temperatures across the southeastern quadrant of the country to
the south of the storm track. By the latter half of the week,
model guidance is indicating the potential for a southern stream
upper low dropping through the eastern Pacific just off the
California coast.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest models and ensembles continue to show good agreement
with the large scale pattern through much of the period, but with
some lingering uncertainties in the smaller scale details. A
series of shortwaves rotating out of the Western U.S. trough
towards the Great Lakes/Northeast have come into a little bit
better agreement but there are some timing/placement differences
will may take until the short range to resolve. This would impact
the exact axis of heavy rainfall across the Ohio Valley mid next
week. The other notable area of concern is regarding the next
shortwave dropping down the West Coast, with potential for a
closed low off the California coast by next Thursday. The
18z/yesterday GFS followed suit with its predecessor runs in being
weaker and much faster than the better consensus It brings the
energy into the Southwest by early Friday while the rest of the
deterministic models (and ensemble means) show a well developed
closed low well off of Southern California at that time.

For the WPC blend, the available guidance presented enough
agreement for days 3-4 to warrant a purely deterministic model
blend for days 3-4/Tuesday-Wednesday. After that, the ensemble
means were introduced and gradually increased as the period
progressed to help mitigate the smaller scale detail differences.
The GFS was not included in the blend after day 4, due to the
issues with the closed low off southern California. This approach
also provided good continuity with the previous WPC forecast
overall.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Precipitation across the West should be waning by the start of the
period on Tuesday, although some modest snow accumulations may
continue in the higher terrain, especially for parts of Arizona
and the Colorado Rockies. Activity should quiet down on Wednesday,
but another round of heavy mountain snows are possible for
portions of the Pacific Northwest/northern Rockies ahead of the
shortwave dropping down the West Coast on Thursday. The closed low
development off the California coast may help direct increased
moisture into parts of southern California as well later next week.

Generally progressive low pressure systems will spread periodic
precipitation across parts of the central and eastern U.S. through
next week. The best snow chances should be confined to the Great
Lakes and interior Northeast, with rain to the south. The
associated trailing cold front slowly sinking southeastward could
provide a focus for enhanced rainfall across the Ohio Valley
around Tuesday-Wednesday and toward the Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachians/Southeast by Thursday-Friday of next week,
but with uncertainty remaining regarding the amounts and axis of
the heaviest rain.

Bitterly cold temperatures will be ongoing by Tuesday in parts of
the northwestern and north-central U.S., with daytime highs (and a
lesser extent overnight lows) 20 to nearly 40 degrees below
average. Some areas of North Dakota and Montana may stay below 0F
for more than 48 hours Tuesday-Wednesday before moderating
somewhat by Thursday. Cold temperatures combined with gusty winds
could result in dangerously cold wind chills, especially for parts
of the northern High Plains where wind chill values could dip well
below 0F for many. Temperatures are also expected to trend colder
in the rest of the western U.S., with expanding coverage of highs
10-25F below normal early to mid next week. Increasing numbers of
locations along and just inland from the West Coast could see
daily records for low maximum and minimum temperatures Tuesday and
Wednesday. Meanwhile, mild to warm weather is expected across the
south-central U.S. and northeastward through next week where many
places from the southern Plains to the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic
could be 20 to 30 degrees above normal Tuesday into Wednesday.
Daily record high minimum and maximum temperatures are likely. As
the pattern deamplifies just slightly over the country later next
week, temperatures across both the West and East should moderate,
but still maintain a general cool in the West, warm in the East,
just less extreme.

1242 AM CST Sat Dec 25 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow will prevail across much of the CONUS Christmas day as a
weakening upper-level disturbance moves through the upper OH River
Valley and a stronger wave deepens along the West Coast. This flow
regime will favor a broad stretch of weak surface pressure falls
along the lee of the Rockies with an attendant downslope wind
response. Areas of fire weather concerns may emerge from the central
to southern High Plains, but will be most likely across the NE
Panhandle where strong winds are expected over critically dry fuels.

...Nebraska Panhandle...
A conditional, wind-driven fire weather concern appears probable for
portions of the NE Panhandle this afternoon. Stronger mid-level flow
between 850-700 mb will likely be in place over the region as a weak
upper-level wave propagates across the Dakotas. Mostly clear skies
should allow for sufficient boundary-layer mixing to realize these
winds at the surface. Sustained winds near 20 mph appear likely and
gusts up to 30-40 mph are possible. Although RH reductions will be
modest (down to 20-25% by late afternoon), ERC values across the
region are between the 90-97th percentile, which will support a
wind-driven fire weather concern.

...Central Colorado...
Latest ensemble guidance continues to show modest probabilities for
elevated fire weather conditions along the I-25 corridor in central
CO, primarily be driven by downslope winds in the immediate lee of
the terrain. However, weak flow aloft over central CO casts some
uncertainty into the wind forecast. Additionally, recent MRMS data
shows light rainfall over the region that may have mitigated fine
fuel receptiveness to a degree as well as boosted overnight RH
recoveries (as noted in recent surface obs). Localized fire weather
concerns may emerge, but confidence remains too low for highlights.

...West Texas...
Despite an influx of moisture over the past 24 hours, conditions
will remain generally dry across much of the southern High Plains.
While increasing westerly winds will support some downslope
warming/drying, increasing mid to high-level cloud cover through the
day may mitigate RH reductions to some degree. Sustained winds near
15 mph may gust as high as 25-30 mph during the afternoon hours,
especially along the I-20 corridor under an axis of stronger
low-level flow. Localized elevated conditions are likely, but
confidence in the duration/coverage of such conditions remains too
low for highlights.

...Significant mountain snowfall, travel disruptive lowland snow,
and rain through the Holiday Weekend for the West...

...Anomalously warm temperatures continue for most of the central
and eastern U.S., with record highs possible from the Southern
Plains to Mid-Atlantic...

...Scattered rain showers and a wintry mix forecast in the
Northeast Christmas Day; new winter storm to develop in the Upper
Midwest Sunday night...

The seemingly endless upper level troughing pattern in the West is
forecast to stick around through Christmas and the remainder of
the holiday weekend. Anomalously cold conditions and a barrage of
Pacific moisture results in prolonged periods of mountain snow and
coastal/valley rain, some of which may fall heavy at times. Enough
cold air is in place for even metropolitan areas of the Northwest
to receive measurable snowfall. Winter Storm Warnings have been
issued from Portland, Oregon and the Willamette Valley on south to
the Sierra Nevada and the Transverse Range in Southern California
through Sunday. Through the remainder of the weekend, the heaviest
snowfall totals are expected to occur in the northern and central
Sierras with 2 to 4 feet of snow (locally higher amounts possible)
are expected. The Portland metro area may receive a 2 to 5 inches
of snow and the Seattle metro (under a Winter Weather Advisory
through Sunday afternoon) could witness as much a few inches of
snow. A little father east, after snow winds down this morning and
a brief break in the active weather pattern arrives Christmas
afternoon, the next upper level disturbance slams into the West
Coast on Sunday, delivering another round of moderate-to-heavy
snowfall to the Intermountain West. Snow totals, from the
Sawtooths, the Tetons, Wasatch, and central Rockies can anticipate
roughly 1 to 2 feet of snow by the end of the weekend. Travel will
be treacherous, to at time impossible, from the Sierras to the
central Rockies this weekend due to whiteout conditions and
drifting snow.

The other "hot" weather story of the weekend will be the continued
much above normal warmth for most of the central and eastern U.S.
Record-tying and record-breaking high temperatures are likely from
the Southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic. The warmest average
temperatures for Christmas Day will stretch from the heart of
Texas to the Middle Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and
Mid-Atlantic where temperature departures look to range between 25
to 35 degrees above normal. A passing cold front drops
temperatures to more seasonally warm levels in the Ohio Valley on
Sunday, but much of the South remains remarkably warm as highs
soar into the 80s once again in Texas and Oklahoma. Winds will
also increase ahead of a cold front across the High Plains on
Sunday. The combination of windy, dry, and continued warm
conditions have resulted in a Critical Risk of fire weather issued
by the Storm Prediction Center for southwest Kansas and both the
Oklahoma and northern Texas Panhandles. One exception to the
anomalous warmth (aside from the cooler, stormy setup along the
West Coast) is the Northern Plains where frigid Canadian air will
pool behind a strong cold front. Morning lows are forecast to be
sub-zero in the High Plains of Montana and North Dakota with
daytime highs struggling to get out of the single digits.

Elsewhere, scattered light to moderate rain showers along a
frontal system will move across the Northeast and Ohio Valley
Christmas Day. A wintry mix of freezing rain and snow is forecast
in the cooler air on the north side of the front across upstate
New York and New England. A glaze of freezing rain is expected for
Upstate New York and western New England, with accumulations of
around a tenth of an inch possible in the Hudson and Connecticut
River Valleys. Snow showers are likely for the higher terrain of
western New England and Maine. Winter Weather Advisories have been
issued for these areas through Christmas morning. By Sunday
afternoon, snow will begin to increase in coverage across the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest as an emerging storm system
strengthens and approaches from the West. Latest forecast guidance
indicated anywhere from 6 to 12 inches of snow is possible in
eastern North Dakota Sunday night and into early Monday morning.
Parts of northern Minnesota may also pick up as much as 6 inches
Sunday night. A glaze of ice accumulation is also possible in the
Upper Mississippi Valley and the central Great Lakes Sunday night
into early Monday morning.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST COLORADO INTO WEST
KANSAS AND THE OKLAHOMA/TEXAS PANHANDLES...

...Synopsis...
Early-morning water-vapor imagery reveals an upper-level disturbance
off the West Coast that is forecast to propagate eastward into the
Plains by Sunday afternoon. As this occurs, broad ascent ahead of
the wave combined with lee troughing will support a deepening
surface low over the High Plains. Southwesterly downslope winds are
expected to strengthen across much of the central to southern High
Plains in response, resulting in the potential for widespread fire
weather concerns. While some forecast details remain fluid, the
overall synoptic pattern continues to look favorable for at least
elevated to critical fire weather concerns.

...Central to southern High Plains...
Although some spread is noted among members, early-morning ensemble
guidance continues to show high probability for sustained winds
between 20-25 mph over a broad area from west TX to southwest NE.
These winds will primarily be driven by a pressure-gradient response
from the deepening low as well as 30-50 mph low to mid-level flow
over the region. While confidence in the general synoptic evolution
and wind forecast remains high, some forecast details remain
uncertain. Increasing cloud cover ahead of the wave is expected to
overspread much of the region and may limit the potential for
diurnal mixing and robust RH reductions. Furthermore, the low-level
thermal ridge (currently relegated to parts of southwest TX) may
become established from west TX into southwest OK, slightly
displaced from the stronger winds to the north. Drier deterministic
solutions hint at a pocket of 20-25% RH persisting into the
overnight hours across central and eastern KS. However, confidence
in this scenario is low given a large spread in guidance for the
overnight period and uncertainties regarding the western extent of
richer moisture return.

These uncertainties imply that elevated conditions are likely across
a broad swath of the region with the potential for critical
conditions from west TX/southwest OK into the CO/NE/KS region. For
this outlook, the Critical risk area delineates where a favorable
overlap of 15-20% RH and strong winds appears most likely, but this
area may be refined in subsequent updates as forecast details become
more clear.

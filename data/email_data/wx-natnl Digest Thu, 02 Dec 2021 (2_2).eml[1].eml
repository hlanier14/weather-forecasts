Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1248 AM CST Thu Dec 02 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery and analyses reveal strong zonal
flow across the northern CONUS within the apex of a broad
upper-level ridge. While flow aloft may weaken somewhat through the
day, winds within the boundary layer will remain strong enough to
support a fire weather threat for the northern Rockies. To the east,
an upper-level trough with an attendant surface low will induce
breezy pressure-gradient winds that may result in localized fire
weather concerns for the Mid-Atlantic where fuels are dry.

...Montana...
Strong zonal flow within the lowest 1-2 km will continue to support
gusty winds across central MT for today. Sustained winds between
20-30 mph with frequent gusts above 40 mph (isolated gusts between
50-60 mph) appear likely in the lee of the terrain. RH reductions
are expected to be modest due to cloud cover and weak cold advection
late this afternoon. However, dry fuels coupled with the strong
winds have carried active fires over the past 24 hours despite some
RH recovery. This trend should continue to support a wildfire threat
for today. A Critical risk may be introduced in subsequent updates
if RH observations trend drier than currently anticipated.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A surface low over southeast Canada will continue to shift
east/northeast through the day. This will maintain breezy
pressure-gradient winds near 15 mph across the Mid-Atlantic.
Afternoon RH may fall into the 40-50% range from SC northward into
western MD, which could result in localized fire weather concerns
where 15 mph winds and reduced RH can overlap. The probability for a
substantial fire weather threat will reside in the immediate lee of
the Blue Ridge Mountains where downslope effects may support
windier/drier conditions. In general, the overall threat appears too
marginal for highlights at this time, though trends will be
monitored for subsequent updates.

...Southern High Plains...
Antecedent dry conditions are noted across the southern High Plains
where ERC values are above seasonal normal and overnight RH
recoveries have been poor (in the 20-40% range). While this region
is on the periphery of stronger flow aloft, the deepening of a lee
trough over the central High Plains will support westerly downslope
winds across parts of central/eastern NM. Winds may reach near 15-20
mph in the lee of terrain features as RH values fall into the teens.
As such, localized elevated fire weather conditions are possible.
However, confidence in the coverage and duration of such conditions
remains too low for highlights.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
150 AM EST Thu Dec 2 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Dec 5 2021 - 12Z Thu Dec 9 2021

...Overview...

The overall upper level pattern is forecast to transition from
quasi-zonal to more amplified, with the western U.S. upper ridge
becoming established farther west over the eastern Pacific and
multiple troughs passing over the Plains and Midwest.  There will
likely be two organized storm systems to contend with through the
middle of next week, with the first tracking from the Midwest to
the Northeast through late Monday, and the second one tracking
from the central Rockies to the Ohio Valley and Mid-South by
midweek.  An Alberta clipper-type system may affect the Northern
Plains by next Thursday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

There has been an overall improvement in the consolidation of the
00Z model guidance compared to recent days as the overall pattern
becomes more amplified, with forecast confidence now average
compared to below average in recent days.  With the first storm
system crossing the Great Lakes/Northeast through Monday, the GFS
was faster and farther north than the model consensus, including
its own ensemble mean, so it was not favored through early
Tuesday.

The character of the next shortwave nearing the Northwest early
next week will depend on how much if any interaction there may be
between northern stream energy just south of Alaska and a separate
upper low farther south, with no clear consensus evident yet for
exactly what will happen.  This leads to noteworthy model
differences, with the GFS initially quite strong with the
shortwave and faster, and the CMC is considerably slower and
farther west, and a good deal of spread among individual ensemble
members.  The CMC is also farther east than the consensus with the
upper low near northwest Mexico, but this does not appear to have
a significant impact on sensible weather at this time.

The first half of the forecast incorporated the ECMWF/CMC/UKMET
and some of the ECENS, with the GFS excluded due to the reasons
previously mentioned.  However, the GFS was slightly more in line
with the overall pattern by late in the period, so it was
substituted for the CMC along with more of the ensemble means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

There is the potential for a band of light to moderate snow from
northern Michigan to northern New England through Monday as an
organized storm system passes through the region.  Precipitation
type and intensity over the eastern Great lakes and New England
will depend on the exact low track.  Moisture increasing ahead of
the cold front is expected to result in scattered showers and a
few thunderstorms from the Deep South to the Ohio Valley through
Monday morning.  There could be some locally moderate to heavy
rain embedded within this area but with fairly low confidence
regarding exact placement.

The shortwave and cold front forecast to reach the Pacific
Northwest by Sunday night and through Monday should produce a
period of moderate to locally heavy rain and mountain snows over
western Washington and Oregon, with some of this moisture reaching
the northern Rockies by Tuesday.  Heavy snow will be possible for
the higher elevations of northern Idaho, western Montana, and
western Wyoming.  In addition, some moisture will likely extend
farther south over favored terrain in the Great Basin and central
Rockies.  By the Wednesday-Thursday time period, more rainfall is
likely for the east-central U.S. ahead of this same storm system,
and wintry precipitation farther north across the Great Lakes and
New England.

Temperatures are expected to be near to above normal for early
December across most of the nation through the early to middle of
next week, with the greatest positive anomalies expected for
western portions of Texas and Oklahoma on Tuesday ahead of the
next cold front.  On the other end of the spectrum, cold weather
is forecast to continue across the Northeast U.S. with highs
running up to 10 degrees below normal through the weekend with a
cold upper level trough overhead, and another round of below
average readings on Tuesday along the East Coast which should
moderate by Wednesday.  However, no major arctic airmass
intrusions are expected during this forecast period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0124 AM CST Thu Dec 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will continue to dominate the western two-thirds
of the CONUS into the D2/Friday period. With generally weak flow
aloft, the potential for widespread/robust fire weather concerns
will be low. However, a regional fire weather threat is probable
across the southern High Plains as west winds increase ahead of a
cold front.

...Southern High Plains...
Despite modest winds above the surface, west to southwesterly
surface winds are forecast to increase to 15-20 mph in the vicinity
of a weak surface low over the TX Panhandle/Western OK. Trajectories
off the southern Rockies will favor downslope warming/drying with RH
values in the teens to low 20s likely. Given antecedent dry fuels
across the region (ERC values above seasonal normal), these
dry/windy conditions should support at least a few hours of elevated
conditions. The southward progression of a cold front during the
afternoon casts some uncertainty into the duration and coverage of
the fire weather threat, but this synoptic pattern typically
produces at least low-end fire weather concerns for this region.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A dry post-frontal air mass will remain in place across the region
with afternoon RH values in the 25-45% range possible. This may pose
a low-end fire weather concern given dry fuels, but winds will
generally be too weak (below 15 mph for most locations) to support a
more robust fire weather threat.

...Widespread record breaking warmth likely throughout the central
United States today...

...Gusty winds and fire weather concerns located over the northern
High Plains and central Appalachians...

...Scattered showers and lake effect snow forecast across the
Great Lakes and Northeast through Friday morning...

A relatively tranquil weather pattern is expected to remain over
the Lower 48 through the end of the week, with dominant high
pressure located across the southern half of the U.S. and a
powerful jet stream remaining over the Northern Tier. As a result,
above average temperatures are forecast for nearly the entire
country over the next few days. The warmest weather will occur
today as highs soar into the 60s and 70s from the Great Plains to
the Mid-Atlantic. This equates to around 20-30F above normal for
early December. Dozens of daily high temperature records could be
tied or broken throughout these regions as well. Highs are
forecast to remain above normal on Friday, but should begin to
cool slightly as a cold front enters the midsection of the Nation.
The combination of these warm and dry conditions, along with gusty
winds, could lead to dangerous fire weather across parts of the
northern High Plains and central Appalachians today. Additionally,
both of the regions have High Wind Warnings in effect to highlight
the potential for damaging winds.

Very little precipitation is forecast across the U.S. through the
beginning of the weekend. A majority of the activity is likely to
occur across the Northeast and Great Lakes as a potent low
pressure system swings through southeast Canada. This system and
associated cold front will aid in producing showers across the
Northeast today. Meanwhile, with arctic air surging behind the
cold front lake effect snow is likely to begin overnight into
Friday morning across the typical snowbelts of Upstate New York.
Light snow is also possible for upslope regions in far northern
New England.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1022 AM CDT Sun Mar 13 2022

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed.
Morning surface observations show a swath of single digit dewpoints
across southeast NM into west TX, which should overspread the TX
Panhandle, western OK, and southern KS this afternoon. Sustained
winds between 15-20 mph are already being observed across west TX,
and regional 12Z soundings and VWP profiles show 25-35 mph winds
above the nocturnal inversion, which should mix to the surface by
early afternoon amid ample diurnal warming. Based off these observed
trends, confidence remains high in critical fire weather conditions
this afternoon. Elevated fire weather conditions remain possible
well into eastern OK/KS, but morning fuel guidance continues to
suggest that fuel status remains marginal after recent snowfall. See
the previous discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 03/13/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1132 PM CST Sat Mar 12 2022/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will approach the Southwest during this
afternoon. This feature will help deepen an eastern Colorado surface
low. With an already dry airmass across the southern Plains, dry and
windy conditions during the afternoon will bring about elevated to
critical fire weather.

...Southern Plains...
Saturday evening's observed regional soundings show widespread
low-level dry air. Though winds have already turned to southerly
along the western flank of the surface ridge, trajectories will
remain mostly continental or have very limited modification from the
Gulf. While the stronger winds aloft will lag to the west, flow
within the lowest 3 km will be strong. Sustained winds of 20-25 mph
are possible along with higher gusts. RH in parts of western Texas
could fall near 10%. Farther east and north, 15-25% is more
probable. The greatest confidence in critical fire weather is within
the Texas Panhandle into western Oklahoma and western North Texas.
Uncertainty is greatest into southern Kansas and eastern Oklahoma
due to potentially higher RH and non-zero impact from recent
snowfall. In considering Saturday's observed minimum RH values, some
expansion of the elevated was made north and east as it seems
reasonable to give some deference to the more aggressively dry
solutions for Sunday.

...Severe weather possible over Northeast Texas and the ArkLaTex
on Monday and across northern Florida on Tuesday...

...Critical fire weather conditions across portions of the
Southern High Plains on Monday...

...Additional heavy precipitation possible across the Northwest on
Tuesday...

A system that moved inland earlier today and brought widespread
precipitation to the Northwest and northern Rockies, including
areas of locally heavy mountain snow, is forecast to move steadily
southeast.  Generally light precipitation is expected across the
central Rockies as this system moves across that area this evening
and overnight.

By tomorrow morning, the system is expected to move east of the
Rockies, sending a cold front south through the southern High
Plains.  Low humidity and gusty winds are expected to generate
elevated to critical fire weather concerns across portions of the
region, especially for the Trans-Pecos and Big Bend regions of
Texas.

As the system continues farther east, it will begin to interact
with moist and unstable air streaming north from the Gulf of
Mexico.  Showers and thunderstorms are likely to develop during
the afternoon and evening hours across eastern Texas and Oklahoma
into Arkansas and Louisiana.  Some of these storms may become
strong to severe.  The Storm Prediction Center continues to
highlight much of Northeast Texas into the ArkLaTex and far
southeastern Oklahoma with a Slight Risk (level 2/5).  Storms that
develop across this area may produce large hail, isolated wind
damage or a tornado two during the afternoon and evening hours.

On Tuesday, as the system tracks east along the Gulf Coast,
showers and storms will spread from the lower Mississippi Valley
across the Southeast, with locally heavy heavy rain possible.
Strong to severe storms will once again be possible.  The Storm
Prediction Center has highlighted portions of the northern Florida
Peninsula with Slight Risk, noting that damaging winds will be
possible during the afternoon and evening hours.

Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories currently cover much of
central Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.  One more night of
well-below normal temperatures is expected before cold high
pressure moves offshore and temperatures begin to moderate on
Monday.

Farther to the north, a weak upper disturbance is expected to
produce of narrow stripe of light to moderate snow, producing
accumulations of a few inches from North Dakota to northern
Michigan tonight into Monday.

Meanwhile, another system is forecast to move into the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies, producing another round of
widespread precipitation, including potentially locally heavy
amounts across portions of the western Washington and Oregon as it
moves across the region on Tuesday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Mon Mar 14 2022

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
On Tuesday, flow aloft will become much more zonal for the central
and western portions of the country. At the surface winds are
generally expected to be light across areas with dry fuels. Some lee
troughing near the Rockies will support locally elevated conditions
across parts of the southern and central High Plains.

Farther north in northern Nebraska, a favorable overlap of warm
temperatures and windy conditions may occur. Model guidance has
shown a consistent signal for stronger surface to 2 km winds across
the area. ERC values are at record highs in some locations per RMCC
fuel guidance. Given today's fine fuel moisture observations, it
seems probable that an elevated fire weather threat will exist
during the afternoon as RH may fall near 20% with winds of 15-20
mph.

...Severe weather possible over Northeast Texas and the ArkLaTex
on Monday and across northern Florida on Tuesday...

...Critical fire weather conditions across portions of the
Southern High Plains on Monday...

...Additional heavy precipitation possible across the Northwest
Monday into Tuesday...

Monday starts off on a cold note in the Southeast where Freeze
Warnings and Frost Advisories are in place. Temperatures will
moderate to milder levels than Sunday throughout the eastern third
of the Lower 48, but some hints of winter still remain in the
Midwest and Great Lakes. A wave of low pressure will be
responsible for producing a narrow swath of accumulating snowfall
from central Minnesota and northern Wisconsin into northern
Michigan. Winter Weather Advisories have been posted in these
areas where several inches of snow are possible. By Monday night,
periods of snow reach northern New England but only minor
accumulations are expected. In the South, a strengthening wave of
low pressure will ignite areas of thunderstorms in the east Texas
and the ArkLaTex late Monday afternoon and into Monday night. The
SPC has issued a Slight Risk for these areas as storms could
become severe with damaging winds, large hail, and potentially
tornadoes. Heavy rainfall is also expected throughout the Deep
South with over an inch of rainfall throughout much of the region
(locally higher amounts possible). The severe threat shifts east
on Tuesday as the occluded low tracks along the Gulf Coast.
Strong-to-severe storms are likely from the mouth of the
Mississippi River to south-central Florida with damaging winds and
tornadoes/water spouts possible. Some storms may also produce
excessive rainfall rates, prompting the issuance of a Marginal
Risk for flash flooding in parts of northern and central Florida
on Tuesday.

In the southern High Plains, favorable conditions for fire weather
are expected to linger into Monday. West Texas and southeast New
Mexico are most susceptible to high wind gusts and very low
humidity levels. This has led to the issuance of a Critical Risk
for fire weather in parts of these regions, as well as a handful
of Red Flag Warnings. As a cold front swings through the southern
High Plains Monday night, the fire weather threat should diminish
heading into Tuesday. Still, favorable fire weather conditions
look to return to northern Nebraska on Tuesday where an Elevated
Risk for fire weather has been issued by the SPC. Farther west, a
pair of Pacific storm systems are responsible for unsettled
weather in the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies, and northern
California. Beneficial rainfall on the order of 1 to 2 inches are
expected in parts of the coastal range of California and western
Oregon through early Wednesday morning. Measurable snowfall is
also anticipated in the Cascades, Olympics, Sawtooths,
Bitterroots, and northern Rockies of western Montana. The heaviest
totals are forecast in the Washington Cascades where two the three
feet of snow is possible in the highest elevations over the next
couple days.

Temperature-wise, the Nation's Heartland will undergo a
spring-like transition, culminating with daytime high temperature
anomalies ranging between 15 and 25 degrees from the Texas
Panhandle and Midwest to the Lower Great Lakes by Wednesday. The
coldest temperatures are set to occur in the Northwest and central
Rockies as a more active storm track helps to keep temperatures
below normal in these areas. Look for the warming trend to reach
the East Coast by Wednesday with highs in the 60s throughout the
Mid-Atlantic.

30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR MARCH 2021

As we approach the month of March, the pattern across the greater North
America
region appears to be in the process of changing from the last few weeks. Week
2
dynamical model forecast guidance supports a change to anomalous ridging over
the north central Pacific with the central North America mean trough shifted
westward and deepening over portions of western North America including into
western CONUS. Downstream of this, more amplified ridging and positive 500-hPa
height departures are forecast for much of the southeast U.S. favoring a more
southwesterly-westerly mean flow for the eastern half of the CONUS then in
recent weeks.



The most recent Week 3-4 guidance from the CFS, ECMWF and extended GEFS
support
a continuation of this change, in the mean, for approximately the first two
weeks of March. March CFS forecasts as well as those from the majority of the
NMME and Copernicus model suites also favor this pattern and associated
anomalous temperature and precipitation patterns which are consistent with
typical La Nina conditions in many ways during this point in the seasonal
cycle.



Other factors to consider in addition to a review of the available dynamical
model guidance across time scales, is the state and forecast evolution of the
MJO, the AO and most recent anomalous snow cover.



The MJO has been active during January and February resulting in both
constructive and destructive interference with La Nina impacting anomalous
tropical rainfall, circulation and other variables in the Pacific basin.
Forecast information suggests that the MJO is likely to weaken or become less
coherent entering March and is not strongly utilized in the March outlook due
to this as well as indications that much of recent mid-latitude temperature
and
precipitation anomalies have most likely been driven by high latitude
subseasonal variability.



Predictions in the short-term (next 10 days) indicate the phase of the AO
(which has returned to near zero) to remain near zero or weakly positive in
the
mean as compared to the strongly negative phase of the last couple months. The
Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) of early-mid January would continue to
elevate odds for a negative AO phase into the month of March resulting in the
continuation of potential cold air outbreaks into the mid-latitudes. There is
high uncertainty, however, in whether the negative phase of the AO will return
and persist and if so where troughing and so favored below-normal temperatures
are most likely to develop at forecast lead times well into the month of
March.



Finally, substantially below-normal snow cover and snow depth exist across
parts of the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley. Although, early in
the seasonal cycle, taken alone, this is likely to favor above-normal
temperatures in these areas.



After consideration of the factors described above, the March temperature
outlook favors monthly mean below-normal temperatures for a region stretching
from south-central Alaska southeastward to include northern California, the
Pacific Northwest and the northern Rockies. This is strongly supported by
dynamical model guidance across time scales and is consistent with La Nina
conditions. Elevated probabilities for above-normal temperatures are depicted
for parts of the north and west coast of Alaska based on negative sea ice and
positive ocean surface temperature trends especially later in the month of
March.



Dynamical model guidance and in some cases typical La Nina conditions and
positive temperature trends favor above-normal temperatures for a region from
the Southwest eastward to include the southern CONUS and northward to
encompass
the central Mississippi Valley, eastern Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and eastern
seaboard. Only slightly tilted odds of above-normal temperatures or
Equal-Chances (EC) are depicted for the northern and central Plains, central
and upper Mississippi Valley and parts of the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes and
Tennessee Valley due to the uncertainty and conflicting indicators described
above with respect to the phase of the AO, anomalous snow cover and snow depth
and dynamical model guidance.



For precipitation, below-normal monthly total precipitation amounts are most
likely for the southern tier of the CONUS with some expansion of this
highlighted area to the central Great Plains, primarily based on dynamical
model guidance which is consistent with La Nina typical impacts. For similar
reasons, elevated odds for above-normal precipitation is forecast for a small
region in the northern Rockies and for the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region.
For Alaska, elevated odds for above-normal precipitation is depicted for parts
of the north and west coasts associated with anticipated more open and warmer
waters in nearby areas as well as typical La Nina impacts. Below-normal
precipitation is most likely for the south-central coast and far northern
Alaska Panhandle.

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1981 and 2010, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

An updated monthly outlook... for Mar will be issued on Sun February 28 2021

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EST Thu Feb 18 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

La Nina conditions are present across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, as
represented in current oceanic and atmospheric observations. The official CPC
ENSO forecast indicates that La Nina conditions are favored to persist through
March-April-May, followed by a transition to ENSO-Neutral later in the spring
and into the early summer.



The March-April-May (MAM) 2021 temperature outlook favors above normal
temperatures for a majority of the CONUS, with the largest probabilities
(greater than 70 percent) forecast across parts of the Southwest. Elevated
probabilities of below normal temperatures are forecast from the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies northward to the Alaska Panhandle and
southeastern Mainland Alaska. Above normal temperatures are more likely for
western and northern Mainland Alaska. The MAM 2021 precipitation outlook
features enhanced probabilities of below normal precipitation amounts for much
of California and the Southwest eastward to the central and southern Great
Plains, along the Gulf Coast, and southern portions of the East Coast. Above
normal precipitation is slightly favored for parts of the Northeast, Midwest,
Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, and western Mainland Alaska. Equal
chances
(EC) are indicated  among areas where seasonal mean temperatures and seasonal
accumulated precipitation amounts are expected to be similar to climatological
probabilities.

BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

Oceanic and atmospheric observations reflect La Nina conditions  During the
past four weeks (Jan 17  Feb 13), sea surface temperature anomalies were below
average across the west-central Pacific to 130W. The latest Nino-3.4 index is
-1.2 degrees C. Negative subsurface temperature anomalies continue to persist
at a depth of near 200 meters from 170W to 130W. The magnitude of negative
upper-ocean heat anomalies has remained nearly steady since mid-November.
Suppressed convection persists across the equatorial Pacific surrounding the
Date Line, while enhanced convection continues across much of Indonesia and
the
Philippines. The coupled ocean-atmospheric system is consistent with La Nina
conditions.



PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

The CPC SST consolidation for the Nino-3.4 region depicts negative SST
anomalies decreasing  in magnitude to less than -0.5 degrees C during the late
spring. The North American Multi Model Ensemble (NMME) ensemble mean forecast
for the Nino-3.4 SST anomaly has a similar evolution during the next several
months. Based on these model forecasts as of early February, the official
CPC/IRI ENSO outlook states that there is a 60 percent chance that La Nina
transitions to ENSO-Neutral during the Northern Hemisphere spring (April-
June).
Later in the summer and fall 2021, dynamical and statistical tools diverge,
with the dynamical models (NMME and CFSv2) favoring a return of La Nina
conditions.

PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Since La Nina conditions are likely to persist through the early spring (MAM
2021), La Nina composites were used in creating the temperature and
precipitation outlooks for that three month period. Dynamical model guidance
such as the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and the Calibration,
Bridging, and Merging (CBaM) version of the NMME were also tools that were
used
during MAM and were increasingly relied upon starting with AMJ. The
consolidation tool, which includes NMME input and various statistical tools,
was also used,  especially at later leads. Also, based on the likelihood of
drought persisting across parts of the Great Plains and Southwest heading into
the warm season, low soil moisture conditions were a factor in the temperature
outlooks during the spring and summer 2021. Due to a number of back-to-back La
Nina events in the historical record since the 1950s, a reemergence of La Nina
by the fall was considered. At later leads, decadal trends in temperature and
precipitation were the primary tool used in creating the seasonal outlooks.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - MAM 2021 TO MAM 2022

TEMPERATURE

Above normal temperatures are favored for a majority of the CONUS during MAM
with the largest probabilities (more than 70 percent) centered over west Texas
and southeast New Mexico due to low soil moisture and strong support among the
dynamical models. Below normal temperatures are slightly favored from the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies northward to the Alaska Panhandle and
southeastern Mainland Alaska during MAM, based on La Nina composites and model
guidance. Decadal trends were the primary factor for increased chances of
above
normal temperatures across western and northern Mainland Alaska during MAM.
These increased chances of above normal temperatures extend south of the
Brooks
Range due in part to ongoing low snowpack across east-central Alaska which
could lead to an early snowmelt. Forecast confidence for MAM is lowest across
the Northern Great Plains where a highly variable pattern is expected,
especially during March. Based on this and conflicting signals for the three
month period, EC is indicated. As predicted low soil moisture begins to have
more of an influence on surface temperatures later in the spring coupled with
less effects from La Nina, above normal temperatures are the favored category
across the northern Plains, beginning with AMJ. Low soil moisture also
supports
larger probabilities of above normal temperatures across the Great Plains and
Southwest through the summer. During late spring and summer (MJJ through JAS),
above normal temperatures are favored throughout the forecast domain. However,
probabilities are lowest across the north-central CONUS where decadal trends
are the weakest. Decadal trends were the largest factor during the winter
2021-2022 and spring 2022.

PRECIPITATION

Based on the latest model guidance and likely influence of La Nina through the
early spring, elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation were
expanded to include more of the Gulf Coast during MAM, compared to the
previous
outlook. The displaced storm track to the south, that occurred during early to
mid-February, is expected to shift back to the north prior to the beginning of
March as high latitude blocking eases. Other slight changes from last months
MAM outlook include expanding the favored area of below (above) normal
precipitation to cover more of the northern Great Plains (Northeast). The
highest confidence in the MAM precipitation outlook remains across the
Southwest due to excellent agreement among dynamical and statistical tools.
The
precipitation outlook for Alaska during MAM is consistent with the seasonal
temperature outlook. The latest NMME and consolidation tool support a larger
coverage, relative to last months outlook, with elevated probabilities of
below normal precipitation across parts of the Great Plains and Gulf Coast
States during AMJ. Another notable change from the previous month was to
slightly favor below normal precipitation across the Great Plains during MJJ,
which coincides with their wetter climatology. This dry signal is supported by
multiple tools inducing the NMME, IMME, CBaM, and consolidation. Although
decadal trends support a wet signal across the Ohio Valley during the summer,
the latest dynamical models have trended drier. Therefore, EC is indicated for
this region. During the fall and into the winter 2021-2022, decadal trends and
consideration of a potential second La Nina were the primary factors in the
forecast precipitation patterns.

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move eastward out of the southern Plains
today. Across the West Coast, an upper-level ridge will develop.
Surface conditions will remain rather cold with precipitation
occurring within the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. High
pressure will build into the Great Basin. Offshore winds in southern
California will be moderate in the typical wind-prone locations.
Humidity in some locations could approach 10-15% within some of the
valleys. With a majority of fuels generally unreceptive to fire
ignition and spread, fire weather concerns are not expected to be
more than locally elevated where fine fuels have been able to cure.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1251 PM CST Thu Feb 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Recent guidance continues show low
fire weather potential with weaker winds over the Southwest where
conditions have been dry. Increasing westerly winds over the
southern High Plains remain likely, but as noted in the previous
discussion, fuels over this region are currently not receptive.

..Moore.. 02/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0109 AM CST Thu Feb 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level flow will become less amplified as a flattened ridge
moves over the Plains ahead of the next trough along the West Coast.
The surface high in the southern Plains should shift east and
weaken. Enough mid-level flow across the Rockies will exist to
develop a lee trough in the High Plains. Dry and breezy conditions
are possible in eastern New Mexico and parts of West Texas. However,
recent cold temperatures and precipitation will drastically reduce
any potential fire weather concerns as fuels have become quite
unreceptive.

...Active weather continues across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies through the period...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Latest guidance generally agrees that an eastern Pacific mean
ridge aloft (which may briefly extend into parts of the West late
weekend/early next week) should retrograde enough to promote a
developing mean trough over the western U.S. from the middle of
next week onward.  The progressive pattern in place ahead of this
evolution and then a late period frontal system expected to drop
into the Northwest will likely produce multiple days of active
weather over the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies.
Meaningful precipitation could extend farther south over parts of
the West late in the period depending on specifics of shortwave
energy.  Systems carried along in the mean flow downstream will
produce areas of precipitation to the east of the Rockies but
likely with light to moderate totals.

The forecast remains fairly agreeable and consistent for about the
first half of the period when a composite of 00Z/06Z operational
runs (with least weight on the CMC) depicts the features of
interest well.  A leading wave should track from the central
Plains through the Great Lakes, most likely followed by triple
point/coastal development leading to a surface low near Downeast
Maine or Nova Scotia by early day 5 Tuesday.  This evolution has
been consistent in the ensemble means in addition to most models.
The 00Z CMC was weaker/sheared with this system versus other
guidance but the new run has adjusted to consensus.  Then a strong
jet pushing across the northern tier states and southern Canada
will support Canadian low pressure and frontal system crossing the
northern U.S. during the first half of next week.  The majority
cluster is now more agreeable on a defined frontal wave near
northeastern Montana by early Tuesday, a trend toward recent ECMWF
runs.

Models/ensembles increasingly diverge for energy expected to
descend into the West around Tuesday-Wednesday.  GFS/GEFS runs
have tended to be flatter with the 00Z runs becoming particularly
progressive.  Other models and ensemble systems have also varied
with the handling of this energy.  The 06Z GFS/GEFS mean made a
significant adjustment back toward the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean, with
a blend of these models and means ultimately providing a good
intermediate solution that is still a bit eastward of the 12Z/17
ECMWF and latest CMC runs that are on the slower/closed side of
the spectrum.  Interestingly there seems to be somewhat better
agreement and continuity for the upstream feature dropping into
the mean trough late in the week.  Farther east the consensus
hints at the aforementioned Montana wave continuing eastward
through the Upper Midwest/New England, with the trailing front
pushing somewhat farther southeast than continuity.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect areas from the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies
to see the heaviest precipitation during the period.  The highest
totals are likely to be from late weekend into early next week
with strong westerly flow enhancing rain/mountain snow over
western Washington and eventually reaching into parts of Oregon.
Northern Rockies snowfall will also be heavy but should not be
quite as extreme as over the Cascades.  Heading into midweek
precipitation should trend lighter as it spreads southeastward,
though some areas of meaningful precipitation could extend into or
near the central Rockies depending on shortwave/surface evolution
details.  Then a frontal system dropping in from the northeastern
Pacific should bring another episode of rain/mountain snow to the
Pacific Northwest by next Thursday.  Some locations along the most
favored terrain in western Washington may see several inches
liquid equivalent over the five-day period.  Meanwhile the pattern
will support breezy to windy conditions over areas from the
Northwest into the northern Plains through the first part of next
week.  Central Plains through New England low pressure and
associated frontal system will produce generally moderate wintry
precipitation during the first part of the week, most likely from
the Midwest into the Northeast. Areas of light to moderate rain
are likely farther south. Some lake effect snow will be possible
in the chilly cyclonic flow behind this system with locations to
the lee of Lake Ontario seeing the best potential for meaningful
accumulations.  After midweek another front should reach the
Plains/east-central U.S. with possible precipitation development
depending on still-uncertain details of shortwave energy ejecting
from the West and the amount of low level Gulf inflow ahead of the
front.

The pattern evolution during the period will provide some
variability to temperatures.  On Sunday moderately below normal
temperatures (generally 5-15F below normal) will linger over the
East Coast while similar negative anomalies spread across the
Interior West/Rockies into the Plains behind the wave tracking out
of the central Plains.  Aside from a modified form of this latter
airmass reaching the east-central U.S. Monday-early Tuesday,
temperatures over the South/East should trend to near or somewhat
above normal levels over the course of the week.  Northern tier
areas will see a pronounced warming trend during the first part of
the week with the northern Plains most likely to see plus 10-20F
anomalies for both max/min readings while min temps should be more
likely to reach that threshold farther east and west.  The Pacific
upper ridge that may extend into the West early in the week should
support a brief period of warmth over the Great Basin/Southwest,
peaking with some highs 10-15F above normal on Tuesday.  By next
Wednesday-Thursday expect upper troughing that develops over the
West to spread colder temperatures (up to 10-15F below normal)
from the Northwest/northern Rockies into the central
Rockies/Plains.  Areas to the south will see readings trend closer
to normal.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 18 2021

SYNOPSIS: A quieter weather pattern is forecast for week-2 compared to the
current onslaught of wintry weather across much of the eastern half of the
country. Mid-level high pressure is favored to expand over the East allowing
for a transition to more seasonable temperatures. The expected return flow
around this feature results in renewed precipitation chances by the middle of
the period across parts of the east-central U.S. Mid-level low pressure is
forecast to shift from eastern Alaska and into the western U.S., resulting in
the potential for a limited amount of cold air to descend into interior
portions of the West, and a subsequent warming trend for Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Great Basin
and Northern and Central Rockies, Fri-Sun, Feb 26-28.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Brooks Range
and Yukon Valley of Alaska, Fri, Feb 26.

Slight risk for heavy precipitation for portions of the Southern Plains,
Middle
and Lower Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, Sun-Thu, Feb 28-Mar 4.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY FEBRUARY 21 - THURSDAY FEBRUARY 25:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vD2krfLlnnmsZve2hLRYEJMyGUAQWfR7tfX6NNwuQdoTNevnddC4SZwPR1znmS3yrmzdo_y4$

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 26 - THURSDAY MARCH 04: Anomalous troughing is forecast to
move from eastern Alaska into the western CONUS early in week-2, coinciding
with a slight risk of much below-normal minimum temperatures over parts of the
Great Basin, and the Northern and Central Rockies for 2/26-2/28. This is
mainly
supported by the GEFS reforecast tool, which depicts at least a 20% chance
temperatures fall below the 15th percentile over parts of the highlighted
region. Both the uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF ensembles indicate minimum
temperatures falling at least 10 deg F below climatology, supporting the
slight
risk. Some of this cold may eventually expand eastward across the Northern and
Central Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, but is not expected to be
anomalous enough to warrant including in the hazard area.



The aforementioned troughing is forecast to exit Alaska early in week-2.
However, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict at least a 20% chance
for temperatures to fall below -40 deg F on 2/26 over the Brooks Range and
immediate adjacent portions of the Yukon Valley, allowing the slight risk for
much below normal temperatures to remain in place for that day only. Behind
the
departing trough, the mid-level flow is favored to become more zonal with
increasing Pacific moisture transport across the southern half of the state.
Despite this, no clear signals emerge for any heavy precipitation or high wind
hazards for Alaska.



Model guidance continues to depict a robust anomalous 500-hPa ridge building
over the eastern CONUS early in week-2 as the Arctic Oscillation is forecast
to
be in a positive phase. This favors an end to the cold pattern seen across
much
of the East in the recent weeks, and increased chances for near to above
normal
temperatures. Surface high pressure is forecast to move from the southeastern
CONUS into the western Atlantic by the second half of the period, increasing
southwesterly flow and moisture transport out of the Gulf of Mexico. The ECMWF
reforecast tool depicts a large region of the east-central CONUS having at
least a 20% of 3-day precipitation exceeding the 85th percentile for the
2/28-3/2 period. While the GEFS reforecast tool is not as robust, uncalibrated
guidance from the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles support elevated precipitation
chances beginning around 2/28 as shortwave disturbances eject out of the
trough
over the west. Therefore a slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for
2/28 through the end of the period for the Southern Plains eastward into the
Middle and Lower Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys. Since the forecast
favors temperatures above freezing, rain is favored over snow. Severe weather
cannot be ruled out, particularly across parts of the Southern Plains and
Lower
Mississippi Valley, where the highest humidity levels are forecast.

...Light snow and freezing rain to linger across the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic through Friday...

...Flash flooding and severe thunderstorms remain possible this
evening and overnight across portions of the Southeast...

...Bitter cold temperatures continue to slowly warm throughout the
Central/Southern Plains into the weekend...

The headlining weather story today is a winter storm tracking
along the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic coast that is currently
producing light snow across the Northeast and earlier this morning
was responsible significant ice accumulations across the
Mid-Atlantic. Much of the heaviest snowfall amounts have already
fallen, with an additional 2 to 4 inches of snow possible through
Friday evening across the Northeast and Southern New England. A
little farther south, significant and disruptive ice accumulations
were observed across southwest Virginia and northwestern North
Carolina today. An additional tenth of an inch of freezing rain is
possible this evening across similar areas. Some locations could
receive a dangerous storm total half inch of ice accumulation. The
result will be dangerous travel conditions, numerous power
outages, and extensive tree damage. Light freezing rain/drizzle
could also stretch as far as north as the I-95 corridor from the
Washington D.C. to Philadelphia metro areas this evening, which
could prompt slippery travel on Friday morning. Light snow will
finally dissipate across the Northeast by late in the day on
Friday.

Meanwhile, a slow moving cold front associated with the ongoing
winter storm is producing scattered heavy rain across the
Southeast from northern Florida to the eastern Carolinas.
Instances of flash flooding will be possible into the overnight
hours. Much of the region has experienced an abundance of rainfall
over the last few weeks, therefore any additional heavy rain could
struggle to quickly drain. WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall across the region, with Flash Flood Watches
also currently in effect. Across northern Florida and southern
Georgia, isolated thunderstorms could turn severe. In fact, the
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of Severe
Thunderstorms for this area through early Friday morning.
Thunderstorms will have the capability to produce damaging winds
and isolated tornadoes.

The prolonged stretch of frigid temperatures courtesy of a strong
Arctic high pressure system continues to gradually loosen its icy
grip over the Heartland. That said, abnormally cold temperatures
will hang around through the weekend. Record cold daily maximum
and minimum temperatures are likely to transpire in the
South-Central U.S. through Saturday morning. The Plains and
Mississippi Valley can expect daily temperature anomalies ranging
between 20 and 30 degrees below normal. The Ohio Valley will also
remain in a deep freeze through Saturday with high temperatures
remaining below the freezing mark.

Across the Northwest, a pacific storm system will make landfall
this evening and deliver more coastal/valley rain and mountain
snow to the region. A steady onshore flow continues to favor
additional upsloping winds along the Cascades while Pacific
moisture advances deeper into the Intermountain West. Through
Friday night, 1 to 2 feet of snow is forecast to pile up along the
Cascade Range with 6 to 12 inches of snow possible in the
Sawtooth, Bitterroots, and Teton mountain ranges. Those along the
coastal range of northern California and western Oregon/Washington
may receive 1 to 2 inches of rain through Friday night.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu February 18 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 24 - 28 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
pattern
across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period.
Dynamical models forecast a 500-hPa trough over the western CONUS. Upstream of
this trough, ridging is forecast over the Alaska Peninsula and southwestern
Mainland Alaska. The manual height blend depicts negative height anomalies
over
the western CONUS and northeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle,
as
well as the extreme Northeast. Positive height anomalies are forecast across
the remainder of the eastern CONUS, the Southern Plains, the Alaska Peninsula
and Aleutians.

Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are enhanced across much of
Northern
and Central Mainland Alaska associated with below normal heights. Above normal
temperatures are favored for the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutians, due to
predicted ridging. Troughing predicted over the western CONUS favors below
normal temperatures for that region, extending eastward to the central High
Plains. Above normal temperatures are favored for the eastern third of the
CONUS along with the Gulf Coast, underneath predicted above normal heights.

An increased pressure gradient is expected to promote enhanced Pacific flow
across parts of the northwestern CONUS, leading to elevated chances of above
normal precipitation. Farther to the south, surface high pressure and rising
500-hPa heights favor drier than normal conditions across California and the
southwestern CONUS, extending eastward to parts of the Southern and Plains.
Conversely, above normal precipitation is more likely across the Great Lakes,
Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, Middle to Upper Mississippi Valley, and much of
the
Northeast, underneath predicted cyclonic flow. Ridging and associated surface
high pressure are expected farther to the south and east, favoring below
normal
precipitation for the eastern Gulf Coast and Florida. Strong ridging across
the
Aleutians is forecast to push the storm track further north than normal,
resulting in elevated chances of above normal  precipitation across Alaska.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset slightly by increasing
uncertainty in regards to the temperature forecast over the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 26 - MAR 04, 2021

During the week-2 period, an amplified 500-hPa trough is forecast across the
western CONUS with below normal heights. Downstream, ridging is forecast to
dominate the eastern CONUS with above normal heights.  Across Alaska, the
ensemble means depict low amplitude 500-hPa flow which is likely a function of
increasing spread among ensemble members.

Forecast below normal heights lead to increased chances of near to below
normal
temperatures across Alaska. Troughing aloft favors below normal temperatures
across the western CONUS. Near to above normal temperatures are more likely
for
the remainder of the CONUS as a mean ridge gains strength over the
Southeastern
CONUS.

There are  elevated chances of above normal precipitation across Alaska ahead
of a mean trough predicted near the western Aleutians. Downstream of an
amplified 500-hPa trough, above normal precipitation is also favored for much
of the eastern CONUS, Southern Plains, and Mississippi Valley. However,
increased chances of below normal precipitation are forecast across Florida
due
to anomalous subtropical ridging and a predicted storm track north of the Gulf
Coast. Drier than normal conditions are likely for much of the western CONUS
along with the Northern and Central Plains, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern offset by
increasing
uncertainty in regards to the temperature forecast over the CONUS

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...Active weather continues across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies through the period...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Latest guidance generally agrees that an eastern Pacific mean
ridge aloft (which may briefly extend into parts of the West late
weekend/early next week) should retrograde enough to promote a
developing mean trough over the western U.S. from the middle of
next week onward.  The progressive pattern in place ahead of this
evolution and then a late period frontal system expected to drop
into the Northwest will likely produce multiple days of active
weather over the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies.
Meaningful precipitation could extend farther south over parts of
the West late in the period depending on specifics of shortwave
energy.  Systems carried along in the mean flow downstream will
produce areas of precipitation to the east of the Rockies but
likely with light to moderate totals.

The forecast remains fairly agreeable and consistent for about the
first half of the period when a composite of 00Z/06Z operational
runs (with least weight on the CMC) depicts the features of
interest well.  A leading wave should track from the central
Plains through the Great Lakes, most likely followed by triple
point/coastal development leading to a surface low near Downeast
Maine or Nova Scotia by early day 5 Tuesday.  This evolution has
been consistent in the ensemble means in addition to most models.
The 00Z CMC was weaker/sheared with this system versus other
guidance but the new run has adjusted to consensus.  Then a strong
jet pushing across the northern tier states and southern Canada
will support Canadian low pressure and frontal system crossing the
northern U.S. during the first half of next week.  The majority
cluster is now more agreeable on a defined frontal wave near
northeastern Montana by early Tuesday, a trend toward recent ECMWF
runs.

Models/ensembles increasingly diverge for energy expected to
descend into the West around Tuesday-Wednesday.  GFS/GEFS runs
have tended to be flatter with the 00Z runs becoming particularly
progressive.  Other models and ensemble systems have also varied
with the handling of this energy.  The 06Z GFS/GEFS mean made a
significant adjustment back toward the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean, with
a blend of these models and means ultimately providing a good
intermediate solution that is still a bit eastward of the 12Z/17
ECMWF and latest CMC runs that are on the slower/closed side of
the spectrum.  Interestingly there seems to be somewhat better
agreement and continuity for the upstream feature dropping into
the mean trough late in the week.  Farther east the consensus
hints at the aforementioned Montana wave continuing eastward
through the Upper Midwest/New England, with the trailing front
pushing somewhat farther southeast than continuity.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect areas from the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies
to see the heaviest precipitation during the period.  The highest
totals are likely to be from late weekend into early next week
with strong westerly flow enhancing rain/mountain snow over
western Washington and eventually reaching into parts of Oregon.
Northern Rockies snowfall will also be heavy but should not be
quite as extreme as over the Cascades.  Heading into midweek
precipitation should trend lighter as it spreads southeastward,
though some areas of meaningful precipitation could extend into or
near the central Rockies depending on shortwave/surface evolution
details.  Then a frontal system dropping in from the northeastern
Pacific should bring another episode of rain/mountain snow to the
Pacific Northwest by next Thursday.  Some locations along the most
favored terrain in western Washington may see several inches
liquid equivalent over the five-day period.  Meanwhile the pattern
will support breezy to windy conditions over areas from the
Northwest into the northern Plains through the first part of next
week.  Central Plains through New England low pressure and
associated frontal system will produce generally moderate wintry
precipitation during the first part of the week, most likely from
the Midwest into the Northeast. Areas of light to moderate rain
are likely farther south. Some lake effect snow will be possible
in the chilly cyclonic flow behind this system with locations to
the lee of Lake Ontario seeing the best potential for meaningful
accumulations.  After midweek another front should reach the
Plains/east-central U.S. with possible precipitation development
depending on still-uncertain details of shortwave energy ejecting
from the West and the amount of low level Gulf inflow ahead of the
front.

The pattern evolution during the period will provide some
variability to temperatures.  On Sunday moderately below normal
temperatures (generally 5-15F below normal) will linger over the
East Coast while similar negative anomalies spread across the
Interior West/Rockies into the Plains behind the wave tracking out
of the central Plains.  Aside from a modified form of this latter
airmass reaching the east-central U.S. Monday-early Tuesday,
temperatures over the South/East should trend to near or somewhat
above normal levels over the course of the week.  Northern tier
areas will see a pronounced warming trend during the first part of
the week with the northern Plains most likely to see plus 10-20F
anomalies for both max/min readings while min temps should be more
likely to reach that threshold farther east and west.  The Pacific
upper ridge that may extend into the West early in the week should
support a brief period of warmth over the Great Basin/Southwest,
peaking with some highs 10-15F above normal on Tuesday.  By next
Wednesday-Thursday expect upper troughing that develops over the
West to spread colder temperatures (up to 10-15F below normal)
from the Northwest/northern Rockies into the central
Rockies/Plains.  Areas to the south will see readings trend closer
to normal.

next week onward.  The progressive pattern in place ahead of this
evolution and then a late period frontal system expected to drop
into the Northwest will likely produce multiple days of active
weather over the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies.
Meaningful precipitation could extend farther south over parts of
the West late in the period depending on specifics of shortwave
energy.  Systems carried along in the mean flow downstream will
produce areas of precipitation to the east of the Rockies but
likely with light to moderate totals.

The forecast remains fairly agreeable and consistent for about the
first half of the period when a composite of 00Z/06Z operational
runs (with least weight on the CMC) depicts the features of
interest well.  A leading wave should track from the central
Plains through the Great Lakes, most likely followed by triple
point/coastal development leading to a surface low near Downeast
Maine or Nova Scotia by early day 5 Tuesday.  This evolution has
been consistent in the ensemble means in addition to most models.
The 00Z CMC was weaker/sheared with this system versus other
guidance but the new run has adjusted to consensus.  Then a strong
jet pushing across the northern tier states and southern Canada
will support Canadian low pressure and frontal system crossing the
northern U.S. during the first half of next week.  The majority
cluster is now more agreeable on a defined frontal wave near
northeastern Montana by early Tuesday, a trend toward recent ECMWF
runs.

Models/ensembles increasingly diverge for energy expected to
descend into the West around Tuesday-Wednesday.  GFS/GEFS runs
have tended to be flatter with the 00Z runs becoming particularly
progressive.  Other models and ensemble systems have also varied
with the handling of this energy.  The 06Z GFS/GEFS mean made a
significant adjustment back toward the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean, with
a blend of these models and means ultimately providing a good
intermediate solution that is still a bit eastward of the 12Z/17
ECMWF and latest CMC runs that are on the slower/closed side of
the spectrum.  Interestingly there seems to be somewhat better
agreement and continuity for the upstream feature dropping into
the mean trough late in the week.  Farther east the consensus
hints at the aforementioned Montana wave continuing eastward
through the Upper Midwest/New England, with the trailing front
pushing somewhat farther southeast than continuity.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect areas from the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies
to see the heaviest precipitation during the period.  The highest
totals are likely to be from late weekend into early next week
with strong westerly flow enhancing rain/mountain snow over
western Washington and eventually reaching into parts of Oregon.
Northern Rockies snowfall will also be heavy but should not be
quite as extreme as over the Cascades.  Heading into midweek
precipitation should trend lighter as it spreads southeastward,
though some areas of meaningful precipitation could extend into or
near the central Rockies depending on shortwave/surface evolution
details.  Then a frontal system dropping in from the northeastern
Pacific should bring another episode of rain/mountain snow to the
Pacific Northwest by next Thursday.  Some locations along the most
favored terrain in western Washington may see several inches
liquid equivalent over the five-day period.  Meanwhile the pattern
will support breezy to windy conditions over areas from the
Northwest into the northern Plains through the first part of next
week.  Central Plains through New England low pressure and
associated frontal system will produce generally moderate wintry
precipitation during the first part of the week, most likely from
the Midwest into the Northeast. Areas of light to moderate rain
are likely farther south. Some lake effect snow will be possible
in the chilly cyclonic flow behind this system with locations to
the lee of Lake Ontario seeing the best potential for meaningful
accumulations.  After midweek another front should reach the
Plains/east-central U.S. with possible precipitation development
depending on still-uncertain details of shortwave energy ejecting
from the West and the amount of low level Gulf inflow ahead of the
front.

The pattern evolution during the period will provide some
variability to temperatures.  On Sunday moderately below normal
temperatures (generally 5-15F below normal) will linger over the
East Coast while similar negative anomalies spread across the
Interior West/Rockies into the Plains behind the wave tracking out
of the central Plains.  Aside from a modified form of this latter
airmass reaching the east-central U.S. Monday-early Tuesday,
temperatures over the South/East should trend to near or somewhat
above normal levels over the course of the week.  Northern tier
areas will see a pronounced warming trend during the first part of
the week with the northern Plains most likely to see plus 10-20F
anomalies for both max/min readings while min temps should be more
likely to reach that threshold farther east and west.  The Pacific
upper ridge that may extend into the West early in the week should
support a brief period of warmth over the Great Basin/Southwest,
peaking with some highs 10-15F above normal on Tuesday.  By next
Wednesday-Thursday expect upper troughing that develops over the
West to spread colder temperatures (up to 10-15F below normal)
from the Northwest/northern Rockies into the central
Rockies/Plains.  Areas to the south will see readings trend closer
to normal.

153 AM EST Fri Feb 19 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 22 2021 - 12Z Fri Feb 26 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

A relatively progressive upper flow pattern will be in place for
the beginning of the week as the eastern U.S. trough departs.
This will be followed by zonal flow across much of the central and
eastern U.S. ahead of an amplifying western U.S. trough by
Wednesday.  A second trough will likely follow for the Pacific
Northwest by the end of the week.

The 00Z model guidance suite is overall in above average agreement
on the synoptic scale pattern through Tuesday.  By Wednesday and
beyond, the CMC becomes a little more amplified with the western
U.S. trough and is slower to lift it out by the end of the
forecast period, and the 00Z GFS parallel is quite strong with the
second trough/closed low approaching the Pacific Northwest by
Thursday, but is competitive elsewhere across the continental U.S.
 For the fronts and pressures forecast, the 18Z GFS parallel was
preferred over the operational 18Z GFS given some timing
differences with the pattern change across the West, with the
parallel version closer in line with the model consensus.  A blend
of the 12Z ECMWF/18Z parallel GFS/12Z CMC was used through early
Wednesday, and then discontinued CMC by Thursday and Friday and
more weighting towards the EC and GEFS means.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Things will be relatively uneventful across most regions of the
nation compared to the extreme winter weather that has been
endured by many locations this past week.  A departing storm
system across the East Coast region early in the week is expected
to produce mainly light to moderate rainfall, and some snow from
the northern Mid-Atlantic to New England.  The heaviest snow
should be confined to portions of upstate New York that get lake
effect snow in the wake of the departing low.  A stronger storm
system crossing the Pacific Northwest and the Rockies is expected
to produce heavy snow for the higher terrain of the Cascades, and
extending across northern Idaho, western Montana, western Wyoming,
and then central Colorado by the middle of the week, and will
likely affect much of the Interstate 25 corridor.

In the temperature department, the building trough and the passage
of the cold front across the Intermountain West will herald a
change to readings falling to 10-20 degrees below average for the
western High Plains to the Rockies, along not nearly as impressive
as the recent Arctic blast based on our current forecasts.
Temperatures will likely be 10-20 degrees above average ahead of
that same storm system across the northern Plains.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0117 AM CST Fri Feb 19 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough atop surface high pressure will traverse the
eastern CONUS through the period, bringing about cooler/moister
conditions that are expected to limit significant wildfire spread
conditions across much of the central and eastern CONUS. Some
breezy, occasionally dry conditions may be observed during the
afternoon across portions of the southwest U.S in conjunction with
the approach of another upper trough. However, the lack of receptive
fuels and marginally supportive surface winds/RH precludes any fire
weather highlights.

0120 AM CST Fri Feb 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure/cooler air, as well as recent widespread
accumulated precipitation, will serve to limit major wildfire spread
potential across much of the eastern CONUS during the Day 2/Saturday
period. Farther west, an upper trough will continue to deepen as it
overspreads the southwest into central CONUS and fosters surface lee
troughing in the southern High Plains through the day. Dry downslope
flow along the lee of the Southern Rockies, and strong, dry gradient
flow across portions of southern California into central and
southern Arizona/New Mexico are expected. Surface sustained winds
may exceed 20 mph across much of the southwest, with several locales
potentially seeing RH drop as low as 15-20% in spots. While such
conditions typically warrant at least an Elevated delineation, the
lack of more receptive fuels to fire spread suggests that fire
weather highlights are not needed at this time.

...Light snow and freezing rain to linger across the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic through today...

...Central/Southern Plains begin to thaw out heading into the
weekend...

A much quieter weather period is in store for the CONUS over the
next few days. The current system that is bringing snow and
freezing rain to the Northeast and northern Mid-Atlantic, as well
as rain and thunderstorms to the Southeast will taper off today
while lingering snow showers will continue over much of the
interior Northeast and New England through Saturday. A general
area of 1-3 inches of additional snowfall is possible for the
Northeast today while places downwind of the Lower Great Lakes may
receive between 4-8 inches of snow over the next couple of days.
Freezing rain impacts will be minimal. Meanwhile, snow will
continue for the western mountains over the next couple of days as
an upper-level disturbance moves through the region. Rain will
impact the coast extending up from California through the Pacific
Northwest. The northern Cascades could see over a foot of snow
while parts of the Cascades, Sierra and Rockies may see between
6-10 inches of snow through Saturday. Winter Storm Warnings and
Advisories are in effect for parts of the Cascades and Northern
Rockies.

An anomalously cold week across the Southern Plains will begin to
come to an end this weekend as an approaching area of low pressure
pulls warmer air northward out ahead of it on Saturday. Before
that, though, widespread low temperature records may be broken
tonight over parts of eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi
Valley as high pressure spread into the eastern half of the
country.Temperatures will remain below average for much of the
heartland today

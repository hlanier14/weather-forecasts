Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1052 AM CST Tue Nov 23 2021

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN WYOMING INTO THE
WESTERN NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO AND
NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO...

The primary change to this outlook was to join both Elevated areas
across northeastern Colorado, where critically low RH is expected.
While winds are somewhat marginal across this area, the presence of
critically dry fuels and abnormally dry conditions warrants the
inclusion of Elevated highlights. Elsewhere, the two Critical areas
remain unchanged, where strong westerly surface winds (20 to 25 mph
with higher gusts) will coincide with critically dry RH amid highly
receptive fuels. For further details on the High Plains
wildfire-spread threat, please see the forecast discussion below.

Farther east across portions of Georgia and South Carolina, a cool
and dry post-frontal airmass will support Elevated to Critical RH
this afternoon, as also suggested by some of the latest surface
observations. Finer fuels are gradually drying across the region.
However, relatively weak northerly surface winds will generally
limit a more widespread wildfire-spread threat, precluding
fire-weather highlights at this time.

..Weinman/Squitieri.. 11/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CST Tue Nov 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move eastward across the West today
bringing enhanced southwesterly to westerly flow aloft to much of
the High Plains.  At the surface, low pressure is forecast to deepen
over eastern South Dakota by late afternoon with a pressure trough
extending southwestward back to the southern Colorado-Kansas border.

...Eastern Wyoming, Southern South Dakota, and Northern Nebraska...
Enhanced westerly flow aloft overspreading the area will begin
mixing down to the surface as the boundary layer warms/deepens
through the day, resulting in strong and gusty winds.  Given the
very dry airmass in place (PW values less than 0.25"), RH values
will fall into the single digits over most of the area.  Critical
fire weather conditions are forecast over portions of southeastern
Wyoming into the western Nebraska Panhandle, where the best overlap
of strong winds (20-25 mph sustained westerlies with 40 mph gusts)
and low RH (<10%) is likely to occur during the afternoon hours.

...Adjacent Portions of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New
Mexico...
Similar fire weather conditions will also develop farther south.
The most likely overlap of low RH (<10%) and sustained 20 mph
surface winds is for favored downslope regions of southeastern
Colorado and northeastern New Mexico.  Farther east into the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles and Western Kansas/Oklahoma (i.e., east of
the surface trough), the RH values are likely to stay above critical
thresholds, though the strong pressure gradient there will favor
widespread southerly winds over 20 mph.  Given the relatively dry
fuels and lack of recent rainfall, elevated fire weather conditions
are likely.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
203 PM EST Tue Nov 23 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Nov 26 2021 - 12Z Tue Nov 30 2021

...Overview...

A relatively stagnant upper-level pattern is expected in the
medium range period, with mean troughing for the eastern half of
the U.S. and quasi-zonal flow shifting to ridging by the weekend
across much of the West, except for a southern stream low
gradually making its way across northern Mexico and the Southwest
as it weakens. This pattern should be relatively dry across much
of the contiguous U.S., with the exception of waves of
precipitation over the Pacific Northwest through the period, as
well as some precipitation coming in across eastern trough,
including a round of moderate to heavy lake effect and interior
Northeast snow Friday into Saturday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to show above average agreement on the large
scale flow pattern described above particularly through the
weekend, and a multi-model deterministic blend of the 00Z ECMWF,
CMC, UKMET, and 00Z/06Z GFS was used early in the period. Greater
differences arise with energy digging through the western side of
the trough serving to reload it. The first shortwave with
significant differences between models shows up in the Great Lakes
around Sunday, with another possibly diving toward the Northern
Plains around Monday or Tuesday. The latter shortwave spins up a
closed 500mb low across the Great Lakes region in the 00Z ECMWF by
Tuesday; a hint of this is shown by the 00Z GFS and a weaker
version is shown by the new 12Z ECMWF. Ensemble guidance shows a
bit of a split with GEFS members having more ridging across the
north-central U.S. and EC ensemble members showing more troughing.
So uncertainty is still high with these features. At the surface,
there is still a possibility of a surface low to spin up and
deepen over the Atlantic Monday into Tuesday, but the timing and
strength of the low vary. Ensemble means are weaker, as expected,
with the low but do provide a nice middle ground solution at this
time, particularly the 00Z GEFS and EC means that were right on
top of each other. Incoming 12Z guidance appears it may be more
clustered with this low. The WPC forecast for these features
shifted from a deterministic blend early on toward utilizing more
of the GEFS and EC mean solutions as the period progressed.

Some differences between models also remain with the track and
timing of the southern stream mid-upper low tracking northeastward
from Baja California into the Southwest. 00/06Z GFS runs linger a
closed low longer than other guidance, but all guidance has a
general weakening trend as the period progresses. Additionally,
the precise orientation of an atmospheric river event this weekend
into British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest just north of the
low amplitude ridging remains in question--GFS have generally kept
the greater integrated water vapor transport confined to western
Canada, while the 00Z ECMWF brings it into the Pacific Northwest.
This will have an impact on how much rain impacts the Olympics and
northern Cascades versus the bulk of the precipitation staying
north in British Columbia, increasing uncertainty. For these
features, a multi-model blend sufficed to minimize differences and
produced a middle ground solution at this point, and will continue
to monitor.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As the period begins Friday, a cold front exiting the East Coast
will bring westerly flow to the Great Lakes region and the
Northeast, favorable conditions for lake effect and interior
Northeast (particularly higher elevation) snow through Saturday.
Moderate to locally heavy snow amounts downwind of Lake Ontario,
the Adirondacks, and northern New England are possible. Meanwhile,
a plume of moisture/atmospheric river coming into the Pacific
Northwest could bring another round of moderate to locally heavy
rains to parts of western Washington, with the heaviest totals
likely along favorable terrain. Lighter precipitation should spill
over into northern parts of the Rockies as well this weekend but
quickly dry out early next week. Then another round of
precipitation is forecast for the Pacific Northwest by around
Tuesday. The remainder of the country should remain fairly dry
through the weekend and into next week. A weak system moving
through the Ohio Valley into the East may bring some light
precipitation to the region but nothing looks particularly
impactful at this time.

A building trough over the East should keep temperatures below
normal through the entire five day period with the greatest
anomalies (-10 to -15F) likely on Friday into Saturday from south
Texas/lower Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley and
Mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, amplified ridging will promote a warming
trend across the West and into the Plains with several days of +10
to +20 anomalies (locally higher) likely, especially across parts
of the northern and central High Plains Sunday and Monday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
203 PM EST Tue Nov 23 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Nov 26 2021 - 12Z Tue Nov 30 2021

...Overview...

A relatively stagnant upper-level pattern is expected in the
medium range period, with mean troughing for the eastern half of
the U.S. and quasi-zonal flow shifting to ridging by the weekend
across much of the West, except for a southern stream low
gradually making its way across northern Mexico and the Southwest
as it weakens. This pattern should be relatively dry across much
of the contiguous U.S., with the exception of waves of
precipitation over the Pacific Northwest through the period, as
well as some precipitation coming in across eastern trough,
including a round of moderate to heavy lake effect and interior
Northeast snow Friday into Saturday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to show above average agreement on the large
scale flow pattern described above particularly through the
weekend, and a multi-model deterministic blend of the 00Z ECMWF,
CMC, UKMET, and 00Z/06Z GFS was used early in the period. Greater
differences arise with energy digging through the western side of
the trough serving to reload it. The first shortwave with
significant differences between models shows up in the Great Lakes
around Sunday, with another possibly diving toward the Northern
Plains around Monday or Tuesday. The latter shortwave spins up a
closed 500mb low across the Great Lakes region in the 00Z ECMWF by
Tuesday; a hint of this is shown by the 00Z GFS and a weaker
version is shown by the new 12Z ECMWF. Ensemble guidance shows a
bit of a split with GEFS members having more ridging across the
north-central U.S. and EC ensemble members showing more troughing.
So uncertainty is still high with these features. At the surface,
there is still a possibility of a surface low to spin up and
deepen over the Atlantic Monday into Tuesday, but the timing and
strength of the low vary. Ensemble means are weaker, as expected,

FOR WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 01 - TUESDAY DECEMBER 07: Following the predicted
break-down of a 500-hPa blocking ridge to the south of Greenland during
week-1,
dynamical models continue to advertise a more transitional mid-level patter=
n
over North America heading into December. Relative to yesterday's guidance,
there are differences between the latest ensemble means in regards to the
evolution of predicted mid-level week-2 features, leading to added uncertai=
nty
in today's outlook. While the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensembles favor
troughing shifting southeastward from the Gulf of Alaska, this morning's EC=
MWF
and Canadian favor much of the anomalous ridging downstream to retrograde
westward over the southwestern U.S. and eastern Pacific, allowing for the
development of downstream negative height departures over the central and
eastern CONUS by days 10 and 11 (Dec 3-4). The 0z and 6z GEFS keep the
anomalous ridging over the central CONUS (albeit relatively weak), with muc=
h
of
the negative height departures focused over western Canada and the
northwestern
CONUS through the middle of the period. Over Alaska, guidance continues to
depict a fairly amplified ridge/trough pattern over the northern Pacific to
help keep temperatures on the cold side across much of the state.



Despite these differences in dynamical models, enhanced Pacific onshore flo=
w
remains favored and is likely to lead to above-normal precipitation across =
the
northwestern CONUS. The latest Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT) tool contin=
ues
to reflect some atmospheric river potential, where reforecast tools maintai=
n
at
least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percent=
ile
and 2 inches (1 inch) over the Pacific Northwest (northern California and
Northern Rockies) during the period. Thus, the pair of slight risk areas fo=
r
heavy precipitation remain posted for the northern half of the West Coast a=
nd
the Northern Rockies for the entirety of week-2. The increased potential fo=
r
atmospheric river activity also supports maintaining a slight risk of high
winds over the northwestern CONUS, which is also supported by the GEFS
reforecast tool, which depicts at least a 20% chance of sustained winds
exceeding the 85th percentile through the middle of the period. Periods of
heavy precipitation during week-2 may trigger localized flooding over parts=
 of
western Washington, where streamflow and soil moisture content are currentl=
y
registering in highest percentiles due to antecedent above-normal
precipitation. Although localized flooding is possible further south, the
increased precipitation is likely to aid in continued drought recovery for
portions of western Oregon and northern California where D0 to D4 condition=
s
remain designated in the U.S. Drought Monitor. No heavy snow hazards are
posted
in the outlook due to the absence of anomalous cold signals in the model
guidance over the northwestern CONUS, however high elevation snowfall acros=
s
the Sierra Nevadas, Cascades and Bitterroot Mountains cannot be ruled out
given
the abundance of available moisture forecast.



East of the Rockies, the ECMWF favors surface low formation over the Great
Plains tied to the aforementioned development of anomalous trouging over th=
e
central CONUS during the middle of the period. With surface high pressure a=
lso
forecast over the western Atlantic conducive for an enhanced moisture feed
over
the southeastern CONUS, both the raw ECMWF ensemble and the ECMWF reforecas=
t
tool show an elevated potential for heavy precipitation across the Lower
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and the Southeast during days 10 an=
d
11
(Dec 3-4).  However, given the novelty of this realization, and a lack of
support from the GEFS guidance, no precipitation hazards are designated,
however this scenario will continue to be monitored in upcoming outlooks.



Over Alaska, prevailing mid-level northerly flow from the Bering Sea is
anticipated to promote below normal temperatures where large negative
temperature anomalies (-12 to -20 degrees F) continue to be depicted in the
ensemble means. The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools maintain at least a 20%
chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below
zero
degrees (F) to support the continuation of the slight risk of much below
normal
temperatures through the middle of week-2 (Dec 5) for much of the state.
Higher
probabilities (>40%) for minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile
remain evident across the western Mainland early in the period, supporting =
the
continuation of a moderate risk for much below normal temperatures from Dec
1-2. By day 10 (Dec 3), probabilities in the reforecast guidance lessen,
indicative of a moderation of temperatures as the mid-level pattern is
expected
to become more zonal.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 PM CST Tue Nov 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

Critical highlights were added to portions of southern California
from the Ventura Valley to the Santa Ana Mountains for tomorrow
afternoon. From 18Z onward, 20+ mph offshore surface winds and 15%
RH will develop and continue into the overnight hours to 12Z
Thursday. Critical conditions are expected to persist into Day
3/Thursday, and higher Critical probabilities will be introduced in
the upcoming Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook to address this threat.

A slight northward expansion was made to the Elevated area in the
southern High Plains. 15+ mph northerly surface winds and 15-20% RH
are still expected behind the cold front during the afternoon hours.

..Weinman/Squitieri.. 11/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CST Tue Nov 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
As an upper-level trough moves across the central U.S. on Wednesday,
an upper-level ridge is forecast to build into the Great Basin.  At
the surface, a low pressure system will move eastward across the
Great Lakes Region while an associated cold front extending
south-southwestward slowly advances eastward across the southern
Plains.  In the wake of this cold front, high pressure is forecast
to build over the central Great Basin enhancing the surface pressure
gradient across Southern California.

...Southern California...
Offshore flow will develop once again over Southern California by
early Wednesday morning.  By Wednesday afternoon, the upper-level
flow is forecast to be more northeasterly over Southern California
lending support to downslope, offshore flow.  Critical RH values
appear likely and sustained winds approaching 20 mph appear
probable, especially for terrain-favored locations.  Though the
event is forecast to peak Thursday morning, an upgrade to critical
may be warranted on Wednesday in later updates.

...Adjacent Portions of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New
Mexico...
In the wake of a cold frontal passage on Wednesday morning, strong
northerly winds (15-20 mph) are likely across portions of the High
Plains.  Initially, these strong winds will be coincident with low
RH values (<20%) until cooling and moistening raise the RH values in
the late afternoon. As a result, elevated fire weather conditions
are likely during the early afternoon.

...Coastal rain and higher elevation snow for the Pacific
Northwest...

...Snow of the Upper Great Lakes starting Wednesday evening into
Thanksgiving...

...Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Central/Southern High Plains...

A front extending from the Northern Plains roughly southwestward
to Southern California will move eastward to the Lower Great Lakes
and southward to the Central/Western Gulf Coast by Thanksgiving.
Energy associated with the system will produce light snow over
parts of the Northern Intermountain Region/Northern Rockies
Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning.  Early on Wednesday
morning, light snow will develop over parts of the Central Rockies
and parts of the Southern Rockies. Concurrently, rain showers
develop over parts of the Southwest and lower elevations of the
Southern Rockies, ending by overnight Wednesday.  Additionally, a
reinforcing front will move southward across the U. S./Canadian
border overnight Tuesday, producing light snow over parts of the
Northern Plains that will taper off by Wednesday evening.  The
snow will result in reduced visibility and hazardous driving
conditions.  By Wednesday evening, the front will dissipate while
reinforcing the lead front over the Upper Great Lakes.
Furthermore, light snow will develop over the Upper Great Lakes on
Wednesday evening and expand over Michigan's Lower Peninsula on
Thanksgiving; snowfall amounts will be higher near the Lakes.

Moreover, moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will start to
stream northward ahead of the lead front overnight Tuesday into
Wednesday. As a result, rain will develop along the front late
Wednesday night from parts of Michigan's Lower Peninsula to
Arkansas.  Rain and thunderstorms will also develop along and
ahead of the front over parts of the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley on early Thanksgiving morning into the evening.

Meanwhile, over the Central and Southern High Plains, warm
temperatures, dry fuels, and gusty wind will aid in creating a
Critical Risk of fire weather over the region through Wednesday
morning.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 29 - DEC 03, 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement ear=
ly in the period in
depicting
an amplified 500-hPa flow pattern across the forecast domain. However, a
potential pattern change leads to a substantial increase in uncertainty by =
the
end of the period. In the mean mid-level height fields, strong ridging near
the
western Aleutians is forecast, leading to anticipated troughing downstream
across western Mainland Alaska. Anomalous ridging is likely farther to the
south across the western two-thirds of the CONUS. Mean troughing is predict=
ed
along the Eastern Seaboard. In general, these overall features are forecast=
 to
progress eastward and deamplify during the period. The ridge forecast acros=
s
the western two-thirds of the CONUS early is forecast to weaken and
potentially
break down completely across the Plains by the end of the period. As the
western ridge flattens, enhanced Pacific Flow is forecast to become more
likely
across the Pacific Northwest. The trough over Mainland Alaska is forecast t=
o
progress eastward, potentially reaching the Panhandle by Day 10. As this
trough
progresses eastward, increased ridging is forecast in its wake later in the
period across the Bering Sea.

Troughing forecast over Alaska leads to increased chances of below normal
temperatures across most of the state, with probabilities exceeding 60 perc=
ent
for much of the western Mainland. Ridging over the western two-thirds of th=
e
CONUS early in the period favors above normal temperatures from the West Co=
ast
to the Plains. Conversely, troughing predicted over the Eastern Seaboard le=
ads
to increased chances of below normal temperatures for much of the eastern
quarter of the CONUS, particularly early in the period.

The potential for enhanced Pacific flow, particularly later in the period,
increases chances of above normal precipitation for the northwestern CONUS.
Ridging and surface high pressure are expected early in the period across m=
uch
of the remainder of the CONUS, favoring below normal precipitation. An
exception is for parts of southern Texas, where above normal precipitation
chances are slightly elevated ahead of a weak trough forecast over northern
Mexico. Above normal precipitation is likely for much of southeastern Alask=
a,
ahead of mean surface low pressure predicted over the Gulf of Alaska. Offsh=
ore
flow to the northwest of this low leads to increased chances of below norma=
l
precipitation across western Alaska.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a
good
agreement on a predicted amplified 500-hPa flow pattern early in the period=
,
offset by substantially increased uncertainty later in the period associate=
d
with a potential pattern change.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 01 - 07 2021

The potential for a significant pattern change and associated substantial
uncertainty exists for the week-2 period. The AO and NAO indices are both
forecast by the GEFS to switch from negative to positive. However,
teleconnections on one of the most prominent height anomalies in the predic=
ted
500-hPa height pattern over the Northern Hemisphere (a negative center over
Europe) strongly favor above normal heights near Greenland, consistent with
the
negative phase of the AO. Early in the period, agreement is fairly good amo=
ng
the models with troughs predicted across Alaska and the northeastern CONUS,
and
ridging forecast from the southwestern CONUS to parts of the Plains.
Thereafter, model uncertainty increases rapidly with the potential pattern
change as major mode differences become evident by the middle of week-2 acr=
oss
much of the CONUS. These differences are punctuated by large disagreements
among the model guidance related to the potential for trough development ov=
er
the central CONUS around Day 10, with the ECMWF ensemble in favor and the G=
EFS
opposed. Models are in agreement on a general de-amplification of the overa=
ll
pattern by the end of the period. With this de-amplification, enhanced Paci=
fic
Flow is forecast to become more dominant across much of the West Coast.
Upstream, strong troughing over Alaska is expected to persist early in the
period, but weaken and push eastward by the end of week-2.

Increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast to persist into
week-2 for most of Alaska. Ridging early in the period, and a general
low-amplitude pattern thereafter, leads to increased chances of above-norma=
l
temperatures across most of the CONUS from the Mississippi Valley westward.
Near to below normal temperatures are favored for the eastern quarter of th=
e
CONUS, as a trough predicted over the Eastern Seaboard early in the period
pushes offshore. Near normal temperatures are favored for the Pacific
Northwest
eastward across the Northern Tier of the CONUS as above normal temperatures
early in the period potentially give way to a colder pattern due to possibl=
e
height falls during the middle and latter parts of the forecast period.

As the overall pattern transitions to a more zonal orientation, enhanced
Pacific Flow is increasingly likely across much of the West Coast.
Additionally, teleconnections from an upstream ridge predicted near the
Aleutians presents a very strong wet signal across much of the West Coast. =
Due
to these factors, above normal precipitation is favored across most of the
northwestern CONUS eastward to the Northern Plains and southward along much=
 of
the West Coast. Below normal precipitation is slightly favored to the south
and
east from the Southwest eastward to the Central and Southern Plains, due
primarily to the ridging forecast early in the period. Below normal
precipitation is also favored for parts of the Southeast due to surface hig=
h
pressure predicted behind a departing trough. Uncertainty is high for the
western Gulf Coast region and the Mississippi Valley, as the ECMWF ensemble=
s
indicate the potential for return flow and enhanced moisture behind the
predicted surface high over the Southeast while the GEFS forecasts a drier
solution. A dry pattern is likely for much of Mainland Alaska and parts of =
the
Aleutians, due to the potential for mean northerly mid-level flow ahead of =
a
ridge predicted over the Bering Sea.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean

Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Much below average, 1 out of 5=
,
due to the potential for a significant pattern change during the period and
associated substantial model disagreements.

FORECASTER: Scott H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
155 AM EST Wed Nov 24 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Nov 27 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 01 2021

...Overview...

The upper level flow during the medium range period should remain
mostly stagnant and amplified consisting of mean troughing in the
East and ridging out West. A southern stream upper low over Baja
California on Saturday should weaken with the leftover energy
shifting into the southern Plains and eventually being absorbed by
the Eastern U.S. trough. A couple of shortwaves into the Eastern
trough should help reinforce it through the period. General
ridging should persist out West, though periodically may be
interrupted by weak waves of shortwave energy.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to show good agreement on the large scale flow
pattern but offer plenty of uncertainty still in the details.
Early on, there are some timing/intensity differences with
reloading energy into the Eastern trough, which eventually results
in some placement differences of a deepening low pressure system
off the Northeast coast. The latest GFS is stronger with the
system, while the CMC is farthest south. By day 5/Monday, the GFS
and CMC are a little bit stronger with a shortwave moving into the
Pacific Northwest, which eventually propagates downstream into the
Eastern trough, and offers additional differences in
evolution/shape of the Eastern trough late period. By that point
though, there's enough run to run variability in the models that
leaning more on the ensemble means seems to be the best for now.

The WPC forecast used a general deterministic model blend for days
3-5 amidst decent model agreement. Thereafter, more weighting
towards the ensemble means were used to help mitigate some of the
smaller scale, hard to resolve, detail. Did maintain modest
amounts of the ECMWF and GFS just for some added system
definition. This approach maintains good continuity with the
previous WPC forecast for days 3-6.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Westerly flow across the still relatively warm Great Lakes on
Saturday should provide favorable conditions for lake effect and
interior Northeast (particularly higher elevation) snow. Moderate
to locally heavy snow amounts downwind of Lake Ontario, the
Adirondacks, and northern New England are possible. Meanwhile, a
plume of moisture/atmospheric river coming into the Pacific
Northwest could bring another round of moderate to locally heavy
rains to parts of western Washington, with the heaviest totals
likely along favorable terrain. Lighter precipitation should spill
over into northern parts of the Rockies as well this weekend but
quickly dry out early next week. Then another round of
precipitation is forecast for the Pacific Northwest by around next
Tuesday. The remainder of the country should remain fairly dry
through the weekend and into next week. A weak system moving
through the Ohio Valley into the East and energy across the
southern Plains may bring some light precipitation to these
regions but nothing looks particularly impactful at this time.

A building trough over the East should keep temperatures below
normal through Monday with some moderation back towards normal on
Tuesday and Wednesday. Meanwhile, amplified ridging will promote a
warming trend across the West and into the Plains with several
days of +15 to +25 anomalies (locally higher) likely, especially
across parts of the northern and central Plains Sunday and Monday
and again on Wednesday.

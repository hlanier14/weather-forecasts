Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1013 AM CDT Tue Mar 15 2022

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

The forecast remains on track with only slight adjustments needed.
Despite early morning fog and/or decent overnight RH recovery across
NE, 12Z regional soundings show shallow moisture under a relatively
dry residual layer. This shallow moisture should mix out through by
early afternoon amid ample diurnal warming. Southwesterly winds will
gradually increase over the next several hours as the lee trough
along the central/northern High Plains continues to deepen. Slight
expansions of the Elevated were made across northeast NE and
northeast NM where latest guidance has increased probability for
elevated conditions. Periods of localized critical conditions remain
probable across central NE this afternoon, as outlined in the
previous discussion below.

..Moore.. 03/15/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1236 AM CDT Tue Mar 15 2022/

...Synopsis...
Flow aloft across much of the West and Plains will become more zonal
today. A low-amplitude trough in the northern Rockies will spur lee
troughing across the High Plains region. The pressure gradient will
be stronger to the north and weaken with southward extent. In the
wake of a weak cold front, dry air will be in place across the
Plains.

...Nebraska...
Dry and windy conditions are expected during the afternoon. Given
the proximity to the stronger low-level troughing, greater surface
to 2 km winds are expected. Sustained winds will likely reach 15-20
mph, though 20-25 mph winds may occur locally for a brief time. RH
varies within guidance, but areas with as low as 15-20% are
possible. With that said, locally critical fire weather is certainly
possible, particularly within the Sand Hills vicinity. Otherwise,
elevated to near critical conditions are expected on a broader basis
due to very dry fuels.

...Central High Plains...
Though surface troughing will not be overly strong, 15 mph winds are
forecast nearly uniformly by guidance along and near the
Kansas-Colorado border. Due to the potential for RH of 10-15% over
very dry fuels, elevated fire weather concerns will exist during the
afternoon.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
123 PM EDT Tue Mar 15 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 18 2022 - 12Z Tue Mar 22 2022

...Overview...

A relatively progressive flow pattern with increasing amplitude is
expected to be in place across the continental U.S. through the
upcoming weekend.  The initial system over the Central Plains
Friday will be tracking northeastward to the Great Lakes and then
the Northeast through Sunday. By late in the weekend to next
Monday, a much stronger and amplified trough will progress across
the western U.S., and then reaching the Plains by late Monday and
into Tuesday, with the overall pattern becoming a bit less
progressive by then. This will likely bring widespread, beneficial
rains to the western U.S., and evolve into a potentially strong
storm system over the Lower/Middle Mississsippi Valley by the end
of the forecast period. No significant arctic air intrusions are
currently expected, and temperatures will generally oscillate
between near normal and well above normal ahead of the various
waves of low pressure.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The 00z guidance suite was in good agreement regarding the
evolution of the synoptic scale pattern across the lower 48 during
the medium range period. Therefore, a general model blend of the
00z EC/CMC/UKMET and the 06z GFS were applied through day 5. The
06z GFS was phased out by days 6 & 7 due to a markedly deeper
upper-trough over the West compared to model consensus. An
ensemble blend consisting of the ECE/GEFS/CMCE with some 00z
deterministic EC were utilized for days 6 & 7.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The next system moving across the Plains could bring some moderate
to locally heavy rainfall and scattered thunderstorms to parts of
the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Southeast on Friday. A new system
will emerge over the Pacific Northwest on Friday, spreading much
needed rain showers across the lower elevations of the Pacific
Northwest/northern California as well as mountain snow over the
Cascades and Rockies through Saturday. The surface wave will then
strengthen beneath an amplifying upper-level trough on Sunday,
allowing for snow and rain to blanket the Rockies through Monday.
Moderate to heavy rainfall will spread into the Southern Plains on
Monday before expanding into the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valleys
on Tuesday. The amplified synoptic pattern supports severe weather
activity over parts of eastern Texas into the ArkLaTex on Monday
before shifting into the central Gulf coast on Tuesday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Tue Mar 15 2022

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed.
Latest guidance has trended towards slightly higher probabilities
for elevated/critical conditions across western OK tomorrow
afternoon. Elevated conditions may develop as far east as the OK
I-35 corridor. Similarly, localized critical conditions are possible
across west/northwest OK by late afternoon as low to mid-level flow
increases. However, the potential for widespread critical conditions
remains rather limited. Concerns regarding fuel status across AZ/NM
remain valid. See the previous discussion below for details.

..Moore.. 03/15/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0120 AM CDT Tue Mar 15 2022/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will approach the Southwest during the
afternoon on Wednesday. At the surface, a southern High Plains low
will develop through the day. This low will shift south and east
with time.

...Southwest...
Portions of southeastern Arizona into southern New Mexico are most
likely to experience meteorologically critical conditions given the
proximity to the mid-level jet. Winds near 20 mph are probable along
with 10-20% RH. With fuels only near seasonally normal dryness,
potential for large fires will be mitigated to some extent. Critical
highlights will be withheld for that reason.

...Southern Plains...
The deepening surface low in within the Texas Panhandle should aid
in 15-20 mph winds occurring across a broad portion of western Texas
into western Oklahoma. Slightly higher speeds may occur due to
terrain enhancement or stronger 850 mb winds in Oklahoma. RH will
range from 10% in western Texas to near 25% in western/central
Oklahoma. Lack of stronger winds precludes critical highlights.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue March 15 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 21 - 25 2022

Today's model solutions are in general good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. A strong ridge is favored over the Bering Sea and downstream
troughing and associated below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast across the
Gulf of Alaska, extending north to Mainland Alaska. A ridge and associated
above normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over the western CONUS. Troughing
and below normal 500-hPa heights are predicted across the central CONUS. Above
normal heights associated with ridging are forecast over the eastern CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are likely for parts of the Northern and Central
Great Basin, Southwest,  Central and Southern Rockies, and Southern High
Plains
underneath enhanced northerly mid-level flow. Ridging and above normal
500-hPaheights lead to increased odds of above normal temperatures for the
western CONUS. Ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights also increase the
likelihood of above normal temperatures for most of the eastern and central
CONUS, supported by most of the dynamical forecast tools. Near to below normal
temperatures are likely for Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, associated with
predicted troughing. Above normal temperatures are forecast over the Alaska
Panhandle, consistent with the consolidation temperature tool.

Below normal precipitation is likely for most of western and central Mainland
Alaska, and the Aleutians, downstream of a ridge predicted over the Bering
Sea,
while above normal precipitation is favored for the Alaska Panhandle and parts
of southeastern Mainland Alaska due to the troughing. Below normal
precipitation is most likely for much of the western CONUS and parts of
southwestern Texas, associated with predicted riding over the western CONUS.
Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the central and eastern
CONUS, due to a predicted trough over the central CONUS and potential for
return flow moisture advecting northward to the west of surface high pressure
forecast over the Atlantic.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About Average, 3 out of 5, due to
general good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation
pattern,
offset by some disagreement in the forecast temperature and precipitation
fields in the forecast tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 23 - 29 2022

During the 8-14 day period, the predicted week-2 mean 500-hPa circulation
pattern features ridging over the Bering Sea and troughing across the Gulf of
Alaska, extending north to southern Mainland Alaska. Downstream, ridging and
associated above normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over much of the western
CONUS. Conversely, below normal heights associated with troughing are forecast
over the eastern CONUS.

Elevated probabilities of near to above normal temperatures are likely over
much of the western and central CONUS due to riding and above normal 500-hPa
heights. Below normal temperature is likely for parts of the Upper Mississippi
Valley underneath the predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights.
Below normal temperature is also favored over parts of southern Texas and the
Lower Mississippi Valley, supported by most of the dynamical forecast tools.
Ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights also increase the likelihood of near
to above normal temperatures for most of the eastern CONUS. Near normal
temperatures are likely for Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians.  Above normal
temperatures are forecast over the Alaska Panhandle, consistent with the
consolidation temperature tool.

A drier pattern is likely to continue into week-2 across northwestern Mainland
Alaska downstream of the ridging over the Bering Sea. Elevated probabilities
of
above normal precipitation are favored over the southeastern Mainland Alaska
and Alaska Panhandle due to predicted troughing. Below normal precipitation is
most likely for much of the western and central CONUS associated with
predicted
ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal precipitation is
favored
for  the eastern CONUS, due to a predicted trough over the eastern CONUS and
potential for return flow moisture advecting northward to the west of surface
high pressure forecast over the Atlantic.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About Average, 3 out of 5, due to
general good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation
pattern,
offset by some disagreement in the forecast temperature and precipitation
fields in the forecast tools.


FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 18 - TUESDAY MARCH 22:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vCGcVB0528lX1TjxCdHzYC7E8SiCnladh12IjDTaLCEWETp2ZaPkNERB9DqaAGFoN6lIdmm2$

FOR WEDNESDAY MARCH 23 - TUESDAY MARCH 29: There is good multi-model agreement
among the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means depicting amplified
mid-level troughing with the trough axis extending across the Mississippi
Valley and Southern Plains at the outset of the period. This feature is
anticipated to support the formation of a strong surface centered over the
Upper Midwest, with a trailing front extending to the Lower Mississippi
Valley.
This disturbance combined with ample moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico
associated with surface high pressure over the western Atlantic supports a
slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and
Lower Middle Mississippi Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and Southeast, Mar 23
to 24. There is relatively good agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast
tools indicating at least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulated precipitation
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch across the Lower Mississippi Valley
and Southeast, with the ECMWF reforecast tool extending this signal into parts
of the Eastern Seaboard. The highlighted slight risk area is expanded compared
to yesterday's forecast and incorporates the reforecast tools as well as
recent
deterministic GFS and ECMWF solutions and uncalibrated ensemble guidance.



Additionally, the aforementioned surface low and front combined with surface
high pressure over the western Atlantic may support enhanced wind speeds
across
portions of the East Coast and central and eastern Gulf Coast as the front
progresses eastward. A slight risk of high winds is posted initially for
portions of the Gulf Coast, Mar 23, followed by coastal parts of the East
Coast, Mar 23 to 24. The reforecast tools are in good agreement indicating at
least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph in
these risk areas. Anticipated heavy rainfall and the potential for a southerly
component to expected high wind speeds across the Lower Mississippi Valley may
lead to localized flooding, especially in areas currently experiencing
flooding.



Surface high pressure over the Interior West and surface low pressure across
the Upper Midwest may support a tightened pressure gradient across portions of
the Great Plains at the beginning of the period. Another surface low is
anticipated to form over the Northern Great Plains at the beginning of the
period, which could support high winds across the region. Therefore, a broad
area is highlighted across the Great Plains with a slight risk of episodes of
high winds, Mar 23 to 25. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at
least
a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph over the
Northern and Central Great Plains. Recent deterministic GFS and ECMWF runs
indicate the potential for wind speeds reaching at least 25 mph in an area
stretching from the Northern Great Plains into northern portions of the
Southern Great Plains.



The risk for much below normal temperatures across the Four Corners region is
removed in today's outlook, since the mid-level trough is expected to move
eastward by the start of the period, being replaced by ridging across eastern
third of the CONUS. In contrast, there is a potential for much above normal
temperatures across parts of the Desert Southwest at the beginning of week-2,
expanding to parts of southwestern Texas by the middle of the period. Both the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 Deg F in these areas. A risk
area is not posted for much below normal temperatures at this time, due to NWS
heat risk tools indicating relatively low anticipated impact for human health.
There is however an increased risk for worsening drought conditions and
wildfires due to these regions currently experiencing severe to extreme
drought
and antecedent and expected dry conditions, which is consistent with La Nina
heading into early spring.



Over Alaska, there is increasing uncertainty regarding the mid-level pattern.
The 0Z GEFS ensemble mean maintains mid-level troughing across the
southernmost
portions of the Mainland, whereas the 0Z ECMWF favors ridging across most of
the state. These differences translate to the GEFS reforecast tool lingering
elevated potential for minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th
percentile, whereas the ECMWF does not. Given high model discrepancy and the
anticipation that the greatest likelihood for much below normal temperatures
would occur prior to week-2, the much below normal temperature hazard is not
included in today's outlook. The reforecast tools have also pulled back the
signal for high wind potential, precluding a related wind hazard from being
posted for the Alaska Panhandle.

...Storm system continues to bring showers and thunderstorms to
the Southeast and eventually the Mid-Atlantic...

...Pacific disturbance ushers unsettled weather pattern into the
Northwest and the Rockies...

...April-like warmth returns to the Heartland, Great Lakes, and
Northeast; Elevated to Critical Risks for fire weather expected in
the Southwest and Southern High Plains...

...Severe weather threat ramps up from Texas to the Lower
Mississippi Valley Thursday...

A storm system bringing showers and thunderstorms from the central
Gulf Coast to Florida Tuesday will turn northeast on Wednesday,
with rounds of showers and thunderstorms stretching from southern
Virginia south into South Florida. A few storms may be severe, and
the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk for severe
weather for the chance of some gusty winds, hail, and an isolated
tornado. The severe threat begins to diminish by Thursday morning
as the storm system's warm sector moves offshore, but
thunderstorms will continue over the Carolinas and southern
Mid-Atlantic. In total, through early Thursday morning, most areas
from the central Gulf Coast to the Carolinas can expect 1 to 2
inches of rainfall with localized totals surpassing 2 inches where
the most intense convection transpires.

Farther west, a Pacific disturbance is directing moisture into the
Northwest as an upper trough deepens over the Central Rockies
Wednesday and a cold front moves eastward. Mountain snow/valley
rain will continue for the Cascades, northern Rockies, and
northern Great Basin overnight Tuesday, with the snow spreading
into the Central Rockies late Wednesday into early Thursday.
Higher peaks of the Cascades and northern Rockies may see up to
another 6-8 inches of snow through Wednesday Morning. Portions of
the Sawtooths, Bitterroots, Tetons, and the Rockies of western
Wyoming and central Colorado can expect 6 to 12 inches of snow
through Thursday morning, with the highest amounts expected in the
more northern mountain ranges.

Temperature-wise, a surge of above normal temperatures will expand
over the Plains and Midwest ahead of the Pacific system and cold
front. Daytime highs will soar into the 60s and 70s in the Great
Plains Wednesday, with 80s popping up in parts of the Southern
Plains. A warming trend is also expected in the Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley, and Northeast, with daytime highs ranging between 10 to 20
degrees above normal. In terms of fire weather, dry conditions and
occasionally gusty winds are favoring an Elevated Risk for fire
weather by the Storm Prediction Center Wednesday stretching from
the Southwest to the Southern High Plains. Cooler temperatures
will follow the southeastward moving cold front on Thursday for
portions of the Southern High Plains. However, there will be a
Critical Risk of fire weather Thursday across the Big Bend of
Texas, where conditions are already extreme dry and winds will
increase ahead of the cold front.

Finally, on Thursday, severe weather chances will ramp up from
Texas to the Lower Mississippi Valley ahead of a developing low
pressure system forming in the lee of the Rockies. This area of
low pressure will move east into the Red River Valley by Thursday
evening, with moisture surging northward from the Gulf ahead of
the low and southeastward moving cold front. The Storm Prediction
Center has highlighted a Slight Risk of severe weather from
northeastern Texas southeast to the Lower Mississippi Valley.
Widespread thunderstorms are expected to develop along and behind
the front beginning Thursday afternoon, with a risk for severe
wind gusts and large hail.

...Overview...

A relatively progressive flow pattern with increasing amplitude is
expected to be in place across the continental U.S. through the
upcoming weekend.  The initial system over the Central Plains
Friday will be tracking northeastward to the Great Lakes and then
the Northeast through Sunday. By late in the weekend to next
Monday, a much stronger and amplified trough will progress across
the western U.S., and then reaching the Plains by late Monday and
into Tuesday, with the overall pattern becoming a bit less
progressive by then. This will likely bring widespread, beneficial
rains to the western U.S., and evolve into a potentially strong
storm system over the Lower/Middle Mississsippi Valley by the end
of the forecast period. No significant arctic air intrusions are
currently expected, and temperatures will generally oscillate
between near normal and well above normal ahead of the various
waves of low pressure.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The 00z guidance suite was in good agreement regarding the
evolution of the synoptic scale pattern across the lower 48 during
the medium range period. Therefore, a general model blend of the
00z EC/CMC/UKMET and the 06z GFS were applied through day 5. The
06z GFS was phased out by days 6 & 7 due to a markedly deeper
upper-trough over the West compared to model consensus. An
ensemble blend consisting of the ECE/GEFS/CMCE with some 00z
deterministic EC were utilized for days 6 & 7.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The next system moving across the Plains could bring some moderate
to locally heavy rainfall and scattered thunderstorms to parts of
the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Southeast on Friday. A new system
will emerge over the Pacific Northwest on Friday, spreading much
needed rain showers across the lower elevations of the Pacific
Northwest/northern California as well as mountain snow over the
Cascades and Rockies through Saturday. The surface wave will then
strengthen beneath an amplifying upper-level trough on Sunday,
allowing for snow and rain to blanket the Rockies through Monday.
Moderate to heavy rainfall will spread into the Southern Plains on
Monday before expanding into the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valleys
on Tuesday. The amplified synoptic pattern supports severe weather
activity over parts of eastern Texas into the ArkLaTex on Monday
before shifting into the central Gulf coast on Tuesday.

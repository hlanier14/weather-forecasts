Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1050 AM CDT Tue Apr 19 2022

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN WYOMING INTO FAR WESTERN
NEBRASKA...

Elevated and Critical highlights have been extended farther
southwest in Arizona to reflect the latest guidance consensus. Some
high-level cirrus clouds are overspreading portions of the Southwest
into the High Plains. Nonetheless, adequate boundary-layer mixing
should still occur this afternoon, supporting 20+ mph sustained wind
speeds overlapping with 10-15 percent RH from southern Nevada into
Arizona, New Mexico, eastern Colorado, up to the Wyoming/Nebraska
border. Dry, occasionally breezy conditions atop dry fuels are also
still in the forecast across west-central parts of the Florida
Peninsula, where Elevated highlights have been maintained.

..Squitieri.. 04/19/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Tue Apr 19 2022/

...Synopsis...
A broad large-scale trough and enhanced deep-layer westerly flow
will overspread the western CONUS, favoring surface lee troughing
over the northern and central High Plains. Farther east, a dry
post-frontal airmass will be in place across the Southeast and
Florida Peninsula.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
As the enhanced deep-layer westerly flow overspreads the Southwest
and southern High Plains, efficient diurnal heating/mixing of a dry
antecedent airmass will result in widespread 10-15 percent minimum
RH. These dry boundary-layer conditions, combined with sustained
westerly surface winds of 20-30 mph atop dry/receptive fuels will
support critical fire-weather conditions.

...Eastern Wyoming into far western Nebraska...
Downslope warming/drying combined with diurnal heating will yield 15
percent RH during the afternoon. At the same time, the tight surface
pressure gradient peripheral to the deepening lee trough will favor
20-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds. Therefore, Critical
highlights are in place where dry fuels exist.

...Florida Peninsula...
A dry post-frontal airmass will encompass the Florida Peninsula,
where diurnal heating will result in 25-35 percent minimum RH over
the central and western portions of the peninsula. Northerly surface
winds near 10 mph are expected to overlap the critically low RH for
a few hours, warranting Elevated highlights.

...Northern Montana...
Sustained westerly surface winds near 30 mph (with higher gusts) are
expected in the lee of the higher terrain across northern Montana.
While strong downslope flow could contribute to 25 percent RH amid
the strong/gusty winds, generally unreceptive fuels should mitigate
the fire-weather risk.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 19 2022

SYNOPSIS: A substantial warm-up is forecast across much of the central and
eastern contiguous U.S. during the week-1 period underneath mid-level high
pressure. This is forecast to accelerate spring bloom across northern areas
that have seen limited growth thus far. However, by the start of week-2, th=
e
mid-level pattern is forecast to flip to a much colder pattern across the
East,
leading to a potential agricultural hazard across portions of the Midwest,
Ohio
Valley, and extending into the interior Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, where
following a short period of anomalously warm temperatures, minimum
temperatures
cold enough to support frost are forecast to become more likely over newly
susceptible vegetation. Mid-level low pressure forecast over the northeast
Pacific early in the period favors below normal temperatures across parts o=
f
the northwestern contiguous U.S., with the overall pattern predicted to bec=
ome
more zonal later in week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Upper a=
nd
Middle Mississippi Valley, southern Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Central
Appalachians, and the interior Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, Wed-Fri, Apr 27-=
29.

Slight risk for much below normal temperatures for portions of the Great
Plains, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, Appalachians, Great Lakes=
,
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, Wed-Tue, Apr 27-May 3.

Slight risk for much below normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Northern California, Northern Great Basin, and Northern Rockies,
Wed-Fri, Apr 27-29.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 22 - TUESDAY APRIL 26:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!t7v28_zn1i-31fVMAfo9pMbOdwe_uVQnYmOcKizcqm5PcRUVSeRAH-hSCCodk=
1_xj6QFTFel$

FOR WEDNESDAY APRIL 27 - TUESDAY MAY 03: During week-1, anomalous ridging i=
s
forecast to amplify across the east-central CONUS, resulting in elevated
chances for above normal temperatures. However, this warm-up is forecast to=
 be
short-lived as the predicted negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillati=
on
(NAO), combined with the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) reemerging in phas=
es
8
and 1, both support a return to a colder pattern across the eastern half of
the
CONUS. Following a period of maximum temperatures in the 60s and 70s deg F
over
much of the east-central CONUS (possibly reaching 80 deg F in some areas),
minimum temperatures may again fall below 40 deg F at the outset of week-2 =
as
troughing expands over the northeastern CONUS. This presents a major concer=
n
for agriculture as the sudden warm up will likely accelerate vegetation
growth,
and be immediately followed by temperatures cold enough to support a crop
damaging frost. Due to the increased risk for agricultural impacts, a moder=
ate
risk for much below normal temperatures continues to be highlighted across
portions of the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, southern Great Lakes, =
and
Ohio Valley, and is extended in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook t=
o include the Appalachains
as
well as interior portions of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Over these
regions, there is at least a 40 percent chance minimum temperatures fall be=
low
40 deg F (supporting potential frost) based on GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
guidance. The moderate risk now lasts through Apr 29 given the increased
blocking that is projected to keep the anomalous troughing in place over th=
e
northeastern CONUS, resulting in potentially multiple nights of hazardous
temperatures. Some moderation is likely across the Mississippi Valley by da=
y-9
(Apr 28), with the greatest potential for hazardous cold shifting more east=
 to
the Ohio Valley and the interior Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.



A broader slight risk for much below normal temperatures is posted for much=
 of
the east-central CONUS for all of week-2, where the ECMWF and GEFS reforeca=
st
tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance minimum temperatures fall below
the
15th climatological percentile and 40 deg F. The troughing also supports th=
e
development of surface low pressure along the Northeast coast, and increase=
d
potential for enhanced rainfall, but the reforecast tools do not highlight =
any
widespread areas where precipitation totals reach hazardous thresholds,
precluding a related precipitation hazard.



Troughing is forecast across the northeastern Pacific early in week-2, with
below normal temperatures favored across the northwestern CONUS. The ECMWF =
and
GEFS reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance minimum
temperatures fall below the 15th percentile of the climatological distribut=
ion
and freezing (40 deg F at lower elevations and closer to the coast) over pa=
rts
of the Pacific Northwest, northern California, Northern Great Basin, and
Northern Rockies, supporting the introduction of a slight risk of much belo=
w
normal temperatures over these areas from Apr 27-29. Models depict a weaken=
ing
of this trough later in the period, reducing the probabilities for hazardou=
s
cold over these areas.



Elsewhere across the CONUS and Alaska, a quieter pattern is forecast
underneath
a more zonal mid-level flow pattern. There is potential for above normal
temperatures across the Southwest early in the period, with some of the
hottest
locations in the deserts possibly topping 100 deg F. However, this level of
heat is becoming more typical for the region, and no related hazard is
included. No hazards are indicated across Alaska, with near to above normal
temperatures favored for much of the state.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0108 PM CDT Tue Apr 19 2022

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF NEW MEXICO INTO FAR WEST
TEXAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EXTREME SOUTHEAST WYOMING INTO THE
NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...

Across the Southwest, Critical highlights were expanded eastward
into Far West Texas, with Elevated highlights extended northward
into southeast Colorado to reflect the latest guidance consensus.
Thunderstorms are ongoing across portions of the Texas Rolling
Plains, and it is unclear how influential this rainfall is on fuel
receptiveness. It is possible that Elevated highlights in this area
may need to be removed by the Day 1 Outlook if fuels have been
dampened more than expected. Otherwise, the previous forecast (see
below) remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 04/19/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Tue Apr 19 2022/

...Synopsis...
A belt of strong westerly midlevel flow will cross the northern and
central Rockies, maintaining broad surface lee troughing over the
High Plains. Farther east, a dry continental airmass will remain in
place over the southeastern CONUS.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Diurnal heating/mixing of a dry airmass will result in widespread
10-15 percent minimum RH, where 20-25 mph sustained westerly surface
winds are expected. These meteorological conditions, combined with
increasingly dry fuels, will yield critical fire-weather conditions
primarily over New Mexico.

...Eastern Wyoming into western Nebraska...
Strong downslope flow combined with diurnal heating will favor 15-20
percent RH in the lee of the Rockies over eastern Wyoming into
western Nebraska. At the same time, sustained westerly surface winds
of 25+ mph will overspread highly receptive fuels. Therefore,
Critical highlights are in place where the best overlap of the
strong surface winds and dry boundary-layer conditions are expected.

...Eastern Montana...
Strong west-northwesterly surface winds of 25-35 mph (with higher
gusts) will develop across parts of eastern Montana, where
downsloping could yield 25-35 percent minimum RH. While the latest
guidance suggests that fuels are not receptive to wildfire spread,
trends will need to be monitored.

...Florida Peninsula...
Breezy easterly surface winds near 15 mph are expected across the
Florida Peninsula. While uncertain, diurnal heating/mixing over the
western portions of the peninsula could result in a small corridor
of 35 percent minimum RH. Confidence in the overlap of the breezy
surface winds and low RH is too low to introduce highlights at this
time, though trends will be monitored.

...Mountain snow for the highest elevations of the Northwest...

...Severe storms to form in parts of the Southern Plains while
unsettled & stormy weather arrives in the Pacific Northwest on
Wednesday...

...Summer-like warmth and a Critical Risk of fire weather over
parts of the Front Range, Southwest and Southern Plains through
Wednesday; chilly weather sticks around in the Northeast through
mid-week...

Much of the eastern U.S. will remain mired within an abnormally
chilly air-mass for mid-April through mid-week. A handful of daily
record cold high and low temperatures are forecast in parts of the
Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast today. There are also a
combination of Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories in the
Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valleys. In addition to the cold, a
Nor'easter will continue to produce periods of light snow in parts
of the interior Northeast this evening along with gusty winds.
Additional snow accumulations between 3-6 inches are expected from
northern Pennsylvania to the Adirondacks. Lake effect snow
downwind of Lake Erie may also produce accumulating snowfall
greater than 8 inches in southwestern New York. Some pockets of
measurable snowfall are also expected in parts of the central
Appalachians today. High pressure continues to build in from the
west tonight and moves over the East Coast by Wednesday, making
for a mostly dry but still relatively chilly day.

Farther west, a frontal system tracking through the northern
Rockies this afternoon will eject into the northern High Plains
tonight. In its wake, areas of mountain snow will lead to pockets
of 6"+ snowfall totals in parts of the Sierra Nevada, Oregon
Cascades, and the Tetons. In the southern High Plains, scattered
showers and thunderstorms will continue into the evening with the
best odds for severe storms in the Texas Panhandle where the Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk for severe weather.
As a potent upper level disturbance tracks through the
Intermountain West tonight and into the northern High Plains
Wednesday morning, a strengthening surface low in the central High
Plains will become the focus for the next round of severe storms
Wednesday afternoon and evening. A Slight Risk has been issued for
northeast Oklahoma and southeast Kansas where severe hazards such
as tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds are all possible.
Periods of rain are also likely in the Middle Mississippi Valley
and the Ozarks on Wednesday where over one inch of rain is
forecast. Severe storms will also be possible in the Pacific
Northwest as the next Pacific storm system approaches the region.
Rainfall totals of 1.5 to 2 inches are expected on Wednesday in
southwest Oregon and coastal northern California. In the higher
elevations, snowfall totals as much as a foot or more are on tap
in the Shastas, Cascades, and northern Sierra Nevada.

Elsewhere, it is a busy stretch for fire weather in the Southwest
and the High Plains. Critical Risks for fire weather have been
issued from Las Vegas on east across northern Arizona and much of
New Mexico. The fire weather hazards are due to gusty winds, dry
fuels, and low humidity. The more concerning Critical Risk areas
stick around in parts of the western Nebraska and eastern Wyoming
on Wednesday, as well as central and southern New Mexico. Red Flag
Warnings are in effect for all of these areas. Summer-like
temperatures will expand into the Great Plains tomorrow and then
the Mississippi Valley on Thursday. A cold airmass will keep
temperatures well below average over parts of North Dakota and
northern Minnesota through the weekend.

...Weekend storm likely to bring heavy precipitation/strong winds
to the Northern Plains and a heavy rainfall threat to some areas
farther south...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The upper level pattern over the continental U.S. will become more
amplified by the end of the week and into the weekend as a large
synoptic scale Pacific trough progresses through the West,
supporting surface cyclogenesis across the High Plains by Friday
night.  An embedded upper low should track northeastward through
the Northern Plains during the weekend, bringing strong low
pressure through the this region and the Upper Midwest.  This
storm should produce significant snowfall over some areas in the
cold sector along with varying intensity of rainfall to the east
as well as potentially heavy rainfall farther south over the
Plains/Mississippi Valley along the trailing wavy front.
Meanwhile, a downstream upper ridge axis building over the eastern
U.S. should lead to a considerable warming trend over some areas
for the weekend but cool high pressure may persist for a time over
the Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic.  Another Pacific upper trough
should approach the northwestern U.S. by the beginning of next
week.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The updated forecast utilized a blend of 00Z/06Z operational
models early and then trended to a combination of models and 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means.  This approach yielded only typical
run-to-run adjustments through most of the period.  By early next
week, most guidance has displayed a trend toward a slower/more
elongated upper trough behind the strong northern tier
storm--resulting in a slower and more wavy trailing surface front
that was reflected in the update.  06Z/12Z GFS runs have gone back
to a faster progression though.  As for the strong northern tier
storm, there is still a fair degree of timing spread with the GFS
fastest and UKMET/CMC slowest.  Multi-run trends show the GFS/GEFS
coming back to the ECMWF/ECMWF mean so at the very least the fast
side of the spread appears less likely.  Thus far trends have not
been pronounced enough to include more than minority weight of the
UKMET/CMC.  Some track spread is also evident and forecast weather
over some areas will be very sensitive to specifics.  For the
upper trough nearing the West Coast by late in the period,
models/ensembles are good at depicting the overall feature in
principle but vary with some details.  The 12Z GFS is particularly
strong with some leading shortwave energy reaching the West by
late Sunday-Monday.  This ultimately affects its progression of
the central U.S. trough.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Confidence continues to improve for the general forecast of a
strong storm emerging from the Rockies and tracking into the
Dakotas/Upper Midwest late this week into the weekend.  Best
potential for significant snowfall will be from favored terrain
within the Great Basin/north-central Rockies and then through
eastern Montana/northeastern Wyoming and the western half of North
Dakota (to the immediate west of the surface low track).  Strong
winds around the low could produce blizzard conditions for some
areas if model forecasts persist.  There is still some uncertainty
for the track and speed of the storm, so continue to monitor
forecasts for refinements to the details.  Locations in warmer air
to the east may see rainfall of varying intensity, including some
pockets of locally moderate to heavy activity.

The wavy cold front extending southward from the storm may provide
a focus for heavy showers and thunderstorms from Sunday into the
early part of the next work week, with added contribution from
lingering upper trough energy and input from Gulf moisture
advecting northward ahead of the front.  This will likely be in
the form of multiple mesoscale convective complexes with repeating
rounds of convection/training, and some strong to severe storms
are also possible.  Currently the best potential for highest
rainfall totals exists from parts of the southern half of the
Plains into or a bit south of the Middle Mississippi Valley.

The upper trough approaching the West late in the period should
bring light to moderate precipitation to the Pacific Northwest
early next week.

Expect unseasonably cold temperatures to persist over far northern
parts of the Plains through the period with North Dakota in
particular seeing highs 15-30F below normal for multiple days.
The West will see more variable temperatures, with minus 5-15F
anomalies late week into the weekend but followed by a
west-to-east moderating trend with increasing coverage of above
normal readings early next week.  Clouds/precipitation may bring
below normal highs to the Pacific Northwest next Tuesday though.
A major warming trend is likely for the central/southern Plains on
Friday and then much of the eastern half of the nation going into
the weekend.  Central Plains locations could see highs up to
20-30F above normal on Friday.  Plus 10-20F anomalies should be
more common farther east.  Also humidity levels should increase in
response to deep southerly flow ahead of the central U.S. storm
system.  One exception to the eastern warmth should be over the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic where cool surface high
pressure/ridging may prevail for multiple days.  A back door front
expected to settle over the Mid-Atlantic could provide a sharp
contrast between cool air to the north and warmth to the south and
west.

early part of the next work week, with added contribution from
lingering upper trough energy and input from Gulf moisture
advecting northward ahead of the front.  This will likely be in
the form of multiple mesoscale convective complexes with repeating
rounds of convection/training, and some strong to severe storms
are also possible.  Currently the best potential for highest
rainfall totals exists from parts of the southern half of the
Plains into or a bit south of the Middle Mississippi Valley.

The upper trough approaching the West late in the period should
bring light to moderate precipitation to the Pacific Northwest
early next week.

Expect unseasonably cold temperatures to persist over far northern
parts of the Plains through the period with North Dakota in
particular seeing highs 15-30F below normal for multiple days.
The West will see more variable temperatures, with minus 5-15F
anomalies late week into the weekend but followed by a
west-to-east moderating trend with increasing coverage of above
normal readings early next week.  Clouds/precipitation may bring
below normal highs to the Pacific Northwest next Tuesday though.
A major warming trend is likely for the central/southern Plains on
Friday and then much of the eastern half of the nation going into
the weekend.  Central Plains locations could see highs up to
20-30F above normal on Friday.  Plus 10-20F anomalies should be
more common farther east.  Also humidity levels should increase in
response to deep southerly flow ahead of the central U.S. storm
system.  One exception to the eastern warmth should be over the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic where cool surface high
pressure/ridging may prevail for multiple days.  A back door front
expected to settle over the Mid-Atlantic could provide a sharp
contrast between cool air to the north and warmth to the south and
west.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue April 19 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 25 - 29 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting above normal 500-
hPa
heights across most of the higher latitudes of North America, consistent wi=
th
a
transition to the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). In the mea=
n
mid-level height fields, a ridge over the Aleutians is forecast, leading to=
 a
troughing downstream across the eastern Gulf of Alaska extending to the
Northwest CONUS. Anomalous ridging is likely farther downstream, across par=
ts
of the western and central CONUS. Another trough is predicted over the Grea=
t
Lakes, with below normal 500-hPa heights.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored over much of Alaska associate=
d
with predicted near to above normal heights. Probabilities for near to abov=
e
normal temperatures are increased across much of the southwestern CONUS and
central High Plains due to relatively higher mid-level heights. Increased
probabilities of below normal temperatures are favored for the Northwest, m=
ost
of the Great Plains, Great Lakes and Northeast in association with forecast
troughing and consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Probabilitie=
s
for near to above normal temperatures are increased across parts of the
Southeast ahead of the troughing.

There are potentially increasing precipitation chances across parts of the
Southern Plains and much of the eastern CONUS in good agreement among the
ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian models during the period. Above normal precipitat=
ion
is also favored for the Northwest CONUS and parts of the Northern High Plai=
ns,
as troughing is forecast to approach the Pacific Northwest. Enhanced
probabilities for near to below normal precipitation are indicated for much=
 of
the southwestern CONUS during the period related to predicted ridging. Belo=
w
normal precipitation probabilities are also increased across the Central
Plains
and Great lakes, supported by the consolidated forecast tool. Ahead of ridg=
ing
over the Aleutians, increased below normal precipitation probabilities are
favored across southwestern Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians and Alaska
Panhandle.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by increasing uncertainty depicted by the temperatu=
re
and precipitation forecast tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 27 - MAY 03, 2022

During week-2, 500-hPa troughing is favored to propagate across the eastern
CONUS, resulting in below normal heights in the manual blend over much of t=
he
eastern CONUS. An enhanced 500-hPa ridge is forecast to cross the central
CONUS. Ridging is forecast over the Aleutians and parts of Alaska, while a
trough is predicted downstream over the Northeast Pacific and the Northwest=
ern
CONUS.

Given the predicted propagation of anomalous troughing across the eastern
CONUS, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate elevated
probabilities
for below normal temperatures across most of the eastern half of the CONUS,
except above normal temperature probabilities are increased over the southe=
rn
Florida Peninsula. Below normal temperature probabilities are increased ove=
r
the Northwest CONUS and most of the Great Plains related to the troughing o=
ver
the northeast Pacific. Both reforecast tools continue to depict increased
probabilities for above normal temperatures across the Southwest, Central a=
nd
Southern High Plains due to the ridging. Elevated probabilities for near to
above normal temperatures remain favored for Mainland Alaska and the Aleuti=
ans
due to forecast ridging.

Elevated probabilities for above normal pricipitation are indicated over pa=
rts
of the Northwest and the Northern High Plains along with increased potentia=
l
for surface low development and frontal activity. Both reforecast tools
support
enhanced below normal precipitation probabilities across the Mississippi
Valley, the Great Lakes, and the Central and Southern Plains. Increased
chances
for below normal precipitation are indicated for the southwestern CONUS due=
 to
persistent ridging. Behind troughing over the northeast Pacific, slightly
increased chances for below normal precipitation are favored across the Ala=
ska
Panhandle. A slightly wet pattern is likely for western Mainland Alaska in
association with the surface southerly flow from the low pressure system ov=
er
the Bering Sea.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
the potential for a significant pattern change during the period and
associated
substantial model disagreements.


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
427 PM EDT Tue Apr 19 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 22 2022 - 12Z Tue Apr 26 2022

...Weekend storm likely to bring heavy precipitation/strong winds
to the Northern Plains and a heavy rainfall threat to some areas
farther south...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The upper level pattern over the continental U.S. will become more
amplified by the end of the week and into the weekend as a large
synoptic scale Pacific trough progresses through the West,
supporting surface cyclogenesis across the High Plains by Friday
night.  An embedded upper low should track northeastward through
the Northern Plains during the weekend, bringing strong low
pressure through the this region and the Upper Midwest.  This
storm should produce significant snowfall over some areas in the
cold sector along with varying intensity of rainfall to the east
as well as potentially heavy rainfall farther south over the
Plains/Mississippi Valley along the trailing wavy front.
Meanwhile, a downstream upper ridge axis building over the eastern
U.S. should lead to a considerable warming trend over some areas
for the weekend but cool high pressure may persist for a time over
the Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic.  Another Pacific upper trough
should approach the northwestern U.S. by the beginning of next
week.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The updated forecast utilized a blend of 00Z/06Z operational
models early and then trended to a combination of models and 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means.  This approach yielded only typical
run-to-run adjustments through most of the period.  By early next
week, most guidance has displayed a trend toward a slower/more
elongated upper trough behind the strong northern tier
storm--resulting in a slower and more wavy trailing surface front
that was reflected in the update.  06Z/12Z GFS runs have gone back
to a faster progression though.  As for the strong northern tier
storm, there is still a fair degree of timing spread with the GFS
fastest and UKMET/CMC slowest.  Multi-run trends show the GFS/GEFS
coming back to the ECMWF/ECMWF mean so at the very least the fast
side of the spread appears less likely.  Thus far trends have not
been pronounced enough to include more than minority weight of the
UKMET/CMC.  Some track spread is also evident and forecast weather
over some areas will be very sensitive to specifics.  For the
upper trough nearing the West Coast by late in the period,
models/ensembles are good at depicting the overall feature in
principle but vary with some details.  The 12Z GFS is particularly
strong with some leading shortwave energy reaching the West by
late Sunday-Monday.  This ultimately affects its progression of
the central U.S. trough.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Confidence continues to improve for the general forecast of a
strong storm emerging from the Rockies and tracking into the
Dakotas/Upper Midwest late this week into the weekend.  Best
potential for significant snowfall will be from favored terrain
within the Great Basin/north-central Rockies and then through
eastern Montana/northeastern Wyoming and the western half of North
Dakota (to the immediate west of the surface low track).  Strong
winds around the low could produce blizzard conditions for some
areas if model forecasts persist.  There is still some uncertainty
for the track and speed of the storm, so continue to monitor
forecasts for refinements to the details.  Locations in warmer air
to the east may see rainfall of varying intensity, including some
pockets of locally moderate to heavy activity.

The wavy cold front extending southward from the storm may provide
a focus for heavy showers and thunderstorms from Sunday into the
early part of the next work week, with added contribution from
lingering upper trough energy and input from Gulf moisture
advecting northward ahead of the front.  This will likely be in
the form of multiple mesoscale convective complexes with repeating
rounds of convection/training, and some strong to severe storms
are also possible.  Currently the best potential for highest
rainfall totals exists from parts of the southern half of the
Plains into or a bit south of the Middle Mississippi Valley.

The upper trough approaching the West late in the period should
bring light to moderate precipitation to the Pacific Northwest
early next week.

Expect unseasonably cold temperatures to persist over far northern
parts of the Plains through the period with North Dakota in
particular seeing highs 15-30F below normal for multiple days.
The West will see more variable temperatures, with minus 5-15F
anomalies late week into the weekend but followed by a
west-to-east moderating trend with increasing coverage of above
normal readings early next week.  Clouds/precipitation may bring
below normal highs to the Pacific Northwest next Tuesday though.
A major warming trend is likely for the central/southern Plains on
Friday and then much of the eastern half of the nation going into
the weekend.  Central Plains locations could see highs up to
20-30F above normal on Friday.  Plus 10-20F anomalies should be
more common farther east.  Also humidity levels should increase in
response to deep southerly flow ahead of the central U.S. storm
system.  One exception to the eastern warmth should be over the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic where cool surface high
pressure/ridging may prevail for multiple days.  A back door front
expected to settle over the Mid-Atlantic could provide a sharp
contrast between cool air to the north and warmth to the south and
west.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
427 PM EDT Tue Apr 19 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 22 2022 - 12Z Tue Apr 26 2022

...Weekend storm likely to bring heavy precipitation/strong winds
to the Northern Plains and a heavy rainfall threat to some areas
farther south...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The upper level pattern over the continental U.S. will become more
amplified by the end of the week and into the weekend as a large
synoptic scale Pacific trough progresses through the West,
supporting surface cyclogenesis across the High Plains by Friday
night.  An embedded upper low should track northeastward through
the Northern Plains during the weekend, bringing strong low
pressure through the this region and the Upper Midwest.  This
storm should produce significant snowfall over some areas in the
cold sector along with varying intensity of rainfall to the east
as well as potentially heavy rainfall farther south over the
Plains/Mississippi Valley along the trailing wavy front.
Meanwhile, a downstream upper ridge axis building over the eastern
U.S. should lead to a considerable warming trend over some areas
for the weekend but cool high pressure may persist for a time over
the Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic.  Another Pacific upper trough
should approach the northwestern U.S. by the beginning of next
week.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The updated forecast utilized a blend of 00Z/06Z operational
models early and then trended to a combination of models and 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means.  This approach yielded only typical
run-to-run adjustments through most of the period.  By early next
week, most guidance has displayed a trend toward a slower/more
elongated upper trough behind the strong northern tier
storm--resulting in a slower and more wavy trailing surface front
that was reflected in the update.  06Z/12Z GFS runs have gone back
to a faster progression though.  As for the strong northern tier
storm, there is still a fair degree of timing spread with the GFS
fastest and UKMET/CMC slowest.  Multi-run trends show the GFS/GEFS
coming back to the ECMWF/ECMWF mean so at the very least the fast
side of the spread appears less likely.  Thus far trends have not
been pronounced enough to include more than minority weight of the
UKMET/CMC.  Some track spread is also evident and forecast weather
over some areas will be very sensitive to specifics.  For the
upper trough nearing the West Coast by late in the period,
models/ensembles are good at depicting the overall feature in
principle but vary with some details.  The 12Z GFS is particularly
strong with some leading shortwave energy reaching the West by
late Sunday-Monday.  This ultimately affects its progression of
the central U.S. trough.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Confidence continues to improve for the general forecast of a
strong storm emerging from the Rockies and tracking into the
Dakotas/Upper Midwest late this week into the weekend.  Best
potential for significant snowfall will be from favored terrain
within the Great Basin/north-central Rockies and then through
eastern Montana/northeastern Wyoming and the western half of North
Dakota (to the immediate west of the surface low track).  Strong
winds around the low could produce blizzard conditions for some
areas if model forecasts persist.  There is still some uncertainty
for the track and speed of the storm, so continue to monitor
forecasts for refinements to the details.  Locations in warmer air
to the east may see rainfall of varying intensity, including some
pockets of locally moderate to heavy activity.

The wavy cold front extending southward from the storm may provide
a focus for heavy showers and thunderstorms from Sunday into the
early part of the next work week, with added contribution from
lingering upper trough energy and input from Gulf moisture
advecting northward ahead of the front.  This will likely be in
the form of multiple mesoscale convective complexes with repeating
rounds of convection/training, and some strong to severe storms
are also possible.  Currently the best potential for highest
rainfall totals exists from parts of the southern half of the
Plains into or a bit south of the Middle Mississippi Valley.

The upper trough approaching the West late in the period should
bring light to moderate precipitation to the Pacific Northwest
early next week.

Expect unseasonably cold temperatures to persist over far northern
parts of the Plains through the period with North Dakota in
particular seeing highs 15-30F below normal for multiple days.
The West will see more variable temperatures, with minus 5-15F
anomalies late week into the weekend but followed by a
west-to-east moderating trend with increasing coverage of above
normal readings early next week.  Clouds/precipitation may bring
below normal highs to the Pacific Northwest next Tuesday though.
A major warming trend is likely for the central/southern Plains on
Friday and then much of the eastern half of the nation going into
the weekend.  Central Plains locations could see highs up to
20-30F above normal on Friday.  Plus 10-20F anomalies should be
more common farther east.  Also humidity levels should increase in
response to deep southerly flow ahead of the central U.S. storm
system.  One exception to the eastern warmth should be over the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic where cool surface high
pressure/ridging may prevail for multiple days.  A back door front
expected to settle over the Mid-Atlantic could provide a sharp
contrast between cool air to the north and warmth to the south and
west.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
214 AM EDT Wed Apr 20 2022

...Significant late season winter storm increasingly likely for
Northern Plains this weekend and potentially heavy rainfall threat
to some areas farther south...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A highly amplified pattern is expected over the forecast period
highlighted by an anomalous closed upper low coming out of the
West into the Plains this weekend while strong ridging anchors
over the Southeast. A deepening surface low will track from the
Rockies toward the Upper Midwest bringing a wide variety of
weather hazards - significant snow and wind to the Northern Plains
and eventually a heavy rain threat evolving late in the weekend
into early next week over portions of the Southern Plains to the
Ozarks. Meanwhile, much above normal temperatures will be found
downstream underneath the Southeast ridge and finally, another
Pacific upper trough should approach the northwestern U.S. by the
beginning of next week.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

A blend of the latest available deterministic guidance was used
for this forecast cycle - mainly the 12Z ECMWF, 18Z/12Z GFS, 12Z
CMC, 12Z UKMET. For Days 3-4, a blend mostly consisting of the
ECMWF/GFS was used for the strong low pressure system in the
Plains where the deterministic runs and ensemble clustering
continues to improve such that confidence is above normal. Further
south along the trailing frontal boundary Sunday into Monday -
there remains some timing and speed issues with how fast the front
kicks southeast. Some suggestion that the front will hang out/slow
across portions of the southern Plains to Ozarks but some forecast
runs show a much more progressive scenario though the setup favors
a slow solution so the forecast blended some of the slower
guidance. By days 6-7, forecast uncertainty grows substantially
with how the phasing or lack of shortwave energy over the
Northeast occurs and its progression potentially blocked  by
ridging to the northeast. Another storm system is likely to
approach the Pacific Northwest toward the end of the period.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

A strong to potentially significant storm system is increasingly
likely to emerge out of the Rockies and track toward the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest later this week into the weekend. The
best potential for significant totals of snow and blowing snow are
favored from northeast Wyoming and eastern Montana to much of
western/central North Dakota and far northwest South Dakota -
immediately west to northwest of the surface low track. The strong
winds and heavy snow combined could lead to near blizzard
conditions for some areas if model trends continue. While there is
some uncertainty in the speed and track - the guidance is
increasingly becoming clustered on the idea of a high impact late
season winter storm for portions of the region where the latest
Winter Weather Outlook shows high probabilities for several inches
of snow.

As the low lifts north of the Great Lakes, its associated frontal
boundary extending southward through the central U.S. is likely to
slow, stall or become nearly stationary late in the weekend into
early next week across portions of the southern/central Plains
toward the Ozarks. Warm, moist southerly air intersecting the
boundary will likely lead to strong thunderstorms that may train
or repeat over the same areas Sunday into Monday. Several
mesoscale convective systems repeating over the area could lead to
large footprint of multi-inch totals and the latest guidance
suggests the best potential for flash flooding and excessive
rainfall over portions of southern Missouri, northwest Arkansas,
northeast Oklahoma and adjacent areas. A Day 5 Experimental Slight
Risk ERO was included for this region given the potential - where
stream flows and precipitation anomalies are already above normal
due to recent heavy rainfall and with the potential for additional
heavy rainfall leading up to Day 5.

Expect unseasonably cold temperatures to persist over far northern
parts of the Plains through the period with North Dakota in
particular seeing highs 15-30F below normal for multiple days.
The West will see more variable temperatures, with minus 5-15F
anomalies late week into the weekend but followed by a
west-to-east moderating trend with increasing coverage of above
normal readings early next week.  Clouds/precipitation may bring
below normal highs to the Pacific Northwest next Tuesday though.
A major warming trend is likely for the central/southern Plains on
Friday and then much of the eastern half of the nation going into
the weekend.  Central Plains locations could see highs up to
20-30F above normal on Friday.  Plus 10-20F anomalies should be
more common farther east.  Also humidity levels should increase in
response to deep southerly flow ahead of the central U.S. storm
system.  One exception to the eastern warmth should be over the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic where cool surface high
pressure/ridging may prevail for multiple days.  A back door front
expected to settle over the Mid-Atlantic could provide a sharp
contrast between cool air to the north and warmth to the south and
west.

there remains some timing and speed issues with how fast the front
kicks southeast. Some suggestion that the front will hang out/slow
across portions of the southern Plains to Ozarks but some forecast
runs show a much more progressive scenario though the setup favors
a slow solution so the forecast blended some of the slower
guidance. By days 6-7, forecast uncertainty grows substantially
with how the phasing or lack of shortwave energy over the
Northeast occurs and its progression potentially blocked  by
ridging to the northeast. Another storm system is likely to
approach the Pacific Northwest toward the end of the period.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

A strong to potentially significant storm system is increasingly
likely to emerge out of the Rockies and track toward the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest later this week into the weekend. The
best potential for significant totals of snow and blowing snow are
favored from northeast Wyoming and eastern Montana to much of
western/central North Dakota and far northwest South Dakota -
immediately west to northwest of the surface low track. The strong
winds and heavy snow combined could lead to near blizzard
conditions for some areas if model trends continue. While there is
some uncertainty in the speed and track - the guidance is
increasingly becoming clustered on the idea of a high impact late
season winter storm for portions of the region where the latest
Winter Weather Outlook shows high probabilities for several inches
of snow.

As the low lifts north of the Great Lakes, its associated frontal
boundary extending southward through the central U.S. is likely to
slow, stall or become nearly stationary late in the weekend into
early next week across portions of the southern/central Plains
toward the Ozarks. Warm, moist southerly air intersecting the
boundary will likely lead to strong thunderstorms that may train
or repeat over the same areas Sunday into Monday. Several
mesoscale convective systems repeating over the area could lead to
large footprint of multi-inch totals and the latest guidance
suggests the best potential for flash flooding and excessive
rainfall over portions of southern Missouri, northwest Arkansas,
northeast Oklahoma and adjacent areas. A Day 5 Experimental Slight
Risk ERO was included for this region given the potential - where
stream flows and precipitation anomalies are already above normal
due to recent heavy rainfall and with the potential for additional
heavy rainfall leading up to Day 5.

Expect unseasonably cold temperatures to persist over far northern
parts of the Plains through the period with North Dakota in
particular seeing highs 15-30F below normal for multiple days.
The West will see more variable temperatures, with minus 5-15F
anomalies late week into the weekend but followed by a
west-to-east moderating trend with increasing coverage of above
normal readings early next week.  Clouds/precipitation may bring
below normal highs to the Pacific Northwest next Tuesday though.
A major warming trend is likely for the central/southern Plains on
Friday and then much of the eastern half of the nation going into
the weekend.  Central Plains locations could see highs up to
20-30F above normal on Friday.  Plus 10-20F anomalies should be
more common farther east.  Also humidity levels should increase in
response to deep southerly flow ahead of the central U.S. storm
system.  One exception to the eastern warmth should be over the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic where cool surface high
pressure/ridging may prevail for multiple days.  A back door front
expected to settle over the Mid-Atlantic could provide a sharp
contrast between cool air to the north and warmth to the south and
west.

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF NEW MEXICO INTO FAR WEST
TEXAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR SOUTHEAST WYOMING INTO THE
NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...

...Synopsis...
Broad/enhanced westerly flow will continue over the western
two-thirds of the CONUS, while a lee surface low develops over far
northeastern New Mexico. The strongest westerly flow will be
confined to the north-central Rockies, within the base of an
eastward-advancing midlevel trough. Farther east, expansive surface
high pressure will move slowly eastward off the Mid-Atlantic coast.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains and Colorado Front
Range...
Another day of warm/dry boundary-layer conditions is forecast across
the Southwest into the southern High Plains and northward along the
Colorado Front Range. Diurnal heating/mixing will encourage
widespread 10-15 percent minimum RH, where breezy westerly surface
winds of 15-25 mph are expected. The strongest surface winds should
develop across much of New Mexico into far West Texas, where
Critical highlights remain in place. Along the Colorado Front Range,
locally critical conditions will be possible primarily across
terrain-favored areas, though the localized nature of these
conditions precludes Critical highlights.

...Central High Plains...
Strong downslope warming/drying and diurnal heating will result in
15-20 percent minimum RH across parts of the central High Plains,
where breezy surface winds will develop. From eastern Wyoming into
the Nebraska Panhandle, 25-30 mph sustained west-northwesterly
surface winds (with gusts upwards of 40 mph) will overspread the
increasingly dry airmass. These meteorological conditions, coupled
with very dry fuels, will result in critical fire-weather
conditions.

...Western Florida Peninsula...
Along the southern periphery of the expansive surface high pressure,
breezy easterly surface winds near 15 mph will overspread the
Florida Peninsula. Over the western portion of the peninsula,
diurnal heating/mixing could result in a narrow corridor of 35-40
percent RH coincident with the breezy surface winds. Elevated
highlights have been introduced to account for this localized
fire-weather threat.

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE TEXAS PANHANDLE...

...Synopsis...
An amplified large-scale trough and enhanced southwesterly midlevel
flow will overspread the western states, while a dryline develops
over parts of West Texas. Farther east, high pressure will continue
moving eastward across the western Atlantic waters.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Behind the dryline, breezy southwesterly surface winds will overlap
widespread 10-15 percent minimum RH. Over parts of the Texas
Panhandle, deep boundary-layer mixing into the strong southwesterly
flow aloft will favor sustained surface winds of 20-25 mph with
gusts upwards of 30 mph. These conditions, combined with very dry
fuels, will result in critical fire-weather conditions.

...Central High Plains...
While strong southerly return flow is expected over parts of the
central High Plains, confidence in the overlap of the strong surface
winds and low RH is too low to introduce highlights at this time.

...Storm system to produce snow in northern Minnesota, showers
throughout the Great Lakes, and severe storms in portions of the
Heartland today...

...Strong upper low to bring unsettled and cooler weather to
California and the Pacific Northwest ...

...Summer-like warmth and a Critical Risk of fire weather over
parts of the Front Range, Southwest and Southern Plains through
Wednesday; cooler temps sticks around in the Northeast through
Thursday...

A frontal system tracking across the North Central U.S. will be
responsible for developing an expansive shield of precipitation
that will stretch from the U.S./Canada border on south into East
Texas. In northern Minnesota, precipitation is forecast to fall in
the form of snow with several inches of accumulation expected. The
heaviest totals are set to occur in the Minnesota Arrowhead where
totals could surpass 8 inches. In the Middle Mississippi Valley,
showers and thunderstorms will be common from the Middle
Mississippi Valley on south into the South Central U.S.. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk for eastern Oklahoma
and southeast Kansas where severe storms could produce tornadoes,
damaging wind gusts, and large hail. Some thunderstorms may also
produce locally excessive rainfall rates in the Ozarks, which has
prompted the issuance of a Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall in
northern Arkansas and southern Missouri. The storm system will
race through the Great Lakes by Thursday morning losing its punch
as it does so. Showers will be more spotty in nature across the
eastern Great Lakes and northern New York. Meanwhile, a warm front
lifting north into the Midwest and Central Plains will result in
blossoming thunderstorms across parts of the the Nation's
Heartland. A Slight Risk for severe weather has been issued for
Thursday in Kansas with a chance for storms extending as far east
as the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys through Thursday night.

Farther west, a large upper level low will direct a slug of
Pacific moisture at the West Coast with periods of heavy rain and
mountain snow expected from the Pacific Northwest on south into
California. By Thursday, the heaviest precipitation will become
focused in the Sierra Nevada where crashing snow levels will
support snowfall amounts of 1 to 2 feet. Winter Storm Warnings
have been posted for the higher elevations of northern California
from Wednesday afternoon through Friday morning. Showers will
reach as far south as Southern California by Thursday night and
into early Friday morning. Through early Friday morning, total
precipitation amounts will totals as much as 2 to 3 inches in
coastal northern California, in the Shastas, and northern Sierra
Nevada. In addition to the rain and snow, gusty winds are also on
tap with Wind Advisories in place from southern Oregon on south
into the higher terrain of Southern California. This upper low
will provide a shot of cooler than normal temperatures up and down
the West Coast and eventually into the Great Basin and Desert
Southwest by week's end.

Fire weather conditions remain ripe across the Southwest, Front
Range, and southern High Plains through the end of the week.
Critical Risks for fire weather include portions of New Mexico,
West Texas, and both western Nebraska and southeast Wyoming today.
By Thursday, the threat for fire weather becomes more focused in
the southern High Plains as a Critical Risk has been issued in the
Texas Panhandle. In terms of temperatures, summer-like warmth is
on tap in the Southwest and the southern High Plains through
Thursday. Some record high temps could be broken in parts of the
Texas, eastern New Mexico, and southern Oklahoma both Wednesday
and Thursday. Farther east, seasonally cooler temperatures will
remain in place today and moderate closer to normal by Thursday.
Eventually, 70s and 80s look to return to the Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast by Friday.

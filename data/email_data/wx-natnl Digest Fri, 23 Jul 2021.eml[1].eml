Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Thu Jul 22 2021

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWESTERN MONTANA...

The critical area in northwest Montana remains unchanged. There
remains uncertainty as to how widespread and long-lasting these
critical conditions will be as strength/location of the surface low
to the east is unclear. The elevated area also remains unchanged.
Only minor modifications were made to the dry thunderstorm area.
Most areas will see isolated coverage. Coverage may approach
scattered criteria in southwestern Montana and areas to the
northeast.

..Wendt.. 07/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Thu Jul 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will crest the upper ridge axis and traverse the
northern Rockies through the period. Surface lee-troughing will
intensify across the northern High Plains, supporting the
intensification of a surface pressure gradient and associated wind
field, with dry and breezy conditions expected across northern Great
Basin to the U.S./Canada border. Deep-layer ascent/moisture ahead of
the mid-level trough will also encourage scattered to widespread
thunderstorm development across the northern Rockies, where very dry
fuels are in place.

...Northern Rockies to northern Great Basin - Dry and Breezy
Conditions...
50+ kt mid-level flow will overspread portions of western Montana
during the afternoon hours. Downward momentum transport of this
mid-level flow, along with a strengthening surface pressure
gradient, will foster 20+ mph sustained westerly surface winds amid
15-20% RH. Critical highlights have been introduced for parts of
western Montana, which should experience the most favorable surface
wind/RH overlap the longest. While surface westerly winds will be a
bit weaker overall across the higher terrain and lee-side slopes
across southern Montana to the northern Sierra, favorable RH will
likely be realized for several hours during the afternoon. Elevated
highlights have been introduced where 15 mph sustained westerly
winds will overlap 15-20% RH for at least a few hours.

...Northern Rockies - Thunderstorms...
Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are expected to develop ahead of
the mid-level trough axis as the boundary layer heats and
destabilizes. While storm motions will be relatively fast, up to 1
inch precipitable water values suggest that wet storms will be
predominant. Nonetheless, dry strikes on the periphery of the
heavier rain cores atop very dry fuels may support a high enough
lightning ignition efficiency to warrant isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights. In addition, a few of the stronger storms may also
produce gusty and erratic winds, some of which approaching severe
criteria (50+ kts at the surface). Please see the latest Day 1
Convective Outlook for more details.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 22 2021

SYNOPSIS: At the beginning of week-2, dynamical models are in good agreement
favoring mid-level high pressure over the east-central contiguous U.S. This
favors a broad area with an increased risk for excessive heat throughout the
period, with elevated heat indices being more of a concern across eastern and
southern portions of the U.S. For the Alaska region, mid-level low pressure is
forecast across the northern Bering Sea favoring anomalously cooler and wetter
conditions over western Alaska. However, pre-defined hazards criteria are not
expected to be reached.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Great Plains, Mississippi,
Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast, Fri-Sun, Jul 30-Aug
1.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the northwestern CONUS, Great
Plains, Mississippi Valley, and extending east to the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast coasts, Fri-Thu, Jul 30-Aug 5.

Flooding possible across portions of the Central and Southern Rockies.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY JULY 25 - THURSDAY JULY 29:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!tmTjTLCgRa91pkMTQMz7fZt7EJEipxUGPd3thGqsJG7dZ2sXCeCq5fR3qR0LVG8GEw8bX_Z2$

FOR FRIDAY JULY 30 - THURSDAY AUGUST 05: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles are in relatively good agreement regarding the depiction of broad,
amplified ridging across much of the CONUS, with a mid-level height maximum
over the Lower Mississippi Valley on day-8. The largest positive 500-hPa
height
anomalies (over +60 meters) are indicated early in the period across portions
of the Great Plains eastward into the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee
Valleys.
By the middle of the period, the amplitude of the ridging is favored to
slightly weaken as more troughing builds over eastern Canada and the
northeastern CONUS, which is now depicted in the GEFS along with the ECMWF and
Canadian ensembles. Given the broad ridge placement, a slight risk of
excessive
heat is posted for portions of the northwestern CONUS, Great Plains,
Mississippi Valley, and extending east to the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast
coasts
for all of week-2, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least
a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 deg
F
(95 deg F across southern portions of the highlighted region). The slight risk
is extended westward through portions of the Rockies, Great Basin, and Pacific
Northwest given the increased signals in the reforecast tools compared to
yesterday.



A moderate risk of excessive heat is highlighted for portions of the Great
Plains, Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast
from July 30 to August 1. The ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a 40%
chance maximum temperatures exceed the 85th climatological percentile and 95
deg F across the eastern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley, with lower
chances shown in the GEFS reforecast tool. Uncalibrated guidance from the
ECMWF
and GEFS support triple digit heat across parts of the Great Plains, and low
soil moistures are also favored to result in enhanced surface heating. Actual
temperatures are forecast to be lower to the east over the Mississippi Valley
and Southeast, with increased humidity becoming the dominant factor in the
excessive heat. Heat risk guidance favors parts of the Middle and Lower
Mississippi Valley and the Southeast having at least a 40% chance heat indices
exceed 105 deg F (110 deg F across southern areas) supporting the moderate
risk. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict at least a 30% chance
maximum temperatures exceed the 85th climatological percentile over parts of
the Mid-Atlantic translating to actual temperatures in the mid to upper 90s
deg
F. While this is a bit lower than the usual threshold for a moderate risk,
more
emphasis is given to the heat risk guidance which indicates elevated
probabilities (at least 40%) for heat indices to exceed 105 deg F. Of note is
the fairly sharp gradient between the higher excessive heat probabilities
forecast over the Ohio Valley and northern Mid-Atlantic compared to the Great
Lakes and Northeast, where excessive heat chances quickly diminish from south
to north due to more influence from the building mid-level trough over eastern
Canada. While not explicitly forecast, the gradient could serve as a focus for
increased frontal convergence and convection early in the period. After
day-10,
this troughing is forecast to deamplify the ridge enough to lower excessive
heat chances, although a possible rebuilding of the ridge further to the west
is plausible by the end of week-2. Due to the uncertainty in the exact pattern
evolution later in the period, the slight risk remains in place throughout the
period but may need to be refined in some areas in tomorrows outlook.



The southwest monsoon is forecast to diminish during week-2 as a result of a
more eastward placement of the mid-level ridge center compared to previous
model guidance. However, the uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF guidance still
indicates the potential for convective precipitation over the Rockies on the
backside of the mean ridge axis early in the period. Forecast amounts are
generally less than a half inch in a 3-day period precluding a related heavy
precipitation hazard, but localized flash flooding remains a concern. As a
result, the possible flooding hazard is continued in todays outlook across
parts of the Central and Southern Rockies. Flash flooding can occur even in
areas that do not receive any rain, and be a direct result of runoff from
precipitation upstream. Tropical activity is forecast to increase in the East
Pacific during week-2 which could increase the potential for moisture surges
into the Southwest CONUS depending on the exact track of any disturbances,
which at this time is highly uncertain.



A low amplitude mid-level pattern is favored for Alaska during week-2 with
troughing forecast across the northern Bering Sea, favoring increased chances
for above normal precipitation across much of the state. Precipitation totals
over a 3-day period are forecast to be under an inch for most areas in the
ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools, precluding a related hazard. Increased wind
speeds are also possible along the west coast of the state and the Aleutians
given the tight pressure gradient between surface low pressure over the Bering
Sea and surface high pressure forecast over the Northeast Pacific. However,
reforecast tools do not support a related wind hazard. Weak ridging is favored
downstream across the eastern Mainland and Panhandle with associated above
normal temperatures. However, temperatures are not anticipated to exceed 85
deg
F, and mean week-2 temperature anomalies are forecast to be less than 4 deg F.
As a result, no related temperature hazard is highlighted.

...Locally heavy rainfall threat through Sunday in the
Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon followed by a lighter trend...

...Heat will continue over the northern/central Plains into the
Upper Midwest...


...Overview...

Expect upper ridging to consolidate and strengthen over the
central Rockies/Plains by midweek after initially extending from
California and the Great Basin into the central/southern Plains on
Sunday.  An upper low drifting westward near the western
U.S.-Mexico border as of early Sunday will continue to enhance
Southwest Monsoon rainfall through the end of the weekend.  This
feature should then move off the southwest U.S. into the Pacific,
leading to a lighter trend for rainfall over Arizona and vicinity.
 Flow around the northern side of the ridge will feed into a broad
Northeast mean trough aloft, while an initial northeastern Pacific
low should eventually open up but with considerable uncertainty
over how/when its energy will become incorporated within the
progressive flow along/north of the U.S.-Canada border.  This
overall pattern should lead to a meandering surface low/front over
the northern Plains--generally providing only modest variability
within a lengthy period of hot weather--while fronts periodically
reach the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic.  Finally, guidance continues to
suggest that a surface trough with one or more embedded lows may
extend from off the Southeast/eastern Florida coast into the Gulf
of Mexico to start the week and then weaken as it edges closer to
the southeast U.S. coast.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance this morning continues to indicate noticeable spread
regarding the details of the upper-level confluence flow across
the northern tier states through much of the medium-range period.
From the larger-scale perspective the primary issue for this
stream is when/how the upper low initially over the northeastern
Pacific opens up and its energy becomes embedded within the
progressive flow.  The deterministic ECMWF solution began to
deviate further and further from its ensemble mean on Day 5 so
that a cyclone is developed over the Northeast midweek.  The GFS
did not exhibit such deviation for the low over the Northeast but
for the next cyclone moving into the northern High Plains midweek.
 In view of these model spread, more weights from the ensemble
means were given starting on Day 5.  This resulted in a blend that
yielded a lingering low pressure wave near the Great Lakes, with a
warm front lifting faster across the upper Midwest.  Changes to
the remaining parts of the country were relatively minor through
the medium range period.

The WPC medium range forecast package was derived from a general
model compromise among the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, and
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  A greater weight
toward the ensemble means was used from Day 5 onward to handle the
uncertainty.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The potential for some locally heavy monsoonal rainfall should
continue over Arizona through Sunday as a compact upper low tracks
generally westward along the southern border of the state.  This
area will be sensitive to additional rain given the significant
totals already expected in the short range time frame.  The
strengthening/consolidation of the Rockies-Plains upper ridge next
week should force the weakening upper feature to the west and
spread moisture to the north and west.  Thus the Southwest will
see rainfall trend lighter after Sunday.  Activity that extends
into California, the Great Basin, and northward over the Rockies
should be less intense than with the Arizona event.
Showers/thunderstorms will accompany a front pushing from the
Great Lakes/Plains into the East from Sunday onward.  By
Tuesday-Thursday another front may bring rainfall of varying
intensity to areas from the Upper Midwest through New England.
With considerable uncertainty in the specifics, the weak surface
feature off the southeast Coast and possibly into the eastern Gulf
may enhance rainfall at some locations.  Please monitor National
Hurricane Center outlooks for latest information on development
potential.

Within the persistent hot pattern from the northern/central Plains
into the Upper Midwest, expect Monday through Wednesday to feature
the greatest coverage of plus 10-15F or so high temperature
anomalies--with some locations in the Plains reaching at least
100F.  A meandering surface low/front across the the northern tier
will likely provide some day-to-day variability for temperatures
but not a meaningful cooling trend.  The one exception could be
over the northern High Plains on Thursday when highs may decline
to only a few degrees above normal.  There is still uncertainty in
the surface front/temperature details though.  From Sunday into
Monday the northern Great Basin and interior portions of the
Northwest will also see hot conditions with highs possibly
reaching 10F or so above normal.  A few locations could approach
or reach daily record values.  The moisture over the Southwest
will initially support highs up to 10-15F below normal followed by
a moderating trend.  Northwestward progression of this moisture
will bring temperatures down somewhat over the Great Basin and
interior Northwest after Monday.  Most of the eastern U.S. should
see near to somewhat above normal readings.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu July 22 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 28 - AUG 01, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
Bering Sea. A ridge and associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over Mainland Alaska. Over most of the CONUS, an amplified ridge is
forecast with positive 500-hPa height anomalies. However, a trough is
predicted
over the Northeast with near to below normal 500-hPa heights anticipated
across
the region.

Near to above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over Alaska
underneath predicted above normal 500-hPa heights, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. Near to above normal temperatures are also
favored
for most of the CONUS due to the persistent ridging over the region and also
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. A predicted trough over the
Northeast favors enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures over the
region.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the Aleutians and
western Mainland Alaska due to a forecast trough near the Bering Sea and
potential storm system development. Below normal precipitation is likely for
eastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle underneath forecast above normal
500-hPa heights. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over the
Pacific Northwest eastward across much of the central and eastern CONUS due to
forecast ridging or surface high pressure over the region. The position of the
predicted 500-hPa ridge and low-level flow is favorable for near to above
normal precipitation for much of the Great Basin region. Above normal
precipitation is likely over parts of the Great Lakes, supported by the
consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 30 - AUG 05, 2021

During the week-2 period, the overall 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
similar to the 6-10 day period. The temperature probability forecast during
the
week-2 period is very similar to the 6-10 day period except that below normal
temperatures are likely for western Mainland Alaska and the probabilities for
above normal temperatures over the CONUS are reduced, consistent with the
operational autoblend forecast tool. The precipitation probability forecast is
also generally similar to the 6-10 day period. However,  probabilities of
below
normal precipitation were reduced over the eastern CONUS. Conversely, enhanced
probabilities of above normal precipitation were expanded across eastern
Mainland Alaska, consistent with the GEFS reforecast and operational autoblend
tools.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST MONTANA...

Questions remain regarding the critical area due to the uncertain
duration of 20-25 mph winds across parts of northern Montana. Given
that the trough will be in the Canadian Prairies, the surface
response is not expected to be overly strong in the northern Plains
region. With only a modest surface gradient, sustained winds over 20
mph may be brief and/or localized. Even so, strong gust potential
will remain present as a mid-level jet will impact the area during
the afternoon. Precipitation also remains a concern in northeast
Montana. So far this afternoon, dry conditions at low levels have
kept accumulations little to none. Storms are still expected to move
into the area from southwest Montana later this evening/overnight.
Forecast soundings indicate little rainfall may occur, but
reassessment will be needed as observations become available. For
this outlook, no changes will be made.

..Wendt.. 07/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0214 AM CDT Thu Jul 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper trough traversing the Northern Rockies on Day 1 will eject
into the Northern Plains tomorrow/Friday. Surface lee troughing will
intensify across the Plains, resulting in a strengthening surface
pressure gradient over the Northern Rockies. Dry and breezy
conditions will likely develop during the afternoon over much of
Montana and Idaho, supporting wildfire spread. Elevated highlights
have been introduced for areas most likely to see widespread 15+ mph
sustained westerly surface winds coinciding with 15-20% RH for
several hours. Critical highlights were also added to portions of
northeast Montana, where 20+ mph sustained westerly winds will
overlap with 15% RH for at least a few hours.

While portions of the Elevated/Critical areas may see some rainfall
accumulations preceding favorable wildfire-spread conditions
tomorrow, fuels are still likely to be at least near-critically dry.
However, major modifications may need to be made to the current Day
2 fire weather highlights should higher rainfall accumulations than
expected be realized.

...Heavy rainfall and the threat for flash flooding continue
across the Southwest as Monsoon activity remains high...

...Midsummer heat persists across the Northern/Central Plains and
spreads into the Midwest, with the threat of severe thunderstorms
on Friday...

...Elevated to critical fire weather concerns remain throughout
the Northern Rockies and Great Basin...


Heavy rainfall and the threat for flash flooding from daily storms
associated with the Southwest Monsoon will continue through the
short-term forecast period, with Friday of particular concern. An
upper-level ridge centered over the Four Corners region and an
upper-level low retrograding westward out of Texas are funneling
an anomalously high amount of moisture into the region. A Slight
Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive Rainfall remains in effect through
tomorrow morning for portions of Arizona, western New Mexico,
southwest Colorado, and southern Utah for the threat of heavy
downpours with rain rates of 1 inch per hour possible. On Friday,
a Moderate Risk (level 3/4) is in effect for portions of central
and southeastern Arizona, with a broader slight risk in effect for
additional portions of Arizona, New Mexico, and into central
Colorado. The Moderate Risk area is highlighted for the threat of
up to 2 inches per hour rain rates and widespread rainfall totals
of 1 to 3 inches. A Slight Risk is also in effect for portions of
central and southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico on
Saturday for the threat of an additional 1 to 2 inches of. Various
Flash Flood watches are in effect across the region, with most of
Arizona under a watch through at least Saturday evening. The
intense rainfall over burn scars remains a concern for flash
flooding and the potential for debris flow. Flash flooding will
also be a threat locally for areas that have already seen heavy
rainfall over the past few days as the Monsoon storms have ramped
up.

Hot weather will continue into the beginning of the weekend
throughout the Northern and Central Plains, as well as parts of
the Midwest. High temperatures generally in the mid- to upper 90s
are expected across the region, with little relief at night as
temperatures remain in the low to mid-70s. In addition to the
heat, moisture will increase ahead of a cold front moving east
across the Northern Plains on Friday leading to the chance of
thunderstorms, some of which may be severe. The Storm Prediction
Center (SPC) has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) for severe
weather for central and eastern North Dakota and northern
Minnesota, with damaging winds and hail the main threats. Farther
west, gusty winds and low humidity combined with the established
dry terrain will lead to yet another day of fire weather concerns.
The SPC has highlighted portions of northeastern Montana for
Critical fire weather conditions and most of the rest of Montana
and southern Idaho for Elevated fire weather conditions.

Elsewhere, high temperatures will begin to increase into the low
to mid-90s from the Gulf Coast north through the Mississippi and
Ohio Valleys as the upper-level ridge begins to build further to
the east. Excessive heat will begin to become more of a concern
where these higher temperatures are combined with high humidity.
Heat advisories are in effect for portions of the Gulf Coast from
New Orleans area east to the Central Florida Panhandle and the
Tampa area as heat indices may climb into the upper 100s on
Friday. An Excessive Heat Watch will also take effect Friday
afternoon for the Kansas City area where heat indices over 100 are
expected into the weekend. Thunderstorm chances will increase for
the Midwest as a warm front lifts north through the region on
Friday and Saturday. Thunderstorm chances also look to increase
for the Florida Peninsula associated as a trough of low pressure
becomes established across the area.

...Locally heavy rainfall threat through Sunday in the
Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon followed by a lighter trend...

...Heat will continue over the northern/central Plains into the
Upper Midwest...


...Overview...

Expect upper ridging to consolidate and strengthen over the
central Rockies/Plains by midweek after initially extending from
California and the Great Basin into the central/southern Plains on
Sunday.  An upper low drifting westward near the western
U.S.-Mexico border as of early Sunday will continue to enhance
Southwest Monsoon rainfall through the end of the weekend.  This
feature should then move off the southwest U.S. into the Pacific,
leading to a lighter trend for rainfall over Arizona and vicinity.
 Flow around the northern side of the ridge will feed into a broad
Northeast mean trough aloft, while an initial northeastern Pacific
low should eventually open up but with considerable uncertainty
over how/when its energy will become incorporated within the
progressive flow along/north of the U.S.-Canada border.  This
overall pattern should lead to a meandering surface low/front over
the northern Plains--generally providing only modest variability
within a lengthy period of hot weather--while fronts periodically
reach the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic.  Finally, guidance continues to
suggest that a surface trough with one or more embedded lows may
extend from off the Southeast/eastern Florida coast into the Gulf
of Mexico to start the week and then weaken as it edges closer to
the southeast U.S. coast.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance this morning continues to indicate noticeable spread
regarding the details of the upper-level confluent flow across the
northern tier states through much of the medium-range period.
From the larger-scale perspective the primary issue for this
stream is when/how the upper low initially over the northeastern
Pacific opens up and its energy becomes embedded within the
progressive flow.  The deterministic 00Z ECMWF solution began to
deviate further and further from its ensemble mean on Day 5 to the
extent that a cyclone develops over the Northeast midweek only in
the deterministic solution.  On the other hand, the GFS did not
exhibit such deviation for the low over the Northeast but for the
next cyclone moving into the northern High Plains midweek.  In
view of these model spread, more weights from the ensemble means
were applied starting on Day 5.  This resulted in a blend that
yielded a lingering low pressure wave near the Great Lakes, with a
warm front lifting faster across the upper Midwest.  Otherwise,
changes to the remaining parts of the country were relatively
minor through the medium range period.

The WPC medium range forecast package was derived from a general
model compromise among the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, and
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  A greater weight
toward the ensemble means was used from Day 5 onward to handle the
uncertainty.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The potential for some locally heavy monsoonal rainfall should
continue over Arizona through Sunday as a compact upper low tracks
generally westward along the southern border of the state.  This
area will be sensitive to additional rain given the significant
totals already expected in the short range time frame.  The
strengthening/consolidation of the Rockies-Plains upper ridge next
week should force the weakening upper feature to the west and
spread moisture to the north and west.  Thus the Southwest will
see rainfall trend lighter after Sunday.  Activity that extends
into California, the Great Basin, and northward over the Rockies
should be less intense than with the Arizona event.
Showers/thunderstorms will accompany a front pushing from the
Great Lakes/Plains into the East from Sunday onward.  By
Tuesday-Thursday another front may bring rainfall of varying
intensity to areas from the Upper Midwest through New England.
With considerable uncertainty in the specifics, the weak surface
feature off the southeast Coast and possibly into the eastern Gulf
may enhance rainfall at some locations.  Please monitor National
Hurricane Center outlooks for latest information on development
potential.

Within the persistent hot pattern from the northern/central Plains
into the Upper Midwest, expect Monday through Wednesday to feature
the greatest coverage of plus 10-15F or so high temperature
anomalies--with some locations in the Plains reaching at least
100F.  A meandering surface low/front across the the northern tier
will likely provide some day-to-day variability for temperatures
but not a meaningful cooling trend.  The one exception could be
over the northern High Plains on Thursday when highs may decline
to only a few degrees above normal.  There is still uncertainty in
the surface front/temperature details though.  From Sunday into
Monday the northern Great Basin and interior portions of the
Northwest will also see hot conditions with highs possibly
reaching 10F or so above normal.  A few locations could approach
or reach daily record values.  The moisture over the Southwest
will initially support highs up to 10-15F below normal followed by
a moderating trend.  Northwestward progression of this moisture
will bring temperatures down somewhat over the Great Basin and
interior Northwest after Monday.  Most of the eastern U.S. should
see near to somewhat above normal readings.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0118 AM CDT Fri Jul 23 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough will move across Montana on Friday.
Moderate mid-level flow which is present this morning is expected to
weaken through the day. Deep mixing is expected across the northern
Rockies during the afternoon hours. Surface winds are expected to
strengthen as some of this moderate mid-level flow reaches the
surface. However, due to the weakening flow through the day,
sustained winds may only peak around 15 to 20 mph. Therefore,
critical conditions are expected to remain isolated with widespread
elevated conditions likely.

Elsewhere, wet, monsoonal thunderstorms are expected to be numerous
across the Southwest and the southern Great Basin.

0118 AM CDT Fri Jul 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge will strengthen across the western CONUS on
Saturday. As it strengthens, mostly light winds are anticipated
across much of the dry portions of the west. In addition,
thunderstorms are expected to remain across areas with high PWAT and
wet fuels. Therefore, wind/relative humidity based fire weather
concerns are expected to remain mostly subdued. However, plume
dominated fire activity remains possible from ongoing large fires
across California, Oregon, and Idaho.

...Heatwave with some Record Temperatures for the North-Central
U.S...

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Hot upper ridging will consolidate and strengthen over the
north-central Rockies/Plains next week. The heatwave offers some
records/triple digit temperatures. Flow over the ridge will feed
into a Great Lakes/Northeast mean trough aloft. Moisture and
instability pooling along a wavy frontal zone and upper
difluence/jet will intermittently fuel scattered heavy convection
and downpours out from the Northern Plains, Midwest and the
Northeast through the Mid-Atlantic.

Meanwhile, an upper low drifting offshore into the Pacific and the
strengthening/consolidation of the Rockies-Plains upper ridge next
week should act to spread moisture to the north and west out from
from the Southwest. Activity to extend into California, the Great
Basin, and northward over the Rockies should be less intense than
a mainly short term focusing Arizona event.

Guidance also suggests that a surface trough with one or more
embedded lows off the Southeast coast lingering into early-mid
next week offer modest development potential. NHC will monitor.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from best
clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET days
3-5 (Mon-Wed) along with 01 UTC National Blend of Models. The
ECMWF seems to remain the best clustered model with the GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means into days 6/7 in a period of gradually growing
forecast spread, but still above normal average predictability
beyond smaller scales. 00 UTC models remain in line with the most
variance still with periodic energy amplitude feeding into the
Great Lakes/Northeast upper trough.

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Southwest through Saturday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Upper Midwest through Saturday morning...

...There is an Elevated Risk of conditions capable of producing
wildfires over parts of the Northern High Plains/Northern Rockies
and parts of the Great Basin through Saturday morning...

Monsoonal moisture and upper-level energy will aid in producing
showers and thunderstorms, and some will produce heavy rain over
the Southwest and the Central/Southern Rockies through Sunday.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall with these thunderstorms. The associated heavy rain will
create numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams
may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers through Saturday
morning.  The excessive rainfall threat will decrease slightly
from Saturday into Sunday as the showers and thunderstorms
continue with the monsoonal moisture.

A front extending from the Northern High Plains southwestward to
the Great Basin will move slowly to the Great Lakes to the
Northern Plains by Sunday.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop
along and ahead of the boundary over parts of the Upper Midwest on
Friday.  The showers and thunderstorms will move into the Great
Lakes on Saturday, moving into parts of the Northeast on Sunday.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Upper Midwest through Saturday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
minimal risk of tornadoes.  The severe thunderstorm risk moves
into the Great Lakes on Saturday into Sunday.  Showers and
thunderstorms will develop from parts of the Northeast to the Ohio
Valley on Sunday.  Additionally, a weak front over the Southeast
will be the focus for showers and thunderstorms over the Southeast
and the Central Gulf Coast Through Sunday.

Meanwhile, there is an Elevated Risk for conditions capable of
producing wildfires over parts of the Northern High
Plains/Northern Rockies and parts of the Great Basin through
Saturday morning.  Gusty wind and dry fuels will aid in producing
conditions favorable for the spread of wildfires.  Therefore, Red
Flag Warnings have been issued for the areas.

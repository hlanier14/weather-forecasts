Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1227 PM CST Fri Feb 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

Recent high-resolution model guidance indicates several areas of
10-15% RH values during peak heating with wind speeds of around
15-25 mph west of a surface trough extending from far western
Oklahoma through west Texas.  ERCs are relatively low, though
consecutive afternoons of full sunshine and very dry air will likely
contribute to drying of finer fuels.  An elevated fire-weather
delineation has been added to address this scenario.

See the previous discussion below for more information.

..Cook.. 02/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0139 AM CST Fri Feb 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow is expected to increase across the southern High
Plains on Saturday with surface lee cyclogenesis expected in
southeast Colorado. Deep mixing, combined with the strengthening
surface pressure gradient, is expected to bring winds of 10 to 25
mph and relative humidity less than 15 percent across much of the
southern High Plains. Fuels in the region are not critically dry at
this time, and therefore, no fire weather hazards have been added.
However, fuel conditions will need to be monitored closely, and if
significant drying occurs before Saturday, at least an elevated
delineation may be needed.

...Heavy rain threat over the South continuing into early next
week and then gradually diminishing...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium-range period continues with the theme of uncertainty
that has been plaguing the late-week forecast lately.  At issue is
whether a compact upper low will detach from the northern stream
trough well off the Pacific Northwest Coast early next week before
eventually emerging into the Plains late next week.  In the mean
time, there is good model consensus on the threat of heavy
rainfall across the Deep South early next week.  The rain should
slide eastward and could bring areas of heavy rain across the
interior Southeast on Tuesday.

The GFS has been quite consistent in forecasting the
aforementioned trough fracture off the Pacific Northwest early
next week.  This flow separation issue ultimately leads to high
uncertainty in the synoptic pattern evolution over the eastern
Pacific and then eastward across much of the lower 48.  Meanwhile,
the ECMWF has largely avoided significant trough fracture but has
been keeping a digging trough down into the West Coast.  This
would result in a much more progressive pattern propagating
downstream across the northern tier states in stark contrast with
the GFS which eventually brings the detached upper low into the
Plains with potential for cyclogenesis late next week.  On the
other hand, the latest (12Z) ECMWF did indicate a switch toward
the GFS' trough fracture scenario.  It appears that the amplitude
of the upper trough currently in the northern Pacific is sharp
enough to allow such trough fracture to occur further downstream.
Given past performances of the ECMWF and the GFS in recent months
across the northeastern Pacific, the morning medium-range package
adopted an intermediate solution which is comparable to the CMC.
This solution allows a low pressure wave to form over the southern
High Plains during the middle of next week before showing some
amplification over the central/southern Plains late next week.

The WPC medium-range fronts and pressures were derived based on
the consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS
with smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  Beginning
on Day 5, more of the 06Z GEFS together with the 00Z EC mean were
used due to the above normal forecast uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The upper low tracking out of the southern Rockies and through the
Plains early in the week should interact with a front near the
Gulf Coast, supporting one or more waves along the front and a
northward flow of Gulf moisture.  This evolution will favor
another episode of locally heavy rainfall across parts of the
South during the first part of the week, with lighter
precipitation extending farther north over the southern half of
the Plains and an increasing portion of the East.  There may be
some snow in the northern part of the precipitation shield.  The
rest of the forecast has lower than average confidence for
specifics.  One scenario--currently somewhat more likely--would
have a period of moderate rain/mountain snow over the Northwest
and vicinity at the start of the week with mostly light activity
then spreading into the Interior West/Rockies followed by
precipitation of varying intensity spreading across the East in
association with one or more surface lows/fronts (which may
eventually consolidate).  The other possibility will be for a much
lighter event over the Northwest into the Rockies early in the
week and less moisture extending downstream, while a system off
California moves into the Southwest by midweek or so with moisture
continuing eastward into late week.  Either way some moisture may
reach the West Coast late in the week depending on the exact
timing/strength of the upper trough amplifying over the eastern
Pacific.

The upper low emerging from the southern Rockies early in the week
will keep highs up to 10-20F below normal over the southern High
Plains on Monday followed by a rapid rebound to near normal as the
feature continues onward.  Then cool high pressure building over
the East will lead to highs 5-15F below normal near the East Coast
on Tuesday, again followed by a quick recovery.  The Northern
Plains region will likely be consistently warmer than average next
week with most days featuring some plus 10-20F anomalies.  A
majority of the West should see near to slightly below normal
readings early-mid week followed by a warming trend as upper
ridging builds over the region.  As with precipitation, some
aspects of the temperature forecast over the lower 48 will depend
closely on the uncertain details of individual systems.

...Heavy rain threat over the South continuing into early next
week and then gradually diminishing...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

The medium-range period continues with the theme of uncertainty
that has been plaguing the late-week forecast lately.  At issue is
whether a compact upper low will detach from the northern stream
trough well off the Pacific Northwest Coast early next week before
eventually emerging into the Plains late next week.  In the mean
time, there is good model consensus on the threat of heavy
rainfall across the Deep South early next week.  The rain should
slide eastward and could bring areas of heavy rain across the
interior Southeast on Tuesday.

The GFS has been quite consistent in forecasting the
aforementioned trough fracture off the Pacific Northwest early
next week.  This flow separation issue ultimately leads to high
uncertainty in the synoptic pattern evolution over the eastern
Pacific and then eastward across much of the lower 48.  Meanwhile,
the ECMWF has largely avoided significant trough fracture but has
been keeping a digging trough down into the West Coast.  This
would result in a much more progressive pattern propagating
downstream across the northern tier states in stark contrast with
the GFS which eventually brings the detached upper low into the
Plains with potential for cyclogenesis late next week.  On the
other hand, the latest (12Z) ECMWF did indicate a switch toward
the GFS' trough fracture scenario.  It appears that the amplitude
of the upper trough currently in the northern Pacific is sharp
enough to allow such trough fracture to occur further downstream.
Given past performances of the ECMWF and the GFS in recent months
across the northeastern Pacific, the morning medium-range package
adopted an intermediate solution which is comparable to the CMC.
This solution allows a low pressure wave to form over the southern
High Plains during the middle of next week before showing some
amplification over the central/southern Plains late next week.

The WPC medium-range fronts and pressures were derived based on
the consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS
with smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  Beginning
on Day 5, more of the 06Z GEFS together with the 00Z EC mean were
used due to the above normal forecast uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The upper low tracking out of the southern Rockies and through the
Plains early in the week should interact with a front near the
Gulf Coast, supporting one or more waves along the front and a
northward flow of Gulf moisture.  This evolution will favor
another episode of locally heavy rainfall across parts of the
South during the first part of the week, with lighter
precipitation extending farther north over the southern half of
the Plains and an increasing portion of the East.  There may be
some snow in the northern part of the precipitation shield.  The
rest of the forecast has lower than average confidence for
specifics.  One scenario--currently somewhat more likely--would
have a period of moderate rain/mountain snow over the Northwest
and vicinity at the start of the week with mostly light activity
then spreading into the Interior West/Rockies followed by
precipitation of varying intensity spreading across the East in
association with one or more surface lows/fronts (which may
eventually consolidate).  The other possibility will be for a much
lighter event over the Northwest into the Rockies early in the
week and less moisture extending downstream, while a system off
California moves into the Southwest by midweek or so with moisture
continuing eastward into late week.  Either way some moisture may
reach the West Coast late in the week depending on the exact
timing/strength of the upper trough amplifying over the eastern
Pacific.

The upper low emerging from the southern Rockies early in the week
will keep highs up to 10-20F below normal over the southern High
Plains on Monday followed by a rapid rebound to near normal as the
feature continues onward.  Then cool high pressure building over
the East will lead to highs 5-15F below normal near the East Coast
on Tuesday, again followed by a quick recovery.  The Northern

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 26 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast to shift east to the West Coast
from March 6 to 8, likely resulting in rain and high-elevation snow across the
Pacific Northwest and northern California. As this area of mid-level low
pressure continues to progress eastward, there is an increasing chance of a
stormy pattern developing for the north-central U.S. by mid-March. Multiple
low
pressure systems are forecast to track eastward across the Bering Sea which
favors above normal precipitation throughout Alaska during week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation (rain and high-elevation snow) for parts of
northern California and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Sat-Mon, Mar 6-8.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Sat-Mon, Mar 6-8.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Great Plains, Middle to
Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley, Tue-Fri, Mar 9-12.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the western U.S.,
Wed-Fri, Mar 10-12.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MARCH 01 - FRIDAY MARCH 05:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!qGRHkaxhXmwc6VP3pR3zAK_9oKa0ud0z_WgoedQQBT7EWygk5Vo19urUxygyrPWSAVjznXhk$

FOR SATURDAY MARCH 06 - FRIDAY MARCH 12: An amplified 500-hPa trough is
expected to progress east to the West Coast which favors near to above normal
precipitation for the Pacific Northwest and California during week-2. Based on
model continuity and precipitation tools, the most likely area and timing of
heavy precipitation (rain and high-elevation snow) exists across northern
California and the Sierra Nevada Mountains from March 6 to 8. Therefore, a
slight risk of heavy precipitation (24-hour amounts of near 1 inch, liquid
equivalent) is posted for these areas early in week-2. As 500-hPa heights
decrease, snow levels are likely to lower and a slight risk of heavy snow
(more
than a foot per day) is designated for the Sierra Nevada Mountains, also from
March 6 to 8. As of February 25, snow water equivalent for this time of year
are: 66% (Northern Sierra), 71% (Central Sierra), and 49% (Southern Sierra) of
normal. Although no snow hazards are currently posted for the Great Basin or
Rockies, a continued eastward shift of the 500-hPa would likely bring at least
occasional snowfall to those areas during early to mid-March. Later in week-2
(Mar 10-12), a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for
areas across the West where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict that
minimum temperatures have a 20 percent chance of falling below the 15th
percentile of the climatological distribution and below 40 degrees F. These
tools indicate that there is at least a 20 percent chance of a frost occurring
across the Central Valley of California.



As an amplified 500-hPa trough axis becomes centered over the interior West
during the second week of March, lee side cyclogenesis is probable across the
High Plains. During early March, the pattern favors at least several days of
return flow from the Gulf of Mexico which is likely to lead to an increase in
low-level moisture across the central U.S. This evolving pattern and
precipitation tools support a slight risk of heavy precipitation, beginning on
March 9, from the Great Plains east to the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes. This
slight risk area coincides with a typical mid-latitude storm track given the
longwave pattern over North America and is also consistent with the week-2
analog tool. To the northwest of any surface low track, there would be an
elevated risk of snowfall across the northern/central Great Plains northeast
to
the Upper Mississippi Valley.



Forecast confidence for any week-2 precipitation hazards along the East Coast
remains low due to poor model consistency and agreement. The deterministic GFS
model and many of its ensemble members are trending towards a closed 500-hPa
low developing over the Southeast by March 6 with a slow-moving surface low
near the Mid-Atlantic. However, there is little to no support from the 0Z
ECMWF
model as it features a progressive full-latitude trough. Due to these large
model differences, no precipitation hazards are posted for the eastern U.S.



A longwave trough over the Bering Sea and multiple low pressure systems favor
above normal precipitation throughout the Aleutians and Mainland Alaska during
week-2. Given that temperatures are also likely to average below normal,
snowfall amounts are expected to be enhanced, especially across southwestern
Mainland Alaska. The surface lows, crossing the Bering Sea, are forecast to
increase wind speeds along the coast of the southwestern Mainland, but wind
speeds are expected to remain below hazards thresholds.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri February 26 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 04 - 08 2021

Today's model forecasts are in good agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation
pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day
period. Troughing is forecast over the Bering Sea extending southward across
Mainland Alaska and the Gulf of Alaska, while ridging is predicted over most
of
the central and eastern CONUS in most model solutions. The manual height blend
depicts negative 500-hPa height anomalies over most of Alaska except for parts
of the Aleutians. Near to below normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over the
Pacific Coast and southern Florida, while positive 500-hPa height anomalies
are
predicted across the remainder of the CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are likely over the Pacific coastal states of the
CONUS, related to troughing over the Gulf of Alaska. Above normal temperatures
are likely over much of the central and eastern CONUS, under near to above
normal 500-hPa heights. Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are
enhanced
across Alaska, except for the western Aleutians where near normal temperatures
are favored, under predicted negative 500-hPa height anomalies.

Above normal precipitation is favored over northern and central portions of
the
Pacific Coast of the CONUS due to the potential emergence of shortwaves ahead
of a trough over the Gulf of Alaska. Chances of near to below normal
precipitation are enhanced for the remainder of the CONUS under near to above
normal 500-hPa heights, consistent with operational Autoblend and ERF
Consolidation tools. Near to above normal precipitation is likely across
Alaska, under enhanced westerly flow.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 60% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 10%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good model agreement with some disagreement among the the temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 06 - 12 2021

The main features of the predicted circulation pattern for the 6-10 day period
persist into the week 2 period in the manual 500-hPa height blend. A trough
and
below normal 500-hPa heights are depicted over the western CONUS. Ridging and
positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over most of the eastern CONUS.
A trough is forecast over the Bering Sea, and below normal 500-hPa heights and
enhanced westerly flow are expected over much of Mainland Alaska.

The temperature pattern forecast for the week 2 period is similar to the 6-10
day outlook period. Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures are
forecast for the western CONUS, due to the predicted trough and associated
negative 500-hPa height anomalies. Above normal temperatures are favored over
most of the central and eastern CONUS  under positive 500-hPa height
anomalies.
Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures are indicated for the
Alaska Mainland and Alaska Panhandle, under negative 500-hPa height anomalies,
while above normal temperatures are forecast over the western Aleutians
associated with positive 500-hpa height anomalies.

Above normal precipitation is favored over southern California, under a
predicted trough. Near to below normal precipitation is favored over most of
the remainder of the CONUS, except for parts of the Upper and Middle
Mississippi Valley, the Upper Great Lakes, and the Ohio Valley, where above
normal precipitation is likely, consistent with operational Autoblend and ERF
Consolidation tools, and supported by most dynamical model forecasts. Enhanced
probabilities of above normal precipitation are favored over most of Alaska in
week 2, under persistent westerly mid-level flow.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 10% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day
11, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good model agreement with some disagreement among the the temperature and
precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
303 PM EST Fri Feb 26 2021

Valid 00Z Sat Feb 27 2021 - 00Z Mon Mar 01 2021

...Heavy mountain snow and gusty winds will impact portions of the
Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies through Saturday...

...Numerous showers and thunderstorms likely from the Lower/Middle
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys to Southern Appalachians
through the weekend...

...Light snow and wintry mix to spread throughout the
Appalachians, Northeast, and New England between this evening and
Saturday...

In the Northwest, a potent upper-level trough is forecast to drop
southward into the region today, leading to continued snow in
higher elevations as well as the potential for high winds.
Snowfall totals are expected to be 1 to 2 feet in the peaks of the
Cascades and Northern Rockies before snow winds down Saturday. The
Wasatch and Wind River Mountains/Tetons could see snowfall amounts
of 6 to 12 inches. Meanwhile, high winds with gusts over 50 mph
are possible in some areas in and north of the Great Basin,
leading to blowing snow and reduced visibility. Winter Storm
Warnings/Winter Weather Advisories and High Wind Warnings/Wind
Advisories are in effect for portions of the Northwest given these
threats. With this pattern, cooler than average temperatures are
likely across much of the Intermountain West, with highs about
10-20 degrees below average by Saturday persisting through the
weekend. Working with the injection of fresh cold air, the frontal
system that blanketed areas in the Mountain West with snow
yesterday will produce more winter weather Northern Plains late
tonight into tomorrow morning. Several inches of snow and a light
glaze of freezing rain are possible across portions of the upper
Corn Belt. The active pattern continues Sunday with yet another
frontal system on the heels of the first, with a shot of light
rain in the Central Plains transitioning to a winter mix north of
a warm front in the upper Missouri Valley.

Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms are possible over the
next few days across portions of the central and eastern U.S. near
meandering frontal boundaries. In particular, through Saturday
night, rain of 1 to locally 3 inches with locally higher amounts
are likely across portions of the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley
eastward into the Tennessee and Lower Ohio Valleys and toward the
Southern Appalachians. Several days of widespread rainfall could
lead to an enhanced flash flood threat in these areas, especially
into the weekend as rain could fall onto already wet ground. As
such, a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall is in place through
tomorrow morning in the Tennessee Valley, with a Slight Risk in
effect for Saturday and Sunday. Further west, the Storm Prediction
Center has outlooked a Marginal Risk of severe weather over the
Upper Red River Valley into the Ozarks tomorrow, due to the risk
of damaging hail.

By this evening and into the first half of this weekend, a wave of
showers associated with the aforementioned frontal system and an
approaching wave of low pressure is forecast to encounter a colder
airmass in place from the Central Appalachians to northern New
England. 2 to 3 inches of snow and a glaze of freezing rain will
be possible, and Winter Weather Advisories are in effect for
portions of the Appalachians. Light rain is expected for coastal
regions and major cities along the I-95 corridor during this time
frame. Temperatures will rise to above normal beginning Saturday
throughout the central and eastern U.S., so additional
precipitation should fall as rain, with the exception of northern
Maine.

...Heavy rain threat over the South continuing into
Tuesday-Tuesday night and then diminishing...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Although the past day of guidance has shown a strong trend toward
the general GFS/GEFS scenario of eastern Pacific shortwave energy
forming a closed low off California by the start of the period,
there are still plenty of forecast uncertainties yet to be
resolved.  As of the 12Z/18Z cycles there were still some
differences in where this upper low closes off and how quickly it
progresses through the southwestern U.S. (GFS fastest).  While
this system moves into/through the Southwest, guidance continues
to advertise amplification of an upstream eastern Pacific
trough--which should ultimately amplify downstream North American
flow as well.  By late in the period most guidance amplifies
eastern U.S. troughing more than the GFS/GEFS mean runs.  This
leads to the ECMWF/CMC and their means becoming more suppressed
with the surface pattern over the eastern half of the country
compared to the GFS/GEFS mean.  Teleconnections relative to a
positive height anomaly center over the central Pacific as well as
a negative anomaly center over eastern Siberia in the D+8
multi-day means support more troughing over eastern North America
than forecast by the GFS/GEFS.  It remains to be seen to what
extent though.

Otherwise, the aforementioned amplifying eastern Pacific trough
the approaches the West late in the week continues to display some
timing spread with the ECMWF/ECMWF mean somewhat slower than other
solutions.  Exact timing will become sensitive to progressive
upstream flow late in the period.  Over the eastern half of the
country early in the period, the GFS is on its own in becoming
much faster and more sheared than other solutions (including the
GEFS mean to some degree) with a compact upper low which consensus
shows over the south-central Plains as of early Tue and then
opening up as it continues eastward.

For the first half of the period a 12Z/18Z operational model blend
represented the preferred non-GFS cluster for the initial Plains
upper low early Tuesday and surface waviness that it may generate
over the Southeast by early Wednesday as the opening upper feature
continues onward.  The blend also provided an intermediate timing
for the upper low that forms offshore California and then moves
into the Southwest.  Teleconnection relations recommended tilting
the forecast over the eastern half of the country somewhat more
toward the ECMWF/ECMWF mean/CMC relative to the GFS/GEFS mean by
days 6-7 Friday/Saturday, while a more even balance could be valid
farther westward.

New 00Z guidance thus far maintains support for the non-GFS
cluster from the Plains into the East early in the period while
the UKMET/CMC are consolidating close to the 12Z ECMWF for the
upper low tracking into the Southwest in contrast to the GFS that
has trended even faster than its 18Z runs.  The new ECMWF becomes
just a bit faster than its 12Z run.  Later in the period over the
East, the new CMC/ECMWF still support the established non-GFS
cluster for the overall pattern though the ECMWF has hedged a bit
less suppressed than the prior run.  The new ECMWF also adjusted a
fraction faster with the late period trough nearing the West
Coast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The favored guidance consensus still shows the potential for
another episode of locally heavy rainfall over parts of the South
into Tuesday-Tuesday night.  Expect the upper low forecast to be
over the south-central Plains early Tuesday to open up as it
continues eastward, interacting with a front near the Gulf Coast
and supporting one or more frontal waves along with some inclusion
of Gulf moisture.  Lighter precipitation could reach as far north
as the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic.  Precise northward
extent and intensity of precipitation remains fairly uncertain.
The upper low closing off to the west of California should bring
moderate amounts of moisture into the southwestern U.S. and Plains
by mid-late week (some snow possible at high elevations over the
Four Corners states), still with only moderate confidence for
timing at best.  Confidence trends even lower for the northward
extent of precipitation over the eastern half of the country by
late week/weekend, given the differences in how much eastern U.S.
upper troughing develops in response to upstream amplification.
To the east of the Rockies, with both systems there could be some
wintry weather in the northern fringe/higher elevations of the
precipitation shield if the moisture extends far enough north.
Over the Northwest/West Coast, precipitation should initially be
light to moderate and primarily over northern areas.  The upper
trough approaching the West Coast later in the week should bring
an increase and southward expansion of precipitation but with
continued uncertainty over the exact timing of this evolution.

The above normal temperatures expected over the Northern Plains
and vicinity through the period are one of the more consistent and
confident aspects of the forecast.  There should be decent
coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs/morning lows most days
and some locations could see highs greater than 20F above average.
 Southern and eastern states will see a cool day Tuesday with East
Coast areas most likely to see some highs 10-15F below normal,
followed by rebound toward normal.  Locations near the East Coast
could see a cooling trend next weekend depending on how much upper
troughing develops.  The West will see a warming trend that should
support highs reaching 5-15F above normal by late in the week.

...Heavy rain threat over the South continuing into
Tuesday-Tuesday night and then diminishing...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Although the past day of guidance has shown a strong trend toward
the general GFS/GEFS scenario of eastern Pacific shortwave energy
forming a closed low off California by the start of the period,
there are still plenty of forecast uncertainties yet to be
resolved.  As of the 12Z/18Z cycles there were still some
differences in where this upper low closes off and how quickly it
progresses through the southwestern U.S. (GFS fastest).  While
this system moves into/through the Southwest, guidance continues
to advertise amplification of an upstream eastern Pacific
trough--which should ultimately amplify downstream North American
flow as well.  By late in the period most guidance amplifies
eastern U.S. troughing more than the GFS/GEFS mean runs.  This
leads to the ECMWF/CMC and their means becoming more suppressed
with the surface pattern over the eastern half of the country
compared to the GFS/GEFS mean.  Teleconnections relative to a
positive height anomaly center over the central Pacific as well as
a negative anomaly center over eastern Siberia in the D+8
multi-day means support more troughing over eastern North America
than forecast by the GFS/GEFS.  It remains to be seen to what
extent though.

Otherwise, the aforementioned amplifying eastern Pacific trough
the approaches the West late in the week continues to display some
timing spread with the ECMWF/ECMWF mean somewhat slower than other
solutions.  Exact timing will become sensitive to progressive
upstream flow late in the period.  Over the eastern half of the
country early in the period, the GFS is on its own in becoming
much faster and more sheared than other solutions (including the
GEFS mean to some degree) with a compact upper low which consensus
shows over the south-central Plains as of early Tue and then
opening up as it continues eastward.

For the first half of the period a 12Z/18Z operational model blend
represented the preferred non-GFS cluster for the initial Plains
upper low early Tuesday and surface waviness that it may generate
over the Southeast by early Wednesday as the opening upper feature
continues onward.  The blend also provided an intermediate timing
for the upper low that forms offshore California and then moves
into the Southwest.  Teleconnection relations recommended tilting
the forecast over the eastern half of the country somewhat more
toward the ECMWF/ECMWF mean/CMC relative to the GFS/GEFS mean by
days 6-7 Friday/Saturday, while a more even balance could be valid
farther westward.

New 00Z guidance thus far maintains support for the non-GFS
cluster from the Plains into the East early in the period while
the UKMET/CMC are consolidating close to the 12Z ECMWF for the
upper low tracking into the Southwest in contrast to the GFS that
has trended even faster than its 18Z runs.  The new ECMWF becomes
just a bit faster than its 12Z run.  Later in the period over the
East, the new CMC/ECMWF still support the established non-GFS
cluster for the overall pattern though the ECMWF has hedged a bit
less suppressed than the prior run.  The new ECMWF also adjusted a
fraction faster with the late period trough nearing the West
Coast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The favored guidance consensus still shows the potential for
another episode of locally heavy rainfall over parts of the South
into Tuesday-Tuesday night.  Expect the upper low forecast to be
over the south-central Plains early Tuesday to open up as it
continues eastward, interacting with a front near the Gulf Coast
and supporting one or more frontal waves along with some inclusion
of Gulf moisture.  Lighter precipitation could reach as far north
as the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic.  Precise northward
extent and intensity of precipitation remains fairly uncertain.
The upper low closing off to the west of California should bring
moderate amounts of moisture into the southwestern U.S. and Plains
by mid-late week (some snow possible at high elevations over the
Four Corners states), still with only moderate confidence for
timing at best.  Confidence trends even lower for the northward
extent of precipitation over the eastern half of the country by
late week/weekend, given the differences in how much eastern U.S.
upper troughing develops in response to upstream amplification.
To the east of the Rockies, with both systems there could be some
wintry weather in the northern fringe/higher elevations of the
precipitation shield if the moisture extends far enough north.
Over the Northwest/West Coast, precipitation should initially be
light to moderate and primarily over northern areas.  The upper
trough approaching the West Coast later in the week should bring
an increase and southward expansion of precipitation but with
continued uncertainty over the exact timing of this evolution.

The above normal temperatures expected over the Northern Plains
and vicinity through the period are one of the more consistent and
confident aspects of the forecast.  There should be decent
coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs/morning lows most days
and some locations could see highs greater than 20F above average.
 Southern and eastern states will see a cool day Tuesday with East
Coast areas most likely to see some highs 10-15F below normal,
followed by rebound toward normal.  Locations near the East Coast
could see a cooling trend next weekend depending on how much upper
troughing develops.  The West will see a warming trend that should
support highs reaching 5-15F above normal by late in the week.

...Widespread rain and thunderstorms could cause flooding across
portions of the Lower/Middle Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio
Valleys to the Central Appalachians through the weekend...

...Snow in the Northwest and the Northeast should wind down today,
but a round of light to moderate snow is possible in the
north-central CONUS...

Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms are possible over the
next few days across portions of the central and eastern U.S. near
meandering frontal boundaries and as moisture streams in from the
Gulf of Mexico. In particular, through Sunday night, rainfall of 1
to 3 inches with locally higher amounts is likely stretching from
parts of the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee
and Ohio Valleys and the Central/Southern Appalachians. This rain
will lead to flooding and flash flooding concerns, especially
where rain falls on already wet ground from previous and ongoing
rainfall. Slight Risks of excessive rainfall are in place through
the weekend for these areas, along with Flood Watches in the Lower
Ohio Valley to Central Appalachians. Additionally, the Storm
Prediction Center has outlooked Marginal Risks of severe weather
for the next couple of days, given that storms could be strong to
severe.

After a snowy couple of days particularly in higher elevations of
the Northwest, snow is forecast to wind down there by this
afternoon. However, as the system moves east, some snow or mixed
precipitation is forecast to affect the Northern/Central Plains
and make its way into the Upper Midwest and Upper Great Lakes
region tonight. A swath of snow around 3 to 6 inches is possible,
along with a light glaze of freezing rain just to the south of the
snow axis in the Upper Midwest. In the Northeast, some snow and
light freezing rain is expected today, with snow amounts of 4 to 8
inches in portions of Maine, where there are Winter Weather
Advisories in effect. Another round of light snow could spread
into the interior Northeast by Monday morning.

Elsewhere, fire weather is a concern across portions of the
Southern High Plains today, and Red Flag Warnings are in place
there. Gusty winds are possible in the southwestern U.S. and parts
of California in particular, so scattered Wind Advisories and High
Wind Watches are in effect.

In terms of temperatures, cooler than normal temperatures will
persist in the Great Basin and Rockies through the weekend,
dropping southeastward into the Desert Southwest and
central/southern portions of the High Plains Sunday as a cold
front pushes through. Meanwhile, above normal temperatures are
likely for the eastern half of the country this weekend. Highs of
10 to 20 degrees above average will be common, with low
temperatures even milder, as warm moist air comes into the
Southeast from the Gulf. Daily record high maximum and minimum
temperatures could be set in the Gulf Coast states and toward the
Southern Appalachians.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
...Southern High Plains...
Lee cyclogenesis is ongoing in southeast Colorado with southwesterly
flow starting to strengthen across the southern High Plains. These
winds are expected to strengthen through the day as the pressure
gradient tightens and as deep mixing transports stronger mid-level
flow toward the surface. A broad area of 20 to 25 mph winds are
expected across much of the southern High Plains with the strongest
winds approaching 30 mph in northern New Mexico into the Oklahoma
Panhandle.

In addition, dewpoints are already in the single digits across much
of New Mexico, and this dry air will spread east into the TX/OK
Panhandles this afternoon. This combination of windy and very dry
conditions will lead to a broad area of elevated conditions in much
of the southern High Plains. Fuels in southwest Kansas are not that
dry, but given the strength of the winds and the dry air mass, rapid
drying of 1-hour fuels is expected to provide enough dry fuels for
some risk of fire spread.

Added a critical area along the New Mexico border from far southeast
Colorado to Parmer County, Texas. In this area, the aforementioned
meteorological conditions are expected, and fuels are drier than
elsewhere. There have been fires reported earlier this week and
fuels have dried significantly since then. Therefore, a critical
delineation is warranted.

...Southern California...
Very strong offshore winds are expected across much of southern
California starting early Sunday morning as an offshore pressure
gradient combines with upper-level support. Dry fuels and relative
humidity will be in place, but cool conditions are expected with
temperatures in the 20s to 30s expected in many of the mountain
areas. Therefore, an elevated delineation was added as wind and
relative humidity support fire spread, but cool temperatures should
temper the overall threat.

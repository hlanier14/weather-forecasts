...Heavy snow likely across parts of the Midwest on Friday, with
lingering uncertainties downstream along the East Coast this
weekend...

...Overview...

Mean ridging is likely over the West during the medium range
period, though with the possibility of shortwaves tracking through
the mean flow while southern stream troughing lingers near or
offshore the California/Baja California coast. Meanwhile, one
shortwave will exit the East Coast early Friday as the next one
drops through the Midwest, bringing the potential for heavy
snowfall to parts of the area. The shortwave should slide through
the Southeast and pivot off the East coast to support another East
Coast low this weekend into early next week. This could bring
potentially impactful wintry weather across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, but confidence in the details
remain very low.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance shows fairly good agreement for the
large-scale pattern, but with some lingering uncertainties in some
potentially impactful details. An initial surface low off the East
Coast on Friday looks to remain well offshore to limit any
significant impacts to the Northeast, but may affect the Canadian
Maritimes this weekend. Farther upstream, the models agree that
shortwave energy will be spilling into the Midwest on Friday. Most
of the 00z guidance (and incoming 12z guidance) continue to trend
southward with the low and associated heavy snow axis across the
Midwest on Friday.

By this weekend, the shortwave should pivot across the Southeast
inducing development of low pressure at the surface which
eventually moves up the East Coast early next week. Compared to
yesterdays 12z/18z guidance, the 00z/06z (and the new 12z)
guidance shows a very notable westward shift, now bringing the low
closer to or over the East Coast next Sunday-Tuesday. The 06z GFS
was the farthest west with the low, while the 00z ECMWF and CMC
kept it well offshore. However, the newest 12z runs have now
shifted significantly westward and much closer to the GFS. There
also remains considerable spread in individual ensemble members as
well, although the means are faster than the deterministic runs
(likely due to lower amplitude in the upper pattern). The WPC
blend for today was closer to the 00z ECMWF, 00z CMC, and 00z
UKMET keeping the low off the East Coast but still closer than the
previous WPC forecast. Although, given the newest 12z guidance
(which arrived after the forecast was issued), the WPC forecast is
now east of the consensus. Needless to say, the details of any
potential winter weather impacts to parts of the Mid-Atlantic the
Northeast remain highly uncertain at this time as most new model
runs continue to change and shift and will likely do so in the
coming days.

Out West, periodic and weak shortwave intrusions should briefly
break up the ridge out West through the period. There's good
agreement in the deterministic runs through at least the first
half of the period, with less uncertain timing and detail
differences arising late. One shortwave should traverse the far
northern tier of the U.S., eventually moving across the Great
Lakes and amplifying over the East later in the period. There
remains plenty of uncertainty around how this energy
interacts/combines with the shortwave moving up the East Coast in
the days prior, so a trend towards the ensemble means later in the
period seemed ideal at this time.

...Weather Highlights...

While deepening Atlantic low pressure late this week should stay
far enough offshore to keep a majority of precipitation east of
New England on Friday, gusty winds may be possible due to the
tight gradient between this storm and eastern Canada high
pressure. The shortwave and surface low dropping southeastward
from the northern tier late this week will likely bring a swath of
wintry precipitation across portions of the Midwest, followed by
some of this precipitation extending across the eastern U.S. this
weekend. Guidance signals are improving for a band of significant
snow that may cover parts of Minnesota/Wisconsin/Iowa/Illinois
around Friday-Friday night, albeit with some uncertainty remaining
for location and magnitude as well as exact timing. Confidence
remains  low for locations, coverage, and amounts of wintry
precipitation farther east. Latest trends continue to suggest a
farther west axis over the East which brings the heaviest
precipitation along the East Coast, with potential for heavy snow
farther inland. Again, this is highly uncertain and subject to
change, but the potential is there. The south-central and
southeastern U.S. should see mostly light to moderate rain along
the southern side of the precipitation shield. An area of light
snow may extend across the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes
around Sunday-Monday with the system moving into the region. The
most likely forecast scenario has generally light and scattered
precipitation over the West during the period.

Temperature-wise, the central U.S. will see mild conditions on
Friday, with lows 10-20F above average while 10-15F above normal
highs are expected for the Southern Plains. Warmer than average
temperatures should continue into early next week for portions of
the Plains. Meanwhile, colder than average temperatures are likely
for the Great Lakes to the Northeast through the weekend, with
Saturday the coldest day in the Northeast with temperatures 15-25F
below normal. The West should see temperatures within about 5-10
degrees of normal, with a tendency toward slightly warmer than
average conditions especially for lows.

An amplifying mid/upper-level ridge will be centered over the
Intermountain West, while a belt of strong northwesterly midlevel
flow extends from the northern Plains into the Middle MS Valley. At
the surface, high pressure will encompass much of the western and
central CONUS, with weak lee troughing persisting over the central
Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
While a dry air mass characterized by RH in the lower/middle teens
will develop across the southern High Plains during the afternoon,
generally light northerly winds should limit the overall
fire-weather threat.

300 PM EST January 11 2022

SYNOPSIS: There are increasing signals of a significant intrusion of Arctic
air
overspreading much of the central and eastern U.S. during the second half o=
f
January. This results from an amplified 500-hPa height pattern forecast dur=
ing
week-2, with broad mid-level low pressure east of the Rockies and mid-level
high pressure across the East Pacific and Alaska resulting in enhanced
northerly flow across much of the contiguous U.S. Early in week-2 the most
anomalous cold is favored across the Upper Midwest, with the cold air mass
forecast to expand southward and eastward throughout the period. This patte=
rn
also favors an active storm track over the East, as well as enhanced chance=
s
of
lake effect snow. Surface low pressure forecast over the north-central paci=
fic
favors elevated chances of heavy precipitation across the southern coast of
Alaska.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Northern
Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes, Wed-Thu, Jan 19-=
20.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Norther=
n
Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Northeast,
Wed-Tue, Jan 19-25.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the central and
eastern CONUS, Wed-Tue, Jan 19-25.

FOR WEDNESDAY JANUARY 19 - TUESDAY JANUARY 25: Broad 500-hPa troughing is
forecast over the central and eastern CONUS, with ridging predicted upstrea=
m
across the Eastern Pacific. This pattern favors anomalous northerly mid-lev=
el
flow over the CONUS, which will act to bring waves of Arctic air southward =
out
of Canada. Initially, the coldest air is forecast across portions of the Up=
per
Midwest as surface high pressure moves over the region. A high risk for muc=
h
below normal temperatures is posted for Jan 19 and 20 over parts of the
Northern Pains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes where the
GEFS reforecast tool depicts a 40-60 percent chance of minimum temperatures
dropping below the 15th percentile. Although the probabilities in the ECMWF
reforecast tool are lower (20-40 percent), uncalibrated guidance from both =
the
0z GEFS and ECMWF ensembles indicate minimum temperature anomalies of at le=
ast
-10 deg F over some areas. This translates to temperatures falling below 0 =
deg
F over parts of the highlighted region, and below -10 deg F across portions=
 of
North Dakota and northern Minnesota, with several of the latest determinist=
ic
GFS solutions depicting even colder temperatures. Although the reforecast t=
ool
probabilities are lower than usual for a high risk, it was justified due to
the
favorable synoptic set-up combined with it being the coldest time of year
climatologically.



During the early and middle parts of week-2, the anomalous cold is favored =
to
take on a more positive tilt. This is particularly evident in the ECMWF
reforecast tool, which depicts probabilities of at least 30 percent for
temperatures falling below the 15th climatological percentile extending fro=
m
the Great Lakes to the Northeast on days 9 and 10 (Jan 20 and 21). The GEFS
reforecast tool persists the higher probabilities across the Upper Mississi=
ppi
Valley and Great Lakes throughout week-2, while expanding the elevated
probabilities (at least 20 percent) throughout much of the central and east=
ern
CONUS by the second half of the period. A moderate risk of much below norma=
l
temperatures is posted for parts of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi
Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Northeast for all of week-2, with
temperatures in the single digits and teens (deg F) possible over parts of =
the
Ohio Valley and Northeast, in addition to subzero temperatures continuing
across the Upper Midwest. An active storm track in the East prior to and
during
week-2 may also increase the snow pack over parts of the Northeast, which
favors larger negative temperature anomalies. A slight risk for much below
normal temperatures is posted for much of the central and eastern CONUS for
all
of week-2 given the potential for the anomalous cold to continue to expand.
While positive temperature anomalies across the Central and Southern Plains
and
Southeast are favored initially, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
depict elevated probabilities (at least 20 percent) of subfreezing
temperatures
reaching parts of Texas and the Central Gulf Coast states by the end of
week-2.



During the early part of week-2, models continue to depict a southern strea=
m
disturbance propagating around the broad trough forecast over the central a=
nd
eastern CONUS. Increased moisture is first favored to build across the
southeastern states where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at
least
a 20 percent chance for 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th
climatological percentile and 1-inch over some areas supporting a slight ri=
sk
for heavy precipitation on Jan 19 and 20. By Jan 21 uncalibrated ECMWF and
GEFS
ensemble guidance depict this moisture consolidating off the East Coast,
possibly enhancing precipitation over eastern New England. A track closer t=
o
the coast could bring more snow to portions of the Northeast due to the col=
d
air expected to be in place, thus a slight risk of heavy snow is posted fro=
m
Jan 19 to 22 to account for this potential. Regardless of the fate of this
southern stream disturbance, the northern stream is forecast to remain acti=
ve,
with intermittent shortwaves diving out of Canada, each bringing an enhance=
d
chance of lake effect snow to parts of the Great Lakes region, which is als=
o
included in the slight risk for heavy snow.



Anomalous ridging and surface high pressure is forecast across the Eastern
Pacific and Alaska during week-2, promoting increased southerly or
southwesterly flow across the southern part of Alaska. Additionally, trough=
ing
and associated surface low pressure forecast over the west-central Pacific =
is
forecast to move closer to Alaska. This will result in a tightening of the
pressure gradients, both at the mid-levels and the surface, further enhanci=
ng
a
deep southerly moisture flow into southern Alaska. The GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools depict some areas along the southern coast of the Mainland
and
the northern Panhandle having at least a 20 percent chance of 3-day
precipitation exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 2-inches
throughout the period. The uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble indicates at least a=
 20
percent chance for 24-hour precipitation to exceed 1-inch over parts of
southern Alaska beginning on day 9 (Jan 20). Therefore a slight risk of hea=
vy
precipitation is posted along the southern coast of Mainland Alaska, the
Alaska
Peninsula, and the northern Alaska Panhandle for Jan 20-25. An accompanying
slight risk of high winds is also posted for these areas plus parts of the
Aleutians during the same timeframe, supported by both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools, which depict at least a 20 percent chance of wind speeds
exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 25-mph over these areas.

...Heavy snow likely across parts of the Midwest on Friday, with
lingering uncertainties downstream along the East Coast this
weekend...

...Overview...

Mean ridging is likely over the West during the medium range
period, though with the possibility of shortwaves tracking through
the mean flow while southern stream troughing lingers near or
offshore the California/Baja California coast. Meanwhile, one
shortwave will exit the East Coast early Friday as the next one
drops through the Midwest, bringing the potential for heavy
snowfall to parts of the area. The shortwave should slide through
the Southeast and pivot off the East coast to support another East
Coast low this weekend into early next week. This could bring
potentially impactful wintry weather across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, but confidence in the details
remain very low.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance shows fairly good agreement for the
large-scale pattern, but with some lingering uncertainties in some
potentially impactful details. An initial surface low off the East
Coast on Friday looks to remain well offshore to limit any
significant impacts to the Northeast, but may affect the Canadian
Maritimes this weekend. Farther upstream, the models agree that
shortwave energy will be spilling into the Midwest on Friday. Most
of the 00z guidance (and incoming 12z guidance) continue to trend
southward with the low and associated heavy snow axis across the
Midwest on Friday.

By this weekend, the shortwave should pivot across the Southeast
inducing development of low pressure at the surface which
eventually moves up the East Coast early next week. Compared to
yesterdays 12z/18z guidance, the 00z/06z (and the new 12z)
guidance shows a very notable westward shift, now bringing the low
closer to or over the East Coast next Sunday-Tuesday. The 06z GFS
was the farthest west with the low, while the 00z ECMWF and CMC
kept it well offshore. However, the newest 12z runs have now
shifted significantly westward and much closer to the GFS. There
also remains considerable spread in individual ensemble members as
well, although the means are faster than the deterministic runs
(likely due to lower amplitude in the upper pattern). The WPC
blend for today was closer to the 00z ECMWF, 00z CMC, and 00z
UKMET keeping the low off the East Coast but still closer than the
previous WPC forecast. Although, given the newest 12z guidance
(which arrived after the forecast was issued), the WPC forecast is
now east of the consensus. Needless to say, the details of any
potential winter weather impacts to parts of the Mid-Atlantic the
Northeast remain highly uncertain at this time as most new model
runs continue to change and shift and will likely do so in the
coming days.

Out West, periodic and weak shortwave intrusions should briefly
break up the ridge out West through the period. There's good
agreement in the deterministic runs through at least the first
half of the period, with less uncertain timing and detail
differences arising late. One shortwave should traverse the far
northern tier of the U.S., eventually moving across the Great
Lakes and amplifying over the East later in the period. There
remains plenty of uncertainty around how this energy
interacts/combines with the shortwave moving up the East Coast in
the days prior, so a trend towards the ensemble means later in the
period seemed ideal at this time.

...Weather Highlights...

While deepening Atlantic low pressure late this week should stay
far enough offshore to keep a majority of precipitation east of
New England on Friday, gusty winds may be possible due to the
tight gradient between this storm and eastern Canada high
pressure. The shortwave and surface low dropping southeastward
from the northern tier late this week will likely bring a swath of
wintry precipitation across portions of the Midwest, followed by
some of this precipitation extending across the eastern U.S. this
weekend. Guidance signals are improving for a band of significant
snow that may cover parts of Minnesota/Wisconsin/Iowa/Illinois
around Friday-Friday night, albeit with some uncertainty remaining
for location and magnitude as well as exact timing. Confidence
remains  low for locations, coverage, and amounts of wintry
precipitation farther east. Latest trends continue to suggest a
farther west axis over the East which brings the heaviest
precipitation along the East Coast, with potential for heavy snow
farther inland. Again, this is highly uncertain and subject to
change, but the potential is there. The south-central and
southeastern U.S. should see mostly light to moderate rain along
the southern side of the precipitation shield. An area of light
snow may extend across the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes
around Sunday-Monday with the system moving into the region. The
most likely forecast scenario has generally light and scattered
precipitation over the West during the period.

Temperature-wise, the central U.S. will see mild conditions on
Friday, with lows 10-20F above average while 10-15F above normal
highs are expected for the Southern Plains. Warmer than average
temperatures should continue into early next week for portions of
the Plains. Meanwhile, colder than average temperatures are likely
for the Great Lakes to the Northeast through the weekend, with
Saturday the coldest day in the Northeast with temperatures 15-25F
below normal. The West should see temperatures within about 5-10
degrees of normal, with a tendency toward slightly warmer than
average conditions especially for lows.

...Bitter cold in the Northeast through early Wednesday; milder
regime begins to expand across much of the Lower 48...

...Heavy rain may lead to flooding across parts of western
Washington through Thursday...

...Canadian storm system to bring next round of accumulating
snowfall to the North Central U.S. Thursday night into Friday...

High pressure remains in control of the eastern U.S. this evening
with another cold night in store from Georgia on north to New
England. Wednesday morning lows plummeting below zero are expected
in northern New England while much of the Mid-Atlantic drops into
the teens. As high pressure slides off the East Coast on
Wednesday, southerly flow arriving in the Mid-South will prompt
the arrival of milder temperatures throughout the Mississippi
Valley on east to the Appalachians. That same milder air-mass is
forecast to reach the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic by Thursday. In
the Nation's Heartland, temperatures will remain seasonally warm
with widespread 50s and 60s for highs in the High Plains
Wednesday. By Thursday, high temps in South Texas are expected to
soar into the 70s. Meanwhile, a passing frontal boundary may
trigger spotty rain and snow showers on Thursday across the Great
Lakes and points east to the Northeast and central Appalachians.
Farther south, scattered showers and thunderstorms may form over
Florida early Thursday as an upper level disturbance approaches
from the west and spawns an area of low pressure near the northern
Bahamas.

The wettest conditions over the next couple days continues to
reside in the waterlogged Pacific Northwest. Additional rounds of
precipiation (primarily in the form of rain) have arrived in
western Washington and will persist into Wednesday morning. This
is due to an area of low pressure over the eastern Pacific Ocean
that is funneling a stream of moisture into the Olympic Peninsula
and Washington Cascades today and into Thursday. This atmospheric
river containing warm/moist air will lift freezing levels above
7000 feet, which results in heavy rain falling across even some of
the highest terrain. Rainfall totals exceeding 5 inches are likely
along upslope portions of the Olympic Peninsula, where recent
heavy rainfall has already fostered overly saturated antecedent
soil moisture conditions. Heavy rain is also expected to reach the
Washington Cascades and may produce flooding along rivers that
flow off the high terrain. A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall, as
well as Flood Watches, have been issued across this region today.
There is also a Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall in similar
parts of western Washington on Wednesday. Parts of the Columbia
Basin in central/eastern Washington will avoid the surge of warm
air at the surface and may contend with light freezing rain.
Winter Weather Advisories have been posted due to potentially icy
and slick travel conditions.

Looking ahead to Thursday night, a strengthening surface low
emerging out of the Canadian Prairies dives south into the North
Central U.S. Thursday night and into Friday. This next storm
system is primed to produce heavy snow and will result in
treacherous travel conditions across parts of the Northern Plains
and Midwest to close out the work-week. Residents in these areas

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 17 - 21 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
predicting an amplified
500-hPa circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions
during
the 6-10 day period. An amplified trough is forecast near the western
Aleutians
expanding northward to the Bering Sea, with associated below normal 500-hPa
heights. Downstream, anomalous ridging is predicted by the ensemble means o=
ver
Mainland Alaska, the Gulf of Alaska, and near the West Coast of the CONUS,
with
positive 500-hPa height anomalies forecast across these regions. Anomalous
troughing and associated near to below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast
over
most of the central an eastern CONUS.

A ridge forecast over the western CONUS favors elevated probabilities for n=
ear
to above normal temperatures for much of the western and central CONUS. Nea=
r
to
below normal temperatures are favored over parts of the easten CONUS, Great
Lakes and Upper Mississippi Valley due to forecast troughing and below norm=
al
500-hPa heights. Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over m=
ost
of central and southern Alaska, underneath above normal 500-hPa heights and
also associated with predicted low-level onshore flow. Increased probabilit=
ies
of near to below normal temperatures are indicated over northern Mainland
Alaska supported by the dynamical model forecasts.

Near to below normal precipitation is favored over most of the western CONU=
S,
underneath predicted above normal 500-hPa heights. Elevated chances of belo=
w
normal precipitation also likely over parts of the Central and Southern
Plains,
behind a forecast mean trough. Above normal precipitation is favored for pa=
rts
of the North  Plains extending eastward to the western Great Lakes Region.
Additionally, probabilities of above normal precipitation are elevated for
parts of the Southwest, Southern Rockies, Southern Plains, Lower Mississipp=
i
Valley, and the Gulf and East coasts, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool. Forecast low-level onshore flow leads to increased chances o=
f
above normal precipitation over central and southern Mainland Alaska, while
below normal precipitation is favored for parts of northern Alaska, support=
ed
by the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 19 - 25 2022

A highly amplified mid-level 500-hPa pattern is forecast to continue into
week-2. Anomalous ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights remain favored f=
or
the period as a whole over most of Alaska and the West Coast of the CONUS.
Troughing and associated below normal mid-level heights are forecast across
most of the central and eastern CONUS. Due to recent model performance,
today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
manual 500-hPa height blend forecast gives equal weight to the GEFS and ECM=
WF
ensemble means and less weight to the Canadian ensemble mean.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored over much of the western CONU=
S
and parts of the Southern Plains due to forecast ridging and above normal
500-hPa heights. Forecast troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights over t=
he
eastern CONUS favor elevated probabilities of below normal temperatures for
parts of the Northern Plains and much of the eastern CONUS, excerpt for
southern Florida where elevated chances of above normal temperatures are
indicated, consistent with the consolidation temperature forecast tool. Nea=
r
to
above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over Alaska, underneath=
 an
anomalous ridge and also associated with predicted low-level southerly flow=
.

Near to below normal precipitation is favored across the western quarter of
the
CONUS, under the predicted above normal 500-hPa heights. A trough forecast
over
the central and eastern CONUS favors elevated probabilities for near to abo=
ve
normal precipitation for the remainder of the CONUS, supported by the
consolidation precipitation forecast tool. Above normal precipitation is
favored for Alaska, associated with forecast low-level southerly flow.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, offset b=
y
increasing uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitat=
ion
forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

...Wintry weather is becoming increasingly likely for parts of the
Appalachians and Eastern Seaboard this weekend into early next
week, but with ample uncertainty...

...Overview...

The most notable weather feature during the medium range period,
and one of the most uncertain, is a developing surface low
pressure system that slides across the Southeast and then pivots
northward near the East Coast ahead of a potent mid-upper
shortwave trough. Deterministic models tend to have a
westward/more inland track with the surface low compared to the
ensemble guidance, so uncertainty is still an issue, but overall
guidance is trending toward a low pressure system possibly inland
or at least near enough to the East Coast to cause impactful
wintry weather. Meanwhile in the West, mainly dry conditions are
expected underneath surface high pressure, with the exception of
light precipitation in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies
as weak fronts track through.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance shows fairly good agreement for the
large-scale pattern, but with some lingering uncertainties in some
impactful details. Models agree that a strong shortwave will track
across the Central Plains into the Southeast this weekend, causing
surface low(s) to develop and strengthen, with some uncertainty in
their placement and phasing. But Sunday into Monday, guidance
shows good consensus for surface low pressure to consolidate and
deepen, but with variability in terms of its track. The 12Z/18Z
model cycle, and the incoming 00Z model cycle, continued to show a
notable westward shift compared to previous guidance, which was
true for both deterministic and ensemble guidance. However, the
deterministic models are generally even farther west than their
ensemble counterparts--the 12/18Z GFS runs and the 12Z CMC and
ECMWF (12Z UKMET was south/suppressed) clustered very well with an
onshore track over the northern Mid-Atlantic Monday morning, but
it is possible their supposed agreement is deceptive. When looking
at the ensemble means and individual ensemble members, the
deterministic guidance was well on the western side of the spread.
Felt it was prudent at the time the medium range forecast was made
to take a low track in between the 12Z deterministic and ensemble
mean positions, which led to a surface low near the coast of
Delaware/southern New Jersey but offshore in the western Atlantic
on 12Z Monday. The incoming 00Z guidance has generally continued
with a westward trend, including a good proportion of 00Z GEFS
members and the 00Z CMC ensemble mean, suggesting the
deterministic guidance may have been leading the ensemble means in
a track consensus. However, it should be stressed that the energy
leading to this potent shortwave are still in the data-poor
Pacific Ocean at this time and model and forecast changes, perhaps
large, could still occur.

In the West, ridging is likely to have hold of the region through
the weekend, other than a southern stream upper low centered
offshore of California meandering. This feature is forecast to
track eastward early in the workweek and join with the main flow,
and possibly interact with northern stream energy entering the
Pacific Northwest around Monday. Model agreement for this overall
pattern was fairly good, but with increasing differences
especially with embedded shortwaves as the period progressed.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was based on a blend of the 12Z
deterministic guidance and a small proportion of the GEFS and EC
ensemble mean guidance, eliminating the UKMET and increasing the
proportion of ensemble mean guidance to 40% by day 5/Monday and
holding that blend through day 7. This led to a more inland track
of the low pressure system and its associated precipitation/winter
weather impacts compared to the previous forecast.

...Weather Highlights...

Moderate to possibly locally heavy rain could move across the
Southeast quickly this weekend given the low pressure and frontal
systems in the vicinity. On the northern side of the precipitation
shield, the low pressure system could create some potential for
wintry weather across portions of the Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley into Tennessee and Kentucky on Saturday, which should be
mainly light, but confidence is low for amounts there especially
given the surface low will not have consolidated yet. Better
chances for heavier snow are likely in the Southern Appalachians
beginning Saturday, and snow is currently expected to spread
northeastward along/on the backside of the deepening low track
over the Eastern Seaboard this weekend into Monday. There is still
uncertainty for the details of this wintry weather that will need
to be resolved in future forecasts, but the trend continues for
impactful weather from the system.

Elsewhere, after the low exits northeast of the U.S. on Tuesday,
westerly flow and another shortwave should cause good conditions
for lake effect/enhanced snow over the Great Lakes. The West could
see some light precipitation during the period, particularly over
the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern Rockies early next
week, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere except possibly
southern Arizona/New Mexico Saturday. Rain could develop across
the Lower Mississippi Valley beginning Tuesday with return flow
from the Gulf of Mexico.

Temperature-wise, chilly weather with much below normal
temperatures by 15-30 degrees is forecast for the Northeast over
the weekend, with slightly cooler than average weather through
early next week for the southeastern quadrant of the country.
Temperatures should generally be above average in the Plains
particularly from Sunday onward after a cooler day Saturday. The
West should see temperatures within about 5-10 degrees of normal,
with a tendency toward slightly warmer than average conditions
especially for lows.

...Wintry weather is becoming increasingly likely for parts of the
Appalachians and Eastern Seaboard this weekend into early next
week, but with ample uncertainty...

...Overview...

The most notable weather feature during the medium range period,
and one of the most uncertain, is a developing surface low
pressure system that slides across the Southeast and then pivots
northward near the East Coast ahead of a potent mid-upper
shortwave trough. Deterministic models tend to have a
westward/more inland track with the surface low compared to the
ensemble guidance, so uncertainty is still an issue, but overall
guidance is trending toward a low pressure system possibly inland
or at least near enough to the East Coast to cause impactful
wintry weather. Meanwhile in the West, mainly dry conditions are
expected underneath surface high pressure, with the exception of
light precipitation in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies
as weak fronts track through.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance shows fairly good agreement for the
large-scale pattern, but with some lingering uncertainties in some
impactful details. Models agree that a strong shortwave will track
across the Central Plains into the Southeast this weekend, causing
surface low(s) to develop and strengthen, with some uncertainty in
their placement and phasing. But Sunday into Monday, guidance
shows good consensus for surface low pressure to consolidate and
deepen, but with variability in terms of its track. The 12Z/18Z
model cycle, and the incoming 00Z model cycle, continued to show a
notable westward shift compared to previous guidance, which was
true for both deterministic and ensemble guidance. However, the
deterministic models are generally even farther west than their
ensemble counterparts--the 12/18Z GFS runs and the 12Z CMC and
ECMWF (12Z UKMET was south/suppressed) clustered very well with an
onshore track over the northern Mid-Atlantic Monday morning, but
it is possible their supposed agreement is deceptive. When looking
at the ensemble means and individual ensemble members, the
deterministic guidance was well on the western side of the spread.
Felt it was prudent at the time the medium range forecast was made
to take a low track in between the 12Z deterministic and ensemble
mean positions, which led to a surface low near the coast of
Delaware/southern New Jersey but offshore in the western Atlantic
on 12Z Monday. The incoming 00Z guidance has generally continued
with a westward trend, including a good proportion of 00Z GEFS
members and the 00Z CMC ensemble mean, suggesting the
deterministic guidance may have been leading the ensemble means in
a track consensus. However, it should be stressed that the energy
leading to this potent shortwave are still in the data-poor
Pacific Ocean at this time and model and forecast changes, perhaps
large, could still occur.

In the West, ridging is likely to have hold of the region through
the weekend, other than a southern stream upper low centered
offshore of California meandering. This feature is forecast to
track eastward early in the workweek and join with the main flow,
and possibly interact with northern stream energy entering the
Pacific Northwest around Monday. Model agreement for this overall
pattern was fairly good, but with increasing differences
especially with embedded shortwaves as the period progressed.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was based on a blend of the 12Z
deterministic guidance and a small proportion of the GEFS and EC
ensemble mean guidance, eliminating the UKMET and increasing the
proportion of ensemble mean guidance to 40% by day 5/Monday and
holding that blend through day 7. This led to a more inland track
of the low pressure system and its associated precipitation/winter
weather impacts compared to the previous forecast.

...Weather Highlights...

Moderate to possibly locally heavy rain could move across the
Southeast quickly this weekend given the low pressure and frontal
systems in the vicinity. On the northern side of the precipitation
shield, the low pressure system could create some potential for
wintry weather across portions of the Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley into Tennessee and Kentucky on Saturday, which should be
mainly light, but confidence is low for amounts there especially
given the surface low will not have consolidated yet. Better
chances for heavier snow are likely in the Southern Appalachians
beginning Saturday, and snow is currently expected to spread
northeastward along/on the backside of the deepening low track
over the Eastern Seaboard this weekend into Monday. There is still
uncertainty for the details of this wintry weather that will need
to be resolved in future forecasts, but the trend continues for
impactful weather from the system.

Elsewhere, after the low exits northeast of the U.S. on Tuesday,
westerly flow and another shortwave should cause good conditions
for lake effect/enhanced snow over the Great Lakes. The West could
see some light precipitation during the period, particularly over
the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern Rockies early next
week, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere except possibly
southern Arizona/New Mexico Saturday. Rain could develop across
the Lower Mississippi Valley beginning Tuesday with return flow
from the Gulf of Mexico.

Temperature-wise, chilly weather with much below normal
temperatures by 15-30 degrees is forecast for the Northeast over
the weekend, with slightly cooler than average weather through
early next week for the southeastern quadrant of the country.
Temperatures should generally be above average in the Plains
particularly from Sunday onward after a cooler day Saturday. The
West should see temperatures within about 5-10 degrees of normal,
with a tendency toward slightly warmer than average conditions
especially for lows.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An amplified mid/upper-level ridge will persist over the western
CONUS, while a belt of strong northwesterly midlevel flow
overspreads the Missouri Valley. At the surface, high pressure will
remain centered over the Intermountain West, with broad/weak surface
troughing encompassing much of the central states.

...Southern High Plains...
Subsidence-induced drying along the southern periphery of the strong
northwesterly midlevel flow combined with diurnal heating/mixing
will foster critically low RH across portions of the southern High
Plains this afternoon. With that said, a weak surface pressure
gradient across the region should limit the overall fire-weather
threat. The one exception may be in the lee of the higher terrain
across east-central New Mexico, where breezy terrain-enhanced winds
may overlap the dry boundary-layer conditions for a few hours.
However, the threat appears too localized to introduce an Elevated
area at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 AM CST Wed Jan 12 2022

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A large-scale mid/upper-level ridge will remain in place across the
Intermountain West during the first half of the Day 2 period, prior
to breaking down in response to an approaching midlevel trough. This
pattern will continue to support dry/subsident northwesterly flow
across the southern Plains, where a weak surface pressure gradient
will persist for the first half of the period.

...Southern High Plains...
Similar to Wednesday, the dry/subsident northwesterly midlevel flow,
combined with diurnal heating, will result in the development of
critically low RH across a large portion of the southern High Plains
during the afternoon hours. However, the surface pressure gradient
will be weak where the most substantial RH reductions occur,
generally limiting fire-weather concerns.

...Moderate to heavy rain continues across parts of western
Washington today...

...Canadian storm system to bring accumulating snowfall to the
Northern Plains Thursday night into Friday...

The wettest conditions over the next couple days continue to
reside in the waterlogged Pacific Northwest. Additional rounds of
heavy precipitation (primarily in the form of rain) are expected
to persist over western Washington into early this afternoon. This
is due to an area of low pressure over the eastern Pacific Ocean
that is funneling a stream of moisture into the Olympic Peninsula
and Washington Cascades today. This atmospheric river containing
warm/moist air will lift freezing levels above 7000 feet, which
results in heavy rain falling across even some of the highest
terrain. Additional rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are likely
along upslope portions of the Olympic Peninsula, where recent
heavy rainfall has already fostered overly saturated antecedent
soil moisture conditions. Heavy rain is also expected to reach the
Washington Cascades and may produce flooding along rivers that
flow off the high terrain. A Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall,
as well as Flood Watches, have been issued across this region
today. This system is forecast to weaken and move inland over the
Pacific Northwest on Thursday, resulting in a much drier end to
the workweek.

Looking ahead to Thursday night, a strengthening surface low
emerging out of the Canadian Prairies dives south into the North
Central U.S. Thursday night and into Friday. This next storm
system is primed to produce heavy snow and will result in
treacherous travel conditions across parts of the Northern Plains
and Midwest to close out the work-week. Residents in these areas
should continue to closely monitor the forecast the next couple
days for the latest information.

As high pressure slides off the East Coast today, southerly flow
will bring warming temperatures to the region through Thursday. In
the Nation's Heartland, temperatures will remain seasonally warm
with widespread 50s and 60s in the High Plains today. By Thursday,
high temps in South Texas are expected to soar into the 70s.
Meanwhile, a passing frontal boundary will trigger scattered rain
and snow showers through Thursday across the Great Lakes and
points east to the Northeast and central Appalachians, with areas
of light snow accumulations possible. Farther south, scattered
showers and thunderstorms will remain possible over southeast
Florida today.

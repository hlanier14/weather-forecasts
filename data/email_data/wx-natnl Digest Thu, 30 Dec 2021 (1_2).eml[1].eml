Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1058 AM CST Wed Dec 29 2021

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

Today's fire weather forecast is complicated to some degree by early
morning light rain showers that progressed from the Rolling Plains
in Texas and across portions of southwest into south-central
Oklahoma. While dry low-levels kept most of this activity very light
(e.g., a few hundredths of an inch), a corridor of rainfall
exceeding 0.10" (in some locations exceeding 0.2") was observed from
near/south of Vernon, Texas to near/northeast of Walters, Oklahoma.
Subsequently, a narrow zone of RH values in excess of 70% remains
from North Texas into central Oklahoma. Nevertheless, RH values
should fall through the afternoon as clouds clear from the area,
which combined with breezy conditions should allow for a couple of
hours of at least locally elevated fire weather conditions (outside
of where the heaviest rainfall occurred).

High confidence remains in a few hours of locally critical fire
weather conditions developing along/west of the low-level thermal
ridge axis from near and to the west of Abilene, Texas northward to
near and to the west of Childress, Texas, where the most favorable
overlap of wind/rh is forecast. However, uncertainty regarding the
duration and extent of critical fire weather conditions is too large
for a Critical area.

Otherwise, the forecast remains on track with only minor
modifications made based on the latest model/fuel guidance. Please
see the previous discussion below for more information on today's
fire weather forecast.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1243 AM CST Wed Dec 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will continue to be confined to the southern
High Plains and into parts of the southern Plains. Today's synoptic
regime is expected to be somewhat similar to Tuesday's. An
upper-level shortwave trough (currently noted over the Four Corners)
will pass over the region during the morning hours, with residual
gradient winds in the afternoon. Regional VWP observations already
hint at the influence of this wave on low to mid-level flow with
strengthening winds noted over the past few hours. However, one
notable difference is the weaker lee trough and surface pressure
falls over the region compared to 24 hours ago. The southward surge
of a colder air mass into central OK over the past 12 hours will
likely dampen the surface mass response to the wave, and may delay
the onset of breezier winds until diurnal warming begins to deepen
the boundary layer. Most model solutions support this idea and
suggest peak sustained winds between 15-25 mph will occur within the
18-22 UTC window with wind gusts up to 30-40 mph possible.

Regardless of the exact wind timing, dewpoint values across the
southern High Plains are generally similar to observed values early
Tuesday. With similar flow patterns and wind speeds expected today,
conditions should be comparable to Tuesday when widespread elevated
conditions, and brief/localized critical, conditions occurred. This
notion is supported by latest guidance with ensembles maintaining
high probabilities for RH values in the 15-25% range across the
region. The exact coverage of elevated conditions remains somewhat
uncertain with northern/eastern extent due to the colder air mass
currently in place across central/northern OK into KS. Drier/windier
solutions hint at the best potential for periods of critical
conditions lies across the Rolling Plains of northwest TX, but these
conditions will likely remain fairly localized. A few fires were
noted Tuesday afternoon across western/central OK. These confirm
that regional fuels are receptive and will once again support a fire
weather concern today.

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist across parts of the High Plains
and southern Plains for Thursday. Southwesterly flow aloft over the
central/southern Rockies will support lee troughing through Thursday
afternoon. As a result, south to southwesterly winds are forecast to
increase through the day with winds between 15-20 mph common. Low to
mid-level flow will feature somewhat above-seasonal wind speeds (up
to the 90th percentile at 700 mb), which may support wind gusts up
to 25-40 mph across the TX Panhandle and western OK during the
afternoon hours. Current indications are that downslope
warming/drying effects will be most pronounced across the TX/OK
Panhandles into southeast CO where RH reductions down to 15-25% may
be common.

Further south, weak moisture return could limit the degree of RH
reductions, but recent guidance appears to be initializing too moist
upstream compared to observed dewpoints. This implies that
conditions may be drier than currently depicted in guidance, and a
southward expansion of the Elevated may be warranted in subsequent
outlooks if observations trend in this direction. Across the broader
region, mid to high-level cloud cover is forecast to increase, owing
to ascent ahead of a shortwave trough to the west and modest
mid-level warm advection. The impact of these clouds on diurnal
heating and the fire weather threat will largely depend on their
coverage and placement, which is not overly certain at this time.
Nonetheless, elevated conditions appear probable from western OK
into east-central CO where fuels will remain receptive due to
continued warm/dry conditions over the next 48 hours.

...New Year's weekend heavy rain/thunderstorm threat for the
South/Southeast/Mid-Atlantic as a heavy snow threat shifts from
the Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast down through the Appalachians...

...Coastal heavy rain and mountain focusing heavy snow threat
Sunday-Wednesday from the Northwest to north-central California...


...Guidance and Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered guidance from the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS, the
00 UTC ECWMF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC National Blend of
Models. The synoptic pattern for this period still shows above
average predictability while the blend tends to mitigate lingering
timing and phasing differences with embedded systems that
increases local focus uncertainty. WPC product continuity is well
maintained.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

An amplified upper trough over the West will eject across a very
snowy south-central Rockies to the Plains Saturday. Ejecting
energies in two streams will then generate systems to enhance an
emerging central to eastern U.S. precipitation focus. Deep
moisture streaming into a strong and wavy frontal system offers
potential for heavy rainfall and localized runoff issues from the
Mid-South and Ohio Valley/Northeast down into the Mid-Atlantic and
South/Southeast this weekend. Some storms across the South may
also be severe, per SPC. Expect widespread record breaking warmth
this weekend in advance of the starkly temperature contrasting
front over the South and East. Cold post-frontal air working
across the central to eastern U.S. should meanwhile spread a heavy
snow/ice threat from the Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast down
through the southern Appalachians. Guidance remains quite varied
with details, but shows some signal that frontal wave genesis
could translate to an organized coastal low over the western
Atlantic Sunday into Monday that could offer some threat to
coastal areas and marine interests.

Well upstream, Sunday-Wednesday will become quite stormy for the
Northwest and the north-central California as the upper level
pattern slowly transitions as part of a developing Omega block
over the Northeast Pacific in the form of a deeply amplified
closed upper low/trough digs slowly southward from the Gulf of
Alaska to offshore the Northwest. This will result in a multi-day
heavy wind/precipitation event. Heavy coastal rains and heavy
mountain snows will focus from the Cascades to the Sierra inland
to the north-central Great Basin/Rockies.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST December 29 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast across the west-central
contiguous
U.S. at the start of week-2 favoring increased chances for heavy precipitat=
ion
(coastal rain and high elevation snow) across portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Great Basin, and California. Below normal temperatures are also
predicted for the northwestern contiguous U.S., with the potential for reco=
rd
low temperatures over the Alaska Panhandle. As the mid-level low shifts
eastward, this anomalously cold air is forecast to expand across the Great
Plains and Mississippi Valley. Additionally, surface low pressure developme=
nt
near the Great Lakes and increased frontal forcing may result in enhanced
precipitation chances across the eastern U.S. early in week-2, with some
northern areas experiencing snow or a wintry mix.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Northern Plain=
s
and Upper Mississippi Valley, Thu-Fri, Jan 6-7.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Northern
Rockies, Northern and Central Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, =
and
western Great Lakes, Thu-Sat, Jan 6-8.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the northwestern
CONUS, Great plains, Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, and Great
Lakes,
Thu-Wed, Jan 6-12.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Grea=
t
Basin, and California, Thu-Sun, Jan 6-9.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of the eastern CONUS, Thu-Fri, =
Jan
6-7.

Slight risk of heavy snow for parts of the Sierra Nevadas and Cascades,
Thu-Sun, Jan 6-9.

Slight risk of heavy snow for parts of the Great Basin and Northern and
Central
Rockies, Thu-Sun, Jan 6-9.

Slight risk of high winds for coastal parts of the Pacific Northwest and

n
6-7.

High risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the Alaska
Panhandle, Thu-Fri, Jan 6-7.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of southeaster=
n
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, Thu-Sat, Jan 6-8.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of southeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, Thu-Tue, Jan 6-11.

FOR THURSDAY JANUARY 06 - WEDNESDAY JANUARY 12: By the beginning of week-2,
troughing is forecast over the west-central CONUS with positive 500-hPa hei=
ght
anomalies predicted along the Eastern Seaboard. There is better model
agreement
compared to yesterday in regards to the evolution of the trough and the
associated anomalous cold that is forecast to expand across the central CON=
US.
Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 60% chance tha=
t
minimum temperatures fall below the 15th climatological percentile across
parts
of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, and uncalibrated guida=
nce
from the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict minimum temperatures dropping belo=
w
-10 deg F over parts of the region (below -20 deg F closer to the Canadian
border), supporting a high risk for much below normal temperatures for Jan =
6
to
7. The moderate risk for much below normal temperatures is posted through J=
an
8, and includes parts of the Northern and Central Plains, Upper and Middle
Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes, where both reforecast tools
indicate at least a 40% chance minimum temperatures drop below the 15th
climatological percentile. Subzero temperatures are increasingly likely ove=
r a
large portion of the Upper Midwest, with minimum negative temperature
anomalies
of at least -10 deg F indicated in the uncalibrated model ensemble means
across
the highlighted region. The slight risk is valid for all of week-2 and cove=
rs
a
broader area of the northwestern and central CONUS. Subfreezing temperature=
s
are possible over northern Texas and parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley.
There is some uncertainty later in week-2 as the GEFS keeps the anomalous c=
old
confined over the central states, and the ECMWF expands it toward the
northeastern CONUS.



Although the aforementioned troughing is forecast to be inland by the start=
 of
week-2, the orientation of the mid-level flow is predicted to be zonal acro=
ss
the West Coast of the CONUS, allowing a continuation of enhanced Pacific fl=
ow
and subsequent increased chances for rounds of heavy precipitation over the
Pacific Northwest and northern and central California. The GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation amou=
nts
exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches across parts of these areas,
supporting a slight risk of heavy precipitation for the region from Jan 6 t=
o
9.
With anomalously cold air favored to be in place, the predicted increase in
moisture also supports a slight risk of heavy snow over the Cascades, Sierr=
a
Nevadas, Great Basin, and Northern and Central Rockies from Jan 6 to 9.
Additionally, the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict a broad region wit=
h
at
least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25-mph
across coastal portions of the Pacific Northwest and northern California,
supporting a slight risk of high winds from Jan 6 to 9. By the end of week-=
2,
the model solutions diverge, with the GEFS indicating more ridging building
over the Eastern Pacific, favoring a reduction in precipitation chances by =
the
second half of the period. The ECMWF indicates a weaker ridge and flatter
mid-level height pattern, which would persist the enhanced precipitation
chances later in week-2. For now, to maintain continuity with yesterday=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
forecast, the associated hazards are discontinued after Jan 9, but may need=
 to
be adjusted tomorrow depending on model agreement.



The evolving mid-level pattern with troughing shifting further east and
relatively colder air arriving across the north-central CONUS favors increa=
sed
baroclinicity developing across the east-central CONUS. The 0z GEFS, ECMWF,
and
Canadian ensembles all depict surface low pressure moving over the Great La=
kes
and southeastern Canada around day 8 (Jan 6). This potential system, along
with
its trailing cold front would lead to increased precipitation chances for a
large portion of the eastern CONUS, with a possible transition to wintry
precipitation following the frontal passage across northern areas, and heav=
ier
rainfall across the southern states. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
depict
at least a 20% chance 3-day precipitation totals exceed the 85th
climatological
percentile across much of the eastern CONUS, and 1 inch across parts of the
Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, and the Southeast during the early
part of the period. Although the liquid equivalent totals are forecast to b=
e
lower farther north, the increased potential for wintry precipitation suppo=
rts
having a broad slight risk of heavy precipitation posted from Jan 6 to 7.



Across Alaska, northerly mid-level flow on the backside of the trough axis
forecast over western North America favors below normal temperatures over m=
uch
of Alaska at the onset of week-2. Building mid-level heights over the Berin=
g
Sea and western Mainland Alaska favors a moderation in temperatures,
especially
in the GEFS, with the most anomalous cold being favored over the southeaste=
rn
Mainland and the Panhandle, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indic=
ate
elevated probabilities for record low temperatures and negative anomalies
potentially exceeding -25 deg F. A high risk of much below normal temperatu=
res
is posted for the Alaska Panhandle from Jan 6 to 7 where the reforecast too=
ls
depict at least a 60% chance minimum temperatures drop below the lowest 10t=
h
climatological percentile. A moderate risk of much below normal temperature=
s
continues through Jan 8, and a broader slight risk remains designated from =
the
Kenai Peninsula through the Alaska Panhandle through Jan 11.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 04 - 08 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
strong ridging over the Bering Sea is forecast, leading to troughing
downstream
across the Gulf of Alaska and the western CONUS with below normal 500-hPa
heights extending northeastward to the Northern Plains. Anomalous ridging i=
s
likely farther to the southeast across the Southern Plains and the eastern
CONUS associated with above-normal 500-hPa heights.

Increased below normal temperature probabilities are favored over Alaska du=
e
to
the influence of surface high pressure over the state and parts of western
Canada. Troughing over the western and north-central CONUS favors elevated
probabilities for near to below-normal temperatures over the western CONUS,
north-central CONUS, and western Great Lakes. Conversely, ridging over the
south-central and eastern CONUS leads to increased chances of near to
above-normal temperatures from the Southern Plains to the Eastern Seaboard.

Mean offshore flow leads to increased chances of near to below-normal
precipitation across the state of Alaska associated with above-normal 500-h=
Pa
heights. The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of
above-normal precipitation for the western CONUS extending to the northern
Great Plains and Great Lakes. Above-normal precipitation is also favored ov=
er
much of the eastern CONUS, ahead of the forecast troughing with potential
storm
systems developing. Near to below-normal precipitation is favored for the
Southern Plains consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GF=

10% of Yesterday's 12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 20% of

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
excellent model agreement on most features, although there is uncertainty i=
n
the exact evolution of surface features in the northeastern CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 06 - 12 2022

The Week-2 forecasts are very similar to the 6-10 day period. There is good
model agreement on most features, which are expected to remain in place but
may
deamplify a bit toward the end of the period. Meanwhile, the ridge in the
Bering Sea and the trough over the western CONUS are expected to shift
eastward, increasing the probabilities of below-normal temperatures over pa=
rts
of the Southern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 0z G=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=

the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on

...Bitterly cold wind chills in the northern Rockies and High
Plains through tomorrow, more heavy mountain snow from the Sierra
Nevada to the central Rockies...

...Record breaking Spring-like weather to stick around in the
South before spreading east; Enhanced Risk for severe storms and a
Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall posted in parts of the Deep
South today...

...Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall in Southern California today
and Thursday; urban and flash flooding possible...

...Winter weather possible over the Plains/Midwest New Years
Weekend...

The continental U.S. remains under the influence of prolonged
troughing in the Intermountain West and ridging in the Southeast.
Beneath the troughing pattern in the West, frigid temperatures are
most common with dangerously cold wind chills located in the
Northern Plains. Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories extend from
Montana and parts of the Dakotas to northern Minnesota where wind
chills will range anywhere from -30 to -50 degrees. Beginning late
Thursday, a strong cold front will push the frigid airmass
southward toward the Central Plains, where overnight lows could
dip below zero by the weekend. In addition to the cold,
accumulating snowfall throughout the mountain ranges of the West
are expected with heavy accumulations for some. The heaviest snow
totals today are forecast from the southern Sierra Nevada and
Transverse range of southern California to the Wasatch and central
Rockies. Snow totals in the highest peaks of these regions will be
measured in feet, which combined with whiteout conditions in these
areas will result in hazardous and, at times, impassable travel
conditions. The latest WPC Winter Storm Severity Index (WSSI)
accordingly depicts moderate to locally major potential winter
storm impacts owing to heavy snow accumulations over the
Transverse Range and southern Nevada today. Closer to southern
California, a storm system rounding the base of the upper trough
in the West is funneling Pacific moisture into the Los Angeles and
San Diego metro areas. Excessive rainfall potential is high enough
to warrant a Slight Risk (threat level 2/5), meaning there is a
threat for flash flooding today and Thursday. Lastly, High Wind
watches were posted for southern Wyoming this Thursday as strong
cross winds could make for hazardous travel conditions for light
weight and high profile vehicles.

Farther east, the anchored ridge atop the southeastern U.S. shows
no sign in relinquishing its spring-like regime in the South and
East-Central U.S.. Numerous record warm lows and highs are
anticipated from the Southeast coast to the Rio Grande of South
Texas today. More of the same is expected in the Southeast on
Thursday with highs in the 70s and lows that are 20 to 40 degrees
above normal. In time for the new year, the unseasonable warmth is
expected to spread into the Mid-Atlantic and portions of the
Northeast beginning Friday, where current forecast daytime highs
and warm minimum temperatures would threaten many records in the
region. A consequence of the warmth combined with windy conditions
remains an Elevated Risk (threat level 1/3) for fire weather for
portions of the southern High Plains today and tomorrow, per the
Storm Prediction Center. In terms of precipitation, moist
southerly flow and increasing instability levels will lead to an
increasingly favorable environment for severe weather. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk (threat level 3/5)
for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, while a Slight Risk
(threat level 2/5) stretches from Northeast Louisiana to eastward
the southern Appalachians, where tornadoes, damaging wind gusts,
and isolated large hail are possible today. Highly anomalous
moisture content also supports the threat for Excessive Rainfall,
thus leading to the issuance of a Slight Risk (threat level 2/5)
for the Tennessee Valley today due to a heightened chance for
localized flash flooding. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will
remain possible across a broad portions of the South on Thursday,
but the severe and flash flood threat will be lower compared to
today's threat. A more focused threat of severe weather and heavy
rainfall returns to the Lower Tennessee Valley on Friday, with a
Slight Risk in effect for both hazards.  Meanwhile, a little
farther north, light rain and snow showers remain possible across
the Lower Great Lakes Wednesday evening. A dusting of 2 inches
snowfall is possible from southern Iowa to the northern Illinois
and Indiana with a light but treacherous glaze of ice possible
from northeast Missouri to central Illinois and Indiana. A more
widespread threat of winter weather is possible over the Plains
and Midwest beginning this weekend as the aforementioned strong
cold front marches south from the Northern Plains. Accumulating
snows and mixed precipitation remain are possible along and north
of the front as the system arrives. However, uncertainty remains
regarding specific accumulations of snow and mixed precipitation.
Check back for more details as the event draws closer.

...New Year's weekend heavy rain/thunderstorm threat for the
South/Southeast/Mid-Atlantic as a heavy snow threat shifts from
the Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast down through the Appalachians...

...Coastal heavy rain and mountain focusing heavy snow threat
Sunday-Wednesday from the Northwest to north-central California...


...Guidance and Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered guidance from the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS, the
00 UTC ECWMF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 13 UTC National Blend of
Models. The synoptic pattern for this period still shows above
average predictability while the blend tends to mitigate lingering
timing and phasing differences with embedded systems that
increases local focus uncertainty. WPC product continuity is well
maintained.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

An amplified upper trough over the West will eject across a very
snowy south-central Rockies to the Plains Saturday. Ejecting
energies in two streams will then generate systems to enhance an
emerging central to eastern U.S. precipitation focus. Deep
moisture streaming into a strong and wavy frontal system offers
potential for heavy rainfall and localized runoff issues from the
Mid-South and Ohio Valley/Northeast down into the Mid-Atlantic and
South/Southeast this weekend. Some storms across the South may
also be severe, per SPC. Expect widespread record breaking warmth
this weekend in advance of the starkly temperature contrasting
front over the South and East. Cold post-frontal air working
across the central to eastern U.S. should meanwhile spread a heavy
snow/ice threat from the Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast down
through the southern Appalachians. Guidance remains quite varied
with details, but shows some signal that frontal wave genesis
could translate to an organized coastal low over the western
Atlantic Sunday into Monday that could offer some threat to
coastal areas and marine interests.

Well upstream, Sunday-Wednesday will become quite stormy for the
Northwest and the north-central California as the upper level
pattern slowly transitions as part of a developing Omega block
over the Northeast Pacific in the form of a deeply amplified
closed upper low/trough digs slowly southward from the Gulf of
Alaska to offshore the Northwest. This will result in a multi-day
heavy wind/precipitation event. Heavy coastal rains and heavy
mountain snows will focus from the Cascades to the Sierra inland
to the north-central Great Basin/Rockies.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
146 AM EST Thu Dec 30 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Jan 02 2022 - 12Z Thu Jan 06 2022

...New Year's weekend heavy rain/thunderstorm threat for the
South/Southeast/Mid-Atlantic as a heavy snow threat shifts from
the Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast down through the Appalachians...

...Coastal heavy rain and mountain focusing heavy snow threat
Sunday-Wednesday from the Northwest to north-central California...


...Guidance and Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was based off a compromise of
the 12Z ECWMF/CMC/EC ensemble and GEFS means with inclusion of the
NBM. The CMC and ECWMF have been consistent with the overall
pattern clustering and evolution the past few days while the GFS
continues to struggle. The inclusion of the means help to reduce
timing and phasing differences for the multiple features during
the extended period. This model blend helps to maintain continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Coastal rains and mountain snow is expected across parts of the
Northwest and California as an amplified upper trough moves
through the West, then crosses the Rockies spreading snow before
entering the Plains. Once in the Plains the ejected energies will
help spawn systems to enhance an emerging central to eastern U.S.
precipitation focus. There will be a wavy frontal system  across
the central U.S. with deep moisture streaming over it, providing a
focus for heavy rainfall from the Mid-South eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. There is a potential for localized
runoff issues from the Mid-South and Ohio Valley/Northeast down
into the Mid-Atlantic and South/Southeast this weekend.

Expect widespread record breaking warmth this weekend in advance
of the starkly temperature contrasting front over the South and
East. Cold Canadian air surging in behind the front across the
central and eastern states will spread a heavy snow/ice threat
from the Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast down through the southern
Appalachians. Guidance remains quite varied with details, but
shows some signal that frontal wave genesis could translate to an
organized coastal low over the western Atlantic Sunday into Monday
that could offer some threat to coastal areas and marine interests.

Another multi-day round of precipitation will move through the
Pacific Northwest and northern/central California Sunday through
midweek. Strong gust winds will also accompany the heavy
precipitation. During this time the upper level pattern slowly
transitions as part of a developing Omega block over the Northeast
Pacific in the form of a deeply amplified closed upper low/trough

146 AM EST Thu Dec 30 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Jan 02 2022 - 12Z Thu Jan 06 2022

...New Year's weekend heavy rain/thunderstorm threat for the
South/Southeast/Mid-Atlantic as a heavy snow threat shifts from
the Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast down through the Appalachians...

...Coastal heavy rain and mountain focusing heavy snow threat
Sunday-Wednesday from the Northwest to north-central California...


...Guidance and Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was based off a compromise of
the 12Z ECWMF/CMC/EC ensemble and GEFS means with inclusion of the
NBM. The CMC and ECWMF have been consistent with the overall
pattern clustering and evolution the past few days while the GFS
continues to struggle. The inclusion of the means help to reduce
timing and phasing differences for the multiple features during
the extended period. This model blend helps to maintain continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Coastal rains and mountain snow is expected across parts of the
Northwest and California as an amplified upper trough moves
through the West, then crosses the Rockies spreading snow before
entering the Plains. Once in the Plains the ejected energies will
help spawn systems to enhance an emerging central to eastern U.S.
precipitation focus. There will be a wavy frontal system  across
the central U.S. with deep moisture streaming over it, providing a
focus for heavy rainfall from the Mid-South eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. There is a potential for localized
runoff issues from the Mid-South and Ohio Valley/Northeast down
into the Mid-Atlantic and South/Southeast this weekend.

Expect widespread record breaking warmth this weekend in advance
of the starkly temperature contrasting front over the South and
East. Cold Canadian air surging in behind the front across the
central and eastern states will spread a heavy snow/ice threat
from the Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast down through the southern
Appalachians. Guidance remains quite varied with details, but
shows some signal that frontal wave genesis could translate to an
organized coastal low over the western Atlantic Sunday into Monday
that could offer some threat to coastal areas and marine interests.

Another multi-day round of precipitation will move through the
Pacific Northwest and northern/central California Sunday through
midweek. Strong gust winds will also accompany the heavy
precipitation. During this time the upper level pattern slowly
transitions as part of a developing Omega block over the Northeast
Pacific in the form of a deeply amplified closed upper low/trough
digs slowly southward from the Gulf of Alaska to offshore the
Northwest. Heavy coastal rains and heavy mountain snows will focus
from the Cascades to the Sierra inland to the north-central Great
Basin/Rockies.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0109 AM CST Thu Dec 30 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions appear probable again this
afternoon for the central to southern High Plains as breezy
downslope winds increase amid a dry air mass.  Early-morning
water-vapor imagery reveals generally broad southwesterly flow aloft
over the southern Rockies/southern High Plains. Gradual height rises
are noted in recent upper-air analyses, which are yielding somewhat
subdued surface pressure falls in the lee of the central/southern
Rockies. However, the southeastward progression of a weak
upper-level disturbance over the northern High Plains will help
strengthen low to mid-level pressure gradients, resulting in
increased downslope winds and lee troughing through the afternoon.

...Central High Plains...
Latest guidance continues to depict a swath of 15-25 mph winds from
east NM/west TX northward into southwest NE. Ensemble probabilities
highlight eastern CO as the most likely region to see sustained 20+
mph winds with gusts up to 30-35 mph likely (and locally stronger
gust possible closer to terrain features). Eastern CO already
features receptive fuels and dry conditions (dewpoints in the single
digits noted), but also very cold temperatures (single digits to low
teens as of early Thursday morning). Relative humidity reductions
this afternoon may depend on the strength of downslope effects and
diurnal heating under mostly clear skies. RH reductions into the
15-20% range appear likely and will support areas of elevated fire
weather conditions. Localized and transient critical conditions are
possible, though confidence in the coverage/duration of this threat
is low.

...Southern High Plains...
The fire weather threat becomes less certain with southward extent
into TX and OK. While sustained winds between 15-25 mph appear
likely, ensemble guidance continues to show low probabilities for
sub-20% RH (though drier pockets down to 15% are possible). However,
recent guidance continues to poorly assimilate upstream dewpoint
observations from eastern and southern NM with a slight moist bias
in model initialization. This may result in lower observed RH values
than currently anticipated. An additional complicating factor is
increasing high-level cloud cover through the day that may limit
peak heating. Regardless of these concerns with the RH forecast,
elevated conditions appear probable and will pose a fire weather
concern given the dry fuels in place. Further forecast refinement is
possible as details become more clear.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CST Thu Dec 30 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will decrease on Friday and into the weekend,
as a storm system brings increasing precipitation chances and cooler
temperatures to the High Plains where fuels have been dry. An
upper-level trough, currently off the southern CA coast, is forecast
to begin approaching the southern Rockies late Friday. Ahead of this
wave, lee troughing and downslope flow will support 15-25 mph winds
across much of the region. However, cloud cover and precipitation
chances will also spread eastward through the day, limiting the
potential for strong diurnal heating. Ensemble guidance currently
highlights east-central NM into western OK as a favorable corridor
for receiving measurable rainfall, which could further mitigate fire
weather concerns. Elevated conditions might evolve across southeast
CO where broken cloud cover can support stronger daytime heating and
20-25 mph winds are likely. Confidence in the coverage of sub-20% RH
is somewhat low and may be confined to the immediate lee of local
terrain features where downslope effects will be more prominent. Due
to this uncertainty, no risk areas are introduced, though trends
will continue to be monitored.

...More heavy mountain snow to overtake much of the Intermountain
West to close out 2021; bitterly cold wind chills to stick around
in the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains; Slight Risk for
Excessive Rainfall in Southern California today..

...Record breaking Spring-like in the South to reach the portions
of the East Coast; Slight Risks for severe storms and Excessive
Rainfall on Friday

...Both winter weather and severe weather possible to kick off the
new year this weekend...

The continental U.S. remains under the influence of prolonged
troughing in the Intermountain West and ridging in the Southeast.
The next upper level disturbance to round the base of this trough
is set to enter the Northwestern U.S. this morning, providing
another round of moderate-to-heavy snow throughout much of the
Intermountain West. Meanwhile, a developing storm system in the
East Pacific ushers Pacific moisture into Southern California and
the Southwest today into Friday. Locally heavy rainfall rates
could cause flash flooding in Southern California (Slight Risk
today in the Los Angeles metro area) and south-central Arizona
(Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall on Friday) but it also
supplies another round of moisture into the southern Rockies. This
combined with the arrival of another Arctic air-mass makes for
another period of heavy mountain snow Friday night. By Saturday
morning, mountain ranges such as the Cascades, Sawtooth, Wasatch,
and both the central and southern Rockies can expect 1 to 2 feet
of snow with totals exceeding 3 feet in the highest elevations of
Utah and Colorado. A myriad of winter weather alerts; from
Warnings and Watches to Advisories, have been issued in these
areas. As previously mentioned, another injection of frigid Arctic
air causes temperatures to plummet through out the West on Friday
and by early Saturday morning, sub-zero temperatures are expected
from the Upper Mississippi Valley to the Northern Rockies. Wind
Chill Warnings and Advisories remain in effect for the far North
Central U.S. today for the present frigid air-mass, but expect
more bitterly cold wind chills Friday and into Saturday.

Farther east, the atmosphere continues to believe the calendar has
skipped winter all together and entered spring. Abnormally warm
and humid conditions will stick around in the Southeast with
considerably milder conditions spreading as far north as the
Northeast by New Year's Day. Numerous record warm lows and highs
are expected from the Gulf Coast to the northern Mid-Atlantic
through Saturday morning. The troughing in the West and the strong
ridge of high pressure over the Southeast are working to funnel
rich Gulf of Mexico moisture into the Mid-South late Friday. There
is a Marginal Risk for both severe weather and Excessive Rainfall
in parts of the Southeast today, but the next developing storm
system in the Plains will set the stage for another active day of
severe weather from North Texas to the southern Appalachians.
Ample moisture and instability is also present to support
Excessive Rainfall rates, making flash flooding a concern in the
Middle Mississippi and Ohio/Tennessee River Valleys. As a result,
Slight Risks have been issued for both severe storms and flash
flooding in these regions with concerns for nocturnal severe
weather and localized flooding.

As the storm system responsible for the severe weather and flash
flood event emerges into the South Central U.S. Saturday morning,
the New Year is forecast to start off in wintry fashion as
measurable snowfall and an icy wintry mix are expected to paint a
swath of hazardous travel conditions New Year's Day from the front
range of the Rockies to the Midwest and Great Lakes. Meanwhile,
within the storm's warm sector, another busy day of severe weather
and Excessive Rainfall is likely in the Mid-South. Residents in
these regions should check for the latest forecast from their
local NWS offices and National Centers as a plethora of weather
hazards; from bitterly cold wind chills and travel-disruptive
snowfall totals to severe storms and flash flooding will make for
a treacherous start to the 2022.

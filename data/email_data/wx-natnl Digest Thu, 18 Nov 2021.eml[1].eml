Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1048 AM CST Wed Nov 17 2021

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

The forecast remains unchanged. Potential for elevated to
near-critical fire weather is possible farther east in Kansas, but
cloud cover and a secondary push of cooler air is likely going to
limit the overall duration of these conditions.

..Wendt.. 11/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CST Wed Nov 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a broad area of cyclonic flow associated with an
upper low/trough across southern Manitoba will move eastward across
the central US through the day. A cold front trailing south from the
upper low will sweep through the Plains early this morning, reaching
the Gulf Coast by late evening. To the west, shortwave ridging will
quickly build over the Great Basin and Pacific Coast. Brief elevated
fire weather conditions will be possible within the dry and windy
airmass behind the front across portions of the central and southern
Plains.

...Central and southern Plains...
Current forecast and observational trends place the cold frontal
position roughly from northeastern KS, through northwestern OK, and
into the TX Panhandle by 12z this morning. To the north of the
front, strong northerly winds of 20-30 mph will develop early in the
day and continue through mid afternoon. As the front accelerates
southward, surface pressure gradients and winds will gradually
diminish through late afternoon and early evening.

Advection of a drier airmass behind the front may support a few
hours of lower relative humidity across portions of western KS/OK
and the TX Panhandle. While still uncertain given potential for
lingering cloud cover, high-resolution ensemble guidance shows
humidity values may fall to 20-25% by mid to late afternoon. This
suggests some potential misalignment with the strongest diurnal
winds. However, the potential for at least a few hours of elevated
to near critical fire weather conditions, coincident with drying
fuels, warrants the continuation of elevated fire weather
probabilities across portions of the central and southern Plains.
Fire weather concerns will quickly diminish after sunset as winds
weaken and higher humidity recoveries develop.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1249 PM CST Wed Nov 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The ongoing forecast remains unchanged. Within the northern and
central Rockies, very dry conditions are possible. Models indicate
potential for 5-15% RH. Given the quite dry mid-level conditions
observed on this morning's soundings to the west, this does seem
plausible. Stronger winds are also possible, particularly in the
higher terrain. As these conditions are expected to be closely tied
to terrain features and temperatures may not reach the 50s F, fire
weather risk will remain low regionally. Locally elevated conditions
are also possible in the southern High Plains, but duration of such
conditions continues to look minimal.

..Wendt.. 11/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CST Wed Nov 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
As the upper low/trough across southern Canada continues east, the
shortwave ridge over the western US will shift eastward and
gradually weaken as the upper-level flow pattern trends more zonal.
Cooler and drier conditions behind the recent cold front will
continue, as surface high pressure moves over the southern Plains.
Daytime surface RH values may fall to as low as 15% across portions
of the southern High Plains where southerly winds are expected to
return later in the day. The ongoing dry conditions may briefly
overlap with breezy conditions across the southern High Plains where
slightly stronger surface flow may develop late in the period.
However, any elevated fire weather conditions will likely be brief
and localized, keeping overall fire weather concerns low.

...Potential continues for a strong cold front and significant
storm to affect the East early next week...

...Overview...

The expected large scale pattern evolution from the weekend into
the middle of next week remains on track. Guidance consensus shows
flat mean flow as of early Saturday steadily becoming more
amplified as a deepening upper trough heads into the eastern U.S.,
downstream from a Pacific upper ridge that reaches western Canada
and the northwestern U.S. by Monday. Within the eastern trough,
some models continue to show an upper low closing off and taking a
path somewhere within an area from the Great Lakes/southern Canada
into New England, supporting at least moderately strong southern
Canada into Northeast U.S. low pressure, which could undergo some
redevelopment during the overall system's life span. This storm
remains a prominent weather focus due to its timing right before
Thanksgiving but it will likely still take a while to resolve the
details. Meanwhile the models and ensembles still have an upper
low developing southwest/south of California during the weekend
and early next week. This feature should open up by Wednesday as a
Pacific shortwave reaches the West by Tuesday and additional
energy could arrive thereafter. Northern Plains into western U.S.
troughing should amplify at least a little around midweek as
another upper ridge builds over the Eastern Pacific. Eastern North
America low pressure and its trailing front will usher in a brief
cold spell over the East during the first half of next week while
the West and parts of the High Plains will see variable but
generally above normal temperatures through Tuesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00/06Z model cycle continued to show fairly good clustering in
the eastern North America evolution considering typical guidance
spread and error for forecasts at this lead time. One remaining
issue is the possibility and positioning of a 500 mb low that
could close off within the trough. After deep closed lows in
previous runs, the 00Z ECMWF showed narrow and open but still deep
troughing, while the new 12Z run has a closed low again.
Meanwhile, the new 12Z GFS shows an open trough in the East
Tuesday after 00Z and 06Z runs were closed. Ensemble means
generally show narrow and deep troughing that may imply a closed
low. The detail issues in the troughing could affect surface low
positions and strength as well. Regardless, low pressure is
forecast to track between the Great Lakes and James Bay as of
early Monday and could see redevelopment and/or looping through
Tuesday-Wednesday. A minor change from the previous forecast was
to move the trailing cold front faster based on consensus. It is
important to note that the upper dynamics supporting this system
are still within flow to the north/west of an upper low over
Alaska and historically the models can have difficulty in
resolving important details of amplifying shortwaves from higher
latitudes until much closer to an event. A blend of the
deterministic guidance used at the beginning of the medium range
period transitioned to an approximately even blend of the
GFS/ECMWF/GEFS mean/EC mean by the latter part of the period.

Farther west, GFS/ECMWF/UKMET along with the GEFS/ECMWF means are
still providing the most common solution for the upper low that
forms west/south of California, with some opening/progression
likely to occur after early Tuesday. CMC runs have been on the
eastern side of the guidance spread, though the 12Z CMC has
shifted west closer to consensus. A model/mean blend excluding the
00Z CMC worked well for this feature as well as the shortwave
reaching the Northwest and then the Plains Tuesday-Wednesday and
for downplaying uncertain shortwave details upstream.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The start of the weekend should be dry over much of the country
aside from rainfall persisting along the eastern Florida Peninsula
and some light snow over parts of the northern/central Rockies.
Expect precipitation to develop along and east of the Mississippi
Valley on Sunday ahead of a leading Plains front and trailing
strong cold front (anchored by northern tier U.S./southern Canada
low pressure) that catches up. Most rain should be light to
moderate given the frontal progression but locally more intense
activity may be possible. Highest totals for Sunday-Sunday night
should be in the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. From Monday onward the
most likely evolution of this system would bring more of an
enhanced rainfall threat to New England, ahead of the cold
front/secondary low development. The best snow potential would be
in the cold air behind the system, to the lee of the Great Lakes
and along westward-facing terrain from the central Appalachians
northeastward. There is still enough uncertainty in system
evolution to allow for other possibilities regarding precipitation
types and amounts. Confidence is somewhat higher in the potential
for a period of brisk to strong winds behind the cold front
sweeping through the Plains into the East, with such winds
continuing over the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into at
least Tuesday after strong initial southerly winds on Monday. The
Pacific Northwest into northern Rockies may see mostly light
precipitation during the first half of next week with a shortwave
arriving from the Pacific. The combination of this energy aloft
and the opening/progression of the upper low southwest of
California may spread some moisture into parts of the West by
Tuesday/Wednesday, but with low confidence for precipitation
coverage/amounts at this time.

The East will see chilly temperatures (mostly 5-10F below normal)
lingering into the early weekend. The next surge of colder air
will spread across the eastern half of the lower 48 Monday-Tuesday
with the broadest coverage of highs 10-15F below normal expected
on Tuesday. Some locations may also see morning lows 10F or so
below normal. The West into the central/southern High Plains will
see mostly above normal temperatures through Tuesday with the
warmest anomalies of plus 10-15F for highs likely over the High
Plains on Saturday (lingering into Sunday near the Rio Grande) and
again on Tuesday. The upper trough over the West by Wednesday will
likely bring highs down to near or slightly below normal levels at
that time.

troughing, while the new 12Z run has a closed low again.
Meanwhile, the new 12Z GFS shows an open trough in the East
Tuesday after 00Z and 06Z runs were closed. Ensemble means
generally show narrow and deep troughing that may imply a closed

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST November 17 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is decent multi-model (0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian) agreem=
ent
of the ensemble means, indicating an amplified mid-level ridge-trough patte=
rn
across the lower 48 states during week-2. However, the 0Z GEFS indicates a
greater potential for the ridging over the western lower 48 to break down
during the period. A surface low is forecast to develop along the western G=
ulf
Coast before moving northeastward early in the period, which may bring heav=
y
precipitation to parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast.
Amplified
mid-level low pressure is predicted to dominate Alaska throughout week-2,
bringing anomalously cool temperatures to the Mainland. A strong surface lo=
w
over the Gulf of Alaska may bring heavy precipitation and high winds to the
Alaska Panhandle during the first few days of the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of eastern Texas, the Lower
Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, Deep South, and Southern Appalachians
Thu-Sat, Nov 25-28.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of southwestern
Mainland Alaska, Thu, Nov 25.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across the Seward Peninsula a=
nd
parts of the southern Lisburne Peninsula in western Mainland Alaska, Thu-Fr=
i,
Nov 25-26.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Alaska Panhandle,
Thu-Sat, Nov 25-27.

Slight risk of high winds across coastal portions of the southeastern Mainl=
and
of Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, Thu-Sat, Nov 25-27.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY NOVEMBER 20 - WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 24:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!qC1lA3_q2a5TnXRSLFBBgmO-Os4dfMIMHFpvwFc3rqZUnCiaGkeC032-u67la=
INE1WT6jybP$

FOR THURSDAY NOVEMBER 25 - WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 01: Surface high pressure acr=
oss
parts of the eastern CONUS is expected to continue from the end of week-1 i=
nto
the start of week-2 as a storm exits the East Coast. Although below normal
temperatures are expected early in week-2, they are not expected to reach
hazardous criteria. As such, yesterday's slight risk of much below normal
temperatures in the eastern U.S. timed off and was removed.



As the center of this surface high pressure moves offshore of the Atlantic
Coast on day 8 (Nov 25), the eastward displacement of this feature may prom=
ote
enhanced return flow on its western periphery and the development of surfac=
e
low pressure along the western Gulf Coast. In addition, the GEFS and ECMWF
ensemble reforecast tools show good agreement in indicating at least a 20%
chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch =
of
rainfall accumulation across parts of the southeastern U.S. from East Texas
eastward to the Appalachians. Therefore, a slight risk of heavy precipitati=
on
is posted for parts of eastern Texas, the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tenness=
ee
Valley, Deep South, and Southern Appalachians Thu-Sat, Nov 25-28. There is
some
disagreement in the exact track of this surface feature among some of the
model
guidance as it tracks northeastward during the first half of week-2, which
increases uncertainty in the precipitation forecast in the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast.



Amplified mid-level troughing across Mainland Alaska from the beginning to
middle of the period supports a slight risk of much below normal temperatur=
es
across parts of the western Mainland. The slight risk of much below normal
temperatures posted for the southeastern Mainland covers the first day of t=
he
week-2 period (Thu, Nov 25), as temperatures are expected to moderate enoug=
h
to
remain below hazardous thresholds beyond day 1. Much below normal temperatu=
res
are expected to linger from the Seward Peninsula northward, warranting a
slight
risk of much below normal temperatures for the first two day of week-2
(Thu-Fri, Nov 25-26). Reforecast tools support both slight risk areas, as b=
oth
the GEFS and ECMWF tools indicate at least a 40% chance of minimum
temperatures
falling to the lowest 15th percentile and below zero Deg F.



There is good multi-model agreement in the formation of a couple of strong
surface lows over the Gulf of Alaska at the beginning of the period (Thu-Sa=
t,
Nov 25-27), which could bring heavy precipitation to parts of the Alaska
Panhandle. A slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for the Alaska
Panhandle, Nov 24 to 26, where the reforecast tools show at least a 20% cha=
nce
of exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches. Localized higher elevation
areas
may experience heavy precipitation in the form of snow. However, a heavy sn=
ow
hazard is not posted at this time due to inherent difficulty in identifying
these specific areas. The location of these storm systems may also support
tight pressure gradients along coastal portions of the Alaska Panhandle and
southeastern Mainland, resulting in high winds, which could be locally
enhanced
near channels. Therefore, a slight risk of high winds is posted in these
areas,
Nov 25 to 27, where the GEFS reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chanc=
e
of
exceeding the 85th percentile and 35 mph.



There is great uncertainty in the evolution of the jet stream pattern acros=
s
western North America during week-2. The GEFS indicates a complete breakdow=
n
of
mid-level high pressure over the western U.S., which would result in a
southward shift of the storm track during the period. Conversely, the ECMWF
and
Canadian ensembles indicate only a suppression of the ridge over the West
during the period, which would prevent the storm track from shifting farthe=
r
southward. With the increased uncertainty, particularly along the West Coas=
t,
no precipitation or snow hazards are posted.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Wed November 17 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 23 - 27 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs dynamical models are in excellent agreeme=
nt in regards to the 6-10
day
500-hPa geopotential height pattern across North America. Large positive
height
anomalies are forecast over the North Atlantic and Greenland, consistent wi=
th
a
negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and enhanced blockin=
g.
This results in a more amplified pattern developing upstream across the CON=
US,
with troughing and negative height anomalies favored in the East, and ridgi=
ng
and positive height anomalies forecast over much of the West. Troughing is
predicted across Alaska, favoring below normal heights over most of the sta=
te.

A surge of cold air is likely to overspread much of the East early next wee=
k
and persist into the start of the 6-10 day period. Temperature anomalies of
-10
to -15 deg F are forecast on day-6 over much of the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic=
,
Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys. Some moderation of the air mass is forecast by
Thanksgiving (day-8), with another anomalously cold air mass predicted to
establish itself over the region by day-10. As a result, probabilities for
below normal temperatures are increased over much of eastern half of the
country, with the highest chances (>60%) along the Southeast and Mid-Atlant=
ic
Coasts. A slight tilt toward enhanced above normal temperature probabilitie=
s
is
highlighted over northern Maine due to increased southerly mid-level flow
ahead
of the mean troughing, with the warmest temperatures predicted early in the
6-10 day period. The negative NAO supports an overall colder pattern in the
East, and is also supported by the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Increas=
ed
ridging and positive height anomalies over the West favor a warmer pattern,
with increased probabilities of above normal temperatures forecast from the
High Plains westward to the Pacific Coast. Troughing is favored across Alas=
ka,
with the highest negative temperature anomalies forecast across the western
Mainland, corresponding with increased probabilities for below normal
temperatures. Increased Pacific flow upstream of the troughing favors near
normal temperatures across the southeastern Mainland and the Panhandle.

The enhanced blocking pattern over the North Atlantic tends to favor stormi=
er
activity across the eastern CONUS, with increased potential for a significa=
nt
system to be impacting the Northeast beginning around day-5. By day-6, much=
 of
the heaviest precipitation is forecast over New England, with areas further
south drying out. However, a cold, windy day is on tap, and some areas of t=
he
interior Northeast and Mid-Atlantic could see some snow flurries as colder =
air
spills in behind the system. Probabilities for above normal precipitation a=
re
increased over the Northeast for the period as a whole, with the highest
probabilities (>50%) across Maine. Relatively drier conditions are forecast
behind the system, with increased probabilities for below normal precipitat=
ion
forecast over the Northern and Central Plains eastward to the Ohio Valley.
Return flow is indicated across much of the southern tier, with both the GE=
FS
and ECMWF reforecast tools favoring increased chances of above normal
precipitation. The ECMWF ensemble brings some of this moisture into the
Northeast in the days 9-10 timeframe, although the GEFS is less bullish wit=
h
this scenario.

Near to below normal precipitation is forecast across much of the western
CONUS, underneath anomalous ridging. This ridging, combined with troughing
forecast over Alaska, promotes a tight mid-level pressure gradient across t=
he
Northeast Pacific, extending into the Alaska Panhandle and southeastern
Mainland Alaska. This favors increased onshore flow and resultant elevated
probabilities for above normal precipitation for these areas. The troughing
over Alaska favors a more northerly mid-level flow across the western
Mainland,
resulting in enhanced chances for below normal precipitation. The
precipitation
forecast across Alaska is consistent with the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast too=
ls.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
overall good agreement among the models on the average large-scale mid-leve=
l
circulation pattern, offset by some uncertainty in the exact surface
evolution.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 25 - DEC 01, 2021

A similar 500-hPa circulation pattern to the 6-10 day period forecast is
predicted during the week 2 period, with the blocking persisting across the
North Atlantic and upstream negative height anomalies remaining in place
across
the eastern half of the CONUS. The largest uncertainty is in the evolution
over
the West, where the GEFS is quicker to break down the anomalous ridging
compared to the ECMWF and Canadian ensembles. For now, a persistence of the
6-10 forecast is preferred, with enhanced ridging and associated positive
height anomalies forecast over the West, although weaker and centered more
inland compared to the 6-10 day period. Troughing remains forecast over
Alaska,
favoring negative height anomalies over most of the state.

Although some moderation in temperatures is anticipated in the East at the
start of the period, the blocking pattern across the North Atlantic favors
additional cold air building southward out of Canada by the middle of week-=
2.
It is worth noting that the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict
substantially lower probabilities for below normal temperatures compared to
that of the 6-10 day period. However, the analog and teleconnection tools a=

more suggestive of a cold pattern continuing over the East. The solutions f=

the statistical guidance are preferred given they are consistent with the 6=

day forecast and match the expectations of a negative NAO event. Increased
above normal temperature probabilities remain favored across the western ha=

of the CONUS underneath forecast ridging, and consistent with the ECMWF and
GEFS reforecast tools. Near to below normal temperatures remain forecast ov=
er
most of Alaska associated with continued troughing.

The precipitation forecast is similar to the 6-10 day period, with enhanced
probabilities for above normal precipitation across the southern tier and
extending through the Northeast. There is considerable uncertainty over the
Northeast. While the negative NAO favors a more active storm track, the
ongoing
La Nina tends to favor a weaker southern stream. Although increased
precipitation is forecast over the South due to return flow, the placement =

the trough in the East will determine how far north this moisture gets. The
more progressive GEFS places the trough axis too far east keeping most of t=

moisture out to sea, with the ECMWF reforecast tool depicting enhanced abov=

normal precipitation probabilities across coastal portions of the Northeast
and
New England.

Increased probabilities for below normal precipitation are forecast over mu=

of the central and western CONUS, underneath forecast ridging and surface h=
igh
pressure. The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools differ significantly over the
West, with the ECMWF depicting a drier solution compared to the GEFS,
consistent with stronger ridging. The Canadian ensemble, as well as the
statistical analog tool, also favor a drier pattern supporting the increase=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=

 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=

...Lake effect snow will develop downwind from the Great Lakes
tonight into Friday evening...

...Rain and higher elevation snow for the Pacific Northwest
starting on Thursday...

A front extending from the Lower Great Lakes southwestward to the
Southern Plains will move eastward off the East Coast and
southward off the Gulf Coast by Friday morning.  Mainly rain will
develop along the front from Great Lakes to the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Western Gulf Coast tonight into Thursday morning.  The rain
will move eastward off the East Coast by Friday morning.  Behind
the boundary, lake effect snow will develop over parts of the
Upper Great Lakes overnight, with snow showers expanding eastward
across Michigan by Thursday evening.  Furthermore, lake effect
snow will develop downwind from Lakes Erie and Ontario overnight
Thursday.  Snow will also develop overnight Thursday, over parts
of interior New England, while coastal areas will remain rain.  On
Friday, the lake effect snow ends over the Upper Great Lakes,
while lake effect snow continues downwind from Lakes Erie and
Ontario through Friday evening.  Light snow will also continue
over parts of Northern New England through Friday evening.

Meanwhile, another front will move onshore over the Pacific
Northwest on Thursday afternoon and rushes inland to the Northern
Plains/Great Basin by Friday evening. However, ahead of the
system, rain and higher elevation snow will develop over the
Northwest Coast by Thursday morning and expand into Northern
California by Thursday evening.  Snow will develop over parts of
the Northern Intermountain Region and into parts of the Northern
Rockies Thursday evening into Friday evening.  A third front, On
Friday, moves south out of Western Canada into the Northern
Plains, marking the leading edge of much colder air.

Elsewhere, easterly flow off the Atlantic will aid in producing
showers and thunderstorms over the southern tip of Florida through
Thursday evening. Then, the aforementioned East Coast front moves
southward over Florida, continuing the showers and thunderstorms
into Friday evening.

...Potential continues for a strong cold front and significant
storm to affect the East early next week...

...Overview...

The expected large scale pattern evolution from the weekend into
the middle of next week remains on track. Guidance consensus shows
flat mean flow as of early Saturday steadily becoming more
amplified as a deepening upper trough heads into the eastern U.S.,
downstream from a Pacific upper ridge that reaches western Canada
and the northwestern U.S. by Monday. Within the eastern trough,
some models continue to show an upper low closing off and taking a
path somewhere within an area from the Great Lakes/southern Canada
into New England, supporting at least moderately strong southern
Canada into Northeast U.S. low pressure, which could undergo some
redevelopment during the overall system's life span. This storm
remains a prominent weather focus due to its timing right before
Thanksgiving but it will likely still take a while to resolve the
details. Meanwhile the models and ensembles still have an upper
low developing southwest/south of California during the weekend
and early next week. This feature should open up by Wednesday as a
Pacific shortwave reaches the West by Tuesday and additional
energy could arrive thereafter. Northern Plains into western U.S.
troughing should amplify at least a little around midweek as
another upper ridge builds over the Eastern Pacific. Eastern North
America low pressure and its trailing front will usher in a brief
cold spell over the East during the first half of next week while
the West and parts of the High Plains will see variable but
generally above normal temperatures through Tuesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00/06Z model cycle continued to show fairly good clustering in
the eastern North America evolution considering typical guidance
spread and error for forecasts at this lead time. One remaining
issue is the possibility and positioning of a 500 mb low that
could close off within the trough. After deep closed lows in
previous runs, the 00Z ECMWF showed narrow and open but still deep
troughing, while the new 12Z run has a closed low again.
Meanwhile, the new 12Z GFS shows an open trough in the East
Tuesday after 00Z and 06Z runs were closed. Ensemble means
generally show narrow and deep troughing that may imply a closed
low. The detail issues in the troughing could affect surface low
positions and strength as well. Regardless, low pressure is
forecast to track between the Great Lakes and James Bay as of
early Monday and could see redevelopment and/or looping through
Tuesday-Wednesday. A minor change from the previous forecast was
to move the trailing cold front faster based on consensus. It is
important to note that the upper dynamics supporting this system
are still within flow to the north/west of an upper low over
Alaska and historically the models can have difficulty in
resolving important details of amplifying shortwaves from higher
latitudes until much closer to an event. A blend of the
deterministic guidance used at the beginning of the medium range
period transitioned to an approximately even blend of the
GFS/ECMWF/GEFS mean/EC mean by the latter part of the period.

Farther west, GFS/ECMWF/UKMET along with the GEFS/ECMWF means are
still providing the most common solution for the upper low that
forms west/south of California, with some opening/progression
likely to occur after early Tuesday. CMC runs have been on the
eastern side of the guidance spread, though the 12Z CMC has
shifted west closer to consensus. A model/mean blend excluding the
00Z CMC worked well for this feature as well as the shortwave
reaching the Northwest and then the Plains Tuesday-Wednesday and
for downplaying uncertain shortwave details upstream.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The start of the weekend should be dry over much of the country
aside from rainfall persisting along the eastern Florida Peninsula
and some light snow over parts of the northern/central Rockies.
Expect precipitation to develop along and east of the Mississippi
Valley on Sunday ahead of a leading Plains front and trailing
strong cold front (anchored by northern tier U.S./southern Canada
low pressure) that catches up. Most rain should be light to
moderate given the frontal progression but locally more intense
activity may be possible. Highest totals for Sunday-Sunday night
should be in the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. From Monday onward the
most likely evolution of this system would bring more of an
enhanced rainfall threat to New England, ahead of the cold
front/secondary low development. The best snow potential would be
in the cold air behind the system, to the lee of the Great Lakes
and along westward-facing terrain from the central Appalachians
northeastward. There is still enough uncertainty in system
evolution to allow for other possibilities regarding precipitation
types and amounts. Confidence is somewhat higher in the potential
for a period of brisk to strong winds behind the cold front
sweeping through the Plains into the East, with such winds
continuing over the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast into at
least Tuesday after strong initial southerly winds on Monday. The
Pacific Northwest into northern Rockies may see mostly light
precipitation during the first half of next week with a shortwave
arriving from the Pacific. The combination of this energy aloft
and the opening/progression of the upper low southwest of
California may spread some moisture into parts of the West by
Tuesday/Wednesday, but with low confidence for precipitation
coverage/amounts at this time.

The East will see chilly temperatures (mostly 5-10F below normal)
lingering into the early weekend. The next surge of colder air
will spread across the eastern half of the lower 48 Monday-Tuesday
with the broadest coverage of highs 10-15F below normal expected
on Tuesday. Some locations may also see morning lows 10F or so
below normal. The West into the central/southern High Plains will
see mostly above normal temperatures through Tuesday with the
warmest anomalies of plus 10-15F for highs likely over the High
Plains on Saturday (lingering into Sunday near the Rio Grande) and
again on Tuesday. The upper trough over the West by Wednesday will
likely bring highs down to near or slightly below normal levels at
that time.

on Tuesday. Some locations may also see morning lows 10F or so
below normal. The West into the central/southern High Plains will
see mostly above normal temperatures through Tuesday with the
warmest anomalies of plus 10-15F for highs likely over the High
Plains on Saturday (lingering into Sunday near the Rio Grande) and
again on Tuesday. The upper trough over the West by Wednesday will
likely bring highs down to near or slightly below normal levels at
that time.

...Potential continues for a strong cold front and significant
storm to affect the East next week...

...Overview...

Latest model and ensemble guidance remains similar for the
evolving large scale pattern through Thanksgiving while displaying
typical spread and run-to-run variability for the details. A
Pacific upper ridge moving into the West/Plains during the first
part of the calendar week will support an amplifying eastern U.S.
trough whose axis should reach near the East Coast by early
Tuesday. It is still up for debate where one or more embedded lows
may close off over the Great Lakes or southern Canada early in the
week but there is a more common theme of an upper low over or just
offshore New England by Wednesday. Thereafter, how quickly the
upper low departs will depend on the strength and westward extent
of North Atlantic upper ridging. The evolution aloft and
potentially complex surface low pressure/frontal evolution may
bring a heavy rain threat to northern New England in the warm
sector and a period of well below normal temperatures, brisk to
strong winds, and lake effect/terrain enhanced snow behind the
strong cold front. Continue to monitor forecasts as details may
change. Farther west, the combination of a Pacific shortwave
reaching the West by Tuesday and an opening upper low initially
southwest of California should yield a positively tilted upper
trough aligned from the Northern Plains into northwestern Mexico
by Thanksgiving. These features and energy rounding the upstream
ridge may produce periods of precipitation over the Pacific
Northwest while rain may expand/intensify along and north of the
western Gulf Coast on Thanksgiving as Gulf moisture interacts with
a Plains front.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

For the evolution across eastern North America, over recent days
the ensemble means (and model runs closest to them in principle)
have provided a fairly steady anchor for the general forecast with
fairly modest adjustments over consecutive runs. Latest GEFS/ECMWF
means have achieved similar solutions for the East Coast upper
trough by early Tuesday by way of the ECMWF mean nudging faster
and GEFS mean somewhat slower. Both the operational models and
means have recently shown a trend for a sharper/deeper trough in
response to a slower/stronger trough reaching the West and
stronger intervening ridge. Models have been waffling on if/where
an embedded upper low may form between Sunday and early Tuesday.
However there is a decent consensus that an upper low should reach
along or just offshore the Mid-Atlantic or New England coast by
later Tuesday or Wednesday. Thus far any stray southern solutions
for this upper low (some ECMWF runs, 18Z GFS) have reverted back
to the north toward the larger clustering in subsequent runs. A
building upper ridge over the North Atlantic and Greenland poses
the risk of slowing down the system for a period of time. Latest
GFS runs have started to show this and the new 00Z ECMWF has
trended much slower late in the period. At the surface, there is
reasonable continuity with low pressure consolidating over the
Upper Great Lakes/southeastern Canada Sunday-Monday. After that
the forecast gets more complicated as some models show a frontal
wave tracking northward over the western Atlantic while one or
more other waves evolve over or reach areas from over/east of New
England into the Canadian Maritimes, in response to the upper
dynamics. Enough upper ridging to the north could keep this system
near New England through or beyond midweek. Many of these details
have lower predictability several days out in time, especially
since the supporting energy is still over or near Alaska at this
time.

The 12Z/18Z GFS, 12Z ECMWF/CMC, and the ensemble means provided a
reasonable cluster of guidance for the upper trough reaching the
West by Tuesday (as mentioned, a little deeper/slower than seen
yesterday; UKMET runs have been slow) and the eastern Pacific
upper low opening up to the south, as well as for the overall
trough that continues eastward through the rest of the period.
However by Thanksgiving there is a fair degree of uncertainty over
how energy will be distributed within the trough. Also new 00Z
runs add other options, such as a stronger upstream shortwave
reaching the West in the GFS and much more flow separation in the
CMC.

Based on guidance comparisons through 12Z/18Z, the updated
forecast incorporated the 12Z/18Z GFS, 12Z ECMWF, and some 12Z CMC
for the first half of the period and then transition to a
model/ensemble mean blend. GFS input tilted more toward the 12Z
run once the 18Z version strayed south of consensus with the upper
low near the East Coast, while the 12Z GEFS mean provided a
slightly stronger solution than the 18Z run for the system near
New England.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Consolidating northern tier U.S./southern Canada low pressure will
bring a leading front and stronger trailing front into and through
the East early in the calendar week. Precipitation (mostly rain)
will develop along and east of the Mississippi Valley on Sunday.
Most rain should be light to moderate but locally more intense
activity may be possible over parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys.
As the front and possible waves head into New England, recent
trends have lowered precipitation totals somewhat over
western/southern areas but maintain the potential for some heavy
rainfall over Maine, aided by Atlantic inflow. Snow is still most
likely in the cold air behind the system, to the lee of the Great
Lakes and along westward-facing terrain from the central
Appalachians northeastward. There is still enough uncertainty in
system evolution to allow for other possibilities regarding
precipitation types and amounts. Meanwhile confidence is higher in
a period of brisk to strong winds from the Upper Midwest through
the East Sunday into Tuesday and then possibly lingering over the
Northeast thereafter. Across the northern tier the combination of
low temperatures and wind would produce cold wind chills.

The Pacific Northwest into northern Rockies should see mostly
light to perhaps locally moderate precipitation during the first
half of next week with a shortwave/cold front arriving from the
Pacific. The combination of this energy aloft and the
opening/progression of the upper low southwest of California may
spread some moisture into other parts of the West by
Tuesday/Wednesday, but still with modest confidence for
precipitation coverage/amounts. Around Thanksgiving the western
front may reach far enough into the Plains to begin interacting
with Gulf moisture to produce an expanding area of rain along and
north of the western Gulf Coast. Some of this rain may become
heavy.

The strong cold front crossing the East early in the week will
bring well below normal temperatures that should be most
pronounced between Monday and early Wednesday when there should be
decent coverage of highs/morning lows 10-15F below normal, with
some pockets of highs possibly 15-20F below normal over southern
areas. Temperatures may fall below freezing rather far into the
South. Readings should rebound toward normal by Thanksgiving.
Portions of the Rockies/Plains will see a brief warm period early
in the week with some plus 10-15F or so anomalies. A cold front
moving from the West into the Plains during Tuesday through
Thanksgiving will bring moderately below normal highs in its wake.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0112 AM CST Thu Nov 18 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper low/trough across southern Canada will shift east today as
a shortwave ridge over the western US weakens and the upper-level
flow pattern trends more zonal. Cooler and drier conditions behind
the recent cold front will continue, supporting brief localized fire
weather potential across much of the central/southern Rockies and
Plains.

...Central/Southern Rockies and High Plains...
Very dry surface conditions are forecast to develop across portions
of the central Rockies and High Plains within the post-frontal
airmass. While temperatures in many spots will remain below 50
degrees F, observed surface dewpoints already in the single digits
and below zero will support humidity values as low as 7-15% this
afternoon. Lingering flow aloft may also support some strong wind
gusts of 15-25 mph, especially closer to the higher terrain of
eastern WY and northern CO. While widespread fire weather conditions
are not anticipated due to cool temperatures and a lack of greater
background flow, locally elevated to near critical conditions may
develop near higher terrain where strong wind gusts and very low
humidity overlap with dry fuels.

Brief elevated fire weather conditions may also develop across
portions of the southern Plains and into central Texas, as gusty
winds develop through the day. Here, low humidity of 15-25% may
briefly overlap with surface winds of 10-20 mph. However, the short
duration and limited spatial extent suggests the overall fire
weather threat will remain low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0116 AM CST Thu Nov 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow over the western US will continue through Day2/Fri as a
weak shortwave trough approaches the central Rockies. Lift from the
approaching trough will aid in the development of a lee low across
eastern CO, enhancing southerly low-level winds across portions of
the southern High Plains. Surface high pressure over the Plains will
move east as cool and dry surface conditions linger across much of
the central US.

...Southern High Plains...
As the area of high pressure over the southern Plains shifts east
through the day, low-level pressure gradients will strengthen in
response to a lee low developing across eastern CO. Southerly
surface winds of 15-25 mph appear likely by mid afternoon from the
panhandles into southern CO and western KS. The gusty winds will
overlap with a warming and drying air mass with forecast relative
humidity values of 15-25%. While confidence in the surface humidity
values is low, regional fuels have continued to dry over the last
several days, suggesting elevated fire weather conditions may
develop across portions of the southern High Plains through the
afternoon.

...Another around of moderate to heavy rain and strong winds will
move into Pacific Northwest tonight; high elevation snow farther
inland on Friday into the weekend...

...Wintry precipitation this morning and again Friday morning over
interior New England; lake-effect snow will develop downwind from
the Great Lakes into Friday...

A low pressure system moving through the eastern Pacific will
bring the next round of active weather into the Pacific Northwest
tonight.  Moderate to heavy rain ahead of this system can be
expected to overspread the Washington/Oregon coasts together with
increasing winds tonight into Friday morning.  Unlike its recent
predecessor, this storm is forecast to quickly weaken as it moves
farther inland on Friday, bringing modest amounts of mountain
snows the Intermountain region and into parts of the northern
Rockies later on Friday and into the weekend.

Meanwhile, a cold front extending from a low pressure system in
eastern Canada will move through the eastern U.S. and then off the
Eastern Seaboard by Friday morning.  This will bring an axis of
rain and some thunderstorms through much of the area today and
into tonight.  Behind the boundary, lake-effect snow will begin to
develop today from west to east across the Great Lakes region
today along with blustery winds.  Over northern New England, some
wintry precipitation ahead of a warm front will change over to
rain showers during the day as the warm air arrives.  However, the
cold front will then quickly move through the area tonight.
Interior New England may see the rain ending as wet snow behind
the front later tonight into Friday morning along with blustery
winds and colder temperatures.

Elsewhere, tropical moisture from the western Caribbean Sea is
being lifted north toward Florida ahead of a weak upper-level
trough moving across the Gulf of
Mexico.  Some enhanced rainfall can be expected to move across
southern
Florida today.  By Friday morning, much of the rain should be
on its way eastward into the Atlantic as a cold front dips into
northern
Florida.  This front will keep a good chance of showers and
thunderstorms into the weekend for the east coast of southern
Florida.

ending as wet snow in the higher elevations behind the front later
tonight along with blustery winds and colder temperatures.
Meanwhile, nice fall weather along the East Coast with much above
normal temperatures today will be replaced by a large dome of cold
air coming through the mid-section of the country on Friday.
Meanwhile, milder than normal conditions will return to the High
Plains on Friday as a new low pressure system attempts to develop
in a relatively dry environment.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1046 AM CST Thu Dec 02 2021

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments
were made with this outlook. The Elevated area across portions of
central Montana was expanded slightly westward. The latest surface
observations depict isolated wind gusts of 45-55 mph along the lee
of the higher terrain, where ongoing fires are noted. While
widespread cloud coverage will limit any substantial RH reductions
across the area today, the strong/gusty downslope winds combined
with ongoing drought conditions are resulting in a continued
enhanced wildfire-spread threat. Surface winds should gradually
subside across central Montana going into Day 2/Friday, generally
limiting the fire-weather threat compared to previous days.

For details on the fire-weather threats across portions of the
Mid-Atlantic and southern High Plains, please see the previous
forecast discussion below.

..Weinman/Bentley.. 12/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1248 AM CST Thu Dec 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery and analyses reveal strong zonal
flow across the northern CONUS within the apex of a broad
upper-level ridge. While flow aloft may weaken somewhat through the
day, winds within the boundary layer will remain strong enough to
support a fire weather threat for the northern Rockies. To the east,
an upper-level trough with an attendant surface low will induce
breezy pressure-gradient winds that may result in localized fire
weather concerns for the Mid-Atlantic where fuels are dry.

...Montana...
Strong zonal flow within the lowest 1-2 km will continue to support
gusty winds across central MT for today. Sustained winds between
20-30 mph with frequent gusts above 40 mph (isolated gusts between
50-60 mph) appear likely in the lee of the terrain. RH reductions
are expected to be modest due to cloud cover and weak cold advection
late this afternoon. However, dry fuels coupled with the strong
winds have carried active fires over the past 24 hours despite some
RH recovery. This trend should continue to support a wildfire threat
for today. A Critical risk may be introduced in subsequent updates
if RH observations trend drier than currently anticipated.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A surface low over southeast Canada will continue to shift
east/northeast through the day. This will maintain breezy
pressure-gradient winds near 15 mph across the Mid-Atlantic.
Afternoon RH may fall into the 40-50% range from SC northward into
western MD, which could result in localized fire weather concerns
where 15 mph winds and reduced RH can overlap. The probability for a
substantial fire weather threat will reside in the immediate lee of
the Blue Ridge Mountains where downslope effects may support
windier/drier conditions. In general, the overall threat appears too
marginal for highlights at this time, though trends will be
monitored for subsequent updates.

...Southern High Plains...
Antecedent dry conditions are noted across the southern High Plains
where ERC values are above seasonal normal and overnight RH
recoveries have been poor (in the 20-40% range). While this region
is on the periphery of stronger flow aloft, the deepening of a lee
trough over the central High Plains will support westerly downslope
winds across parts of central/eastern NM. Winds may reach near 15-20
mph in the lee of terrain features as RH values fall into the teens.
As such, localized elevated fire weather conditions are possible.
However, confidence in the coverage and duration of such conditions
remains too low for highlights.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 PM EST Thu Dec 02 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Dec 05 2021 - 12Z Thu Dec 09 2021

...Overview...

Guidance shows the large scale upper pattern settling into a broad
mean trough across much of the lower 48, between a strong but
slowly flattening eastern Pacific ridge and another area of
ridging over the mid-latitude Atlantic through the Caribbean and
southern Gulf of Mexico.  This pattern will support a series of
surface systems and fronts that will bring areas of meaningful
rain/mountain snow mainly to northern and central parts of the
West and then precipitation to the eastern half of the country
with snow possible over some northern areas.  Although the
forecast mean pattern is agreeable, details of embedded individual
shortwaves become increasingly uncertain from Monday onward so
confidence in some of the important sensible weather specifics is
a lot lower.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Aside from the new 12Z UKMET that is slow with its upper trough,
guidance is slowly but steadily improving its clustering for the
strengthening system tracking from the northern Plains into
southeastern Canada along with the trailing front that crosses the
eastern half of the country during Sunday-Monday.  There is still
some disagreement over exact structure of the low at times with an
intermediate solution reasonable, but again minus the 12Z UKMET,
consensus is now good for timing of the trailing front.

Farther west, some aspects of the forecast appear to have become
more divergent over the past day.  Guidance continues to have
difficulty in resolving the character of shortwave energy expected
to be south of Alaska at the start of the period early Sunday, and
in addition possibly some energy from a separate feature to the
south, drop into the western U.S. over the following couple days.
Among incoming guidance the 12Z GFS was on the strong/southern
side of the spread with its concentrated upper dynamics and
associated surface low nearing the Northwest early Monday.
Interestingly the new ECMWF has adjusted a lot closer to the GFS
at the surface even though the ECMWF's upper shortwave is a lot
more open.  From there guidance differs over how much the energy
will amplify over the West, whether it may help to eject the upper
low over/near Baja California, and the ultimate amplitude and
timing downstream.  The guidance average is waffling somewhat for
how much western amplification will occur early in the week with
the 00Z/06Z consensus trending a bit deeper than previous
forecast.  12Z models are now increasing the potential for quicker
ejection of the Baja upper low.  Another bundle of North Pacific
energy flowing around the eastern Pacific upper ridge should reach
western North America around Wednesday with amplitude/timing
differences adding to the uncertainty.

Given the rapidly declining confidence in details with time, the
operational model consensus employed early in the period
transitioned to 60 percent total weight of the 18Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF
means by day 7 Thursday to emphasize the more agreeable mean
pattern.  Otherwise lingering input from latest ECMWF/GFS runs
provided a little enhancement where agreeable traits existed but
otherwise offset to keep the blend closer to the means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The strengthening storm system tracking from the northern Plains
through the Great Lakes and into southeastern Canada Sunday-Monday
should produce a band of meaningful snow to the north of the low
track--mainly over the extreme northern Plains into Upper Great
Lakes.  Also the storm will likely produce a period of strong
winds from the northern Plains into Great Lakes, and then after
passage, a period of lake effect snow.  There should be sufficient
moisture along the trailing cold front to produce some locally
moderate to heavy rainfall from the Ohio Valley southwestward.
Relatively dry conditions leading into this event should help to
temper what adverse effects could arise where rainfall happens to
be more intense.

While the details remain a question mark, the system pushing into
the Northwest by Monday and then dropping southeastward over the
West will produce an area of enhanced precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest through the northern and central Rockies.
Highest totals will be over favored windward terrain and the best
potential for heavy snow will be over the northern Cascades and
northern Rockies.  The precise southward extent of precipitation
over the West will depend on the uncertain amplitude and
progression of dynamics aloft.  Progression of this energy into
the East, possible wave development, and interaction of Gulf
moisture with a mean frontal boundary should lead to an increasing
area of precipitation over the eastern half of the country Tuesday
onward.  Some heavy rainfall will be possible, with details coming
into better focus when guidance eventually agrees better for
important shortwave specifics.  Some northern latitudes may see
snow with relatively higher probabilities from the Great Lakes
into New England.  Upstream Pacific energy should produce one or
more additional episodes of rain and higher elevation snow over
portions of the West from Tuesday onward.

Over a majority of the lower 48 the progressive nature of most
systems will promote variable temperatures from day to day and
likely average out to near or above normal.  The one exception
should be from the extreme northern Plains into Upper Great Lakes
where snow cover in the wake of the Sunday-Monday system may lead
to some readings 10-20F below normal early next week.  The
greatest anomalies on the warm side should be ahead of the
aforementioned system, with a fairly broad area of plus 10-20F
anomalies from the Plains into the East early in the period.  One
or more additional episodes of warmth may pass through the
Southwest into the southern Plains.  A few daily records for
highs/warm lows may be possible over the Southwest.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0119 PM CST Thu Dec 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

The forecast remains on track, and no changes have been made to the
outlook. The primary fire-weather concern continues to be over
portions of the southern High Plains during the afternoon hours.
Here, high-resolution model guidance continues to depict sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds near 20 mph coincident with 15-20
percent RH for a few hours.

For additional details on the High Plains fire-weather threat and
Mid-Atlantic fire-weather concerns, please see the previous
discussion below.

..Weinman/Bentley.. 12/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CST Thu Dec 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will continue to dominate the western two-thirds
of the CONUS into the D2/Friday period. With generally weak flow
aloft, the potential for widespread/robust fire weather concerns
will be low. However, a regional fire weather threat is probable
across the southern High Plains as west winds increase ahead of a
cold front.

...Southern High Plains...
Despite modest winds above the surface, west to southwesterly
surface winds are forecast to increase to 15-20 mph in the vicinity
of a weak surface low over the TX Panhandle/Western OK. Trajectories
off the southern Rockies will favor downslope warming/drying with RH
values in the teens to low 20s likely. Given antecedent dry fuels
across the region (ERC values above seasonal normal), these
dry/windy conditions should support at least a few hours of elevated
conditions. The southward progression of a cold front during the
afternoon casts some uncertainty into the duration and coverage of
the fire weather threat, but this synoptic pattern typically
produces at least low-end fire weather concerns for this region.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A dry post-frontal air mass will remain in place across the region
with afternoon RH values in the 25-45% range possible. This may pose
a low-end fire weather concern given dry fuels, but winds will
generally be too weak (below 15 mph for most locations) to support a
more robust fire weather threat.

FOR FRIDAY DECEMBER 10 - THURSDAY DECEMBER 16: Amplified ridging (troughing=
)
over the western Aleutians (Mainland Alaska) is likely to persist and maint=
ain
a cold pattern throughout Alaska. Probabilities for minimum temperatures
falling into the lowest 15th percentile of the climatological distribution
across southwest Mainland Alaska have increased to more than 40 percent in
today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs GEFS probabilistic tool, prompting the in=
clusion of a moderate risk
of
much below normal temperatures from Dec 10 to 13. Within the moderate risk
area, daily minimum temperatures are expected to range from -20 to -40 degr=
ees
F. The GEFS probabilistic tool depicts the anomalous cold peaking early in
week-2 when there is more than a 20 percent chance of minimum temperatures
falling below the 5th percentile of the climatological distribution for tha=
t
time of year. Since there is no apparent longwave pattern change forecast o=
ver
the North Pacific, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is poste=
d
for much of Mainland Alaska along with the Aleutians and Alaska Panhandle f=
or
the entirety of week-2.



Model solutions are in good agreement and remain consistent that a 500-hPa
trough expands south into the western CONUS by the beginning of week-2.
Meanwhile, a 500-hPa ridge is likely to amplify over the northern Pacific a=
nd
Aleutians during early to mid-December. This longwave pattern over the
northern
Pacific and western North America is forecast to become well-established an=
d
remain fairly stable through week-2. Based on the GEFS probabilistic tool (=
20
to 30 percent chance of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th
percentile and near 1 inch or more, liquid equivalent), a slight risk of he=
avy
snow is posted for the Cascades and parts of the northern Rockies from Dec
10-16. This heavy snow hazard is also supported by recent deterministic GFS
model runs. Periods of heavy snow (12 inches or more per 24 hours) are
expected
for these areas throughout week-2. Moderate to heavy snow may extend as far
south as the Great Basin and Four Corners region early in week-2, but a lac=
k
of
model agreement, poor consistency, and uncertainty on snow levels preclude =
a
heavy snow hazard farther to the south. The uncalibrated ECMWF model output
along with the increased potential for an atmospheric river supports a slig=
ht
risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Pacific Northwest and north=
ern
California from Dec 10-16.



Following a wet November when precipitation averaged 150 to 200 percent of
normal, many river levels across northwest Washington are running above the
95th percentile. Due to the ongoing antecedent wetness and heavy rainfall (=
3
to
5 inches, locally more) forecast during the next week, a flooding possible
hazard is posted for northwest Washington. This flooding risk may persist
throughout week-2, since above normal precipitation is favored to continue.



As the 500-hPa trough extends southward from the higher latitudes of wester=
n
North America, a much colder pattern is likely for the northwestern CONUS b=
y
mid-December. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for
areas of that region where the GEFS reforecast tool depicts minimum
temperatures having at least a 20 percent chance of minimum temperatures
falling into the lowest 15th percentile. This slight risk area includes
Portland and Seattle where chances for subfreezing temperatures are elevate=
d.
This evolving longwave pattern could eventually bring a risk of winter weat=
her
hazards including snow and freezing rain to the lower elevations of the
Pacific
Northwest.



A couple of low pressure systems along a nearly stationary front may bring
periods of heavy rain to the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, beginning late in
week-1 and continuing through early week-2. A slight risk of heavy rain (mo=
re

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu December 02 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 08 - 12 2021

Today's model solutions are in fairly good agreement on the predicted 500-h=
Pa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. In the mean mid-level height field, ridging is forecast ov=
er
the Aleutians, leading to anticipated troughing downstream across Mainland
Alaska and the Panhandle. Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are likely o=
ver
much of the eastern CONUS, while mean troughing with below normal 500-hPa
heights is predicted over most of the western and central CONUS. Due to rec=
ent
model performance, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa height =
blend forecast gives equal
weight to the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means and less weight to the Canadian
ensemble mean.

Troughing over the western CONUS leads to increased chances of below normal
temperatures over the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Great Basin, and the
Northern Rockies. Ridging with near to above normal 500-hPa heights during =
the
period favors above normal temperatures over much of the eastern and southe=
rn
CONUS. Troughing forecast over much of Alaska leads to increased chances of
below normal temperatures across most of the state, consistent with the Aut=
o
Blend and consolidation temperature forecast tools.

The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of above normal
precipitation over the western CONUS. Near to above normal precipitation is
also favored over most of the eastern CONUS, ahead of mean troughing predic=
ted
over the central CONUS. Near to below normal precipitation is favored acros=
s
parts of the Southern Plains and the Florida Peninsula, consistent with the
operational Auto Blend and consolidation precipitation forecast tools.
Troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased chances of abo=
ve
normal precipitation across most of Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
fairly good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutio=
ns.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 10 - 16 2021

In the week-2 period, strong ridging and associated positive 500-hPa height
anomalies continue to be forecast near the Aleutians. Troughing over easter=
n
Alaska is likely to persist into week-2 and extend southward to the western
CONUS. Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over most of the
southern and eastern CONUS.

Increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast in week-2 for
nearly all of Alaska and the West Coast of the CONUS as well as parts of th=
e
Northern Rockies underneath predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa
heights. Forecast near to above normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased
chances of above normal temperatures across most of the remainder of the
CONUS.
This is also consistent with the consolidation temperature forecast tool.

Above normal precipitation is favored across most of the western CONUS, due=
 to
troughing and enhanced Pacific flow predicted across the West Coast. Near t=
o
below normal precipitation is favored over parts of the Great Plains region
and
the southern East Coast due to the forecast above normal heights. Above nor=
mal
precipitation is favored over parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley,
Tennessee
Valley, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes due to predicted mean cyclonic flow an=
d
associated forecast frontal passages. Probabilities of near to above normal
precipitation are slightly elevated for central and northern Mainland Alask=
a.
Near to below normal precipitation is favored for most of the southern thir=

of
Alaska, supported by the operational Auto Blend and consolidation
precipitation
forecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's GFS

...Widespread record breaking warmth likely throughout the central
United States today...

...Gusty winds and fire weather concerns located over the northern
High Plains...

...Winter weather possible beginning Saturday over the Northern
Tier...

A relatively tranquil weather pattern is expected to remain over
the Lower 48 through the end of the work week, with dominant high
pressure located across the southern half of the U.S. and a
powerful jet stream remaining over the Northern Tier. As a result,
well above average temperatures are forecast for nearly the entire
country over the next few days. The warmest weather will occur
today as highs soar into the 60s and 70s from the Great Plains to
the Mid-Atlantic, which equates to around 20-30F above normal for
early December. Current observations indicate dozens of locations
are nearing their daily record high temperature reading from the
Rockies to east of the Appalachians. Looking ahead to the weekend,
highs are forecast to remain above normal on Friday, and some
areas in the Southeast may threaten their daily high record again.
However, temperatures should begin to cool slightly as a cold
front enters the midsection of the Nation. The combination of
these warm and dry conditions, along with gusty winds could lead
to an Elevated Risk of fire weather, per the Storm Prediction
Center. Additionally, High Wind Warnings extend along the Rocky
Mountain Front this afternoon for wind gusts around 65 mph.

Little precipitation is forecast across the U.S. through the
beginning of the weekend. A majority of the precipitation activity
should likely remain confined occur to the Northeast and Great
Lakes as a potent low pressure system swings through southeast
Canada. This system and associated cold front will aid in
producing showers across the Northeast today. Meanwhile, with
arctic air surging behind the cold front, lake effect snow is
likely to begin overnight into Friday morning across the typical
snowbelts of Upstate New York. Light snow is also possible for
upslope regions in far northern New England. Afterwards, the next
area of focused precipitation will emerge over the High Plains on
Saturday as a lee-side cyclone develops, bringing accumulating
snows chances to the Northern Tier. The latest WPC Winter Storm
Severity Index highlights moderate potential winter storm impacts
with this activity beginning Saturday, so stay tuned for updates
to the forecast going forward. Over the Southern Plains, a dryline
interacting with a slow moving cold front will produce
thunderstorms capable of producing moderate to locally heavy
rainfall on Saturday, although widespread excessive rainfall is
not anticipated.

558 PM EST Thu Dec 02 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Dec 05 2021 - 12Z Thu Dec 09 2021

...Overview...

Guidance shows the large scale upper pattern settling into a broad
mean trough across much of the lower 48, between a strong but
slowly flattening eastern Pacific ridge and another area of
ridging over the mid-latitude Atlantic through the Caribbean and
southern Gulf of Mexico.  This pattern will support a series of
surface systems and fronts that will bring areas of meaningful
rain/mountain snow mainly to northern and central parts of the
West and then precipitation to the eastern half of the country
with snow possible over some northern areas.  Although the
forecast mean pattern is agreeable, details of embedded individual
shortwaves become increasingly uncertain from Monday onward so
confidence in some of the important sensible weather specifics is
a lot lower.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Aside from the new 12Z UKMET that is slow with its upper trough,
guidance is slowly but steadily improving its clustering for the
strengthening system tracking from the northern Plains into
southeastern Canada along with the trailing front that crosses the
eastern half of the country during Sunday-Monday.  There is still
some disagreement over exact structure of the low at times with an
intermediate solution reasonable, but again minus the 12Z UKMET,
consensus is now good for timing of the trailing front.

Farther west, some aspects of the forecast appear to have become
more divergent over the past day.  Guidance continues to have
difficulty in resolving the character of shortwave energy expected
to be south of Alaska at the start of the period early Sunday, and
in addition possibly some energy from a separate feature to the
south, drop into the western U.S. over the following couple days.
Among incoming guidance the 12Z GFS was on the strong/southern
side of the spread with its concentrated upper dynamics and
associated surface low nearing the Northwest early Monday.
Interestingly the new ECMWF has adjusted a lot closer to the GFS
at the surface even though the ECMWF's upper shortwave is a lot
more open.  From there guidance differs over how much the energy
will amplify over the West, whether it may help to eject the upper
low over/near Baja California, and the ultimate amplitude and
timing downstream.  The guidance average is waffling somewhat for
how much western amplification will occur early in the week with
the 00Z/06Z consensus trending a bit deeper than previous
forecast.  12Z models are now increasing the potential for quicker
ejection of the Baja upper low.  Another bundle of North Pacific
energy flowing around the eastern Pacific upper ridge should reach
western North America around Wednesday with amplitude/timing
differences adding to the uncertainty.

Given the rapidly declining confidence in details with time, the
operational model consensus employed early in the period
transitioned to 60 percent total weight of the 18Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF
means by day 7 Thursday to emphasize the more agreeable mean
pattern.  Otherwise lingering input from latest ECMWF/GFS runs
provided a little enhancement where agreeable traits existed but
otherwise offset to keep the blend closer to the means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The strengthening storm system tracking from the northern Plains
through the Great Lakes and into southeastern Canada Sunday-Monday
should produce a band of meaningful snow to the north of the low
track--mainly over the extreme northern Plains into Upper Great
Lakes.  Also the storm will likely produce a period of strong
winds from the northern Plains into Great Lakes, and then after
passage, a period of lake effect snow.  There should be sufficient
moisture along the trailing cold front to produce some locally
moderate to heavy rainfall from the Ohio Valley southwestward.
Relatively dry conditions leading into this event should help to
temper what adverse effects could arise where rainfall happens to
be more intense.

While the details remain a question mark, the system pushing into
the Northwest by Monday and then dropping southeastward over the
West will produce an area of enhanced precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest through the northern and central Rockies.
Highest totals will be over favored windward terrain and the best
potential for heavy snow will be over the northern Cascades and
northern Rockies.  The precise southward extent of precipitation
over the West will depend on the uncertain amplitude and
progression of dynamics aloft.  Progression of this energy into
the East, possible wave development, and interaction of Gulf
moisture with a mean frontal boundary should lead to an increasing
area of precipitation over the eastern half of the country Tuesday
onward.  Some heavy rainfall will be possible, with details coming
into better focus when guidance eventually agrees better for
important shortwave specifics.  Some northern latitudes may see
snow with relatively higher probabilities from the Great Lakes
into New England.  Upstream Pacific energy should produce one or
more additional episodes of rain and higher elevation snow over
portions of the West from Tuesday onward.

Over a majority of the lower 48 the progressive nature of most
systems will promote variable temperatures from day to day and
likely average out to near or above normal.  The one exception
should be from the extreme northern Plains into Upper Great Lakes
where snow cover in the wake of the Sunday-Monday system may lead
to some readings 10-20F below normal early next week.  The
greatest anomalies on the warm side should be ahead of the
aforementioned system, with a fairly broad area of plus 10-20F
anomalies from the Plains into the East early in the period.  One
or more additional episodes of warmth may pass through the
Southwest into the southern Plains.  A few daily records for
highs/warm lows may be possible over the Southwest.

otherwise offset to keep the blend closer to the means.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The strengthening storm system tracking from the northern Plains
through the Great Lakes and into southeastern Canada Sunday-Monday
should produce a band of meaningful snow to the north of the low
track--mainly over the extreme northern Plains into Upper Great
Lakes.  Also the storm will likely produce a period of strong
winds from the northern Plains into Great Lakes, and then after
passage, a period of lake effect snow.  There should be sufficient
moisture along the trailing cold front to produce some locally
moderate to heavy rainfall from the Ohio Valley southwestward.
Relatively dry conditions leading into this event should help to
temper what adverse effects could arise where rainfall happens to
be more intense.

While the details remain a question mark, the system pushing into
the Northwest by Monday and then dropping southeastward over the
West will produce an area of enhanced precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest through the northern and central Rockies.
Highest totals will be over favored windward terrain and the best
potential for heavy snow will be over the northern Cascades and
northern Rockies.  The precise southward extent of precipitation
over the West will depend on the uncertain amplitude and
progression of dynamics aloft.  Progression of this energy into
the East, possible wave development, and interaction of Gulf
moisture with a mean frontal boundary should lead to an increasing
area of precipitation over the eastern half of the country Tuesday
onward.  Some heavy rainfall will be possible, with details coming
into better focus when guidance eventually agrees better for
important shortwave specifics.  Some northern latitudes may see
snow with relatively higher probabilities from the Great Lakes
into New England.  Upstream Pacific energy should produce one or
more additional episodes of rain and higher elevation snow over
portions of the West from Tuesday onward.

Over a majority of the lower 48 the progressive nature of most
systems will promote variable temperatures from day to day and
likely average out to near or above normal.  The one exception
should be from the extreme northern Plains into Upper Great Lakes
where snow cover in the wake of the Sunday-Monday system may lead
to some readings 10-20F below normal early next week.  The
greatest anomalies on the warm side should be ahead of the
aforementioned system, with a fairly broad area of plus 10-20F
anomalies from the Plains into the East early in the period.  One
or more additional episodes of warmth may pass through the
Southwest into the southern Plains.  A few daily records for
highs/warm lows may be possible over the Southwest.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1223 AM CST Fri Dec 03 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
The strongest winds aloft will remain across the Canadian border
today. A weak shortwave trough will impact parts of West Texas into
the ArkLaTex region through the day. At the surface, a cold front
will make steady progress to the south before stalling in the
vicinity of the Red River.

...Texas South Plains...
Westerly winds are expected to increase ahead of the approaching
front. RH will most likely fall to near 20% with winds of 15-20 mph.
The duration of these conditions is in question, but some areas of
the South Plains could see 3-5 hours of elevated fire weather.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
213 AM EST Fri Dec 03 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Dec 06 2021 - 12Z Fri Dec 10 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period (Monday to Friday next week) will be
characterized by a broad mean trough across much of the lower 48,
with periods of shortwave energy moving through the trough pushing
low pressure/frontal systems across the country. Rounds of
precipitation are forecast for the West, while rain is likely to
spread into the southeastern quadrant of the country with perhaps
some snow in northern areas, but there is still a good bit of
uncertainty with specific weather impacts.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 12/18Z (yesterday) model cycle remains in fairly good
agreement with the large-scale pattern, while aspects of the
smaller-scale details remain quite variable. At the beginning of
the period Monday, these differences include a slower upper trough
over the Midwest in the 12Z UKMET compared to the slightly faster
consensus of other guidance, but other than the UKMET there was
reasonably agreeable timing with a Great Lakes surface low and the
timing of its trailing cold front, maybe just slightly faster than
the previous forecast. Another difference among guidance Monday
was that the GFS runs (and many GEFS ensemble members) continue to
be the strongest with a potent shortwave entering the Pacific
Northwest, which as it dives south into the Intermountain West by
Tuesday has implications for its speed and possible flow
separation. However, at the surface the low pressure system is
well clustered offshore of the Pacific Northwest on Monday.
Meanwhile, southern stream energy near Baja California Monday has
shown a faster trend moving eastward and getting absorbed by
Tuesday compared to slower previous guidance, which is reflected
in the WPC forecast.

By Wednesday, recent guidance generally shows a hint of a positive
tilt to the mean trough, with the exception of the 12Z CMC with
its different phasing of shortwave energy that is not reflected in
its new 00Z run either, so leaned away from that solution. A
notable model difference by Thursday-Friday is the degree to which
energy drops southward through the West as well as its timing. The
GFS and CMC runs show stronger energy creating a deeper Western
trough compared to the ECMWF, which shows a couple rounds of
weaker shortwave energy passing through the mean trough.
Confidence is low with this, given uncertainty with the shortwave
energy stemming from high latitudes, and spaghetti plots of 500 mb
heights show the operational GFS and CMC are within in the
guidance envelope but are on the stronger end of solutions with
troughing in the West. Then in the East, there is uncertainty with
a surface low spinning up along the coastal Northeast late
Wednesday into Thursday, with no good consensus position yet, and
this will have implications for precipitation along the Eastern
Seaboard.

Thus the WPC forecast began the period using a blend of the
12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF and CMC, phasing out the CMC from
midweek onward and increasing proportions of the agreeable GEFS
and EC ensemble means (to 60% by Day 7/Friday). This served to
keep proper magnitude of features when there is good model
consensus, and lessened the emphasis on individual models by the
latter part of the period as uncertainty increases.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As a relatively strong surface low pressure system is positioned
across the Great Lakes early Monday, snow is expected there while
strong winds are possible in the tight pressure gradient behind
the low. Conditions will be favorable for lake effect snow behind
the system through Tuesday. Additionally, rain is forecast along
the trailing cold front associated with the low for the Ohio
Valley to south-central U.S., but amounts are likely to be
tapering down by Monday. However, Gulf moisture should increase
again by Tuesday into Wednesday and cause moderate to possibly
locally heavy rainfall from the Lower Mississippi Valley into the
Tennessee Valley and Southeast. Moisture spreading farther north
into cooler air could lead to snow across the northern latitudes,
with relatively higher probabilities from the Great Lakes into
northern New England.

A couple of shortwaves moving across the West will cause
increasing precipitation chances there, with favored windward
terrain seeing the highest amounts. The Pacific Northwest into
much of the Intermountain West and Rockies should see
precipitation Monday and clearing out by Tuesday while chances
ramp up in the Southwest. Then the next round is likely for the
Northwest on Wednesday and spreads into California eastward by
Thursday as energy aloft drops southward. Generally higher
elevation snow and lower elevation rain is forecast, though
varying throughout the precipitation events and perhaps relatively
low snow levels on average given periods of below normal heights
aloft.

Chilly temperatures are likely across the far north-central U.S.
on Monday and Tuesday given snow cover from Sunday's system, with
temperatures 10-20F below normal. Meanwhile the Eastern Seaboard
can expect temperatures about 10-20F above normal on Monday ahead
of a cold front bringing temperatures near average by Tuesday.
Overall temperatures should be within about 10 degrees of normal
in most places Tuesday and Wednesday, before a warmup by Thursday
and Friday from the Plains eastward, with 10-15F above average
temperatures. A cooldown is possible in the Northwest by the
latter part of the week with the potential for troughing aloft
there.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0115 AM CST Fri Dec 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong northern jet stream will begin to amplify on Sunday. A
shortwave trough will develop and dig southward through the Northern
Rockies. At the surface, a cyclone will deepen in the lee of the
higher terrain of eastern Montana and eastern Wyoming. Within the
Great Basin, higher surface pressure is expected to develop along
with stronger northerly winds aloft on the western flank of the
digging trough.

...Eastern Wyoming...
Temperatures in the surrounding region may be slightly cooler owing
the recent cold front. However, strong downslope winds will help to
warm and dry the airmass in the immediate lee of the Big Horns and
the Laramie Range. With fuels remaining dry, locally elevated
conditions are probable. Confidence in winds of 15-25 mph is
relatively high. Confidence in broadly low RH is not as high. With
conditions so spatially limited, no highlights will be added.

...Southern California...
Locally elevated conditions are possible in the higher terrain
towards late Sunday and early Monday. Terrain-favored areas could
see 15-25 mph with RH of 15-20%. Upper-level winds will favor
stronger gusts. Recent model guidance has shows an overall
decreasing trend in the offshore pressure gradient strength.
Sustained elevated fire weather conditions still appear too
localized to warrant highlights.
